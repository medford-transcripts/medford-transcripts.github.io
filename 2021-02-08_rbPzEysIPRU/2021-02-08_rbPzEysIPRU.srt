[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, member McLaughlin.

67
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:38,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was a, I think it was on page, let me see.

68
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:58,768
[SPEAKER_09]: It was around the discussion, I'm sorry, it was around the discussion of whether we actually got notification from the district about our students testing, whether they had tested or not, because we received their,

69
00:55:01,387 --> 00:55:13,211
[SPEAKER_09]: and there was just some comments that I thought were missing there, which essentially, Toni Wray said yes, that we do receive that information, and that does act as a notification, unless I misunderstood.

70
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:17,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we'll just have that added to the minutes under that section.

00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,581

[SPEAKER_08]: Number one is good of the order.

102
00:56:25,222 --> 00:56:26,082
[SPEAKER_09]: That's me again, ma'am.

103
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

104
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:54,942
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a request that we have for the first of the month as part of Robert's rules, best practice, just a good of the order, check in with the school committee members to essentially ask how they feel we're functioning as a team, if there's anything that they wanna bring forward or any concerns that anyone has or any positive things they wanna say about how we're functioning, but it's basically a self-assessment

105
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:56,764
[SPEAKER_09]: The first of the month.

106
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:03,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Miss Mayor member cuts has her hand raised.

107
00:57:03,863 --> 00:57:04,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, member credits.

108
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to share that what I've noticed over the last several subcommittee meetings is keeping to the timeframe that's on the agenda.

109
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:22,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to applaud school committee members, fellow school committee members for adhering to their schedule.

110
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:25,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to try to make my meeting on time.

111
00:57:25,334 --> 00:57:27,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I went like a couple of minutes over on my meeting.

112
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:31,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something, cause we do value everybody's time.

113
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:34,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to congratulate all of you for doing a good job at that.

114
00:57:37,063 --> 00:57:38,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank mayor.

115
00:57:38,344 --> 00:57:38,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor.

116
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:42,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, member of Goffman.

117
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:43,147
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

118
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:43,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

119
00:57:43,847 --> 00:57:44,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Member cuts.

120
00:57:45,148 --> 00:57:46,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I appreciate that.

121
00:57:46,689 --> 00:57:54,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and also, um, I wanted to add, um, I know that we were doing the superintendent's evaluation.

122
00:57:54,054 --> 00:58:04,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Um at the next meeting, and I would just ask that for the good of the order, it would be very helpful for school committee to have a self evaluation as well in a process for that.

123
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:23,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So I believe rules, policy and equity may have that as part of their function coming up or unless I'm mistaking, but I would like to put that forward to my colleagues as well, that we have a self-evaluation process for how we're doing and how we can improve and what our goals are for the year.

124
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:26,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, Member McLaughlin.

125
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:32,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Kreatz, was that just committee meetings or do I keep things timely as well?

126
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:34,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, no, no.

127
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

128
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:40,445
[SPEAKER_02]: All the meetings have been, you know, kept it like they haven't been going until the midnight hour.

129
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:41,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So I meant both.

130
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:42,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

131
00:58:42,547 --> 00:58:43,888
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just joking.

132
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:45,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like you're jinxing me tonight.

133
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna knock on wood right now.

134
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:48,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

135
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:53,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else have anything to point out for good of the order?

136
00:58:55,535 --> 00:59:04,061
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mayor, I guess I would ask that maybe, I don't know, do I need to put that in a motion for the good of the order, or can I put a motion out that, or we move that to subcommittee?

137
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:09,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm asking for advice from my colleagues regarding this matter.

138
00:59:09,745 --> 00:59:11,186
[SPEAKER_08]: The self-evaluation process?

139
00:59:11,446 --> 00:59:12,407
[SPEAKER_09]: For the school committee, yes.

140
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:16,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you could do, Member Graham?

141
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:26,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to remind everyone that before everything changed super dramatically, this was a committee of the whole that we had agreed to schedule.

142
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:43,264
[SPEAKER_11]: So we talked at the very beginning of last year about the importance of having goals that we want to work toward as a committee and particularly around our procedures and how things are working.

143
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:44,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we've done some of those things

144
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:54,896
[SPEAKER_11]: sort of inherently as we've gone, like the scheduling of the subcommittees out for the year, I think was like a really important thing that we have done this year.

145
00:59:55,136 --> 01:00:03,660
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seemed maybe like too structured at the beginning, but I think it has actually worked well to keep all of the priorities of our committees on task.

146
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:11,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I would just say that I don't know that we need a motion because it was already on our like to be scheduled agenda.

147
01:00:11,614 --> 01:00:15,320
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we do need a motion, I'm happy to be a second.

148
01:00:17,308 --> 01:00:17,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

149
01:00:17,908 --> 01:00:20,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I just like to have some regular schedule.

150
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:43,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me just say, I make a motion that we have a self-evaluation process for the school committee where we set goals and we also offer a self-evaluation of our achievement of the goals on a annual basis, similar to the superintendent's self-evaluation and goals.

151
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:46,658
[SPEAKER_08]: And the motion is to do that in a committee of the whole meeting?

152
01:00:48,037 --> 01:00:48,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

153
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:52,379
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

195
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:12,794

[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

208

01:02:42,737 --> 01:02:47,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, we have communication strategy and stakeholder engagement, February 2nd, 2021.

212
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:49,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham, chair, approval of minutes.

213
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:58,293
[SPEAKER_11]: We met last week and we actually covered two topics because our January meeting was canceled.

214
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:02,137
[SPEAKER_11]: So we first covered the topic of the district-wide strategic plan.

215
01:03:02,298 --> 01:03:03,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you remember in

216
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:15,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Like early March of last year, the superintendent provided us a draft of the high level of the district-wide strategic plan that the administrators had been working on for some time.

217
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:31,885
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talked extensively in our meeting about how to pick up that work and how we wanted to see it proceed forward, particularly in light of the fact that there's so much going on across the district

218
01:03:32,745 --> 01:03:41,309
[SPEAKER_11]: and continues to be with the pandemic, but that this is important work and we didn't want it to delay unnecessarily.

219
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:45,431
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we really wanted, we sort of were all in agreement that we wanted to see this move forward.

220
01:03:45,491 --> 01:03:50,273
[SPEAKER_11]: So we hashed out sort of a rough timeline and schedule that I think is important for people to know.

221
01:03:50,293 --> 01:04:01,998
[SPEAKER_11]: At our March meeting, we will actually create a plan for a round table discussion and a survey to be executed in the month of April.

222
01:04:02,627 --> 01:04:11,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And that will be our opportunity to hear from the community about the substance and detail of our strategic plan.

223
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:15,308
[SPEAKER_11]: So at our scheduled subcommittee meeting in March,

224
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:20,491
[SPEAKER_11]: will hash through the plan for a roundtable and a resulting survey.

225
01:04:21,311 --> 01:04:23,293
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll execute both of those in April.

226
01:04:23,313 --> 01:04:36,866
[SPEAKER_11]: In May, that will be sort of the time where the administrators take all that feedback and revisit and revise based on really all the things that have changed across

227
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:39,629
[SPEAKER_11]: the original draft of the strategic plan.

228
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:57,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the sort of the final piece being in June, we would all meet to talk about if this is our strategic plan and this is our revised state, what does the timeline of various activities look like so that we can measure progress against that timeline?

229
01:04:57,363 --> 01:05:06,411
[SPEAKER_11]: So the schedule that we laid out will by June give us not just a strategic plan that consolidates

230
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:17,773
[SPEAKER_11]: all of the activity going on across the district, across a lot of different topics, but it will also have allowed us to collect community input, which we have not done so far as it relates to the strategic plan.

231
01:05:18,413 --> 01:05:29,698
[SPEAKER_11]: And it will also allow us to create a timeline of like the order of operation and importance of various activities because we can't

232
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:31,312
[SPEAKER_11]: do everything at once.

233
01:05:31,412 --> 01:05:34,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really will need to think about what comes first, second, and third.

234
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:37,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that timeline piece is sort of the final piece.

235
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:45,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would anticipate that we would potentially work on that together in a committee of the whole.

236
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:50,321
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think once we get through the first couple of steps, we can revisit that.

237
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:58,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the other topic that we covered in our meeting was really around middle school orientation practices in a similar vein to what we

238
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:01,742
[SPEAKER_11]: had discussed with kindergarten orientation.

239
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:26,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talked about sort of a rough timeline which included that the lottery process and work will begin soon now that the quarter two has ended and that the administration is targeting early March to kick off that lottery process for our fifth grade team so that students know

240
01:06:27,653 --> 01:06:31,537
[SPEAKER_11]: In March where where they will be going to middle school next year.

241
01:06:31,557 --> 01:06:38,203
[SPEAKER_11]: We did talk about, you know, the options and the things we we like to do and want to do around

242
01:06:38,943 --> 01:06:42,944
[SPEAKER_11]: the open houses and whether they can be held in person this year or not.

243
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:54,488
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about the really great community building that happened at the annual cookout that started and was delayed this year, unfortunately.

244
01:06:55,128 --> 01:07:02,270
[SPEAKER_11]: But we also talked about the info sessions that the superintendent has done these past few years that were really previously dedicated to

245
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:09,434
[SPEAKER_11]: the sort of, I'll say the mechanics of the lottery expanding to really talk about the transition to middle school in general.

246
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:21,863
[SPEAKER_11]: So much like our bridges to kindergarten, giving parents, particularly parents with new middle schoolers, a bridge to middle school.

247
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:30,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And our next scheduled meeting is on Monday, March 1st.

248
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:32,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

249

[SPEAKER_10]: She writes, I want to express that I see a full return to in-person school or failing that a fully in-person option for all students next year as vital.

299
01:09:56,768 --> 01:10:04,795
[SPEAKER_10]: As a parent and an economist, I've been following the research on the consequences of disrupted schooling for both children and parents, and I find them very concerning.

300
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:11,060
[SPEAKER_10]: While the evidence on the possibility of safe return to school from a public health perspective is quite promising.

301
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:20,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Columbus, where my son is in kindergarten and has done a terrific job under extremely tough circumstances, as has the district as a whole.

302
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,211
[SPEAKER_10]: The weekly COVID testing program is wonderful.

303
01:10:23,879 --> 01:10:30,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Nonetheless, hybrid rather than fully in-person school has been very challenging for our family.

304
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:36,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, teacher and student safety is paramount for the return to fully in-person school next fall.

305
01:10:36,907 --> 01:10:47,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I would appreciate guidance from the school district on what I and other parents can do now and going forward to help ensure the conditions are in place for a full return to in-person school in the fall.

306
01:10:48,613 --> 01:10:51,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that by furthering this conversation now, we can make sure

307
01:10:52,031 --> 01:10:56,673
[SPEAKER_10]: that there is time to get the necessary funding and resources in place for next fall.

308
01:10:58,374 --> 01:11:06,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, there are also many letters pertaining to the Columbus School discussion, which is later on in our agenda.

309
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:12,341
[SPEAKER_10]: So perhaps we should save them to that point.

310
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:17,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I do know we have CCSR students that I think have to leave at seven.

311
01:11:17,784 --> 01:11:20,245
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that might be best since it is an agenda item.

312
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:25,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should move through the reports of the superintendent fairly quickly.

313
01:11:26,757 --> 01:11:27,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member Van der Kloot.

314
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:36,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we discussed this return to school regarding that email at the last meeting when we talked about goals for the superintendent.

315
01:11:36,465 --> 01:11:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know as one parent and school committee member, I really hope we are fully back come September.

316
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:47,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Dr. Edouard-Vincent would like to respond as well.

317
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:51,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I definitely am a proponent.

318
01:11:52,299 --> 01:11:54,240
[SPEAKER_06]: The good news is that the vaccine is here.

319
01:11:55,101 --> 01:11:58,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Teachers will, we fall into phase two.

320
01:11:58,864 --> 01:12:02,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a matter of sometime between February and March.

321
01:12:03,107 --> 01:12:12,094
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our hope that we will be able to have everyone vaccinated as soon as the vaccines are available.

322
01:12:13,115 --> 01:12:22,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And for next school year, there will be a brief presentation a little later by Dr. Cushing and Ms.

323
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Galussi about listening sessions.

324
01:12:24,621 --> 01:12:28,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's part of the agenda for today, this evening as well.

325
01:12:28,663 --> 01:12:36,827
[SPEAKER_06]: But we will definitely be working collaboratively in support of getting all our kids back in school for next year.

326
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:38,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

327
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:39,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

328
01:12:41,575 --> 01:12:45,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up, we have report of superintendent, number one superintendent's updates and comments.

329
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edward-Vincent.

330
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:48,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

331
01:12:48,201 --> 01:12:49,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone.

332
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:58,671
[SPEAKER_06]: To open today's remarks, I just want to share that today was indeed a tough day for Mustang Nation.

333
01:12:59,932 --> 01:13:06,638
[SPEAKER_06]: As we said goodbye to our colleague, Mr. Frank D'Alessio, the computer technician for the school district.

334
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:15,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the arrival of COVID-19, we have had to adapt ourselves to new restrictions and safety protocols.

335
01:13:16,161 --> 01:13:20,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But the loss of life from this virus is still very hard to process.

336
01:13:21,703 --> 01:13:28,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Frank was a husband, father, and grandfather who loved annually to take his whole family to Disney World.

337
01:13:30,065 --> 01:13:35,047
[SPEAKER_06]: He would often pick up his granddaughters when they attended Kids' Corner at Medford High School.

338
01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:43,706
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a smile for everyone and always was at the ready when something with our computers or printers just didn't work.

339
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:47,947
[SPEAKER_06]: His loss has been felt throughout the entire district.

340
01:13:48,828 --> 01:13:54,971
[SPEAKER_06]: We extend our sincerest sympathies to his family and friends during this very difficult time.

341
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:04,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanna share that last week, we began a new form of COVID testing.

342
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pooled or group testing.

343
01:14:08,331 --> 01:14:14,796
[SPEAKER_06]: This testing has been made possible with a partnership between the city of Medford and Tufts University.

344
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:28,207
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have a few weeks back, we were recognized and spoke by DESE about this cutting edge public health measures that we are using to keep schools safe and students in school.

345
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:41,829
[SPEAKER_06]: By moving to pooled testing, it will ensure its sustainability as well as being more effective and efficient to identify and isolate cases of COVID and reduce transmission.

346
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:54,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Testing now takes place on Mondays and Thursdays for our students, and those with a positive pool will receive follow-up tests in school the following day.

347
01:14:54,819 --> 01:14:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to alert the entire community of that slight shift.

348
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:14,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow, February 9th, COVID-19 information will be provided to our multilingual families by Toni Wray, our director of health services and EL director, Paul Texara.

349
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:24,093
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be available to answer questions about COVID-19 in Medford and the new COVID pool testing in our schools.

350
01:15:24,674 --> 01:15:27,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It is tomorrow by Zoom at 6 p.m.

351
01:15:28,595 --> 01:15:29,395
[SPEAKER_06]: with Portuguese,

352
01:15:31,337 --> 01:15:35,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Haitian Creole translators on at 6 p.m.

353
01:15:36,558 --> 01:15:38,119
[SPEAKER_06]: and at 6 30 p.m.

354
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:46,181
[SPEAKER_06]: we will have Arabic and Spanish translators so again it's split into two sessions 6 p.m.

355
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:48,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Portuguese and Haitian Creole 6 30 p.m.

356
01:15:48,441 --> 01:15:48,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Arabic

357
01:15:51,653 --> 01:15:53,654
[SPEAKER_06]: and Spanish translation is available.

358
01:15:54,434 --> 01:15:59,336
[SPEAKER_06]: The Zoom link is available on our school blog and all principals have it as well.

359
01:15:59,716 --> 01:16:01,357
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope you will join that call.

360
01:16:03,657 --> 01:16:15,522
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned in my Friday message, that because meals have been free for all students this year, many families have not yet applied for free and reduced lunch.

361
01:16:16,715 --> 01:16:24,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Those who qualify for free and reduced lunch may also be eligible for the pandemic food assistance.

362
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: That's P-E-B-T.

363
01:16:28,683 --> 01:16:40,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that status, to get enrolled, all you need to do is complete the free and reduced lunch application and return the form to the school office.

364
01:16:41,873 --> 01:16:44,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Translated versions are available on our website

365
01:16:46,075 --> 01:16:49,756
[SPEAKER_06]: this program is open to both hybrid and remote families.

366
01:16:50,417 --> 01:16:55,959
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I wanna stress that because I know some families may think, well, my kids are not going to school.

367
01:16:56,459 --> 01:17:02,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not entitled, but you are entitled and I just do not want you to miss this opportunity.

368
01:17:02,562 --> 01:17:04,162
[SPEAKER_06]: So please take advantage of that.

369
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:13,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to mention that our YMCA's Mystic Community Market also has food items available to support the community.

370
01:17:14,405 --> 01:17:18,067
[SPEAKER_06]: The hours are Monday to Friday, 3.30 p.m.

371
01:17:18,187 --> 01:17:19,387
[SPEAKER_06]: to 7.30 p.m.

372
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:21,928
[SPEAKER_06]: and Saturdays from 9 a.m.

373
01:17:21,988 --> 01:17:22,689
[SPEAKER_06]: to 2 p.m.

374
01:17:23,549 --> 01:17:26,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Reservations for pickup are required.

375
01:17:28,971 --> 01:17:32,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to say that the Lunar New Year

376
01:17:33,993 --> 01:17:39,317
[SPEAKER_06]: the Chinese New Year or Spring Festival is going to be celebrated this coming Friday.

377
01:17:40,018 --> 01:17:49,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It has more than 4,000 years of history and it begins on February 12th and ends February 26th with the Lantern Festival.

378
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:56,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It celebrates family reunions and features ancient spiritual traditions.

379
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,771
[SPEAKER_06]: 2021 is the year of the ox.

380
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:09,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Those born in the year of the ox often exhibit the positive characteristics of being hardworking and honest.

381
01:18:11,134 --> 01:18:24,003
[SPEAKER_06]: We wish all of our Chinese neighbors and Asian members of our community and all that celebrate the Lunar New Year, good health and much happiness in the new year.

382
01:18:25,884 --> 01:18:28,226
[SPEAKER_06]: February is also Black History Month.

383
01:18:29,107 --> 01:18:31,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to extend a special thank you to Ms.

384
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:32,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Charose Walker.

385
01:18:34,632 --> 01:18:37,294
[SPEAKER_06]: The high school has been celebrating this month.

386
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:49,884
[SPEAKER_06]: In particular, we've been having an ethno Haitian dance performances by the esteemed co-founder and director of the Jean Apollon Expressions, J-A-E.

387
01:18:50,765 --> 01:18:58,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Jean Apollon, he's a successful choreographer and master teacher based in Boston and Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

388
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:06,146
[SPEAKER_06]: He teaches our students various Haitian folkloric dances, their meanings and origins.

389
01:19:07,407 --> 01:19:11,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss Walker has extended email invitations to the entire school committee as well.

390
01:19:12,533 --> 01:19:19,921
[SPEAKER_06]: And the sessions are taking place with students being socially distance and keeping an appropriate physical distance.

391
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:29,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The sessions are being videotaped because we were not able to live simulcast it to our students that are fully remote.

392
01:19:30,077 --> 01:19:40,365
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some of our vocational students taping it and they're going to edit these videos and make it available for everyone to be able to see and participate.

393
01:19:43,968 --> 01:19:47,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to just take a moment to say that, um,

394
01:19:49,391 --> 01:19:57,234
[SPEAKER_06]: A week from tomorrow, or a week from yesterday, next Sunday is Valentine's Day.

395
01:19:58,915 --> 01:20:05,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that we normally do if you recall a year ago, we were celebrating with Medford family network at the McGlynn school.

396
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:10,241
[SPEAKER_06]: participating in the Valentine fundraiser.

397
01:20:10,461 --> 01:20:14,505
[SPEAKER_06]: As a result of COVID, we really were not able to do that this year.

398
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:22,713
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the friends of the Medford Family Network, they held an online fundraiser called Valentine's Love.

399
01:20:24,554 --> 01:20:28,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And during that fundraiser, they were able to raise significant funds.

400
01:20:30,013 --> 01:20:36,739
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is our hope that we will be able to return to scooping ice cream next year at the Valentine fundraiser.

401
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So Medford Family Network, thank you for all you do on behalf of the community.

402
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:48,169
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, we have our wonderful CCSR students.

403
01:20:48,209 --> 01:20:51,272
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be a presentation by them today as well.

404
01:20:51,752 --> 01:20:54,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But as you know, CCSR, they're always busy.

405
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:56,954
[SPEAKER_06]: and up to something very good.

406
01:20:57,715 --> 01:21:03,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Our middle school students are collecting donations to put together senior citizen gift bags.

407
01:21:05,263 --> 01:21:11,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of our seniors are really struggling without being able to meet friends at Medford's Senior Center.

408
01:21:12,717 --> 01:21:20,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, CCSR is hoping donations of the following will help seniors feel less alone.

409
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:32,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Warm hats, gloves, puzzles, boxes of hot chocolate and tea, crossword puzzles, hand sanitizer, masks and books.

410
01:21:32,664 --> 01:21:35,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Donations can be left at the McGlynn Middle School.

411
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:41,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's a great opportunity to help our community and support our senior citizens.

412
01:21:43,635 --> 01:21:51,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, CCSR is hosting a winter clothing drive at Medford High School to benefit our Hope Chest.

413
01:21:51,863 --> 01:22:02,612
[SPEAKER_06]: They are looking for donations of new or gently used warm hats, snow pants, gloves, boots, winter jackets, socks, and Mustang gear.

414
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:07,477
[SPEAKER_06]: A donation box is located in the front lobby of the high school.

415
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:14,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanna recognize the Andrews Middle School National Junior Honor Society.

416
01:22:14,975 --> 01:22:16,997
[SPEAKER_06]: They are hosting a blanket drive.

417
01:22:17,618 --> 01:22:30,329
[SPEAKER_06]: New and gently used donated blankets can be brought to the Andrews Middle School and will be donated to a homeless shelter in our community and an animal shelter as well.

418
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, a few reminders.

419
01:22:35,688 --> 01:22:39,489
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had the opportunity to watch the Super Bowl last night, Ms.

420
01:22:39,669 --> 01:22:48,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Amanda Gorman once again inspired all of us by honoring frontline workers and educators in her poem, Before the Coin Toss.

421
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:54,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Poems for the Mustang Poetry Contest are still being accepted until February 22nd.

422
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:59,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage both our remote and hybrid students to send along their poems.

423
01:23:00,373 --> 01:23:09,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to acknowledge that member McLaughlin spoke and asked about some of our English learner students who may not yet be fluent in English.

424
01:23:10,544 --> 01:23:17,651
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I assured her that, yes, if the poem is written in a student's native language, we will have it translated.

425
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:19,953
[SPEAKER_06]: and we will take that into consideration.

426
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:35,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some of our students with disabilities that may not be able to write, we will accept assistive technology devices and illustrations all on the theme of unity.

427
01:23:35,641 --> 01:23:37,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanna be inclusive.

428
01:23:37,802 --> 01:23:44,065
[SPEAKER_06]: This poetry conference is for, this poetry contest is for everyone, pre-K to 12.

429
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:47,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who wants to participate can participate.

430
01:23:48,078 --> 01:23:49,580
[SPEAKER_06]: and we welcome you all.

431
01:23:50,881 --> 01:23:56,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next Building Bridges to Kindergarten is going to be held on Wednesday, February 24th from

432
01:23:59,811 --> 01:24:00,191
[SPEAKER_06]: 11 a.m.

433
01:24:00,271 --> 01:24:13,462
[SPEAKER_06]: to noon, so this building bridges to kindergarten session is in the middle of the school day, so parents who are out there, if you can mark that and take it as your lunch break, 11 a.m.

434
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:18,666
[SPEAKER_06]: to noon, again, welcoming new kindergartners for next school year.

435
01:24:19,147 --> 01:24:19,747
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the date?

436
01:24:20,828 --> 01:24:24,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday, February 24th, from 11 a.m.

437
01:24:24,091 --> 01:24:26,993
[SPEAKER_06]: to noon, one hour, early lunch that day.

438
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:38,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Our last update is that February vacation begins next week, Monday, February 15th until Friday, February 19th.

439
01:24:39,386 --> 01:24:48,855
[SPEAKER_06]: For parents who are looking for some options for their children during the vacation, please go to Medford's recreation site on the city website.

440
01:24:50,235 --> 01:24:57,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, the Medford Library is offering a creative writing workshop for students in grades six through 12.

441
01:24:57,921 --> 01:25:04,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Our secondary students have an opportunity to participate in creative writing with Medford Library.

442
01:25:05,447 --> 01:25:09,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope all of our Medford students and families enjoy this break.

443
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:09,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

444
01:25:14,554 --> 01:25:15,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

445
01:25:18,098 --> 01:25:27,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, we have a COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update by nurse supervisor, Ms.

446
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:28,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Toni Ray.

447
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:33,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Marianne O'Connor, I don't know if she's on, our board of health director and Mr. David Murphy.

448
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:35,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

449
01:25:35,387 --> 01:25:35,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Ray.

450
01:25:36,226 --> 01:25:37,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good evening, everyone.

451
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:39,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us and welcoming me.

452
01:25:40,711 --> 01:25:55,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to report that in this week's February 4th report from the Department of Public Health, Medford moved to the yellow zone for COVID activity with a decrease in our percent positivity rate to 2.06%.

453
01:25:59,011 --> 01:26:06,213
[SPEAKER_00]: The state is trending downwards as well, and that's reflected in both our city data and our school data.

454
01:26:09,354 --> 01:26:13,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week on Thursday, we made the transition to pooled testing.

455
01:26:15,535 --> 01:26:22,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Last Thursday and then this Monday were our first two days of pooled testing, and the testing process overall went well.

456
01:26:24,633 --> 01:26:35,539
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few little scheduling difficulties that we examined and made changes for today, and we were pleased that today moved along smoothly at all the schools.

457
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Last Thursday, we did 133 pooled tests.

458
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,541
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one positive pool that required follow-up.

459
01:26:46,961 --> 01:27:00,025
[SPEAKER_00]: All participants in that pool were contacted and follow-up testing was done on Saturday at Medford High School using a rapid screening as well as an individual PCR test.

460
01:27:05,344 --> 01:27:11,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the other word I'd like to mention is about upcoming vacation.

461
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:25,902
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna stress to people that anyone who plans to travel must follow the travel restrictions as outlined by Governor Baker and try to limit your travel and limit group gatherings.

462
01:27:27,163 --> 01:27:32,128
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask that you continue to wear your mask and maintain the six feet social distancing.

463
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:47,953
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are traveling, you need to receive a PCR test within 72 hours of re-entering the state, and you must quarantine until you get the results of that PCR test.

464
01:27:49,553 --> 01:27:56,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Any school students are advised to present their results to the school nurse prior to return to school.

465
01:27:58,355 --> 01:28:07,419
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to check the requirements, it would be at mass.gov slash COVID-19 travel restrictions.

466
01:28:13,883 --> 01:28:18,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Dave Murphy might be following me with some more information about the testing.

467
01:28:20,206 --> 01:28:20,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ms.

468
01:28:20,706 --> 01:28:20,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray.

469
01:28:21,706 --> 01:28:22,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Murphy, anything to add?

470
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:28,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Very quickly, Mayor, as Miss Ray said, we've made the transition to pool testing.

471
01:28:28,869 --> 01:28:38,936
[SPEAKER_18]: There were a couple of communications that went out from the superintendent last week, aimed at both families and the staff, explaining some of the implications of those changes.

472
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:50,325
[SPEAKER_18]: As was stated in those communications, for the vast majority of participants, provided our positivity rate continues to stay at the rates that it is now, hopefully declines even further.

473
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:55,123
[SPEAKER_18]: testing looks pretty much the same as it always has.

474
01:28:55,644 --> 01:29:06,113
[SPEAKER_18]: The biggest, the most noticeable change for most people in the Metro Public Schools participating in our testing program is the day of the week and the time at which they're testing.

475
01:29:06,834 --> 01:29:11,858
[SPEAKER_18]: That variable with regard to the time of day is a significant one.

476
01:29:12,538 --> 01:29:13,219
[SPEAKER_18]: And it is, Ms.

477
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:16,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Ray alluded to a couple of scheduling hiccups.

478
01:29:17,463 --> 01:29:17,763
[SPEAKER_18]: And while

479
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:21,732
[SPEAKER_18]: The statement that everything went well in school today was correct.

480
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:26,114
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, it went very well and that's due in large measure to Ms.

481
01:29:26,134 --> 01:29:33,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Ray's staff and the team of school nurses and other staff members who are helping to make this program a success.

482
01:29:33,939 --> 01:29:40,242
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a hiccup with the transition from the testing samples to the lab.

483
01:29:40,723 --> 01:29:46,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I anticipate that for the second time, we'll be doing the reflex testing

484
01:29:47,067 --> 01:29:49,648
[SPEAKER_18]: on what we consider to be the off day of testing.

485
01:29:49,668 --> 01:29:51,389
[SPEAKER_18]: So in this case, it will be Wednesday.

486
01:29:52,009 --> 01:29:54,311
[SPEAKER_18]: As is the last case, it was it was Saturday.

487
01:29:54,331 --> 01:30:00,554
[SPEAKER_18]: And as folks may have noticed by the time of the email on Friday night, we didn't have up 133 pools.

488
01:30:00,574 --> 01:30:05,776
[SPEAKER_18]: We had 132 of them back, but number 133 took a few hours to come in.

489
01:30:05,796 --> 01:30:10,479
[SPEAKER_18]: And as a result, we didn't give an all clear until around eight o'clock on Friday night.

490
01:30:10,559 --> 01:30:13,340
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't think it'll be eight o'clock tomorrow night, but

491
01:30:14,759 --> 01:30:25,184
[SPEAKER_18]: We probably will be utilizing our Wednesday testing station, which as we stated in the communication is open from 1pm until 4pm at Medford High School.

492
01:30:25,605 --> 01:30:31,808
[SPEAKER_18]: That testing station is primarily geared toward central office personnel, student

493
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:46,549
[SPEAKER_18]: athletes and extracurricular program participants in cohort D, so that students who are otherwise fully remote but participating in extracurricular activities in person, the expectation is that they are testing between 1 p.m.

494
01:30:46,569 --> 01:30:47,329
[SPEAKER_18]: and 4 p.m.

495
01:30:47,829 --> 01:30:56,072
[SPEAKER_18]: at the high school in the West Courtyard Lobby, and that will also be the time block this week in which we'll do the reflex testing, assuming there's any positive pools.

496
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:01,053
[SPEAKER_18]: So if there are no positive pools, then we won't be doing any reflex testing, and that would certainly be

497
01:31:01,688 --> 01:31:02,509
[SPEAKER_18]: certainly be good news.

498
01:31:02,549 --> 01:31:07,795
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, that's essentially where we're where we're at in terms of the pool testing.

499
01:31:08,075 --> 01:31:11,198
[SPEAKER_18]: We had said when we made this transition that there would be some bumps and hiccups.

500
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:15,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that's that has been the case, but nothing that is insurmountable.

501
01:31:16,344 --> 01:31:20,868
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, we think we look forward to continuing to execute this program in the coming weeks and months.

502
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:23,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

503
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:24,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Remember Ruseau?

504
01:31:25,486 --> 01:31:26,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for the report.

505
01:31:27,007 --> 01:31:28,727
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm very happy with the pool testing.

506
01:31:28,747 --> 01:31:33,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I did email I think all of you back after you sent the plan out to us.

507
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:42,952
[SPEAKER_20]: It was comprehensive and really closed a lot of the loopholes I think that we had expressed concerns about when you first presented that to us.

508
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:49,434
[SPEAKER_20]: With the pool testing, my understanding is more districts are joining in on pool testing.

509
01:31:49,734 --> 01:31:55,236
[SPEAKER_20]: And do we have any affirmative promises that the capacity

510
01:31:57,254 --> 01:32:06,858
[SPEAKER_20]: of the people that are actually taking the pool and doing the testing, that they can handle a ramping up of other districts joining in.

511
01:32:06,878 --> 01:32:15,302
[SPEAKER_20]: I just would hate for us to have gotten this done real smooth and then two more districts get in and then suddenly we have to wait a whole extra day and all our plans fall apart.

512
01:32:17,423 --> 01:32:18,844
[SPEAKER_18]: May I just respond to that?

513
01:32:18,864 --> 01:32:19,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Member Murphy.

514
01:32:20,665 --> 01:32:21,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Murphy.

515
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:22,205
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be an honor.

516
01:32:24,668 --> 01:32:46,444
[SPEAKER_18]: I think in terms of confirmation of the Broad Institute's capacity, what I would say is that because we've been involved in many of the conversations with DESE as they've developed this program, we've been able to get a little bit of an insider's view as to the vetting process that DESE is subjecting potential vendors to.

517
01:32:47,004 --> 01:32:52,008
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would say I have a high degree of confidence that

518
01:32:52,455 --> 01:33:04,060
[SPEAKER_18]: that vetting process is ensuring that all of the various entities that are involved in the administration of the testing programs, in fact, have the capacity and effectiveness to do so in a reliable way.

519
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:19,147
[SPEAKER_18]: That said, there are a number of variables, some of which that are at times out of our control, that do trigger some sort of pressure points that make the smoothness of the program a bit of a challenge.

520
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:43,447
[SPEAKER_18]: In this instance, the one that we've experienced both last week and this week, it's making sure, again, we pride ourselves on not disrupting the instructional day, and we need to maintain that, not minimize instructional disruption, but also get the testing done in a very, very efficient fashion, such that the samples arrive at the lab and can be turned around.

521
01:33:43,547 --> 01:33:47,568
[SPEAKER_18]: So I haven't seen any issues with regard to the labs capacity.

522
01:33:48,632 --> 01:34:03,035
[SPEAKER_18]: And we are doing our best to demonstrate the capacity necessary to be very efficient in the testing program without turning the entire school day into the day at which you go to test and if you can get some learning in while you're there, that's great.

523
01:34:03,795 --> 01:34:05,616
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's sort of where the challenges are.

524
01:34:05,636 --> 01:34:11,117
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little bit, it's a shared challenge and something that we have to continue to iron out some details on.

525
01:34:12,077 --> 01:34:12,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

526
01:34:15,738 --> 01:34:15,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

527
01:34:18,926 --> 01:34:25,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up, we have report on CCSR, Mr. Richard Trotter, Michael Skorka, and student representatives.

528
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:26,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

529
01:34:32,474 --> 01:34:35,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Just unmuted you, Mr. Skorka.

530
01:34:37,197 --> 01:34:37,837
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I'm here.

531
01:34:37,897 --> 01:34:39,558
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Mr. Trotter is in the room as well.

532
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:40,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, looking.

533
01:34:52,463 --> 01:34:53,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cushing, do you see?

534
01:34:54,044 --> 01:34:55,745
[SPEAKER_16]: I think he might be under iPad.

535
01:34:57,226 --> 01:34:57,666
[SPEAKER_16]: That helps.

536
01:34:58,027 --> 01:34:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made Ms.

537
01:34:59,287 --> 01:35:01,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Olson and Mr. Skorka co-hosts as well.

538
01:35:02,409 --> 01:35:09,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And just let us know the students who would like to speak and we can do similarly or just unmute.

539
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:23,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I could start if Mr. Trotta, Mr. Trotta, could you please unmute and begin?

540
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:24,145
[SPEAKER_16]: And if not, I'll start.

541
01:35:26,006 --> 01:35:28,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Skorka, do you know if it's iPad two or iPad three?

542
01:35:28,647 --> 01:35:31,249
[SPEAKER_08]: No idea, right?

543
01:35:31,729 --> 01:35:32,890
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea, I'm sorry.

544
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:35,432
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here, can you hear me now?

545
01:35:35,872 --> 01:35:36,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we hear you.

546
01:35:36,572 --> 01:35:37,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

547
01:35:38,113 --> 01:35:39,454
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm iPad three, all right.

548
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:43,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, first of all, thank you for allowing us to give this report.

549
01:35:44,357 --> 01:35:46,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank the school committee

550
01:35:47,211 --> 01:35:51,615
[SPEAKER_15]: for being there behind the scenes and supporting us and the kids.

551
01:35:52,436 --> 01:35:58,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I also wanna thank the superintendent who's been an outstanding contributor and supporter.

552
01:35:59,422 --> 01:36:03,845
[SPEAKER_15]: With her support, we have been able to expand the program dramatically over the last three years.

553
01:36:05,447 --> 01:36:10,030
[SPEAKER_15]: So tonight there will be a report by the students and Michael, I'm just giving a quick brief introduction.

554
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:12,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanna remind you of our mission.

555
01:36:13,697 --> 01:36:17,798
[SPEAKER_15]: which is to develop student leaders who work to make the world a better place.

556
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:24,960
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that covers a lot of territory, particularly in this acrimony that has existed for the last few years.

557
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:36,263
[SPEAKER_15]: We believe this program is vital to the future of our country in a sense of developing positive role models and leaders that will help lead us in the future.

558
01:36:36,283 --> 01:36:42,825
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank our founders, Bloomberg Foundation, who gave us the first grant

559
01:36:43,282 --> 01:36:53,008
[SPEAKER_15]: and then the Cummings Foundation, and now thankfully, the Crystal Campbell Betterment Project has now given us life for next year and this year.

560
01:36:53,068 --> 01:36:55,610
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're in good shape financially for this year and next year.

561
01:36:57,030 --> 01:37:02,674
[SPEAKER_15]: We have changed the format because of the COVID, and Michael's gonna talk about that.

562
01:37:03,788 --> 01:37:06,209
[SPEAKER_15]: So in closing, I want to, once again, thank you all.

563
01:37:06,769 --> 01:37:10,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I also want to thank Dr. Cushing for being my direct contact.

564
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:18,353
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working together and we're looking to do some great things beyond just CCSF and getting more into SEL as well.

565
01:37:18,373 --> 01:37:28,936
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I'd like to introduce Michael, but I want to thank also Megan Olson and Ivy Carabucci, who are both working as advisors as well.

566
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:32,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Megan's done a fantastic job at the middle school level and Ivy's helping Michael

567
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:34,612
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, we all know Michael.

568
01:37:34,652 --> 01:37:35,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Michael is a superstar.

569
01:37:36,455 --> 01:37:39,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Life support for our students.

570
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:41,042
[SPEAKER_15]: And he does a fantastic job.

571
01:37:41,062 --> 01:37:42,484
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to pass it on to Michael.

572
01:37:42,504 --> 01:37:44,728
[SPEAKER_15]: And once again, thank you for allowing us to give this report.

573
01:37:46,793 --> 01:37:47,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks so much, Rich.

574
01:37:47,714 --> 01:37:49,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I really appreciate those kind words.

575
01:37:49,877 --> 01:37:54,984
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're very excited and really honored that you're having us on tonight.

576
01:37:55,965 --> 01:37:57,987
[SPEAKER_16]: I even wore my special bow tie for tonight.

577
01:37:58,929 --> 01:38:00,230
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll get started with that.

578
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:05,056
[SPEAKER_16]: So the CCSR is having a very successful year, even during this pandemic.

579
01:38:05,537 --> 01:38:09,458
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the high school, there are over 100 active CCSR student leaders.

580
01:38:09,858 --> 01:38:14,220
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the middle school, there are approximately 30 to 50 active CCSR student leaders.

581
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,760
[SPEAKER_16]: We're very proud of that.

582
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,221
[SPEAKER_16]: It keeps getting bigger and bigger.

583
01:38:17,901 --> 01:38:22,723
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of projects at the high school, students are working on or have completed a total of 50 projects.

584
01:38:22,843 --> 01:38:25,704
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Rich said, the model's been a little different this year.

585
01:38:25,744 --> 01:38:34,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Students are tending to choose large-scale projects, whereas before they were doing projects in groups, that's still happening.

586
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:43,009
[SPEAKER_16]: It's sort of shifted into these large-scale projects and overall, like I said, we have been working on or completed a total of 50 projects.

587
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:47,591
[SPEAKER_16]: We expect that number to go up, of course, as the year continues.

588
01:38:48,171 --> 01:39:00,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of these projects include painting a social justice mural in the city, which we're working on, stocking the CCSR micro pantry located at Tufts Park, running a school supply drive, organizing a Medford Rock painting scavenger hunt,

589
01:39:01,295 --> 01:39:06,181
[SPEAKER_16]: and pushing to decrease the amount of plastic cutlery given to customers with their takeout orders.

590
01:39:06,762 --> 01:39:15,011
[SPEAKER_16]: A big shout out to my co-advisor, Ivy Carnabucci, who helps me advise these students toward the successful completion of these projects every single day.

591
01:39:15,071 --> 01:39:15,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, Ivy.

592
01:39:16,783 --> 01:39:20,005
[SPEAKER_16]: At the middle schools, students have been extremely busy as well.

593
01:39:20,365 --> 01:39:39,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Some key middle school projects include filling up the Free Little Libraries in Medford with age-appropriate books, creating gift bags for our senior citizens, as the superintendent mentioned, and organizing and executing our third annual Mustang Way Assembly, where high school students spoke to sixth graders about the importance of being kind to one another and to encourage one another

594
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:42,561
[SPEAKER_16]: to implement the Mustang way in their daily lives.

595
01:39:43,181 --> 01:39:52,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Also a big shout out goes to Megan Olson, who is the CCSR advisor at the middle schools and helps to oversee all of those wonderful projects that I just mentioned.

596
01:39:52,727 --> 01:39:57,790
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm also happy to report that we will soon be hiring another CCSR co-advisor at the middle schools.

597
01:39:58,883 --> 01:40:15,354
[SPEAKER_16]: We encourage all of you to check out all of these projects and our announcements on the CCSR social media pages and website, which are run by our student leaders, specifically Emma Maganzini, Christina Zhang, Erin Tan, Lisa Lopes, and our webmaster, Dan Khoi Nguyen.

598
01:40:15,894 --> 01:40:28,163
[SPEAKER_16]: You can find more information about the CCSR on our Facebook at the CCSR, on our Instagram at MedfordCCSR, on our Twitter page at MedfordCCSR, and of course on our website at MedfordCCSR.org.

599
01:40:28,863 --> 01:40:36,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Finally, the portfolio that you received before today's meeting was created by our student portfolio managers, Laurel Baxter and Ava Heineck.

600
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:46,552
[SPEAKER_16]: The CCSR works as a team, and I consider us to be one big family, and we will continue to make the world a better place one student at a time, which is our motto.

601
01:40:47,032 --> 01:40:48,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, let's hear from some of these students.

602
01:40:49,714 --> 01:40:54,736
[SPEAKER_16]: First up, I'd like to introduce middle school CCSR student leader, Kaitlyn Alves.

603
01:40:55,076 --> 01:40:56,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Kaitlyn, you're up.

604
01:41:00,069 --> 01:41:02,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Kaitlin Alves, a seventh grader at the McGlynn.

605
01:41:02,911 --> 01:41:09,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've completed a handful of CCS projects, including putting together bags for the senior center, which I'm currently working on doing again.

606
01:41:10,936 --> 01:41:16,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We're collecting items like hot chocolate, tea, mittens, and hats.

607
01:41:19,602 --> 01:41:24,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the summer, I was fortunate enough to see the smiles these bags brought to the faces of the senior citizens.

608
01:41:25,106 --> 01:41:29,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also done a bake sale at the running of the Leprechauns Road Race for Boston Children's Hospital twice.

609
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,300
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was in elementary school.

610
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:38,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fortunate to catch the attention of the news with the lookup challenge, where we challenged students, teachers, and parents to take a break from technology.

611
01:41:39,402 --> 01:41:48,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed doing all these things with the CCSR because it gave me an opportunity to make a difference in my community, and I got to work with so many amazing people while doing it.

612
01:41:49,204 --> 01:41:53,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, I'd like to introduce high school CCSR member Sarah Lima.

613
01:41:59,276 --> 01:42:02,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi everyone, my name is Sarah Lima, I'm a senior at the high school.

614
01:42:02,298 --> 01:42:06,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to talk about a little bit why I joined CCSR.

615
01:42:06,101 --> 01:42:08,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I had Mr. Skorka as a freshman.

616
01:42:08,062 --> 01:42:14,087
[SPEAKER_12]: He was a great teacher and he was always so passionate about his work and I was always so passionate about

617
01:42:14,987 --> 01:42:22,552
[SPEAKER_12]: helping other people so I always had these ideas and I talked to Mr. Skorka about my ideas and he told me about the CCSR and it got me interested.

618
01:42:22,572 --> 01:42:36,439
[SPEAKER_12]: I am also a very shy person so I don't communicate a lot so CCSR helped me a lot with meeting new people and it really helped me with my ideas and it brought my ideas into reality.

619
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,801
[SPEAKER_12]: This year we are making masks for

620
01:42:41,823 --> 01:42:47,168
[SPEAKER_12]: local shelters since the pandemic is really bad lately and everything.

621
01:42:48,089 --> 01:42:50,011
[SPEAKER_12]: We are planning on making 200 masks.

622
01:42:50,972 --> 01:42:53,775
[SPEAKER_12]: We have made 50 right now with the help of our mayor.

623
01:42:54,215 --> 01:42:55,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for donating the elastics.

624
01:42:56,818 --> 01:42:58,239
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to show one of the masks we made.

625
01:42:58,279 --> 01:43:01,222
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just to show an example.

626
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:11,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and we are planning on making logos to put on the masks that says CCSR.

627
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:12,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, guys.

628
01:43:14,692 --> 01:43:15,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's it.

629
01:43:15,513 --> 01:43:15,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

630
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:17,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Now for Samuel Klugisch.

631
01:43:20,256 --> 01:43:20,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

632
01:43:21,597 --> 01:43:22,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Klugisch?

633
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:25,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I can unmute you.

634
01:43:39,282 --> 01:43:40,422
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be good now, Sam.

635
01:43:41,063 --> 01:43:41,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

636
01:43:43,023 --> 01:43:43,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

637
01:43:43,644 --> 01:43:46,025
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Sarah for that very wonderful introduction.

638
01:43:46,525 --> 01:43:50,226
[SPEAKER_17]: So my name is Samuel cluggish and I am a senior at Medford High School.

639
01:43:51,086 --> 01:43:53,787
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been a part of the CCSR since my sophomore year.

640
01:43:56,186 --> 01:44:08,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Tonight, I want to talk briefly about my project for this year, which was to launch the CCSR's first podcast segment with Sam, which I hope most of you have had a chance to listen to.

641
01:44:08,355 --> 01:44:11,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And if not, you can check it out on the CCSR's website.

642
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:21,265
[SPEAKER_17]: So the monthly podcast is a chance to share not only with the school, but the broader Bedford community about various projects and events happening in the CCSR.

643
01:44:21,825 --> 01:44:25,008
[SPEAKER_17]: And we also like to explore various themes such as gratitude and good deeds.

644
01:44:26,082 --> 01:44:30,725
[SPEAKER_17]: The podcast is important because we can reach new audiences to talk about our work and to share ideas.

645
01:44:31,205 --> 01:44:35,448
[SPEAKER_17]: We hope that new students will be inspired to join and new funders will be inspired to support us as well.

646
01:44:36,909 --> 01:44:45,073
[SPEAKER_17]: During the rest of the year, we're looking to build on our initial success with the podcast and hopefully include some interviews and explore different topics.

647
01:44:46,094 --> 01:44:52,337
[SPEAKER_17]: If any of you have any specific ideas you would like to see us address, please feel free to let me or Mr. Skorka know.

648
01:44:54,088 --> 01:45:04,618
[SPEAKER_17]: For me personally, I'm honestly very grateful for all the skills that I'm learning on this project, because I know that podcasts and social media are critical tools to communicate ideas to broad audiences.

649
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:07,961
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that I'll be able to use these skills in college and beyond.

650
01:45:09,322 --> 01:45:12,325
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you to Mr. Skorka, Mr. Trotta, and the CCSR community.

651
01:45:13,386 --> 01:45:19,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And lastly, the CCSR would once again like to thank the Crystal Camp Community Betterment Project and the Cummings Foundation for their continued support.

652
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:23,043
[SPEAKER_17]: And that concludes our presentations for tonight.

653
01:45:23,143 --> 01:45:24,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for your time.

654
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:25,626
[SPEAKER_17]: And are there any questions?

655
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:28,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Sam.

656
01:45:29,951 --> 01:45:30,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we have questions.

657
01:45:31,453 --> 01:45:33,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Van der Klooth and Member McLaughlin?

658
01:45:35,798 --> 01:45:36,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Unmute.

659
01:45:38,905 --> 01:45:39,285
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

660
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:47,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to mention how wonderful it was to have the opportunity to join in the middle school assembly this past week.

661
01:45:48,312 --> 01:45:56,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankly, you know, as a school committee member, one of the great joys is to be able to see our students in action and when we've been all

662
01:45:57,807 --> 01:45:59,188
[SPEAKER_10]: On Zoom, that's been harder to do.

663
01:45:59,308 --> 01:46:05,152
[SPEAKER_10]: So bringing us this assembly, getting to see our kids and a lot of them, it was just great.

664
01:46:05,232 --> 01:46:10,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you and thanks to all the students and of course to their leadership, Mr. Skorka, Ms.

665
01:46:10,175 --> 01:46:13,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Olson, Mr. Trotta and everybody else who's involved.

666
01:46:14,097 --> 01:46:15,939
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that makes us feel very proud.

667
01:46:16,959 --> 01:46:17,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member Van der Kloot.

668
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the assembly was very impressive.

669
01:46:20,702 --> 01:46:22,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin and then member Kreatz.

670
01:46:24,552 --> 01:46:25,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

671
01:46:25,693 --> 01:46:29,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say, I feel like the CCSR is a real jewel in Medford's crown.

672
01:46:30,416 --> 01:46:32,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that we should all truly be proud of.

673
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:38,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It has taught so much about kindness and gratitude as Sam was saying a little while ago.

674
01:46:38,422 --> 01:46:44,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think our community as a whole could learn a lot from the CCSR, especially in these days.

675
01:46:45,548 --> 01:46:52,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanna thank Rich Trotta and Michael Skorka and the foundations for contributing and also Rich

676
01:46:53,258 --> 01:47:02,921
[SPEAKER_09]: very interested in hearing more about CCSR's work in the social-emotional realm, which is also a much needed aspect in our district and in our community.

677
01:47:02,981 --> 01:47:04,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all so much.

678
01:47:04,422 --> 01:47:11,544
[SPEAKER_09]: And to the students who presented tonight, I know it can be really intimidating presenting on Zoom, and just wanted to say that you guys all did a great job.

679
01:47:11,604 --> 01:47:12,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

680
01:47:13,525 --> 01:47:14,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

681
01:47:14,105 --> 01:47:15,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

682
01:47:15,126 --> 01:47:15,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Kreatz?

683
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:20,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say thank you to all the students for your presentation tonight.

684
01:47:20,703 --> 01:47:21,864
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all incredible.

685
01:47:22,845 --> 01:47:27,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to mention that each and every project is so extraordinary.

686
01:47:28,009 --> 01:47:32,252
[SPEAKER_02]: All your projects are making a huge difference in so many people's lives.

687
01:47:32,733 --> 01:47:33,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.

688
01:47:33,694 --> 01:47:36,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to hear how creative these projects are and

689
01:47:37,997 --> 01:47:42,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The students are so excited about their projects and they're so involved in them.

690
01:47:42,401 --> 01:47:43,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's wonderful.

691
01:47:43,542 --> 01:47:45,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just can't thank them enough.

692
01:47:45,804 --> 01:47:55,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna thank Megan Olson, Michael Skorka, Rich Trotter and the foundation also for their support with the funding and just thank you.

693
01:47:55,832 --> 01:48:05,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did get to jump on the call last week and I got to hear some of the presentations during the live call last week and it was incredible also.

694
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:05,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.

695
01:48:08,367 --> 01:48:09,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

696
01:48:09,269 --> 01:48:11,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just want to echo the sentiments, Mr. Skorka, Ms.

697
01:48:11,854 --> 01:48:19,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Olson, Mr. Trotter, I know Dr. Edouard-Vincent and her team, everybody so supportive of CCSR and the Cummings Foundation, which I

698
01:48:20,347 --> 01:48:26,590
[SPEAKER_08]: advocate for funding to CCSR and they've been a great, they've been able to keep the program up and running and surviving.

699
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:28,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And the projects you do are amazing.

700
01:48:28,771 --> 01:48:32,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Squawker, you get the kids to not only do projects and love it.

701
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:43,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it was 180 students you had last year, which I think is amazing at the high school, but you have them emailing the mayor's office for help all the time and really taking that initiative.

702
01:48:43,557 --> 01:48:46,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree, it helps them build confidence.

703
01:48:47,085 --> 01:48:54,995
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can see it, whether that was on the assembly or here tonight, and we're just so proud of all the students and all those working very hard on their behalf.

704
01:48:55,035 --> 01:48:55,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

705
01:48:55,555 --> 01:48:59,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

706
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:01,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, it looks like people have their hand raised.

707
01:49:01,502 --> 01:49:03,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's regards to CCSR.

708
01:49:04,106 --> 01:49:04,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, great.

709
01:49:04,967 --> 01:49:05,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Amy?

710
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:12,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, I just wanted to check in and ask the team that's making the masks.

711
01:49:13,022 --> 01:49:15,924
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to check in and ask if they have all the supplies they need.

712
01:49:16,384 --> 01:49:21,566
[SPEAKER_19]: And if they don't wear, how could people bring you extra fabric or elastics?

713
01:49:21,626 --> 01:49:22,547
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, do you need anything?

714
01:49:22,607 --> 01:49:23,967
[SPEAKER_19]: And how can we get it to you?

715
01:49:24,407 --> 01:49:24,688
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

716
01:49:25,848 --> 01:49:29,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Sarah, did you do you need more fabric or?

717
01:49:30,328 --> 01:49:44,757
[SPEAKER_12]: actually um i finished my fabric because i did make the 50 masks on monday but i am planning on buying more we didn't spend much money but thank you so much for asking but we're okay thank you so much

718
01:49:45,958 --> 01:49:46,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Amy.

719
01:49:46,478 --> 01:49:51,743
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure Mr. Skorka, you could get in touch with Ms.

720
01:49:51,763 --> 01:50:00,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Skorka at medford.k12.ma.us if you want to reach out to him, Amy, to see if any of the other students need any more material.

721
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:04,164
[SPEAKER_08]: and I got extra elastic, so I think they're good with it.

722
01:50:04,644 --> 01:50:05,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor, could I just say one thing?

723
01:50:06,185 --> 01:50:06,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

724
01:50:06,645 --> 01:50:13,709
[SPEAKER_16]: There may be, so Amy, there may, we may need, there may be another group, you know, if we do have the materials that would want to step up and do that.

725
01:50:13,789 --> 01:50:18,111
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you would like to donate, maybe Sarah's group, if they finish, cause their goal is 200.

726
01:50:18,832 --> 01:50:24,655
[SPEAKER_16]: So if they finish 200 before the school is over, we may be able to use that either now or sometime in the summer.

727
01:50:24,715 --> 01:50:28,217
[SPEAKER_16]: So feel free to email me and thank you so much for that.

728
01:50:28,237 --> 01:50:29,157
[SPEAKER_16]: That was really wonderful.

729
01:50:30,698 --> 01:50:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

730
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:32,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all.

731
01:50:33,892 --> 01:50:41,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up, we have number four report on Massachusetts School Library Association, MSLA, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent.

732
01:50:42,098 --> 01:50:46,501
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Maria Dorsey, Teacher Librarian at Medford Public Schools.

733
01:50:46,521 --> 01:50:49,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if this is under the same category.

734
01:50:50,264 --> 01:50:53,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Has been chosen to serve as Metro West Area Co-Director of

735
01:50:54,422 --> 01:50:59,685
[SPEAKER_08]: the 2020-2021 Executive Board of the Massachusetts School Library Association.

736
01:51:00,505 --> 01:51:09,710
[SPEAKER_08]: The Massachusetts School Library Association congratulates Christina Johnson, library teacher at the Andrews Middle School as a recipient of the President's Award.

737
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:15,793
[SPEAKER_08]: This award honors school librarians making an impact on student learning in their early careers.

738
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:19,975
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope you will join us as we celebrate Christina's successes

739
01:51:20,563 --> 01:51:26,185
[SPEAKER_08]: in our online celebratory campaign running February 22nd to March 12th on Twitter and Facebook.

740
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:32,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Christina will be honored at the Massachusetts School Library Association annual conference on March 21st and 22nd.

741
01:51:32,827 --> 01:51:33,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

742
01:51:36,763 --> 01:51:42,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so again this, this report and update is really just to congratulate.

743
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:51,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, the both of them for their wonderful lead leadership Maria Dorsey who we know is our librarian at the high school.

744
01:51:52,216 --> 01:51:53,777
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually her third year.

745
01:51:54,638 --> 01:51:56,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we just want to congratulate her.

746
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:02,884
[SPEAKER_06]: We did recognize her last year when she received the award of super librarian.

747
01:52:03,484 --> 01:52:11,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was in February of 2020, a year ago, but Maria Dorsey is doing wonderful work at the high school.

748
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:15,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is her third year serving in the role, but it's still an honor.

749
01:52:15,413 --> 01:52:19,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to just congratulate her for being part of the executive board.

750
01:52:20,593 --> 01:52:25,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, had we been meeting in person, we would have been able to take a picture and clap with her.

751
01:52:26,779 --> 01:52:30,062
[SPEAKER_06]: She actually had a public library director meeting today.

752
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:33,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's not able to be on this call this evening.

753
01:52:34,041 --> 01:52:55,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And also for Christina Johnson, I just wanted to share a little bit of background about her story in terms of the context that Chris was a parent volunteer at the Brooks Elementary School when the 2008 recession resulted in budget cuts and the K-8 libraries closed.

754
01:52:56,922 --> 01:53:09,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they reopened first with parent volunteers and then paraprofessionals under the guidance of the remaining 1.5 librarians, Holly Lannan and Maria Dorsey.

755
01:53:10,772 --> 01:53:21,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris was transitioning from a business position and became a library para, which resulted in working towards her library teacher certification from Salem State.

756
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:24,061
[SPEAKER_06]: her impact was immediate.

757
01:53:24,962 --> 01:53:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Reopening the Andrews Middle School Library and establishing programs at both Andrews and McGlynn Middle Schools, where she applied for grants to fund after-school science enrichment, as well as a close association with the Medford Public Library.

758
01:53:42,611 --> 01:53:44,152
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to both middle schools,

759
01:53:45,097 --> 01:53:52,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris also manages the McGlynn Elementary School and the Columbus Elementary, along with a staff of paraprofessionals.

760
01:53:53,462 --> 01:54:06,250
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to recognize this wonderful accomplishment for Medford's own Christina Johnson, and I'm just really happy that she's receiving this President's Award.

761
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:13,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not sure if Christina is on the call, but I just wanted to

762
01:54:15,363 --> 01:54:24,027
[SPEAKER_06]: acknowledge her wonderful accomplishments to the committee and let you know that wonderful things are happening in Medford.

763
01:54:25,168 --> 01:54:27,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if we see a raised hand.

764
01:54:27,269 --> 01:54:32,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I see Christina Johnson on the call, not raising her hand though, but I can unmute her.

765
01:54:32,751 --> 01:54:36,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Christina, are you able to say hello?

766
01:54:36,253 --> 01:54:36,973
[SPEAKER_21]: I am.

767
01:54:36,993 --> 01:54:37,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me?

768
01:54:37,854 --> 01:54:38,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Wonderful.

769
01:54:38,678 --> 01:54:40,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we just send you to do.

770
01:54:40,279 --> 01:54:41,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

771
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:41,500
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

772
01:54:41,601 --> 01:54:44,283
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, thank you very much for recognizing me this evening.

773
01:54:44,343 --> 01:54:45,384
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate it.

774
01:54:46,445 --> 01:54:58,455
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a totally unexpected award, but it gives me a lot of honor to also be recognized with Maria Dorsey, who was my inspiration for becoming a library.

775
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:11,525
[SPEAKER_21]: And even though the award is for someone who's new in their library career, I'm actually consider myself old, but this is a second career for me.

776
01:55:12,265 --> 01:55:15,966
[SPEAKER_21]: And Maria was my inspiration for becoming a librarian.

777
01:55:17,167 --> 01:55:20,708
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just wanted to say thank you again for recognizing me tonight.

778
01:55:23,149 --> 01:55:24,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your service.

779
01:55:24,469 --> 01:55:25,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

780
01:55:25,150 --> 01:55:25,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

781
01:55:30,322 --> 01:55:34,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Number five, we have motion to approve donation of MacBook to a student.

782
01:55:34,944 --> 01:55:37,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.

783
01:55:40,385 --> 01:55:40,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

784
01:55:40,926 --> 01:55:46,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So a community member reached out approximately a month ago to Ms.

785
01:55:46,247 --> 01:55:52,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Schulman with a very, very generous donation of a MacBook 2018.

786
01:55:55,572 --> 01:55:58,414
[SPEAKER_03]: um, device and we are presenting it.

787
01:55:58,614 --> 01:56:00,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It is to be used for a student.

788
01:56:01,775 --> 01:56:06,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we are asking you to accept this donation.

789
01:56:07,878 --> 01:56:08,698

[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van der Kloot.

805
01:56:40,488 --> 01:56:43,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Just unmute yourself, Member Van der Kloot, sorry.

806
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:45,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

807
01:56:46,771 --> 01:56:47,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

808
01:56:47,791 --> 01:56:49,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

809
01:56:49,752 --> 01:56:50,713
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

810
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:52,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Cushing.

811
01:56:53,602 --> 01:56:59,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as the motion passed, I do wanna say publicly, and we'll send a thank you note to Ms.

812
01:56:59,406 --> 01:57:03,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Deirdre Hosler for her generous donation to our students.

813
01:57:05,431 --> 01:57:06,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, thank you.

814
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:07,472
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

815
01:57:09,153 --> 01:57:13,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Number six, we have the fiscal year 22 budget overview and anticipated timeline.

816
01:57:14,037 --> 01:57:18,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. David Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

817
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:18,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Murphy.

818
01:57:19,775 --> 01:57:20,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor.

819
01:57:20,735 --> 01:57:22,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening again, members of the school committee.

820
01:57:23,436 --> 01:57:48,221
[SPEAKER_18]: This next presentation, which I will keep brief in light of the fact that it is the first of many times we'll have a conversation, I suspect around the fiscal 22 budget, is in response to several questions that have come in from members of the committee looking to talk about the timeline and to be able to begin to establish expectations, both for the committee

821
01:57:48,795 --> 01:57:52,776
[SPEAKER_18]: and members of the community as to what to expect in the coming weeks and months.

822
01:57:52,816 --> 01:57:57,657
[SPEAKER_18]: So I do have a deck that I'm going to share.

823
01:57:57,837 --> 01:58:01,877
[SPEAKER_18]: It's only seven slides, including the cover.

824
01:58:01,897 --> 01:58:04,558
[SPEAKER_18]: So it, again, won't take us too long to walk through all of this.

825
01:58:05,818 --> 01:58:16,160
[SPEAKER_18]: This particular presentation will be at a fairly high level and we'll walk through the components of the budget and some of the

826
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:29,679
[SPEAKER_18]: initial challenges that we are already know that we'll be confronting as we begin to develop our budgetary priorities and look forward to the adoption of the fiscal year 22 budget.

827
01:58:29,739 --> 01:58:40,386
[SPEAKER_18]: So some of this again is background, but I know for some people watching school committee meetings, this isn't something that thankfully you have to think about or work with on a daily basis.

828
01:58:40,446 --> 01:58:45,329
[SPEAKER_18]: So just for those who haven't tuned into the budget process since the last time the budget was developed,

829
01:58:46,051 --> 01:58:57,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, the budget is comprised primarily of state and local funding with, um, those coming through the budget process that begins with the governor's state of the commonwealth address.

830
01:58:57,095 --> 01:59:09,740
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just a couple of weeks ago when what is called the cherry sheet that goes to the legislature to help work through a complicated formula formula to determine the appropriations have made to municipalities across the state.

831
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:13,021
[SPEAKER_18]: That chapter 70 funding is the largest influx of

832
01:59:13,569 --> 01:59:20,751
[SPEAKER_18]: core educational funding, and the formula dictates the amount that is allocated to each city and town within the Commonwealth.

833
01:59:21,431 --> 01:59:35,554
[SPEAKER_18]: While that's happening at the state level, the city is developing its own budgetary priorities and examining its budgetary capacity, much of which is based on what that Chapter 70 allocation is that comes from the state, along with the unrestricted local aid.

834
01:59:36,114 --> 01:59:38,435
[SPEAKER_18]: All of that goes into determining what

835
01:59:38,972 --> 01:59:43,575
[SPEAKER_18]: the budget will be, what budget will be appropriated for the school department.

836
01:59:44,135 --> 01:59:51,539
[SPEAKER_18]: And while that is happening at the city and state level, the school department is developing its budgetary priorities consistent with the district's strategic goals.

837
01:59:52,180 --> 02:00:07,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultimately, the superintendent will make a recommendation after an internal vetting process and a process that will be outlined in a moment in a flowchart that will tweak consistent with the committee's feedback in order to

838
02:00:08,851 --> 02:00:14,856
[SPEAKER_18]: make sure that we have a presence in our website and elsewhere.

839
02:00:14,896 --> 02:00:23,623
[SPEAKER_18]: So members of the community who wanna follow along as we develop the budget and as it ultimately, as we move toward the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1st.

840
02:00:24,423 --> 02:00:37,153
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the other, I can't really say it because of where the Zoom, how the Zoom is set up here, but the core budget is made up of the local contribution and the chapter 70 funding.

841
02:00:39,103 --> 02:00:42,806
[SPEAKER_18]: what is often referred to in finance circles as the external funds.

842
02:00:43,566 --> 02:00:51,071
[SPEAKER_18]: These are grants as well as some of the miscellaneous funding that comes in based on specific circumstances.

843
02:00:51,551 --> 02:01:07,862
[SPEAKER_18]: The circumstances we're operating under now have to do with funding that has come in for fiscal year 2021 and anticipated through FY22 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of which is heavily restricted for use related to expenses that are connected

844
02:01:08,455 --> 02:01:09,236
[SPEAKER_18]: to the pandemic.

845
02:01:09,796 --> 02:01:25,369
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit later in this meeting, I'll be presenting a summary as to money that we've expended in order to address some of the more pressing priorities that the district has needed to address due to the circumstances under which we are operating.

846
02:01:25,449 --> 02:01:37,018
[SPEAKER_18]: But even putting all the COVID-19 context aside, these external funds flow in each fiscal year and replenish themselves on a year-to-year basis.

847
02:01:37,852 --> 02:02:00,317
[SPEAKER_18]: are Medford Public Schools, like all public school districts in Massachusetts, is, I'm gonna say, heavily dependent, keeping in mind that this is still a relatively small fraction of the overall operating budget, but some of the important initiatives and parts of the district are funded through these grants, and so it's an important part of sort of seeing the entire budgetary picture.

848
02:02:01,557 --> 02:02:05,518
[SPEAKER_18]: With regard to a timeline, and again, this is, I can see the,

849
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:12,684
[SPEAKER_18]: made his facial expression there, which tells me that we will be tweaking this a little bit before we get to the place where it is published.

850
02:02:12,704 --> 02:02:18,828
[SPEAKER_18]: So the point of this flowchart is to make this clearer to the community as to the step-by-step process.

851
02:02:19,889 --> 02:02:28,895
[SPEAKER_18]: I can tell you that the finance people that reviewed it thought it was very clear, but that might tell us more about finance people than it does about the value of the flowchart.

852
02:02:28,915 --> 02:02:30,156
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm including myself in that.

853
02:02:30,716 --> 02:02:33,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope I haven't offended any members of my team.

854
02:02:34,995 --> 02:02:40,799
[SPEAKER_18]: All budgets begin with the goals and visions that are established by the superintendent and the school committee.

855
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:55,188
[SPEAKER_18]: There is, as you might imagine, a significant portion of this that takes place internally and vetting the different priorities prior to being presented to the public through the personnel and budget subcommittee meetings.

856
02:02:55,728 --> 02:03:04,334
[SPEAKER_18]: We anticipate a series of meetings and or hearings to help vet the budget and keep the community informed as the budgetary priorities

857
02:03:04,875 --> 02:03:29,552
[SPEAKER_18]: continue to develop that leads to the superintendent's recommendations to the school committee and the what is the statutory obligation on the part of the school committee to hold a budget hearing and receive feedback that leads to the school committee request that goes to the municipal government and then follow following that but an appropriation to the school committee which is ultimately when the school committee adopts the fiscal year fiscal year 22 budget so

858
02:03:32,335 --> 02:03:58,394
[SPEAKER_18]: The point of this is not so much that everyone can memorize the seven steps involved in the budget development process, as much as it is to convey the point that there's a fairly extended chronological process that will occur over the next several months as we lead toward fiscal year 22, all which each step sort of has a specific purpose.

859
02:03:58,894 --> 02:04:00,976
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes it's to make sure that we're thoroughly vetting

860
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:12,063
[SPEAKER_18]: budgetary priorities and seeing how each of those budget priorities fit together to form the overall coherent picture of what the district is trying to accomplish and the context in which we're operating.

861
02:04:12,543 --> 02:04:26,166
[SPEAKER_18]: And other steps are specifically to maintain a level of transparency so the members of the community can understand both where we are in the process and what the implications are going from the budget book to the classroom and other learning environments.

862
02:04:26,946 --> 02:04:30,687
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're at a place now as we are on the cusp of fiscal year

863
02:04:31,927 --> 02:04:38,109
[SPEAKER_18]: in which we already know that there are some red flags or warning signs ahead.

864
02:04:39,189 --> 02:05:00,615
[SPEAKER_18]: They are not probably anything that is going to be terribly surprising to those who have followed the sort of economic evolutions of the pandemic, but the combination of decreasing revenue streams, some unfortunate timing that I can go into a little bit more detail about for those who have questions about the charter school reimbursement formula.

865
02:05:01,143 --> 02:05:03,445
[SPEAKER_18]: and what that means for Medford.

866
02:05:03,905 --> 02:05:07,108
[SPEAKER_18]: The third bullet point about steadily increasing fixed costs.

867
02:05:07,168 --> 02:05:21,899
[SPEAKER_18]: This is again, something that every district deals with on a year to year basis where they're even before we get into any types of funding or developing additional priorities, there are some fixed costs that increase and grow over time.

868
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:27,384
[SPEAKER_18]: The chapter 70 projections, there's a very slight editorial there, we're calling it stagnating.

869
02:05:28,228 --> 02:05:36,614
[SPEAKER_18]: projected so far $130,000 increase in chapter 70, but that's far outpaced by the increase in fixed costs alluded to above.

870
02:05:37,534 --> 02:05:49,062
[SPEAKER_18]: And those aren't final numbers yet, either the state, as we go back to the first slide, the three lanes of the state, the local and the school department, the state is in the early stages of developing its budgetary process.

871
02:05:49,122 --> 02:05:54,086
[SPEAKER_18]: And that ultimately will determine several variables on which we will build our budget.

872
02:05:55,514 --> 02:05:58,876
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a number of the ongoing fiscal challenges.

873
02:05:58,916 --> 02:06:03,618
[SPEAKER_18]: So that being said, there's a number of actions and initiatives that are already underway.

874
02:06:04,398 --> 02:06:16,884
[SPEAKER_18]: The school administration has established a process of meeting with our counterparts on the city side to discuss all the various challenges and pressure points.

875
02:06:16,924 --> 02:06:19,345
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're meeting on a weekly or biweekly

876
02:06:19,899 --> 02:06:20,339
[SPEAKER_18]: basis.

877
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:37,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we are in the process of beginning our internal meetings on a department by department basis to, um, examine, uh, different priorities and goals of each departments and how those fit together in anticipation of presentations before, uh, the school committee and the personnel and budget subcommittee.

878
02:06:37,114 --> 02:06:46,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, we are also as we, as we need to, uh, on a year to year basis, looking at, um, all of our, all of the various personnel options that are in front of us.

879
02:06:47,188 --> 02:06:56,811
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a fairly common refrain when we talk about school budgets to ask why we always talking about the implications for personnel and for the people that help run the school department.

880
02:06:57,451 --> 02:07:05,954
[SPEAKER_18]: And the simple answer to that is that school departments are primarily, the funding is primarily imposed toward personnel, that there isn't a lot of other things that we pay for.

881
02:07:06,494 --> 02:07:13,737
[SPEAKER_18]: School districts are, their organizations are by their nature, people populated organizations, and that's where most of,

882
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:18,263
[SPEAKER_18]: operating budget for a school system goes toward.

883
02:07:18,663 --> 02:07:30,932
[SPEAKER_18]: And then making sure that we have clear fiscal priorities and an understanding of where we are from a capacity perspective prior to engaging in any of the collective bargaining negotiations that we know are upcoming.

884
02:07:31,012 --> 02:07:43,000
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are the pieces that, that's what we're doing both in terms of looking optimistically, but also realistically about what we're moving toward.

885
02:07:43,624 --> 02:07:52,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, we'll talk a little bit later on about some of those external funds and some of the additional capacity that that can potentially afford us coming from federal and state injections.

886
02:07:53,291 --> 02:08:13,065
[SPEAKER_18]: But in terms of a timeline, what members of the committee and community can anticipate is that we'll continue with our internal meetings and developing priorities and being responsive to the agenda that's been set forth by the school committee, moving toward the more public vetting process in the months of March and April after some of those

887
02:08:13,766 --> 02:08:20,369
[SPEAKER_18]: variables that are coming down from the state begin to become a little more readily apparent.

888
02:08:21,349 --> 02:08:26,011
[SPEAKER_18]: There are budget hearings that are required by statute that will take place later in the spring.

889
02:08:26,691 --> 02:08:39,556
[SPEAKER_18]: And ultimately, the process will play out with a funding request that will go from the school committee to the municipal government, and then ultimately an appropriation that will be made at the end of this fiscal year for purposes of adoption for fiscal year 22.

890
02:08:39,596 --> 02:08:39,796
[SPEAKER_18]: So again,

891
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:54,485
[SPEAKER_18]: I go through that as quickly as I have because it is the first of many conversations we'll have over the coming weeks and months as these priorities are developed and as the budget process unfolds.

892
02:08:55,506 --> 02:08:58,867
[SPEAKER_18]: But happy to answer any questions that anyone has now.

893
02:08:59,728 --> 02:09:11,253
[SPEAKER_18]: And also if the feedback that I'm anticipating about simplifying the flowchart is something certainly that we can take a look at and make sure that it is something that is easily digestible

894
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:20,060
[SPEAKER_18]: members of the community who want to understand where we are in a step-by-step basis with regard to the fiscal year 22 school budget.

895
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:23,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

896
02:09:24,401 --> 02:09:26,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau, the member Kreatz.

897
02:09:27,861 --> 02:09:28,582
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

898
02:09:28,702 --> 02:09:32,923
[SPEAKER_20]: I really appreciate it, especially the slides explaining where the funding comes from.

899
02:09:32,963 --> 02:09:38,464
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought that was, I hope that's the start of every single fiscal, every single budget

900
02:09:40,273 --> 02:09:53,237
[SPEAKER_20]: process each year should include those, because frankly, for us, it's nice to have that refresher, but I think the public in general really cannot comprehend how insanely complicated public school funding is.

901
02:09:54,018 --> 02:09:58,879
[SPEAKER_20]: Frankly, it's offensively complicated and on purpose, but that's a different conversation.

902
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:02,460
[SPEAKER_20]: I do feel like the flow chart is missing a step zero.

903
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:05,641
[SPEAKER_20]: That flow chart implies that City Hall is not involved.

904
02:10:06,882 --> 02:10:09,463
[SPEAKER_20]: And I find that part to be a bit

905
02:10:11,417 --> 02:10:19,539
[SPEAKER_20]: dishonest, frankly, not you personally, but last year we went into our budget where we were told we were not given a number.

906
02:10:20,799 --> 02:10:25,620
[SPEAKER_20]: And then several meetings later, it came out, of course we were given a number.

907
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:29,741
[SPEAKER_20]: We're always given a number from city hall long before school committee is involved.

908
02:10:30,261 --> 02:10:35,922
[SPEAKER_20]: And that flowchart implies that school committee has some control over how much money we are going to spend.

909
02:10:36,483 --> 02:10:38,503
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is patently not true.

910
02:10:39,687 --> 02:10:49,111
[SPEAKER_20]: The number of emails I get and every member gets where we are talked to and add by the public that we should be able to figure out how to get more money.

911
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:52,712
[SPEAKER_20]: They're talking to the wrong people.

912
02:10:53,072 --> 02:11:04,936
[SPEAKER_20]: The process is almost exactly correct in that flow chart, except for the part, there's a missing a step zero, which is where the executive branch of the city tells the school department what they will get.

913
02:11:06,357 --> 02:11:07,257
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the process.

914
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,521
[SPEAKER_20]: We got exactly $0 more.

915
02:11:11,381 --> 02:11:22,143
[SPEAKER_20]: The seven members of the school committee certainly had interest in spending more than $0, more than the number that arrived on the doorstep of the superintendent's office, I presume.

916
02:11:22,984 --> 02:11:24,784
[SPEAKER_20]: I just feel like that that step is missing.

917
02:11:25,184 --> 02:11:29,105
[SPEAKER_20]: The public continues to believe that the school committee decides on what our budget is.

918
02:11:29,535 --> 02:11:30,895
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's just not true.

919
02:11:31,435 --> 02:11:39,737
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's critical, you know, in step one, you had the departments getting together and talking and doing their work, and that's all happening.

920
02:11:39,757 --> 02:11:42,498
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't for a second, that's not true.

921
02:11:43,358 --> 02:11:46,479
[SPEAKER_20]: You're all doing that based on something that you've been told already.

922
02:11:48,319 --> 02:11:56,121
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, if special ed comes in and says, we need 12% more this year because of the pandemic,

923
02:11:57,855 --> 02:12:16,318
[SPEAKER_20]: they can go and sit in their room and talk about the fact that they need 12% more, and that's never gonna show up at school committee because the mayor's office, and I don't mean that the mayor doesn't wanna give us more money, by the way, that is not what I'm saying, but the mayor's office and the finance department there has made it clear what we're getting.

924
02:12:17,919 --> 02:12:21,359
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was explicitly said in a meeting yesterday.

925
02:12:21,699 --> 02:12:21,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

926
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,600
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I mean, the other thing I would say is that

927
02:12:26,059 --> 02:12:31,485
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't want to speak for the mayor or anyone on her team, but that is my experience.

928
02:12:31,525 --> 02:12:39,094
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've certainly the experience that you're talking about of City Hall, sending over a number in the school department, just being told to deal with it is an experience I know very well.

929
02:12:39,895 --> 02:12:44,640
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know it from various walks of life, including having been a member of a school committee.

930
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,083
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's your, your, uh,

931
02:12:48,232 --> 02:12:50,934
[SPEAKER_18]: You're speaking about a story that I know really well.

932
02:12:51,334 --> 02:12:56,457
[SPEAKER_18]: My experience, I can tell you, has been a very collaborative one thus far.

933
02:12:56,977 --> 02:13:11,266
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it may not be specifically on that slide, but as it was referenced in the presentation, we have set up a process by which there is continuous communication between the city hall staff and the school administration.

934
02:13:11,326 --> 02:13:14,968
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, myself and Comptroller Miss Kingdon

935
02:13:15,429 --> 02:13:20,571
[SPEAKER_18]: have, you know, we, we speak to the city's CFO, you know, multiple times a week anyway.

936
02:13:21,191 --> 02:13:29,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but we, we now have sort of a standing appointment to work through these numbers and talk about what the needs are and what we're seeing.

937
02:13:29,675 --> 02:13:42,820
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that it's also true that all of us are starting the conversation, understanding that there are some systemic challenges that are at the state level and at the local level that are

938
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:48,925
[SPEAKER_18]: putting us in a position where we're gonna have to navigate what is most likely to be a challenging budgetary terrain.

939
02:13:49,445 --> 02:13:57,092
[SPEAKER_18]: But I can tell you there has not been thus far a message where we've just been told, here's the number, you gotta deal with it.

940
02:13:57,172 --> 02:13:59,053
[SPEAKER_18]: That is not what's occurred thus far.

941
02:13:59,213 --> 02:14:01,475
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a ongoing dialogue.

942
02:14:01,495 --> 02:14:03,257
[SPEAKER_18]: We're meeting on a regular basis.

943
02:14:04,478 --> 02:14:10,723
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think what we're doing more than anything else is waiting to determine what some of the

944
02:14:11,379 --> 02:14:19,203
[SPEAKER_18]: to wait for some of those variables that are controlled at the state level to clarify so that we can have a sense as to how we are going to navigate.

945
02:14:19,243 --> 02:14:21,324
[SPEAKER_18]: We know we're going to navigate a difficult budgetary terrain.

946
02:14:21,344 --> 02:14:24,426
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is how are we going to do that and to what extent we have to do that.

947
02:14:24,486 --> 02:14:29,168
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what I can just tell you based on the initial stages of this budget process.

948
02:14:30,069 --> 02:14:30,469
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

949
02:14:30,909 --> 02:14:37,933
[SPEAKER_20]: I just think there needs to be a way in that flow chart to make it clear that before the school committee is even really doing our work,

950
02:14:40,026 --> 02:14:43,707
[SPEAKER_20]: are we've already been nailed to the floor of what we're gonna get to spend.

951
02:14:44,967 --> 02:14:59,592
[SPEAKER_20]: We went through months of process last year, we got exactly $0 more for hundreds of hours of labor that we all wanted to do and we all thought it was important, but we got $0 more.

952
02:14:59,692 --> 02:15:04,593
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that that needs to somehow be reflected in this flowchart that the public

953
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:32,759
[SPEAKER_20]: overwhelmingly is convinced the school committee decides on how big our budget is and that cannot stand as we're going to go into another year where we're not going to have enough money for our kids and we're going to get the phone calls and and yeah well it's i just would say that from a historical perspective i do think that's something that school committees have grappled with that as a non-revenue generating governmental entity it's true that you can't

954
02:15:33,372 --> 02:15:45,740
[SPEAKER_18]: just establish your own budget and to whatever degree we can help clarify that and make sure that people understand where in the process the school committee sort of comes in and what function you're playing.

955
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:54,506
[SPEAKER_18]: I certainly think that's something that we can provide information on and again, adjust this deck and others to make that, if that's helpful to provide that clarity.

956
02:15:54,526 --> 02:15:55,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

957
02:15:59,369 --> 02:16:00,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

958
02:16:04,033 --> 02:16:06,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just I wanted to say thank you for the presentation.

959
02:16:06,494 --> 02:16:18,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, um, you know, for the I did feel that the word appropriation sort of does let us know that there's an amount that we're given that, you know, we need to work within for the superintendent's allocation.

960
02:16:18,797 --> 02:16:19,877
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think I agree.

961
02:16:19,897 --> 02:16:24,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I do agree with member Ruseau that that can be made more clear in terms of what

962
02:16:25,006 --> 02:16:27,248
[SPEAKER_09]: an allocation is and or where it comes from.

963
02:16:27,308 --> 02:16:36,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also recommend in an in sort of a appendix, if you will, Dave, any acronyms or, you know, anything that sort of needs to be spelled out like

964
02:16:40,918 --> 02:17:01,838
[SPEAKER_09]: know I think it was earlier I dismissed it was um maybe a you know link to title one title four Perkins grant that kind of thing just an appendix I would really be helpful this is real I found this really helpful and I appreciate you doing this I definitely think there's some work on the flow chart but I'm more than happy to um to give some suggestions if you'd like but um I appreciate the effort and

965
02:17:02,618 --> 02:17:03,938
[SPEAKER_09]: for folks to be able to be seeing.

966
02:17:03,978 --> 02:17:15,760
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's going to be even more helpful when we have numbers attached to the flow chart so that we can see, okay, this is the money and this is sort of how it's getting allocated and what we are working with and what the process is with that number.

967
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:20,941
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you again for the effort and look forward to helping out if I can.

968
02:17:21,801 --> 02:17:30,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I would just, I think I was going to say, as you were looking for the thing that was a little too obscure, I think there's more than one piece there that we need to

969
02:17:32,077 --> 02:17:36,539
[SPEAKER_18]: expand upon to make it more easily digestible for members of the community.

970
02:17:36,559 --> 02:17:50,026
[SPEAKER_18]: The goal would be to envision that flowchart as a clickable document where you click on that stage and it brings you to a greater explication of what exactly happens in that phase of the process.

971
02:17:50,526 --> 02:17:51,487
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be amazing.

972
02:17:51,807 --> 02:17:52,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

973
02:17:53,668 --> 02:17:54,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz?

974
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,461
[SPEAKER_02]: for the presentation Mr. Murphy.

975
02:17:58,142 --> 02:18:19,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question because I know in the past years we've had a schedule with a series of pre-budget meetings where the department heads and or principals present so that we we're all receiving a report with you know the different pre-budget information that we have in advance

976
02:18:20,643 --> 02:18:29,393
[SPEAKER_02]: As we work towards that June date, it's usually broken down gradually over a series of like seven or eight meetings.

977
02:18:29,994 --> 02:18:42,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the last two years it's been, they've been meetings, you know, committee of the whole meetings that were scheduled like the same day as a regular school committee meeting, and we would get

978
02:18:43,388 --> 02:18:45,850
[SPEAKER_02]: one or two reports during that meeting.

979
02:18:45,871 --> 02:18:54,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the public also is not really sure and sometimes didn't know that we were doing that.

980
02:18:54,799 --> 02:19:09,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have another meeting in June where we're just going over the final details, but we've already met many hours and over several meetings to discuss the pre-budget and go over any questions that individuals would have.

981
02:19:11,927 --> 02:19:12,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

982
02:19:12,327 --> 02:19:28,750
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think in this process, um, and, and whether I'll certainly defer to the committee as to whether it's a committee on the whole, I think the traditional way, and I think for various reasons, what I would recommend is that the personnel and budget subcommittee be the forum through which that process takes place.

983
02:19:28,770 --> 02:19:39,492
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've spoken with miss Stone about that, about, uh, making sure that that vehicle is used because, um, for depending on the, on the piece of the budget, there's going to be a, a,

984
02:19:40,523 --> 02:19:49,046
[SPEAKER_18]: more thorough, there's likely to be a need for a more thorough vetting and pulling apart.

985
02:19:49,146 --> 02:19:53,827
[SPEAKER_18]: And that will then most likely be reflected when it comes before the full committee.

986
02:19:53,887 --> 02:19:58,569
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I think more input is always better than less.

987
02:20:00,029 --> 02:20:02,750
[SPEAKER_18]: My recommendation would be that we utilize that subcommittee

988
02:20:03,364 --> 02:20:11,291
[SPEAKER_18]: as the place in which we sort of begin to bring the constituent parts of the budget before you, and you hear that testimony that you're referring to.

989
02:20:11,311 --> 02:20:28,305
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little early at this point for me to say how many of those meetings I think that there should be to map that out, because I think there are probably places that, even if you just look through the budget, there are some places that sort of, it's easier to sort of consolidate

990
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:33,021
[SPEAKER_18]: the conversation because the budgets are so intertwined with one another.

991
02:20:33,061 --> 02:20:39,623
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that could be seven or eight, it could be slightly fewer, it could be slightly more, but that would be my recommendation.

992
02:20:39,643 --> 02:20:48,905
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I think that would position us to have a good constructive and transparent dialogue as we get closer toward the budget.

993
02:20:49,325 --> 02:20:56,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, if you see on the flow chart, there's sort of two boxes that are a little bit bigger are in bold, and that's the superintendent's request to the municipal government.

994
02:20:56,547 --> 02:20:58,167
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the,

995
02:20:59,163 --> 02:21:03,246
[SPEAKER_18]: excuse me, the recommendation from the superintendent and then the request from the school committee to the municipal government.

996
02:21:03,287 --> 02:21:12,034
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think those are the two parts that we want to make sure that we've gone through the process and use those other forums to properly vet prior to getting to that stage.

997
02:21:12,054 --> 02:21:15,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

998
02:21:15,837 --> 02:21:18,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't see the presentation in the shared folder.

999
02:21:18,899 --> 02:21:21,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be able to email it to me separately?

1000
02:21:21,341 --> 02:21:27,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I can email it to everyone because it is definitely not in the shared folder, but it certainly can be after this meeting.

1001
02:21:29,408 --> 02:21:44,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, and then I guess as soon as you know the dates of those meetings, if you could send out a tentative date schedule, because that would be a lot of meetings that we have to include in our current calendars.

1002
02:21:45,202 --> 02:21:49,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and we'll be mindful and respectful of everyone's time to that end.

1003
02:21:50,567 --> 02:21:50,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

1004
02:21:52,989 --> 02:21:53,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1005
02:21:53,429 --> 02:21:53,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

1006
02:21:56,708 --> 02:22:08,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So the problem as I see it with putting this in a subcommittee is it limits the participation of the entire committee in the formation and the early decision making.

1007
02:22:09,071 --> 02:22:22,755
[SPEAKER_11]: So four members of this committee would not have a voice except to accept or object to whatever is presented really at the end of the process.

1008
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:30,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not what I think would make the most effective budget possible.

1009
02:22:30,403 --> 02:22:34,665
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would be an advocate for maintaining the committee of the whole structure.

1010
02:22:34,685 --> 02:22:48,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care who chairs the meetings, but I do think that school finance and how we fund our priorities is critically important for the entire committee to have a voice in.

1011
02:22:50,723 --> 02:22:58,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I also would love to see us pursue a better looking budget that is more understandable than we've ever provided before.

1012
02:22:58,647 --> 02:23:07,652
[SPEAKER_11]: The MASC held a session in the last month or so where they talked about budget preparation.

1013
02:23:07,672 --> 02:23:12,775
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the city did a wonderful job last year of improving the budget

1014
02:23:13,496 --> 02:23:21,361
[SPEAKER_11]: the clarity and the transparency of the budget itself so that the community could understand what was happening.

1015
02:23:22,121 --> 02:23:24,843
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we should be trying to do the same thing here in the district.

1016
02:23:24,903 --> 02:23:33,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to, I do think it's appropriate that the personnel and budget subcommittee talk about and lay out what the expectations for the ultimate document would look like.

1017
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:39,793
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't support putting all the work of this on three people

1018
02:23:40,853 --> 02:23:45,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that is how we bring our collective values and vision to life.

1019
02:23:47,241 --> 02:23:58,534
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a couple of other things that I will say is, last year, we asked a question of all the department heads about objectives.

1020
02:24:00,110 --> 02:24:04,153
[SPEAKER_11]: that are not in the current budget that would improve student outcomes.

1021
02:24:04,333 --> 02:24:07,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And that list was a really eye-opening and meaningful list.

1022
02:24:07,335 --> 02:24:10,797
[SPEAKER_11]: And my expectation is that that work will continue this year.

1023
02:24:12,518 --> 02:24:25,847
[SPEAKER_11]: But also one of the things that happened last year before your arrival, Mr. Murphy, is it was very difficult to look at the structure of what was being presented to us and know where the new stuff was.

1024
02:24:25,907 --> 02:24:27,728
[SPEAKER_11]: So some new stuff was listed in this

1025
02:24:28,388 --> 02:24:33,531
[SPEAKER_11]: list of like extra things that are not in the budget and then other new things were in the budget.

1026
02:24:34,132 --> 02:24:36,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was very difficult to figure out where they landed.

1027
02:24:37,053 --> 02:24:42,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we're going to take the approach of sort of looking at what level fund means,

1028
02:24:44,163 --> 02:24:58,066
[SPEAKER_11]: in one cut of the information that's provided to us, then I want that to truly reflect like base operations and not new headcount, new priorities, new objectives.

1029
02:24:58,166 --> 02:25:02,127
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and the example that comes to mind is like the middle school health teacher.

1030
02:25:02,747 --> 02:25:11,069
[SPEAKER_11]: So she was, she, he was listed in the budget as like a thing we were definitely going to do.

1031
02:25:11,489 --> 02:25:13,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we didn't do it at all.

1032
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:15,091
[SPEAKER_11]: That that I'm aware of.

1033
02:25:15,991 --> 02:25:21,934
[SPEAKER_11]: But it also wasn't on the list of sort of extra priorities and it was just sort of assumed that it would happen and it did not.

1034
02:25:22,554 --> 02:25:34,380
[SPEAKER_11]: So there, I think, where we talk about ads to the overall picture, I just wanted to be really clear what those choices are so that the committee can actually make those choices.

1035
02:25:35,661 --> 02:25:46,400
[SPEAKER_11]: versus be confused by what's in, what's not in, what are we saying is part of what we're gonna do next year, what are we hoping, et cetera, et cetera.

1036
02:25:46,460 --> 02:25:47,743
[SPEAKER_11]: It just needs to be really clear.

1037
02:25:49,768 --> 02:26:11,659
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that I would say about the work that we did last year is that the pandemic certainly got in the way of the timeline, but I would like a clear understanding of when the number comes from the mayor's office so that we can be clear about at what point in the discussion are we no longer talking about theoretical numbers?

1038
02:26:11,719 --> 02:26:14,281
[SPEAKER_11]: And at what point in the discussion are we talking about the real number?

1039
02:26:14,841 --> 02:26:17,082
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're being asked to deal with.

1040
02:26:17,542 --> 02:26:20,423
[SPEAKER_11]: That was not made clear to us until very late in the game.

1041
02:26:20,823 --> 02:26:25,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying that the finance office didn't know that number, but it was not made clear to this committee.

1042
02:26:25,965 --> 02:26:32,908
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, we are the ones that are asked questions that are expected to sort of shepherd this district in a direction.

1043
02:26:32,968 --> 02:26:36,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can't do that without all the information available to us.

1044
02:26:36,909 --> 02:26:39,570
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's going to be a cut, we need to own the cut.

1045
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:41,810
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to describe why the cut.

1046
02:26:42,290 --> 02:26:45,931
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that's work that this committee can do without input from the city.

1047
02:26:46,091 --> 02:26:57,334
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm very concerned about the information that we are hearing already from all sources, including from our city, about what this budget is going to look like.

1048
02:26:58,174 --> 02:27:06,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like we have to find a way to discuss what we really need to recover next year.

1049
02:27:07,076 --> 02:27:27,389
[SPEAKER_11]: and how we go about making sure that our kids don't become an entire generation of students that get left behind, not just because of COVID, but because we didn't do the right things to prioritize the funding that was necessary to help mitigate against all the impacts of these last few years and really into

1050
02:27:28,115 --> 02:27:30,076
[SPEAKER_11]: know into next year and into the year after.

1051
02:27:30,216 --> 02:27:34,657
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're talking about an entire generation of kids and it's really important work.

1052
02:27:34,737 --> 02:27:48,702
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am hopeful that our spending will align with what we say our values are and our city you know certainly clearly values the contributions of Medford Public Schools and I hope that we can

1053
02:27:50,903 --> 02:27:53,925
[SPEAKER_11]: present a budget that is reflective of those priorities.

1054
02:27:54,505 --> 02:27:57,426
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we need to be crystal clear about when the number comes.

1055
02:27:57,586 --> 02:27:59,928
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to be really transparent about what it means.

1056
02:28:00,568 --> 02:28:05,911
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to be clear with the community about who has the power to change what.

1057
02:28:06,831 --> 02:28:15,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And this committee, we can only decide how to spend the money and how to make the cuts or how to spend the extra money.

1058
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:18,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are sort of the latitudes of this committee.

1059
02:28:21,313 --> 02:28:33,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And having said that, it's our responsibility to hold the people around us that have the other responsibilities that lead up to this accountable for a transparent message on the budget.

1060
02:28:34,363 --> 02:28:47,333
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that our constituents are just super clear about where we are at and so that they can all make decisions about how that impacts their participation in Medford Public Schools.

1061
02:28:47,373 --> 02:28:50,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think there are scenarios that could

1062
02:28:50,662 --> 02:28:57,707
[SPEAKER_11]: land people in that position where they say, I need to evaluate my participation here if this is how we're going to spend.

1063
02:28:57,807 --> 02:29:02,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know we're hearing doom and gloom from lots of places.

1064
02:29:02,490 --> 02:29:07,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I also know that the state's revenue blew the doors off its projections for January.

1065
02:29:08,014 --> 02:29:17,621
[SPEAKER_11]: So perhaps there's some better news coming, but either way, I want us to proceed with an open dialogue and transparency

1066
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:25,467
[SPEAKER_11]: around what the funding is, what decisions will be made, and how that helps us align our priorities or doesn't.

1067
02:29:27,369 --> 02:29:28,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Graham.

1068
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:37,699
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, as soon as we heard about Chapter 70 from the governor's budget a week or two ago,

1069
02:29:38,499 --> 02:29:44,006
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as we heard about the cut of almost a million dollars in the charter school reimbursement.

1070
02:29:44,667 --> 02:29:54,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I made sure it's when I talked to my finance our finance team that we let the city council on the school committee know right away so that's why you did get the email on.

1071
02:29:56,032 --> 02:30:05,021
[SPEAKER_08]: the tough news and along the lines of the federal stimulus for the good news of the Medford public schools, thankfully getting a little bit over $2 million.

1072
02:30:05,822 --> 02:30:14,871
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that, brings us down to about 1.2 in addition, when you subtract and add

1073
02:30:16,276 --> 02:30:21,057
[SPEAKER_08]: it's Chapter 70, charter school tuition, and then federal stimulus four.

1074
02:30:21,718 --> 02:30:33,501
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happened last year, usually in a normal budget cycle, we would know the number to give the school sometime in March, and then the budget would be created and budget hearings would start right away.

1075
02:30:34,161 --> 02:30:44,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, we were so up in the air on every state number, UGA, Chapter 70, charter school reimbursement, we were having

1076
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:54,043
[SPEAKER_08]: meetings with the lieutenant governor and the governor and the schools was having meetings with Desi and our finance team was having meetings with finance professionals.

1077
02:30:54,543 --> 02:31:00,286
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were telling us the gloom potential 10, 20% cut and on a number of directions.

1078
02:31:00,366 --> 02:31:02,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was really hard.

1079
02:31:02,866 --> 02:31:11,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And we knew right up until the end, we didn't know about chapter 70 being held harmless until I think one of the last weeks.

1080
02:31:13,857 --> 02:31:19,822
[SPEAKER_08]: because it was the pandemic and because we're in a recession, we didn't have that number to really give the schools.

1081
02:31:19,862 --> 02:31:30,570
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew we had to level fund, but that was after the prior finance director already had increased the budget without permission from the city side by almost 5%.

1082
02:31:31,531 --> 02:31:36,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So we level funded the school side and we cut almost a million dollars from the city budget.

1083
02:31:37,135 --> 02:31:41,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully, chapter 70 was held harmless and we were able to add to the school side.

1084
02:31:42,105 --> 02:31:45,190
[SPEAKER_08]: This year I am trying to be as transparent as possible.

1085
02:31:45,210 --> 02:31:47,333
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why you got the email from us last week.

1086
02:31:47,934 --> 02:31:54,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll get an update from the city's finance director who's going to come to hopefully our February 22.

1087
02:31:56,048 --> 02:32:07,170
[SPEAKER_08]: school committee meeting to present on revenues and losses thereof in hopes that we can do the best to give the school side a number sometime after that.

1088
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:09,250
[SPEAKER_08]: But everything is ever changing.

1089
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:20,972
[SPEAKER_08]: We're praying for Biden, President Biden's next stimulus package, which could help the city and of course the school side because we, city does not want to take from the schools.

1090
02:32:21,012 --> 02:32:24,913
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we level funded the schools and cut the city side last year.

1091
02:32:25,333 --> 02:32:30,514
[SPEAKER_08]: last year's budget was 52% of that budget plus went to the school side.

1092
02:32:30,654 --> 02:32:46,257
[SPEAKER_08]: We are doing everything we can in the toughest of times and we will continue to be transparent and we will continue to do whatever we can to get more money for our schools and that includes me advocating on the state and federal level and I will continue to do so as I know you all will.

1093
02:32:47,337 --> 02:32:52,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to make that clear because I appreciate the

1094
02:32:53,198 --> 02:32:59,620
[SPEAKER_08]: City side budget and that most people thought that was great and I agree that school side.

1095
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:05,322
[SPEAKER_08]: We have work we have some work to do, but we're going to get there and just want to clear up a few things.

1096
02:33:05,842 --> 02:33:07,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else has any questions.

1097
02:33:10,635 --> 02:33:12,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I just had one follow up question.

1098
02:33:12,417 --> 02:33:14,079
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, I did.

1099
02:33:14,219 --> 02:33:24,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard from Miss Graham and, um, you know, I've been thinking about it and, you know, I do have some concerns myself about only having a pre budget meetings and subcommittee.

1100
02:33:24,171 --> 02:33:31,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I think that, you know, my fellow committee members who are not in the subcommittee won't

1101
02:33:32,053 --> 02:33:34,516
[SPEAKER_02]: be updated on the pre-budget materials.

1102
02:33:34,956 --> 02:33:52,293
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just like to know a little bit more information about how that's going to work so that the other committee members who are not in the subcommittee are going to be voicing their questions and concerns with those pre-budget reports.

1103
02:33:53,054 --> 02:33:59,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what I can kind of, I'm just seeing in my head is that, we're gonna have the subcommittee meetings.

1104
02:33:59,938 --> 02:34:02,679
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be talking about all those pre-budget reports.

1105
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:06,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're gonna be approving those to go to the regular meeting.

1106
02:34:07,002 --> 02:34:14,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's when the other committee members are gonna get those reports to then ask questions.

1107
02:34:15,506 --> 02:34:20,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, I think that's why in the past, we've always done it as a committee of the whole.

1108
02:34:20,749 --> 02:34:29,216
[SPEAKER_02]: so that everybody's included in the meeting at the same time while that administrator in principle is there doing that presentation.

1109
02:34:29,236 --> 02:34:33,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's been any discussion about that, Mr. Murphy.

1110
02:34:33,819 --> 02:34:34,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1111
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:34,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Ms.

1112
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:35,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Kress.

1113
02:34:35,521 --> 02:34:45,088
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I may have, I probably maybe should have articulated a little more fully what I meant by the personnel and budget subcommittee.

1114
02:34:45,954 --> 02:34:53,679
[SPEAKER_18]: all committee members will receive the same information regardless of what subcommittee assignments, what the subcommittee assignments are.

1115
02:34:53,759 --> 02:35:04,085
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, in my experience, the members, even if they're not officially members of the personnel and budget subcommittee would participate.

1116
02:35:04,125 --> 02:35:09,849
[SPEAKER_18]: And I guess that is at the discretion of the chair, but so Ms.

1117
02:35:09,869 --> 02:35:13,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Stone can speak to that, but certainly the norm would be

1118
02:35:14,362 --> 02:35:20,407
[SPEAKER_18]: for this process to involve both members of the subcommittee and non-members of the subcommittee.

1119
02:35:20,868 --> 02:35:40,866
[SPEAKER_18]: But I would also say that given the implications of what you're actually approving and that you're all gonna get the same information and there's gonna be no picking and choosing between subcommittees as to who actually sees what materials, I wouldn't necessarily, it wouldn't have been my assumption that the personnel and budget subcommittee would be

1120
02:35:41,886 --> 02:35:47,609
[SPEAKER_18]: taking votes that would then preclude the school committee from either seeing or considering anything.

1121
02:35:48,170 --> 02:35:55,574
[SPEAKER_18]: The subcommittee would just be used as the forum to discuss and vet what it is that the administration is presenting.

1122
02:35:55,934 --> 02:36:05,900
[SPEAKER_18]: That, in my experience, is the point of having the budget subcommittee, to have that as a forum during the budget process to sift through that information.

1123
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:10,623
[SPEAKER_18]: But the actual sort of raw information, if you will, would be

1124
02:36:11,322 --> 02:36:24,069
[SPEAKER_18]: available both, would both be provided by the administration to the school committee as a whole, and would also, you know, I assume there would be participation, but if that was presumptuous on my part, I apologize.

1125
02:36:24,709 --> 02:36:28,712
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the role I've ever, I've only seen the budget subcommittee play, but.

1126
02:36:34,355 --> 02:36:35,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1127
02:36:36,556 --> 02:36:37,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Mustone?

1128
02:36:37,857 --> 02:36:38,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1129
02:36:40,024 --> 02:36:42,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the chair of the personnel and budget committee.

1130
02:36:42,965 --> 02:36:48,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think my understanding was that the personnel and budget committee would come up with the dates.

1131
02:36:48,808 --> 02:36:53,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think because in recent past practice, it has been committee of the holes.

1132
02:36:54,170 --> 02:37:16,435
[SPEAKER_07]: that probably this year they should be committee of the wholes we would just set the date and the plan on the personnel and budget committee and then moving forward if that's more of how school committees um generally do it it's it's just past practice here that it's been committee of the whole so i think for this year for people to understand the process it would be the personnel and budget committee just to set

1133
02:37:17,295 --> 02:37:21,759
[SPEAKER_07]: who we're hearing on what days, and then have committee of the wholes for all the sessions.

1134
02:37:22,219 --> 02:37:30,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And then next year, talk about having a different budget process that's more streamlined and more community focused.

1135
02:37:30,466 --> 02:37:33,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy to hear how other districts do it.

1136
02:37:33,889 --> 02:37:38,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I think just in my experience for the last five years, or four years, this is how we've done it.

1137
02:37:38,834 --> 02:37:41,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that's a compromise that we can work with this year.

1138
02:37:42,157 --> 02:37:42,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1139
02:37:43,298 --> 02:37:44,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Mustone.

1140
02:37:44,499 --> 02:37:44,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

1141
02:37:45,964 --> 02:37:47,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy, for the presentation.

1142
02:37:47,446 --> 02:37:49,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Van der Kloot?

1143
02:37:50,389 --> 02:38:02,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to let my fellow committee members know that both the mayor and I, the superintendent, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Cushing, were

1144
02:38:03,003 --> 02:38:03,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've got everybody.

1145
02:38:03,983 --> 02:38:06,924
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in attendance at the request of Pat Jalen.

1146
02:38:07,424 --> 02:38:10,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I was invited as vice chair to represent the committee.

1147
02:38:12,186 --> 02:38:29,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And Pat had set up, excuse me, Senator Jalen had set up a Zoom call with DESE, their finance people to talk about the impact of the charter school tuitions on our budget, which is extreme.

1148
02:38:29,831 --> 02:38:31,231
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor alluded to the

1149
02:38:31,751 --> 02:38:32,832
[SPEAKER_10]: approximately $1 million.

1150
02:38:33,432 --> 02:38:39,337
[SPEAKER_10]: In truth, it becomes even more than that, closer to a million and a quarter when something else is factored in.

1151
02:38:40,958 --> 02:38:44,921
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very clear that the people we were talking about were budget people.

1152
02:38:45,041 --> 02:38:48,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It's their job to simply implement the formula and not to do anything about it.

1153
02:38:51,406 --> 02:38:58,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Our entire delegation was there, Senator Jayland, Representatives Donato, Garbley, and Barber.

1154
02:39:00,892 --> 02:39:12,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul Donato spoke to the fact that last year, we also sort of fell into this little pit where our funding was lower and they had put together some legislation.

1155
02:39:13,919 --> 02:39:23,404
[SPEAKER_10]: When we spoke, and I was quite adamant about the impact of how starting with a million and a quarter blow,

1156
02:39:24,777 --> 02:39:26,558
[SPEAKER_10]: in our funding would impact us.

1157
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:33,264
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some discussion about what the legislators have to do to try and help us with this issue.

1158
02:39:34,323 --> 02:39:38,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, though, the reality of it is, is the way the funding formula works.

1159
02:39:39,006 --> 02:39:40,287
[SPEAKER_10]: We really get sucker punched.

1160
02:39:41,148 --> 02:39:50,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And our delegation is totally aware and totally desirous of being helpful.

1161
02:39:50,874 --> 02:39:55,477
[SPEAKER_10]: It may be advantageous for us to invite them to a committee meeting at some point.

1162
02:39:56,818 --> 02:40:02,522
[SPEAKER_10]: with a follow-up and talk about what other options, what can we do?

1163
02:40:02,922 --> 02:40:05,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Because right now, I mean, you know, it's a real issue.

1164
02:40:08,827 --> 02:40:09,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

1165
02:40:13,510 --> 02:40:20,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Number seven, we have report on scheduled listening sessions for families on the topic of school reopening fall 2021.

1166
02:40:21,116 --> 02:40:23,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Secondary and

1167
02:40:25,749 --> 02:40:25,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1168
02:40:25,969 --> 02:40:28,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Suzanne Galusi, assistant superintendent of elementary.

1169
02:40:28,531 --> 02:40:31,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Madam Mayor.

1170
02:40:31,513 --> 02:40:31,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1171
02:40:32,173 --> 02:40:35,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And members of the school committee, appreciate this opportunity to speak to you.

1172
02:40:36,196 --> 02:40:44,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to give the committee a brief update on our initial plans to welcome family feedback.

1173
02:40:45,262 --> 02:40:47,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me one second here.

1174
02:40:48,464 --> 02:40:52,607
[SPEAKER_03]: As we enter our planning for the upcoming year.

1175
02:40:52,687 --> 02:40:54,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we wanna do is we wanna

1176
02:40:54,593 --> 02:41:03,226
[SPEAKER_03]: create a space to listen to feedback from our remote students, our hybrid students, our caregivers, as well as our faculty and staff.

1177
02:41:04,440 --> 02:41:12,222
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to provide them this opportunity to share their experiences from the broad spectrum of what people have experienced this year.

1178
02:41:12,242 --> 02:41:16,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Feedback will help us to guide contingency plannings.

1179
02:41:16,743 --> 02:41:19,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that everyone is clear on that word.

1180
02:41:19,283 --> 02:41:22,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's contingency plans as we head into next year.

1181
02:41:23,564 --> 02:41:28,805
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of uncertainty as the state headed into the summer.

1182
02:41:29,725 --> 02:41:35,327
[SPEAKER_03]: and the initial DESI plan was provided to districts on June 25th.

1183
02:41:35,847 --> 02:41:41,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we want to make sure that we're well ahead in any contingency planning for the upcoming year.

1184
02:41:42,629 --> 02:41:48,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Each listening session will have two breakout rooms, one focused for hybrid learning and one focused for remote learning.

1185
02:41:50,151 --> 02:41:56,293
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have translators available in the following languages, Portuguese, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic,

1186
02:41:57,127 --> 02:42:00,310
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll also have closed captions available for anyone on the call.

1187
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:11,017
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been providing closed captioning for the last several meetings, so all you have to do is click the CC live transcript at the bottom of your screen if it doesn't automatically pop up for you.

1188
02:42:12,178 --> 02:42:23,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, if you're unable to attend the listening sessions, we're going to be soliciting feedback at our email address, info at medford.k12.ma.us.

1189
02:42:24,006 --> 02:42:26,148
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to really provide people

1190
02:42:26,622 --> 02:42:32,992
[SPEAKER_03]: an opportunity to provide their open-ended feedback and to really be able to give that.

1191
02:42:33,232 --> 02:42:40,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to turn it over to the assistant superintendent for elementary education, Suzanne Galussi, as we move to the next slide.

1192
02:42:42,745 --> 02:42:43,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1193
02:42:43,926 --> 02:42:58,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So as Dr. Cushing was saying, we're going to have two breakout rooms, one so we can get the feedback for the experience of the hybrid learning model and the other for the remote learning model, but what we're also doing is creating spaces at each level.

1194
02:42:59,457 --> 02:43:04,298
[SPEAKER_04]: to listen to the feedback and to people's personal experiences.

1195
02:43:04,858 --> 02:43:10,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the elementary level, we have the listening sessions from March 4th.

1196
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:13,961
[SPEAKER_04]: At each level, we're gonna begin with students.

1197
02:43:14,181 --> 02:43:27,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna provide an opportunity for students to join and provide their feedback and their experiences, as well as maybe their hopes and wishes for next year, followed by a session for faculty and staff.

1198
02:43:28,664 --> 02:43:30,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And then parents and caregivers.

1199
02:43:30,686 --> 02:43:43,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see we're doing this at all three levels, so that we can really target the listening and the feedback to people's unique experiences based on their level and their learning model.

1200
02:43:46,643 --> 02:43:56,028
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any questions for us, we are happy to answer them, but we are, this is really just like the beginning phase here of our planning work for next year.

1201
02:43:56,108 --> 02:44:04,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing we wanna do is really just listen, listen to people's feedback and input and use that to help guide our planning.

1202
02:44:05,874 --> 02:44:06,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1203
02:44:12,758 --> 02:44:13,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question.

1204
02:44:15,433 --> 02:44:16,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, member van de Kloot.

1205
02:44:16,974 --> 02:44:17,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1206
02:44:17,655 --> 02:44:25,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a role for the school committee in being able to attend any of the sessions or how is that envisioned?

1207
02:44:26,882 --> 02:44:32,587
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome to attend any and all of the sessions, regardless of time.

1208
02:44:32,607 --> 02:44:40,753
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to sit down on the students, the faculty and staff or the parents, I see it as an open invitation.

1209
02:44:44,018 --> 02:44:45,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, I also have a question.

1210
02:44:45,159 --> 02:44:49,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we could stop sharing the slide so we can see hands.

1211
02:44:55,043 --> 02:44:55,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

1212
02:44:57,365 --> 02:44:57,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1213
02:44:57,905 --> 02:45:01,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the presentation, Dr. Cushing and Ms.

1214
02:45:01,046 --> 02:45:01,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Galussi.

1215
02:45:02,387 --> 02:45:10,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I am wondering if there's going to be consideration specific to the Cohort A model because it's more than

1216
02:45:11,214 --> 02:45:16,097
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of a hybrid or remote situation.

1217
02:45:16,157 --> 02:45:21,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our most vulnerable students, as you know, and four days in person, one day remote.

1218
02:45:21,381 --> 02:45:27,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there gonna be any listening sessions specific to those populations?

1219
02:45:29,346 --> 02:45:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's absolutely something that we can plan for, I think.

1220
02:45:36,830 --> 02:45:48,077
[SPEAKER_04]: For the beginning stages here for the first three sessions that we have in March, I think having the opportunity for people to join, I understand what you're saying.

1221
02:45:48,137 --> 02:45:53,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do know that we have cohort A students in both learning models.

1222
02:45:53,801 --> 02:46:00,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would suggest for the beginning stages here that they probably should attend the breakout session in which the model they're currently in.

1223
02:46:01,026 --> 02:46:04,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they're in person, then I would, it would be the hybrid model.

1224
02:46:04,562 --> 02:46:07,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have cohort A students that are fully remote as well.

1225
02:46:09,006 --> 02:46:22,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I think providing the platform for people to be able to just provide their input and experiences on what this year was like for them is the crucial part that we really want to be able to hear.

1226
02:46:23,733 --> 02:46:24,654
[SPEAKER_04]: and to make note of.

1227
02:46:25,275 --> 02:46:34,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And if somebody wants any additional time, we have directed them to the email address, but I am more than willing to have personal phone calls with people as well.

1228
02:46:35,808 --> 02:46:40,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll look and see where we land with the listening sessions if we feel we need to add more.

1229
02:46:41,833 --> 02:46:50,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that I'd like to see more specifically because I think, again, the most vulnerable students have different sort of subset.

1230
02:46:50,176 --> 02:46:57,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And so instead of them having to attend necessarily two meetings, going to both, whether there's an individual meeting specific to that.

1231
02:46:57,719 --> 02:47:04,742
[SPEAKER_09]: So just a thought, food for thought, again, with the time constraints that our families have, as you can imagine, having to go to

1232
02:47:06,422 --> 02:47:23,098
[SPEAKER_09]: one general session and then one individualized session might be a little bit tricky, but I will defer to administration, but would love to be kept into the loop as to what you all decide that will be most meaningful for the most vulnerable cohort A population.

1233
02:47:23,198 --> 02:47:23,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1234
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:26,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member McLaughlin.

1235
02:47:27,722 --> 02:47:28,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edward-Vinson.

1236
02:47:29,539 --> 02:47:42,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say that in coming up with the nine sessions, that's an additional nine hours of meetings on top of the meetings that we have.

1237
02:47:43,144 --> 02:47:54,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I think about the most vulnerable and knowing that we have a significant amount of students where English is not their first language,

1238
02:47:56,071 --> 02:48:02,117
[SPEAKER_06]: where we did try to at least get the translation available for some of our English learner populations.

1239
02:48:02,838 --> 02:48:10,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I do feel that even within the breakout groups, if it's something we can go back to the drawing board,

1240
02:48:11,627 --> 02:48:18,470
[SPEAKER_06]: but I do feel providing an opportunity to listen, this is really an opportunity to listen.

1241
02:48:18,550 --> 02:48:30,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So even as a Cohort A member, if there's a specific thing that you want to be able to share, that opportunity is going to be made available.

1242
02:48:32,415 --> 02:48:35,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can try to go back, but I'm just saying that to the

1243
02:48:39,961 --> 02:48:51,020
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent is really to be able to listen to the feedback and we know that some people might not be able to attend the sessions that are available, but they will be able to

1244
02:48:52,289 --> 02:48:56,992
[SPEAKER_06]: email or send in questions or their own personal reflections.

1245
02:48:57,553 --> 02:49:08,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to say that this is not the intent or the spirit was not to exclude anyone, but to give everyone an opportunity.

1246
02:49:09,700 --> 02:49:15,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one of the areas that we've gotten a lot of feedback is

1247
02:49:18,425 --> 02:49:29,673
[SPEAKER_06]: a significant amount of the communication that comes out from us, from myself personally, and talking about what's happening at the school is specifically geared toward hybrid students.

1248
02:49:30,354 --> 02:49:34,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of families that are fully remote

1249
02:49:34,797 --> 02:49:38,878
[SPEAKER_06]: feel like, are they really still considered part of the school?

1250
02:49:39,138 --> 02:49:42,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And by all means, the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1251
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:56,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And so by trying to separate out into two groups to have remote-only families give feedback and hybrid families providing feedback,

1252
02:49:57,302 --> 02:50:09,246
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to take that information from the two groups and really listen to the feedback that's being said so that we'll be able to help better inform us as we move forward.

1253
02:50:09,666 --> 02:50:22,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say that by no means was there any intention of trying to exclude Cohort A. We really wanted to include and be able to

1254
02:50:23,503 --> 02:50:32,168
[SPEAKER_06]: just listen to students, to staff, faculty, and parents and caregivers.

1255
02:50:33,189 --> 02:50:42,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that very much, Superintendent Edward-Vincent, and I know that your inclination is to be inclusive and kind, and I do appreciate that.

1256
02:50:42,634 --> 02:50:47,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I do also think that is why I'm raising the matter, because as we're thinking about

1257
02:50:48,528 --> 02:51:09,030
[SPEAKER_09]: different subgroups and, you know, cohorting, but, you know, according to hybrid and remote, and then further by middle school, elementary school, and high school, I think as a parent of a child with a significant disability, oftentimes being in those meetings, there's a lot of time that is spent talking about things that do not relate to my child.

1258
02:51:10,050 --> 02:51:12,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that there's a lot of times that parents have to sit in that.

1259
02:51:12,671 --> 02:51:29,938
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, you know, in instances where even when you said everyone is included, you know, also to ensure that our out of district families, our English learners and our students, families with disabilities do feel included, that there is some sort of forethought about how that's being addressed, I think is really important.

1260
02:51:29,978 --> 02:51:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: That's conscious in terms of the thought, because I do know that there are

1261
02:51:33,940 --> 02:51:47,087
[SPEAKER_09]: are families who have children with significant needs who would not go to, say, a two-hour, if you will, meeting of a listening session for elementary school if they're in a very different place.

1262
02:51:47,147 --> 02:51:53,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And so maybe there's just the opportunity to offer something that is smaller and more appropriate for that cohort.

1263
02:51:53,911 --> 02:51:57,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I, again, in the interest of inclusion, that is why I'm bringing that up.

1264
02:51:57,413 --> 02:52:00,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate the fact that you are always willing to listen.

1265
02:52:00,955 --> 02:52:01,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1266
02:52:02,249 --> 02:52:03,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member McLaughlin.

1267
02:52:03,990 --> 02:52:08,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we could, I know you said you'd be doing breakout rooms.

1268
02:52:08,111 --> 02:52:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe during these times and dates, we can do a breakout room just for cohort A, but still be parents and caregivers as well as faculty, staff and students.

1269
02:52:20,815 --> 02:52:22,515
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can kind of compromise that way.

1270
02:52:22,535 --> 02:52:28,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's have Joan and her team run the breakout room for cohort A. I will definitely.

1271
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:34,741
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get everyone.

1272
02:52:39,364 --> 02:52:42,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll work with the team to see how we can do it to have it.

1273
02:52:43,167 --> 02:52:52,394
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll keep the same structure and create an additional breakout room.

1274
02:52:52,694 --> 02:52:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1275
02:52:53,495 --> 02:52:53,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

1276
02:53:00,353 --> 02:53:02,094
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say thank you for this.

1277
02:53:02,334 --> 02:53:14,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it will mean a lot to all the families in the district who have struggled through this year and last year in one way or another to have an audience and an option.

1278
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:17,521
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's a tremendous amount of work to put these things together.

1279
02:53:17,601 --> 02:53:19,942
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to offer my assistance.

1280
02:53:20,602 --> 02:53:26,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to facilitate, take notes, or do anything else that you all

1281
02:53:27,129 --> 02:53:30,651
[SPEAKER_11]: need as an extra pair of hands at any or all of the sessions.

1282
02:53:31,832 --> 02:53:40,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll make myself available and I will tell my clients they have to wait another day so that I can go listen to the students too.

1283
02:53:40,336 --> 02:53:42,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So just let me know what you need.

1284
02:53:42,237 --> 02:53:42,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to help.

1285
02:53:43,858 --> 02:53:44,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Graham.

1286
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:47,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1287
02:53:49,641 --> 02:53:50,622
[SPEAKER_08]: We have old business.

1288
02:53:50,662 --> 02:53:54,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one, vote to approve Superintendent Maurice-Edouard Vincent's goals for 2020-2021.

1289
02:53:57,917 --> 02:53:58,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1290
02:53:58,898 --> 02:54:04,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve.

1291
02:54:05,382 --> 02:54:08,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve by Member Kreatz, Member Graham, and then Member Vendiclou.

1292
02:54:09,667 --> 02:54:11,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just had a quick question.

1293
02:54:12,788 --> 02:54:23,931
[SPEAKER_11]: In our last meeting, we talked about, particularly around the reopening plan, that there would be something added to address the plan for next year.

1294
02:54:24,031 --> 02:54:28,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just didn't see it, but I may have missed it.

1295
02:54:28,292 --> 02:54:32,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't know if that had been added or if there was a reason it wasn't.

1296
02:54:32,533 --> 02:54:32,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1297
02:54:33,914 --> 02:54:35,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that was my request, actually.

1298
02:54:35,354 --> 02:54:37,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1299
02:54:38,902 --> 02:54:40,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It is added.

1300
02:54:40,703 --> 02:54:43,725
[SPEAKER_06]: We have it recorded in the notes.

1301
02:54:43,805 --> 02:54:52,130
[SPEAKER_06]: This was just the exact one that I had submitted to you, but that was definitely added, that request that was added at the last meeting.

1302
02:54:52,150 --> 02:55:08,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just, I'm sorry, this is the exact version that you received when I presented it at the last meeting, but those specific changes have been, or are part of the goals for this year.

1303
02:55:10,068 --> 02:55:11,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

1304
02:55:11,748 --> 02:55:12,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1305
02:55:12,889 --> 02:55:14,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval by Member Kreatz.

1306
02:55:14,509 --> 02:55:16,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Member Vanden Heuvel.

1307
02:55:16,409 --> 02:55:17,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, I just wanted to second it.

1308
02:55:18,330 --> 02:55:19,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know if anybody had.

1309
02:55:20,010 --> 02:55:21,150
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's all you.

1310
02:55:21,350 --> 02:55:24,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Kreatz moved approval, seconded by Member Vanden Heuvel.

1311
02:55:24,851 --> 02:55:26,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, Member McLaughlin.

1312
02:55:27,992 --> 02:55:29,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1313
02:55:29,732 --> 02:55:29,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1314
02:55:31,692 --> 02:55:32,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1315
02:55:32,733 --> 02:55:32,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1316
02:55:34,253 --> 02:55:35,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1317
02:55:35,973 --> 02:55:36,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone.

1318
02:55:37,013 --> 02:55:37,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1319
02:55:38,894 --> 02:55:39,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1320
02:55:41,003 --> 02:55:41,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1321
02:55:42,965 --> 02:55:43,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van de Kloop.

1322
02:55:44,306 --> 02:55:44,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1323
02:55:45,807 --> 02:55:46,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1324
02:55:47,228 --> 02:55:49,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1325
02:55:50,190 --> 02:55:53,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent's goals have been approved for 2020-2021.

1326
02:55:53,933 --> 02:56:06,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, we have it on the agenda and I think we created some confusion, but the Columbus School name change, we did schedule a committee of the whole meeting dedicated to this discussion.

1327
02:56:07,702 --> 02:56:09,785
[SPEAKER_08]: for March 10th, 2020, sorry, March 10th, 2021 at 5.30 p.m.

1328
02:56:10,025 --> 02:56:12,488
[SPEAKER_08]: This vote was taken back in, I believe it was June, and now we are just

1329
02:56:22,066 --> 02:56:29,071
[SPEAKER_08]: announcing far in advance, at least a month in advance, when the discussion will start, which will be March 10th, 2021, 5.30 p.m.

1330
02:56:29,251 --> 02:56:29,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Van der Kloot?

1331
02:56:30,312 --> 02:56:45,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, I feel like that I need to convey to the committee, and I'm sure many committee members know because we've received so many emails to our personal accounts, but there were many submitted to the school committee account as well.

1332
02:56:46,743 --> 02:56:48,844
[SPEAKER_10]: We had roughly 30 letters

1333
02:56:51,146 --> 02:57:05,026
[SPEAKER_10]: all of which were similar, saying to us, please don't continue this discussion, don't change the name, and suggesting that this was the wrong time and the timing would distract us from other work.

1334
02:57:06,646 --> 02:57:10,149
[SPEAKER_10]: The letters were similar, so I know that committee members have seen them.

1335
02:57:10,950 --> 02:57:15,594
[SPEAKER_10]: If I were to read them all, it would take several hours of our time right now.

1336
02:57:16,235 --> 02:57:24,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Conversely, we also received almost an equal number supporting the name change with people.

1337
02:57:25,184 --> 02:57:27,446
[SPEAKER_10]: The letters were a little bit more different, more,

1338
02:57:28,907 --> 02:57:35,149
[SPEAKER_10]: diverse in their discussions, but again asking that we do keep to our intent.

1339
02:57:36,810 --> 02:57:48,253
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one submitted I want to mention in particular by a third grade student who also asked us please to keep to our intent.

1340
02:57:49,514 --> 02:57:52,695
[SPEAKER_10]: So clearly people thought that we might be changing.

1341
02:57:52,815 --> 02:57:56,856
[SPEAKER_10]: There was also a petition submitted by Medford United

1342
02:57:57,576 --> 02:58:00,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is appropriate for me to just read this.

1343
02:58:01,217 --> 02:58:14,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It says please join Medford Mass residents in signing this petition requesting the Medford Mass School Committee and it names us immediately rescind their vote to change the name of the Columbus Elementary School in operation since 1929.

1344
02:58:14,881 --> 02:58:17,402
[SPEAKER_10]: The name change was approved without community input.

1345
02:58:17,910 --> 02:58:21,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Community input and transparency should be sought before major decisions are made.

1346
02:58:22,433 --> 02:58:27,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Please sign the petition so we may right this wrong and be the vibrant community we are.

1347
02:58:27,517 --> 02:58:29,959
[SPEAKER_10]: There were 395 Medford residents on this, but more than, and with 1,426 additional names.

1348
02:58:30,579 --> 02:58:30,899
[SPEAKER_10]: On this,

1349
02:58:39,533 --> 02:58:42,036
[SPEAKER_10]: It is our custom to ask for addresses.

1350
02:58:42,557 --> 02:58:52,730
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just signed with names on the emails I was receiving, you know, I don't think people are necessarily clear all the times that they're supposed to have their address as well.

1351
02:58:52,770 --> 02:58:56,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So I started writing back to people, but frankly, there were so many kind of got out of hand.

1352
02:58:57,609 --> 02:59:00,532
[SPEAKER_10]: All of these will be submitted to be part of the record.

1353
02:59:01,694 --> 02:59:08,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll work with Susie on that tomorrow so that we're sure that they're read into the record or they're written into the record.

1354
02:59:10,513 --> 02:59:30,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I think at this point, what I hear your intent is that we're gonna go ahead with the meeting we have, but I do want you to, I wanted to present both the pro and the con and the very deep feelings that people have both ways, very deep feeling.

1355
02:59:31,713 --> 02:59:34,936
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I can interject a personal note,

1356
02:59:35,437 --> 02:59:46,169
[SPEAKER_10]: The question is in this very difficult discussion for in our community because it is and has been divisive is how can we come together in a positive way.

1357
02:59:46,830 --> 02:59:56,441
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is my deepest hope is that we will find a way to find some common language and common desire around this issue.

1358
02:59:57,165 --> 03:00:07,270
[SPEAKER_10]: so that, in fact, it doesn't divide us, but it brings us together in celebration of a rich Italian culture, which maybe isn't defined by the name Columbus.

1359
03:00:13,053 --> 03:00:14,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member van de Kloot.

1360
03:00:14,554 --> 03:00:16,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Kreatz?

1361
03:00:18,425 --> 03:00:18,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor.

1362
03:00:19,026 --> 03:00:22,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that there's a committee of the whole meeting Wednesday for further discussion on this.

1363
03:00:23,009 --> 03:00:28,714
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also know that there, as you can see, several folks on the call and we have not done public participation.

1364
03:00:28,754 --> 03:00:30,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to be clear.

1365
03:00:30,736 --> 03:00:33,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we having public participation tonight?

1366
03:00:33,238 --> 03:00:35,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you suggesting that we wait until Wednesday?

1367
03:00:35,900 --> 03:00:36,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm unclear.

1368
03:00:39,767 --> 03:01:07,225
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, I'll leave it to the committee, but this meeting was, it says discussed, but when the superintendent and I and Suzy Wise discussed this, it was to put the meeting date on this agenda to give people ample notice, because I know this is, we have people on both sides of this issue, but March 10th, 2021 at 5.30 is gonna be the official meeting focused just on renaming the Columbus School.

1369
03:01:09,093 --> 03:01:14,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think that's what the committee's intentions were when they asked for this to be on the agenda.

1370
03:01:14,714 --> 03:01:17,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It was to schedule a date for the Committee of the Whole.

1371
03:01:19,455 --> 03:01:19,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Kreatz?

1372
03:01:21,056 --> 03:01:21,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1373
03:01:21,776 --> 03:01:30,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure because I know when this was on the agenda in last June, there wasn't a lot of notice.

1374
03:01:30,958 --> 03:01:36,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you're putting on the agenda to notify the public that there is a Committee of the Whole on March 10th.

1375
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:38,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to know if

1376
03:01:39,180 --> 03:01:51,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody would be able to invite a representative from the NAACP, the Italian American community, some South Medford residents, the diversity director of the city of Medford.

1377
03:01:53,443 --> 03:02:09,073
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, you know, the elementary school parents, caregivers, teachers, students, leaders, PTO, you know, just so that, you know, that was one of the major concerns was when we had the June meeting, people didn't know about it.

1378
03:02:09,433 --> 03:02:11,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's on our agenda tonight.

1379
03:02:13,155 --> 03:02:26,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, like to know if it's going to be, you know, shared, you know, on social media to give people the opportunity to join in, or in be included with the discussions that are going to be taking place around the.

1380
03:02:29,815 --> 03:02:54,690
[SPEAKER_02]: then the renaming of the school um because we did receive a lot of emails and I was confused myself because you know we were getting messages and a lot of the community thought we were taking another vote this evening and you know and you know we're we're not doing that and I don't I don't think and I'm I'm not sure but we're not going to be doing that at the committee of the whole meeting so you know

1381
03:02:57,248 --> 03:03:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the committee the whole meeting, I think, is going to be to.

1382
03:03:05,235 --> 03:03:27,610
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule like the planning committee, almost like what we did with the other committees, like forming a task force that's gonna be a very diverse group of community members, you know, from all different areas of Medford that are gonna be part of this committee with an application process and how many members will be on the committee.

1383
03:03:27,810 --> 03:03:31,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what is being discussed in the March 10th Committee of the Whole meeting?

1384
03:03:33,095 --> 03:03:34,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Kress, that is the plan.

1385
03:03:37,709 --> 03:03:38,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Member, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

1386
03:03:40,515 --> 03:04:03,683
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was going to say, at the March 10th meeting at 530, to what Member Kreatz was just sharing, that it'll be an opportunity for our community, as it is going to be a committee of the whole, community members will be able to speak, and we will also be able to talk about what we will be able to do moving forward.

1387
03:04:04,223 --> 03:04:09,765
[SPEAKER_06]: But based on all of the emails that have come in thus far,

1388
03:04:11,119 --> 03:04:19,842
[SPEAKER_06]: and to your request, Member Kreatz, about making sure that we communicate with specific stakeholder groups within the community.

1389
03:04:20,242 --> 03:04:21,402
[SPEAKER_06]: We can definitely do that.

1390
03:04:21,662 --> 03:04:26,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, with the emails that we have in hand right now, make sure

1391
03:04:27,492 --> 03:04:29,453
[SPEAKER_06]: that that communication goes out.

1392
03:04:30,173 --> 03:04:49,180
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have one meeting prior, which is why the March 10th meeting will need to start at 5.30 p.m., but we will be able to get it posted early and use all media platforms to communicate with the entire community at large.

1393
03:04:52,721 --> 03:04:53,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1394
03:04:54,261 --> 03:04:55,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1395
03:04:55,462 --> 03:04:55,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1396
03:05:03,034 --> 03:05:04,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Vanderhoof, did you have your hand up?

1397
03:05:07,816 --> 03:05:15,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I guess one of the things which I'm wondering is if there's a way, you know,

1398
03:05:16,948 --> 03:05:20,810
[SPEAKER_10]: we need some help, I think, bringing our community together on this.

1399
03:05:22,131 --> 03:05:38,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I think it's deeply painful to see such a large rift and people on both sides, you know, obviously very committed, but I don't see yet, you know, I don't see a bridge forward.

1400
03:05:38,979 --> 03:05:45,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And if anybody, you know, I'm wondering whether there's any sort of

1401
03:05:46,808 --> 03:05:56,493
[SPEAKER_10]: any steps we can take, and if any community members have some thoughts in this of how we can help bridge this.

1402
03:05:57,554 --> 03:06:11,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that many people have suggested that we understand the Italian community's concern about losing a landmark that is important to them.

1403
03:06:11,401 --> 03:06:12,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And so many of us,

1404
03:06:15,168 --> 03:06:19,531
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, there's so many different names that could possibly be considered.

1405
03:06:20,551 --> 03:06:26,695
[SPEAKER_10]: If we were to not only, you know, to think about it in a broader sense as an opportunity,

1406
03:06:28,234 --> 03:06:32,137
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I personally feel it's extremely important.

1407
03:06:32,897 --> 03:06:45,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I know when I first came to Medford, I found myself delightfully surrounded in a neighborhood where, you know, by a wonderful warm Italian family.

1408
03:06:45,907 --> 03:06:53,612
[SPEAKER_10]: who took us in, who was so valuable to my own adjustment to Medford, and where I learned about gravy rather than sauce.

1409
03:06:54,972 --> 03:07:13,743
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just wondering, again, whether there's a, people are very strongly feeling they're negative about taking away Columbus, but I just wanna, is there any potential of going forward and thinking about, is there any place where we might move towards honoring

1410
03:07:14,950 --> 03:07:20,734
[SPEAKER_10]: our Italian heritage in this community with a different name.

1411
03:07:21,834 --> 03:07:30,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to throw that out and say, you know, I'm hoping that somebody might start thinking about that in a positive way.

1412
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:33,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member.

1413
03:07:33,161 --> 03:07:40,925
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, and the only other thing I did want to mention is we had originally said it was important for our students at the Columbus to be involved.

1414
03:07:41,926 --> 03:07:43,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I want to make sure we don't forget that piece.

1415
03:07:46,490 --> 03:07:49,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot, you pointed that out twice.

1416
03:07:49,672 --> 03:07:50,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1417
03:07:50,753 --> 03:08:10,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, no, I think it was, it had to be said, and I know Member Kreatz also pointed that out, making sure that the committee, and we have to be aware of that, making sure the committee that we do appoint is very diverse, and we take into account the rich Italian culture that, like, and hopefully we can carry that on moving forward.

1418
03:08:11,266 --> 03:08:14,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that is a bone of contention for some, and some don't.

1419
03:08:15,088 --> 03:08:16,169
[SPEAKER_08]: want the name changed at all.

1420
03:08:16,229 --> 03:08:23,899
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to do our best to try to bring people together and move forward to make as many people comfortable with this as possible.

1421
03:08:26,922 --> 03:08:28,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edward-Vincent?

1422
03:08:29,467 --> 03:08:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say in response to member van de Kloot's comments that I know that there are a lot of mixed opinions about the name for the Columbus School.

1423
03:08:41,749 --> 03:08:53,832
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I was being asked, if I was giving my personal opinion, I feel that we don't have another school right now that actually represents the Italian heritage.

1424
03:08:54,732 --> 03:08:59,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Medford, we do have a large Italian community as well.

1425
03:08:59,816 --> 03:09:22,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things I would hope would be if, in fact, the final decision is the name is going to be changed from Columbus, that as a community, we would think about other Italian-Americans who have, or not necessarily Italian-Americans, or just Italians that could still be living in Italy.

1426
03:09:24,712 --> 03:09:28,876
[SPEAKER_06]: that we would still be able to recognize and honor the culture.

1427
03:09:30,077 --> 03:09:46,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I've said, you know, I love the music of Andrea Bocelli and he is blind, a beautiful singer, has a wonderful voice, that there are a lot of Italians and Italian Americans that have contributed to

1428
03:09:48,535 --> 03:09:50,678
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, great things that have happened.

1429
03:09:51,098 --> 03:10:00,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would hope that as we're thinking about other name options, that that would be something that is not completely taken off of the table.

1430
03:10:01,530 --> 03:10:07,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to share that, that I think that should be part of the conversation.

1431
03:10:09,238 --> 03:10:23,203
[SPEAKER_06]: and hopefully we can have a very fruitful conversation on March 10th at 5.30 and be able to put in the structures necessary for groups that can work on it collaboratively.

1432
03:10:24,983 --> 03:10:36,847
[SPEAKER_06]: As I have my little homework assignment that I've given to students voluntary on the theme of unity, I do believe that we are one district, it's one Medford,

1433
03:10:38,149 --> 03:10:41,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do not want to divide the community.

1434
03:10:41,690 --> 03:10:43,131
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to unify the community.

1435
03:10:43,691 --> 03:10:53,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is an opportunity for us to come together as a community and think and share ideas and have a productive conversation.

1436
03:10:54,394 --> 03:10:57,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to share my thoughts.

1437
03:10:57,315 --> 03:10:57,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1438
03:11:01,193 --> 03:11:02,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

1439
03:11:03,014 --> 03:11:07,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Mr. Colin Bailey's on the call too, shaking his head when you spoke.

1440
03:11:07,576 --> 03:11:10,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for being here, Colin, as our student rep.

1441
03:11:11,838 --> 03:11:13,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, thank you for having me here.

1442
03:11:19,482 --> 03:11:25,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And next we have, so we'll make sure we publicize that meeting broadly.

1443
03:11:26,586 --> 03:11:40,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, we have report on COVID-19 related funding sources, summary of investments made by the Medford Public Schools through funding sources realized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including state grants and federal allocations.

1444
03:11:40,896 --> 03:11:46,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. David Murphy, assistant superintendent for finance and operations and Michelle Kingdom comptroller.

1445
03:11:47,161 --> 03:11:48,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Murphy and Ms.

1446
03:11:48,562 --> 03:11:48,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Kingdom.

1447
03:11:49,783 --> 03:11:50,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, mayor.

1448
03:11:50,563 --> 03:11:50,763
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1449
03:11:50,843 --> 03:11:53,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Kingdom is joining me and is on my call.

1450
03:11:54,050 --> 03:11:56,491
[SPEAKER_18]: I will take any questions that you might have.

1451
03:11:57,251 --> 03:11:59,152
[SPEAKER_18]: I am going to share another deck.

1452
03:11:59,452 --> 03:12:05,474
[SPEAKER_18]: It's another one that, based on time, you haven't seen yet, but it's only two slides.

1453
03:12:05,794 --> 03:12:08,795
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm confident everyone will be able to follow along.

1454
03:12:09,255 --> 03:12:12,096
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a tremendous amount of backup data for this.

1455
03:12:12,276 --> 03:12:12,516
[SPEAKER_18]: And so

1456
03:12:13,522 --> 03:12:36,632
[SPEAKER_18]: My recommendation or my request, I guess, would be that if people have specific questions about funding sources that have been realized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, you just let us know, and we're happy to dig through as necessary to identify for you how those funds have been expended, what's been prioritized, and in many cases, what's been procured.

1457
03:12:37,733 --> 03:12:42,515
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll see that, as is the case with many districts around the

1458
03:12:44,089 --> 03:12:46,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Commonwealth and really, I guess, across the nation.

1459
03:12:47,331 --> 03:13:12,063
[SPEAKER_18]: While this has been a time of tremendous budgetary stress, it's also been a time in which the district has been responsible for making the most efficient and effective use of the funding that has flowed in primarily from the federal government and also from the state government to help both bridge gaps that have been exacerbated as a result of the pandemic, and also to address specific

1460
03:13:12,888 --> 03:13:17,431
[SPEAKER_18]: funding needs that are entirely attributable to the pandemic.

1461
03:13:17,571 --> 03:13:36,242
[SPEAKER_18]: And so what's complicated about this, and which is, and frankly, the reason that this is a two slide presentation with, as I said, reams of background data, is that when we've had expenses, what is essentially eligible

1462
03:13:36,872 --> 03:13:43,016
[SPEAKER_18]: to be charged to certain funding sources has fluctuated over the course of the pandemic.

1463
03:13:43,116 --> 03:13:54,023
[SPEAKER_18]: And so where that's most evident, you can see is in the relatively minuscule amount of pandemic-related funding that has gone toward personnel.

1464
03:13:54,423 --> 03:14:04,510
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had a number of personnel expenses and personnel challenges that are attributable to the pandemic, but there has not been consistent funding sources

1465
03:14:07,095 --> 03:14:11,836
[SPEAKER_18]: that are designed specifically to help support our personnel needs.

1466
03:14:11,896 --> 03:14:30,681
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some, and we've tried to take advantage of that when we can by things like hiring additional school monitors or non-instructional aides that can help serve as the supervisory coverage in a classroom when a teacher is engaged in reverse remote instruction.

1467
03:14:31,761 --> 03:14:34,862
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's a relatively small fraction, obviously.

1468
03:14:35,242 --> 03:14:35,842
[SPEAKER_18]: That being said,

1469
03:14:36,642 --> 03:14:54,066
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been able to address a number of the air quality and other HVAC concerns connected to the pandemic and the need for us to meet the heightened air quality standards that have been subject to many conversations before this body, as well as a lot of the instructional technology needs.

1470
03:14:54,106 --> 03:14:59,487
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's really an issue or an element of our expenditures that

1471
03:15:00,827 --> 03:15:10,630
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that there's been a tremendous amount of instructional technology needs that are directly related to how instruction is taking place and the conditions under which we're operating.

1472
03:15:11,330 --> 03:15:25,693
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there have been other places in which we've been able to essentially capitalize on the funding sources that are available to hopefully position ourselves to be better situated from an instructional technology perspective when the pandemic is over.

1473
03:15:25,794 --> 03:15:27,554
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, as you can see,

1474
03:15:28,392 --> 03:15:38,218
[SPEAKER_18]: 56% of the funding that has come from the four sources identified here have been, and some of them have been specifically earmarked for instructional technology.

1475
03:15:38,278 --> 03:15:42,100
[SPEAKER_18]: So absent that funding, we wouldn't have been able to do that.

1476
03:15:42,140 --> 03:15:46,183
[SPEAKER_18]: And had we not had that priority, we wouldn't have been able to use that funding.

1477
03:15:46,203 --> 03:15:46,243
[SPEAKER_18]: So

1478
03:15:47,264 --> 03:15:56,069
[SPEAKER_18]: That's obviously another reason why that percentage is as high as it is, but these are essentially, and I think you've seen these numbers presented to you in different forms before.

1479
03:15:57,450 --> 03:16:01,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, and I know in September of 2020, both myself and Ms.

1480
03:16:01,513 --> 03:16:12,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Sladen spoke to you in some level of detail about the grant sources that had come through originally in FY20 and then carrying over into FY21.

1481
03:16:13,039 --> 03:16:14,200
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can see that, again,

1482
03:16:15,303 --> 03:16:27,710
[SPEAKER_18]: These numbers are fluid to the extent that there've been times where we've procured something, eligibility has changed or we've identified other needs and one funding source may have a broader eligibility scope.

1483
03:16:27,770 --> 03:16:44,540
[SPEAKER_18]: And so then things have essentially there's been transfers within the accounts, but this is essentially a picture of how we've been able to utilize the external funds that have come in to help support us and the needs that have been realized as a result of the pandemic.

1484
03:16:46,532 --> 03:16:58,095
[SPEAKER_18]: In the second slide here, this is in and go back to our conversation from earlier that it's not too often that we're able to come for you with what would amount to good news.

1485
03:16:58,175 --> 03:17:05,437
[SPEAKER_18]: And it is good news set against the backdrop that the mayor referred to earlier regarding our budgetary challenges going into FY22.

1486
03:17:06,137 --> 03:17:10,718
[SPEAKER_18]: But we are anticipating approximately a $2.3 million injection as a result of the

1487
03:17:11,899 --> 03:17:15,161
[SPEAKER_18]: additional federal stimulus that passed at the end of calendar year 2020.

1488
03:17:15,581 --> 03:17:39,371
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in addition to that, DESE notified us within the last week or 10 days, maybe, that there's essentially a second round of coronavirus virus relief funding that has been realized, which will result in a $216,000 injection of funding with restrictions, including the need for expenditure by June 30th, 2021.

1489
03:17:41,797 --> 03:17:58,780
[SPEAKER_18]: We have some leftover instructional technology priorities, specifically expanding our Zoom capacity that will put a minor hit into that second funding source, the $216,000.

1490
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:09,642
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I think it was evident in the, if we just go back to the first slide for a second, you can see that there's about, of the $85,000 that's remaining from the original funding sources,

1491
03:18:10,142 --> 03:18:26,720
[SPEAKER_18]: The majority of that are expenditures for which the funding was encumbered, but then a determination was made between the city and the state of some of the expenses being ineligible due to the, essentially, the duration of time in which the instructional technology would be utilized.

1492
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:30,885
[SPEAKER_18]: So, again, this is a high-level summary because

1493
03:18:31,708 --> 03:18:41,996
[SPEAKER_18]: As you can tell, $4.4 or $4.3 million in that much work being done from infrastructure and facilities perspective and instructional technology being procured.

1494
03:18:43,237 --> 03:18:52,264
[SPEAKER_18]: There's obviously a lot of background there, but if there are specific questions or if you'd like us to try to break this apart in any way, myself and Ms.

1495
03:18:52,304 --> 03:18:53,765
[SPEAKER_18]: King would be happy to do that.

1496
03:18:53,785 --> 03:19:00,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1497
03:19:01,203 --> 03:19:03,324
[SPEAKER_08]: That was very thorough.

1498
03:19:06,166 --> 03:19:11,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, no questions, we can move on.

1499
03:19:11,910 --> 03:19:13,851
[SPEAKER_18]: We have resolutions.

1500
03:19:13,951 --> 03:19:18,834
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll provide a more detailed memo providing some of the highlights of the instructional technology.

1501
03:19:18,854 --> 03:19:24,418
[SPEAKER_18]: I do think the committee should be aware of how many headphones, how many Chromebooks, how many MacBooks, how many amplifiers, how many projectors.

1502
03:19:24,942 --> 03:19:33,516
[SPEAKER_18]: All of that stuff is related to the different way in which instruction is being delivered, and we'll provide a more itemized list so people can sift through that if they have any questions, happy to answer them.

1503
03:19:34,217 --> 03:19:35,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1504
03:19:35,258 --> 03:19:35,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

1505
03:19:38,931 --> 03:19:40,071
[SPEAKER_11]: The thank you for that.

1506
03:19:40,111 --> 03:19:46,634
[SPEAKER_11]: The presentation was really helpful in sort of laying out all the various sources, and I know that's been a questions been asked a couple of times.

1507
03:19:47,954 --> 03:19:52,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a question at one point in the last couple of months.

1508
03:19:52,356 --> 03:19:52,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was.

1509
03:19:52,996 --> 03:19:53,496
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little.

1510
03:19:53,757 --> 03:19:56,718
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit hazy when I saw this fly by, but there was some.

1511
03:19:56,738 --> 03:19:59,199
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a ruling about the money.

1512
03:19:59,219 --> 03:20:05,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was from cares act in terms of the requirement of districts to.

1513
03:20:07,062 --> 03:20:12,685
[SPEAKER_11]: give certain amount of funding to parochial schools, private and parochial schools that had been reversed.

1514
03:20:13,265 --> 03:20:17,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you describe what happened there for us and how that impacted?

1515
03:20:17,247 --> 03:20:18,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1516
03:20:18,788 --> 03:20:18,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1517
03:20:19,028 --> 03:20:20,389
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm familiar with that.

1518
03:20:20,889 --> 03:20:21,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1519
03:20:21,289 --> 03:20:24,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it was a court decision that put the brakes on some of that funding.

1520
03:20:25,291 --> 03:20:32,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I, at the moment, the details and the sort of what I suspect is a constitutional basis, um, for that.

1521
03:20:33,635 --> 03:20:36,717
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have at my fingertips, so I'd have, I'd have to get back to you on that.

1522
03:20:37,113 --> 03:20:50,064
[SPEAKER_18]: I can tell you that with regard to the technology grants, the first version of those that came through, and we just actually might have one thing that would, let me answer that.

1523
03:20:53,006 --> 03:21:05,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I can tell you that there was about $60,000 that was expended toward parochial schools that the district was responsible for making sure it was ultimately expended on behalf of the students attending those schools.

1524
03:21:06,594 --> 03:21:10,596
[SPEAKER_18]: and that in the second round of funding, that is not being included.

1525
03:21:10,656 --> 03:21:15,918
[SPEAKER_18]: I frankly don't know whether that's attributable to that court case, which my understanding is being appealed.

1526
03:21:15,958 --> 03:21:34,566
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd be a little surprised if that policy change is specifically as a result of that decision, but I can tell you that it won't have the same financial impact coming out of the two, as of now, won't have the same financial impact coming out of the 2.3 million that it did in the original allocation, which as I said, was about 60, approximately $60,000.

1527
03:21:36,043 --> 03:21:37,664
[SPEAKER_18]: was expended on behalf of students.

1528
03:21:39,226 --> 03:21:43,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford's school age children in Medford who are not enrolled in public schools.

1529
03:21:47,012 --> 03:21:48,773
[SPEAKER_11]: And one more question.

1530
03:21:49,794 --> 03:22:00,142
[SPEAKER_11]: You do you have a timeline for when you expect to be talking about the grant spending of this upcoming funding and what the plans are for that?

1531
03:22:00,162 --> 03:22:04,245
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of how does that relate to the budget process in general?

1532
03:22:05,652 --> 03:22:09,913
[SPEAKER_18]: You mean in terms of prioritization for what we're calling the 2.3 million?

1533
03:22:10,913 --> 03:22:11,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1534
03:22:11,373 --> 03:22:26,616
[SPEAKER_18]: What I can tell you is that for fiscal year 21, the priority is making sure that some of the COVID mitigation strategies that are employed are fully sustainable.

1535
03:22:27,236 --> 03:22:31,757
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are other funding sources for that and we've got some valuable,

1536
03:22:33,948 --> 03:22:36,969
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a variety of way in which we're making sure that everything we're doing is sustainable.

1537
03:22:37,870 --> 03:22:52,915
[SPEAKER_18]: But that is a backstop to make sure that everything we're doing in schools, everything from a PPE perspective to finalizing any, most of our HVACs that work, what's been identified is completed.

1538
03:22:52,995 --> 03:22:58,918
[SPEAKER_18]: But other than those things and a few other COVID mitigation tactics,

1539
03:23:00,523 --> 03:23:09,385
[SPEAKER_18]: it is our hope that that funding is fully intact, or as close to fully intact as possible at the start of the new fiscal year.

1540
03:23:09,405 --> 03:23:23,209
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of that is because, as was mentioned in the previous, I think it was in the previous presentation, or maybe it was in this one, as of now, that funding is designed to go through all of FY22 into FY23 and potentially beyond.

1541
03:23:28,336 --> 03:23:37,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything we're hearing from the federal government is realized and there should be additional support, but that's obviously not something we can count on.

1542
03:23:38,522 --> 03:23:54,052
[SPEAKER_18]: And so for that reason, we're trying to be as conservative as possible to make sure that whatever additional expenses are identified as a result of what was hopefully a waning pandemic by that point, that there's funding to support that in FY22.

1543
03:23:59,134 --> 03:24:00,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Fingers crossed on the waning for sure.

1544
03:24:02,397 --> 03:24:15,888
[SPEAKER_11]: And so one of the reasons I ask is because we delayed the spend of a considerable amount of money before you joined us in this happy party in Medford.

1545
03:24:17,709 --> 03:24:21,773
[SPEAKER_11]: And the delay of the spend and the allocation and the approvals

1546
03:24:22,766 --> 03:24:31,989
[SPEAKER_11]: are at least part of the reason why we did not get all the equipment in that we expected so that it could be used in time for the start of the school year.

1547
03:24:32,669 --> 03:24:37,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not 100% clear myself whether we've even yet received all of that technology.

1548
03:24:37,911 --> 03:24:44,293
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanna make sure that we're planful so that that doesn't happen again.

1549
03:24:44,313 --> 03:24:50,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I would say that very, very good question.

1550
03:24:50,394 --> 03:24:51,975
[SPEAKER_18]: And something that I think we have to look at

1551
03:24:52,849 --> 03:25:10,118
[SPEAKER_18]: on an ongoing basis because I don't think we'll ever get to a point and say that's the nature of investments in instructional technology that both because of the lifespan of some infrastructure and because of the need to constantly be reassessing to determine what the next priority should be.

1552
03:25:10,639 --> 03:25:12,019
[SPEAKER_18]: It's definitely an ongoing challenge.

1553
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:19,864
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say that you saw that we spent 56% and I think it's approximately $2.7 million.

1554
03:25:20,304 --> 03:25:22,445
[SPEAKER_18]: It's some pretty significant investments

1555
03:25:23,487 --> 03:25:27,188
[SPEAKER_18]: including investments that were made this fall and going into early winter.

1556
03:25:27,888 --> 03:25:37,110
[SPEAKER_18]: And so there's a lot of technology that we are, I would say we're in a pretty good place in terms of from an instructional technology perspective.

1557
03:25:37,130 --> 03:25:47,672
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not to say it's not a priority or not something we'll have to be looking at, but I think it's fair to say that the district's in a much different place than it would have been in a year ago.

1558
03:25:47,692 --> 03:25:49,512
[SPEAKER_18]: And just as an example of that,

1559
03:25:50,423 --> 03:26:07,415
[SPEAKER_18]: from a, you know, we're well positioned in terms of our Chromebook allocation now that we have both what we need and essentially the next round as the next sort of group of Chromebooks that the Chromebooks like every district is, it's made up of Chromebooks that were bought in different years.

1560
03:26:07,875 --> 03:26:10,356
[SPEAKER_18]: And so they have different life expectancies.

1561
03:26:10,917 --> 03:26:15,420
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we've been able to invest in a way that certainly through

1562
03:26:16,113 --> 03:26:27,639
[SPEAKER_18]: next year, and I think a few beyond, we're going to be in a position to make sure everyone has a Chromebook that works well, works well with our network, and has a lifespan that people can rely on.

1563
03:26:29,820 --> 03:26:32,882
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just an example, but I think we have to look at it on an ongoing basis.

1564
03:26:33,642 --> 03:26:34,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1565
03:26:39,786 --> 03:26:40,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1566
03:26:40,106 --> 03:26:43,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Number nine, communications.

1567
03:26:43,868 --> 03:26:44,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor?

1568
03:26:45,524 --> 03:26:46,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

1569
03:26:46,944 --> 03:26:49,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, if I could interrupt for a second.

1570
03:26:50,225 --> 03:27:01,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just made aware of a mistake which I made, and it's important enough to interrupt and say that the person who wrote it to me is correct.

1571
03:27:02,168 --> 03:27:12,671
[SPEAKER_10]: What I didn't say was that I also, when we were talking about the Columbus School emails, I also had received several emails from members of the Italian

1572
03:27:13,231 --> 03:27:16,874
[SPEAKER_10]: American community who were not in support of the Columbus name.

1573
03:27:17,394 --> 03:27:27,582
[SPEAKER_10]: And the person who wrote me said that she did not want people to think that all of residents of the Italian community were of one mind.

1574
03:27:27,882 --> 03:27:30,724
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to make that correction and to be clear.

1575
03:27:31,585 --> 03:27:36,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, we'll give you the email so that everybody can see that.

1576
03:27:37,169 --> 03:27:40,372
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm so sorry and appreciate the correction.

1577
03:27:41,493 --> 03:27:41,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1578
03:27:42,825 --> 03:27:44,406
[SPEAKER_08]: a member Rousseau mayor.

1579
03:27:45,167 --> 03:27:45,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1580
03:27:45,427 --> 03:27:50,370
[SPEAKER_20]: I just had a quick question on the technology stuff.

1581
03:27:51,831 --> 03:28:04,560
[SPEAKER_20]: Forgive me if you said that I was trying to show a sandwich on my throat, but I'm still hearing teachers and certainly students and their families comment on our internet capacity still.

1582
03:28:06,061 --> 03:28:10,465
[SPEAKER_20]: And is that in this technology spend?

1583
03:28:10,565 --> 03:28:12,486
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it seems kind of like

1584
03:28:13,238 --> 03:28:16,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Look, I'm a software engineer.

1585
03:28:16,240 --> 03:28:16,881
[SPEAKER_20]: I kind of get it.

1586
03:28:16,921 --> 03:28:18,162
[SPEAKER_20]: This stuff is never cheap.

1587
03:28:20,583 --> 03:28:24,266
[SPEAKER_20]: And, but we really, we have to fix the internet.

1588
03:28:24,326 --> 03:28:32,052
[SPEAKER_20]: It needs to be consistently amazing everywhere in the bill, every building, end of store, like there's, this is the only standard that should be considered acceptable.

1589
03:28:32,572 --> 03:28:37,576
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think this point we have to get to, Mr. Oso, is where it's not amazing when the internet works.

1590
03:28:37,676 --> 03:28:41,859
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, as you probably know, we have had some bumps in the road.

1591
03:28:42,313 --> 03:28:47,597
[SPEAKER_18]: with regard to our Wi-Fi network over the last couple of weeks.

1592
03:28:48,577 --> 03:28:55,362
[SPEAKER_18]: We're taking some steps to try to prevent those challenges from reoccurring.

1593
03:28:55,382 --> 03:29:03,188
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you're right that while, and this is, I appreciate you asking this question, because I think it's a distinction I should have made in my comments.

1594
03:29:03,628 --> 03:29:10,173
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we've done a really good job in terms of investing in the technology

1595
03:29:10,993 --> 03:29:16,414
[SPEAKER_18]: that students need to be operating in the environment in which they're currently learning.

1596
03:29:16,934 --> 03:29:28,796
[SPEAKER_18]: But there's a different question with regard to infrastructure that is happening at the facilities level to make sure that technology, that people are able to utilize that technology and maximize its potential.

1597
03:29:29,416 --> 03:29:38,998
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I think that's where our attention will need to turn with regard to these funding priorities to make sure that the $2.7 million we've spent on equipment

1598
03:29:39,600 --> 03:29:43,363
[SPEAKER_18]: and devices and things of that nature is in fact money well spent.

1599
03:29:44,964 --> 03:30:05,478
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that we'll be looking at both some of the external funds that were identified here and I suspect some of the other funding sources on the capital side we'll have to look at to see how do we make sure that we expand our infrastructure capacity to make sure the networks are all reliable and secure.

1600
03:30:06,018 --> 03:30:08,860
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that is a conversation that we'll be having in the coming weeks and months.

1601
03:30:10,162 --> 03:30:10,863
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

1602
03:30:10,883 --> 03:30:12,724
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it.

1603
03:30:12,784 --> 03:30:13,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1604
03:30:14,326 --> 03:30:16,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Colin Bailey, our student rep.

1605
03:30:18,590 --> 03:30:24,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I would just like to thank you for your attention to the Wi-Fi issues that we've been having.

1606
03:30:24,876 --> 03:30:31,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I know for myself today and a lot of other students, the fifth period and sixth periods were more

1607
03:30:33,858 --> 03:30:35,640
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a bit of a struggle for a lot of us.

1608
03:30:35,740 --> 03:30:40,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't actually able to have a sixth period because the Wi-Fi network being at home.

1609
03:30:41,685 --> 03:30:49,832
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to thank you for your attention to fixing the infrastructure and the Wi-Fi there and making it the best possible experience for all of us.

1610
03:30:50,092 --> 03:30:53,715
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a difficult time and I understand that you're doing your best and I really appreciate that.

1611
03:30:54,096 --> 03:30:55,917
[SPEAKER_14]: And the students want to thank you for that.

1612
03:30:57,887 --> 03:31:00,968
[SPEAKER_18]: I know they'll appreciate it more when it works for the whole school day.

1613
03:31:01,228 --> 03:31:05,710
[SPEAKER_18]: And until that time, I don't think you or any other student should be satisfied.

1614
03:31:10,252 --> 03:31:10,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Colin.

1615
03:31:13,593 --> 03:31:14,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any communications?

1616
03:31:15,394 --> 03:31:16,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe so.

1617
03:31:18,935 --> 03:31:23,637
[SPEAKER_08]: New business resolution number one offered by member Rousseau.

1618
03:31:25,295 --> 03:31:40,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Field trips that have been previously approved but needed to be postponed due to the pandemic do not require a new approval from the school committee and may be scheduled for a date in the future under the existing approval for up to two years from the original planned date of the field trip.

1619
03:31:42,126 --> 03:31:47,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval by, okay, Member Ruseau, would you like to speak on this first?

1620
03:31:48,690 --> 03:31:52,232
[SPEAKER_20]: Very briefly, just, you know, I just wanted to short circuit

1621
03:31:52,788 --> 03:31:59,929
[SPEAKER_20]: a flood of new requests and the complexities of a lot of these people who have scheduled these field trips is already hard enough on them.

1622
03:32:01,110 --> 03:32:09,451
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously the list of students that may be participating and the process of getting the nursing approvals and all that stuff, that still all has to happen.

1623
03:32:09,531 --> 03:32:19,533
[SPEAKER_20]: But if we said the kids can take a field trip to New York City, then we've already said it and the pandemic shouldn't require us to all sit around and talk about it.

1624
03:32:20,294 --> 03:32:22,538
[SPEAKER_20]: some Monday morning and some other month.

1625
03:32:22,598 --> 03:32:23,760
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the point of this.

1626
03:32:24,381 --> 03:32:25,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Efficiency, I like it.

1627
03:32:26,084 --> 03:32:27,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, member van de Kloot.

1628
03:32:28,030 --> 03:32:40,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually on this one, I do disagree because I think that we're going to have so many questions around how different things are going to be handled as we're coming out of the pandemic.

1629
03:32:41,595 --> 03:32:49,458
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I will vote along with it if we can add a caveat that we would be informed about the field trip.

1630
03:32:49,738 --> 03:32:52,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, so that we can follow up with questions.

1631
03:32:52,799 --> 03:32:53,359
[SPEAKER_10]: For example,

1632
03:32:54,360 --> 03:33:04,007
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, does that cover, we were going to have kids going to Hawaii, well, what if, or Italy or whatever, you know, does that mean that that wouldn't be brought before us?

1633
03:33:04,488 --> 03:33:22,062
[SPEAKER_10]: It was scheduled in this past, you know, so I'm just, I don't know, a little bit, I do think that there's things that we would particularly want the committee members would particularly be interested, especially since we have a lot of responsibility in this area.

1634
03:33:23,548 --> 03:33:23,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1635
03:33:23,848 --> 03:33:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Miss Stone, then Member Ruseau.

1636
03:33:26,669 --> 03:33:28,489
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you've been, Member Ruseau.

1637
03:33:30,109 --> 03:33:30,469
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1638
03:33:31,149 --> 03:33:49,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor, if I may, maybe we should vote on this and then send the policy for field trips back to subcommittee to have it tweaked, because the current policy doesn't really say anything about the pandemic or any kind of specialized

1639
03:33:50,451 --> 03:33:51,231
[SPEAKER_20]: considerations.

1640
03:33:51,431 --> 03:34:02,496
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, just following our policy, if we brought it up and we talked about it, I mean, we could as members decide we don't feel comfortable because of the pandemic, but that's not actually a consideration.

1641
03:34:02,636 --> 03:34:06,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Like all the dots, all the I's have been dotted and all the T's have been crossed.

1642
03:34:07,378 --> 03:34:11,879
[SPEAKER_20]: Saying no, we don't approve it seems kind of arbitrary.

1643
03:34:12,880 --> 03:34:15,981
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also feel like the nursing department, you know,

1644
03:34:16,478 --> 03:34:24,163
[SPEAKER_20]: If they say it's good to go, I mean, they still do kind of hold the veto power over things, as my understanding.

1645
03:34:24,264 --> 03:34:32,229
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't expect any of our field trips to be getting on a cruise anytime soon.

1646
03:34:32,589 --> 03:34:37,213
[SPEAKER_20]: And those wouldn't be opened up and available at all.

1647
03:34:39,917 --> 03:34:45,338
[SPEAKER_10]: So Paul, would you be okay if we just added a sentence that the school committee will be informed?

1648
03:34:46,779 --> 03:34:47,359
[SPEAKER_10]: By email?

1649
03:34:48,159 --> 03:34:51,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, by email prior to- Absolutely, yes.

1650
03:34:52,040 --> 03:34:52,980
[SPEAKER_10]: A trip taking place?

1651
03:34:54,381 --> 03:34:56,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that sounds great.

1652
03:34:56,201 --> 03:34:58,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so we have some opportunity to ask questions.

1653
03:34:59,782 --> 03:35:07,784
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, but that's, if I may, I mean, I don't want them to have to come before us and be on the agenda like they do now.

1654
03:35:09,114 --> 03:35:10,475
[SPEAKER_20]: for ones we've already approved.

1655
03:35:13,738 --> 03:35:26,328
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, if we get an email or a report or just a notice that this is planned and it's gonna happen, that's different than asking the person who's running the field trip to come and do another presentation before us.

1656
03:35:27,570 --> 03:35:34,896
[SPEAKER_20]: I just feel like, I don't feel like any of our field trips

1657
03:35:35,397 --> 03:35:39,038
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, the Italy field trip, nobody's rushing to get to Italy right now.

1658
03:35:39,058 --> 03:35:45,561
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know that we could legally even get to Italy by the time it's opened.

1659
03:35:46,041 --> 03:35:52,683
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the parents and the students and the staff running it would be using their judgment.

1660
03:35:53,424 --> 03:35:58,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So Paul, I would be comfortable with upon approval from the superintendent.

1661
03:35:59,646 --> 03:36:00,026
[SPEAKER_20]: I like that.

1662
03:36:02,173 --> 03:36:14,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, as a school committee member, I don't personally need to do it, but I wanna make sure that there is a check in place because there have been differing circumstances.

1663
03:36:14,321 --> 03:36:18,564
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I can add, upon approval by the superintendent, I'm fine with it.

1664
03:36:20,225 --> 03:36:22,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So an email to the school committee and approval by the superintendent.

1665
03:36:23,247 --> 03:36:23,687
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

1666
03:36:24,227 --> 03:36:30,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, motion for approval by member Rousseau, as amended by member Van der Kloot, member McLaughlin.

1667
03:36:30,848 --> 03:36:31,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1668
03:36:32,208 --> 03:36:34,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I'm I'm a little bit confused.

1669
03:36:34,569 --> 03:36:35,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's just getting late.

1670
03:36:36,069 --> 03:36:43,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a little bit of clarification, especially being as a first time member and not knowing previously approved field trips.

1671
03:36:44,251 --> 03:36:53,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, is there going to be some list that were made aware of what the previously approved field trips are so that we know that they, you know,

1672
03:36:55,090 --> 03:37:01,576
[SPEAKER_09]: if they're moving forward by the superintendent, that we have some context here, because this institutional knowledge bit is tricky.

1673
03:37:01,716 --> 03:37:02,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nice to have.

1674
03:37:03,698 --> 03:37:04,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1675
03:37:05,359 --> 03:37:14,547
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think in an email we'd get from the administration, it would state the prior approved field trip to New York from June 2020.

1676
03:37:16,131 --> 03:37:18,933
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 has been postponed until November 2021.

1677
03:37:18,973 --> 03:37:21,514
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any questions, let me know.

1678
03:37:21,614 --> 03:37:24,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the superintendent would approve that.

1679
03:37:24,616 --> 03:37:30,959
[SPEAKER_08]: So not all of them may go forward, but they'll let us know if it was prior priorly approved and when the new date is.

1680
03:37:30,979 --> 03:37:34,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Russo.

1681
03:37:34,541 --> 03:37:40,483
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I just, because member McLaughlin is a new member, we have no standing approvals.

1682
03:37:40,844 --> 03:37:45,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Each and every field trip does come to us for approval for a specific field trip.

1683
03:37:45,847 --> 03:37:49,310
[SPEAKER_20]: I can see why my language might've sounded confusing there.

1684
03:37:49,370 --> 03:37:52,352
[SPEAKER_20]: And there is no list of standing approved field trips.

1685
03:37:52,952 --> 03:37:56,074
[SPEAKER_20]: These are people came before us, said we want this field trip.

1686
03:37:56,375 --> 03:37:59,257
[SPEAKER_20]: We said, yes, for the one time, for the one date.

1687
03:37:59,877 --> 03:38:09,604
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is only aimed at those field trips that people have already done all the work so that they don't have to come and do that before us again, just so.

1688
03:38:10,125 --> 03:38:11,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And that were postponed because of the pandemic.

1689
03:38:11,966 --> 03:38:12,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you're saying?

1690
03:38:12,987 --> 03:38:13,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1691
03:38:13,567 --> 03:38:14,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct, yes.

1692
03:38:18,493 --> 03:38:20,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval as amended.

1693
03:38:20,775 --> 03:38:21,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call.

1694
03:38:24,638 --> 03:38:25,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1695
03:38:25,939 --> 03:38:26,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1696
03:38:27,680 --> 03:38:28,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

1697
03:38:28,060 --> 03:38:29,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was the second on the motion?

1698
03:38:30,022 --> 03:38:30,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Van der Kloot.

1699
03:38:31,102 --> 03:38:31,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1700
03:38:32,283 --> 03:38:32,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1701
03:38:33,504 --> 03:38:33,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1702
03:38:35,145 --> 03:38:36,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1703
03:38:36,346 --> 03:38:37,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone.

1704
03:38:37,327 --> 03:38:37,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1705
03:38:39,268 --> 03:38:39,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1706
03:38:40,890 --> 03:38:41,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1707
03:38:41,950 --> 03:38:43,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van der Kloot.

1708
03:38:43,431 --> 03:38:43,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1709
03:38:44,632 --> 03:38:45,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1710
03:38:45,871 --> 03:38:47,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1711
03:38:47,873 --> 03:38:50,434
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes as amended twice.

1712
03:38:52,496 --> 03:39:12,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, the Medford Public Schools Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education and the Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education will present an overview of the efforts underway to prepare students and staff for the administration of the MCAS at the elementary, middle, and high school levels and will include details such as how fully remote students will be tested

1713
03:39:12,733 --> 03:39:17,514
[SPEAKER_08]: equipment set up including space and social distancing plans and proctoring plans.

1714
03:39:18,134 --> 03:39:26,736
[SPEAKER_08]: The presentation should also include what practice MCAS testing is taking place throughout the district and how that will be like or different from the actual MCAS testing.

1715
03:39:27,477 --> 03:39:32,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Estimates of total learning time lost due to practice and actual MCAS testing by grade level will be provided.

1716
03:39:33,498 --> 03:39:41,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, we should be supplied a current total by level elementary, middle, high of the number of students that have opted out of taking the MCAS thus far

1717
03:39:41,960 --> 03:39:49,524
[SPEAKER_08]: what plans are underway to provide those students with meaningful education during the time other students are taking practice in real MCAS tests.

1718
03:39:50,325 --> 03:39:53,587
[SPEAKER_08]: This information will be provided... No, it's not going away Buster.

1719
03:39:56,628 --> 03:39:58,810
[SPEAKER_08]: This information will be provided to the committee

1720
03:40:00,228 --> 03:40:13,877
[SPEAKER_08]: On February 8th, 2021, if there is insufficient time to assemble this information, then a special meeting of the Medford School Committee shall be called the week of February 15th, 2021 to provide this information offered by member Rousseau.

1721
03:40:15,178 --> 03:40:15,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1722
03:40:18,440 --> 03:40:19,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mayor.

1723
03:40:19,300 --> 03:40:25,444
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe actually that there is a document in our packets to answer most of these questions.

1724
03:40:27,955 --> 03:40:42,688
[SPEAKER_20]: I do have one question after reviewing that, and that was related to whether or not, the number of parents who have opted out of MCAS this year was surprisingly low.

1725
03:40:42,708 --> 03:40:47,132
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like I actually know more parents that are opting out than that number.

1726
03:40:48,033 --> 03:40:54,238
[SPEAKER_20]: So I guess my question was, is there a district-wide practice that the principals have all been instructed to follow

1727
03:40:55,142 --> 03:40:59,045
[SPEAKER_20]: and a documentation strategy so that they're all consistently doing it.

1728
03:40:59,685 --> 03:41:10,653
[SPEAKER_20]: I know some parents will send an email, if they know the principal well, they might just be like, hey, Suzanne, when you're a principal, don't give my kid the MCAS and be like, okay.

1729
03:41:11,554 --> 03:41:14,456
[SPEAKER_20]: And then other principals might wanna have a letter from a lawyer, just kidding.

1730
03:41:14,756 --> 03:41:22,722
[SPEAKER_20]: But my point is that without any single statement of how it has to be submitted and how it is tracked,

1731
03:41:23,315 --> 03:41:26,717
[SPEAKER_20]: I found that the three number was quite surprising.

1732
03:41:27,998 --> 03:41:40,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think that when Dr. Cushing and I were preparing this report for you, if you go on the Department of Education website, you'll find some information about MCAS in general.

1733
03:41:41,486 --> 03:41:49,311
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had to do a lot of digging to find some of the specific details because some of it has not really formally been released.

1734
03:41:50,405 --> 03:42:04,831
[SPEAKER_04]: In a phone call, we found out late Friday afternoon that the MCAS is right now just for, it's online, but it's to be taken in person.

1735
03:42:04,891 --> 03:42:06,732
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not offering a remote option.

1736
03:42:08,093 --> 03:42:11,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I do probably feel that when parents know this,

1737
03:42:13,615 --> 03:42:15,937
[SPEAKER_04]: that number will probably likely creep up.

1738
03:42:17,799 --> 03:42:36,577
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, since we just found this information out on Friday afternoon, that is some of the work that Dr. Cushing and I and central office have to now do with school leaders and as a district to figure out the logistics and the plans for how to approach

1739
03:42:40,300 --> 03:42:46,482
[SPEAKER_04]: in-person testing for the remote students or for the students that are in the remote learning model this year.

1740
03:42:48,263 --> 03:42:57,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, currently at the time, there are only three students at the elementary level and at the middle school level and the high school level, principals have not heard from parents about opting out.

1741
03:43:01,237 --> 03:43:09,984
[SPEAKER_03]: In the manner in which any parent, if they want to opt out, should be in a letter or an email, a phone call would not suffice.

1742
03:43:10,724 --> 03:43:21,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And generally speaking, opting out of the both state and federally mandated bylaw, so most states rely on the federal government.

1743
03:43:21,953 --> 03:43:28,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts has its own law for the assessment system.

1744
03:43:29,475 --> 03:43:43,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is generally speaking, not something that schools publicize or push as participation is something that schools strive for based on those laws and the accountability.

1745
03:43:43,547 --> 03:43:51,534
[SPEAKER_03]: The state this year is using MCAS purely for diagnostic reasons, but not for accountability.

1746
03:43:55,437 --> 03:44:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: But if a parent or parent caregiver were to opt out, it should be in the form of a letter or an email to the school principal.

1747
03:44:03,681 --> 03:44:04,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric?

1748
03:44:06,903 --> 03:44:08,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau?

1749
03:44:10,625 --> 03:44:24,752
[SPEAKER_20]: I would just urge that now that I have now received four different text messages from people who have confirmed they have opted out, two at the middle school and one at the high school, that maybe there needs to be some kind of a systematic approach

1750
03:44:25,342 --> 03:44:27,523
[SPEAKER_20]: principles are instructed they must use.

1751
03:44:28,303 --> 03:44:40,468
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, my memories of opting my kids out have always been like, I sent an email and nobody said boo, and that worked.

1752
03:44:41,068 --> 03:44:46,030
[SPEAKER_20]: I just find it hard to believe that, okay, I've got another one, somebody else who opted out.

1753
03:44:46,470 --> 03:44:51,652
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm not saying you didn't get numbers correctly from the people you talked to, I'm saying,

1754
03:44:52,275 --> 03:44:59,539
[SPEAKER_20]: there is not a system in place for how principals are tracking this so that when you ask, you get an answer.

1755
03:44:59,899 --> 03:45:02,521
[SPEAKER_20]: And it really shouldn't be a hard question to answer.

1756
03:45:02,721 --> 03:45:13,127
[SPEAKER_20]: And it seems really important when it comes time to the incredible efforts that they require of proctors and that whole shenanigans that the proctoring system requires.

1757
03:45:14,028 --> 03:45:21,592
[SPEAKER_20]: If they don't know who the kids are that have opted out, I mean, you're gonna end up with some pretty angry parents if they

1758
03:45:22,459 --> 03:45:27,403
[SPEAKER_20]: if you force their kid to sit in front of the computer after you've been instructed, we've been instructed, no.

1759
03:45:28,184 --> 03:45:33,388
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm just worried about that, but I'm fully confident you all can fix this.

1760
03:45:33,428 --> 03:45:36,330
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanna make sure, there's another email, sorry.

1761
03:45:38,472 --> 03:45:38,792
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1762
03:45:41,714 --> 03:45:42,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member Kreatz.

1763
03:45:46,868 --> 03:45:56,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so I had a question, I did read through the report and so from what we've all read is that DESE doesn't currently have plans to offer the remote testing option.

1764
03:45:57,295 --> 03:46:00,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the schools must plan to offer the testing in school.

1765
03:46:00,998 --> 03:46:14,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a question, will there be enough space in each classroom at each school to accommodate all the students in the cohorts taking the MCAS test while maintaining the six foot distancing?

1766
03:46:16,768 --> 03:46:22,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the logistical pieces that we are in the process of figuring out right now.

1767
03:46:23,350 --> 03:46:28,612
[SPEAKER_04]: As I had stated, we just got that information through a phone call Friday afternoon.

1768
03:46:29,172 --> 03:46:37,235
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think they're giving a lot of flexibility to that we can test each cohorts on separate days and separately.

1769
03:46:38,455 --> 03:46:41,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So cohort B and C do not have to be together.

1770
03:46:43,228 --> 03:46:44,509
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to take the test.

1771
03:46:45,489 --> 03:46:53,734
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are the logistics in terms of, as member Rousseau just mentioned, the proctors that are involved and the people that are involved.

1772
03:46:54,054 --> 03:46:56,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the pieces that we now have to figure out.

1773
03:46:59,954 --> 03:47:07,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious what it was going to look like and I know in the report that you gave us, there was a link to the test nav tutorial so that you could get a look at it.

1774
03:47:08,260 --> 03:47:20,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering if this if that link was going to be shared like in a memo, so that community could then you know take a look at what the test now tutorial looks like.

1775
03:47:20,749 --> 03:47:21,930
[SPEAKER_02]: and get a feel for it.

1776
03:47:22,070 --> 03:47:31,733
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's tools such as like a ruler, calculator, magnifying tool, a lot of different features, and you can go through it and just see what it looks like and get a feel for it.

1777
03:47:33,594 --> 03:47:33,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1778
03:47:37,335 --> 03:47:37,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1779
03:47:41,397 --> 03:47:41,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1780
03:47:42,978 --> 03:47:49,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, we have resolution in support of expedited COVID-19 vaccinations for educators.

1781
03:47:49,570 --> 03:47:51,692
[SPEAKER_08]: see email for complete texts.

1782
03:47:52,872 --> 03:47:55,994
[SPEAKER_08]: See a text offered by member Graham and member Ruseau.

1783
03:47:56,435 --> 03:47:57,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1784
03:47:58,576 --> 03:48:05,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I would be willing to not read, forego the reading of this resolution if the members have actually read it.

1785
03:48:06,061 --> 03:48:12,126
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't, if there are questions and we're gonna get into it, then I would certainly be fine with reading it.

1786
03:48:12,206 --> 03:48:14,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise I would be happy to skip it and just summarize it.

1787
03:48:16,248 --> 03:48:17,309
[SPEAKER_20]: How does the membership feel?

1788
03:48:17,850 --> 03:48:18,330
[SPEAKER_20]: That'd be great.

1789
03:48:20,533 --> 03:48:25,034
[SPEAKER_20]: So this resolution was a resolution offered by some other school committees.

1790
03:48:25,734 --> 03:48:35,457
[SPEAKER_20]: It is urging the state delegation and federal delegation to prioritize teachers for COVID vaccination.

1791
03:48:36,217 --> 03:48:40,898
[SPEAKER_20]: There is a very interesting dashboard that shows the whole country and where teachers are.

1792
03:48:41,198 --> 03:48:48,260
[SPEAKER_20]: And in Massachusetts, like much of Massachusetts is rollout of the vaccine, we are not in a good place

1793
03:48:48,956 --> 03:48:53,478
[SPEAKER_20]: And teachers are not presently on the list of people that can be vaccinated.

1794
03:48:54,179 --> 03:48:58,741
[SPEAKER_20]: The amount of nonstop, what about the kids?

1795
03:48:59,521 --> 03:49:01,422
[SPEAKER_20]: What about the loss of learning time?

1796
03:49:01,442 --> 03:49:03,103
[SPEAKER_20]: What about all this stuff?

1797
03:49:03,163 --> 03:49:11,107
[SPEAKER_20]: And then to not prioritize teachers so that they can go to school and teach our kids is really just almost incomprehensible.

1798
03:49:12,328 --> 03:49:14,529
[SPEAKER_20]: So this resolution urges that.

1799
03:49:14,929 --> 03:49:17,991
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would ask that we also put this up on

1800
03:49:19,786 --> 03:49:26,596
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure if it's up on the website in the packet of documents, but should the public want to read the entire resolution?

1801
03:49:29,580 --> 03:49:30,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you members.

1802
03:49:30,221 --> 03:49:31,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So member McLaughlin.

1803
03:49:33,642 --> 03:49:34,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1804
03:49:34,882 --> 03:49:39,004
[SPEAKER_09]: And so urges, thank you for putting this forward.

1805
03:49:39,024 --> 03:49:42,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to clarify for the community urges to whom.

1806
03:49:42,625 --> 03:49:47,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So I believe MASC put this out as a recommendation.

1807
03:49:47,627 --> 03:49:51,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So is this something that we're putting back to MASC and adding our name to a list?

1808
03:49:51,908 --> 03:49:54,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we sending this to the state delegation ourselves?

1809
03:49:54,309 --> 03:50:00,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what actually are you suggesting who this goes to?

1810
03:50:04,512 --> 03:50:04,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Governor.

1811
03:50:04,872 --> 03:50:06,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1812
03:50:06,634 --> 03:50:07,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this a letter to the governor?

1813
03:50:10,057 --> 03:50:10,597
[SPEAKER_20]: My apologies.

1814
03:50:10,657 --> 03:50:11,138
[SPEAKER_20]: I was needed.

1815
03:50:11,878 --> 03:50:12,899
[SPEAKER_20]: It is one second.

1816
03:50:12,979 --> 03:50:18,484
[SPEAKER_20]: I have just accidentally closed my list of PDFs for today.

1817
03:50:18,504 --> 03:50:18,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Um,

1818
03:50:33,025 --> 03:51:02,541
[SPEAKER_20]: calls on the state legislature, the governor, item number three directs the superintendent to transmit official copies of this resolution to the commissioner of Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the governor of Massachusetts, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Edward Markey, Congresswoman Catherine Clark, State Senator Pat Jalen, State Representative Paul Donato, Sean Garbally, and Christine Barber, and also to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

1819
03:51:03,206 --> 03:51:09,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, the number two on the list is to urge the M. A. S. C. To actually advocate for this.

1820
03:51:09,150 --> 03:51:10,191
[SPEAKER_20]: They are not presently.

1821
03:51:10,852 --> 03:51:15,255
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a presently a campaign of theirs to try to get this to happen.

1822
03:51:16,196 --> 03:51:17,497
[SPEAKER_20]: Um So.

1823
03:51:22,700 --> 03:51:24,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Great emotion on the floor by

1824
03:51:32,360 --> 03:51:32,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz?

1825
03:51:37,204 --> 03:51:37,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1826
03:51:38,865 --> 03:51:39,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

1827
03:51:39,646 --> 03:51:39,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1828
03:51:39,926 --> 03:51:40,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone?

1829
03:51:40,886 --> 03:51:41,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1830
03:51:42,368 --> 03:51:43,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

1831
03:51:44,229 --> 03:51:44,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1832
03:51:45,590 --> 03:51:46,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van der Kloot?

1833
03:51:46,791 --> 03:51:47,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1834
03:51:48,392 --> 03:51:49,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1835
03:51:49,633 --> 03:51:50,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely yes.

1836
03:51:50,954 --> 03:51:52,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1837
03:51:52,755 --> 03:51:53,736
[SPEAKER_08]: The paper passes.

1838
03:51:54,136 --> 03:51:54,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cushing?

1839
03:51:55,947 --> 03:52:02,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Mayor, I just wanted to take a second as I just saw something come across my Facebook feed relating to the MCAS.

1840
03:52:04,469 --> 03:52:08,310
[SPEAKER_03]: For high school students, there's still a graduation requirement.

1841
03:52:09,631 --> 03:52:18,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just implore secondary parents to stay tuned as more information comes out around this, but I noticed a message

1842
03:52:19,535 --> 03:52:25,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying about all students that are going to take it, but anyone can opt out.

1843
03:52:26,057 --> 03:52:29,578
[SPEAKER_03]: This is still a graduation requirement for high school students.

1844
03:52:30,378 --> 03:52:38,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And to please await as we are waiting for more information from DESE that I'm sure will be coming out very shortly.

1845
03:52:38,980 --> 03:52:44,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want high school students or parents to think that the graduation requirement has been waived.

1846
03:52:45,938 --> 03:52:53,764
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making changes to competency determinations and a number of other things relating to MCAS at the high school level.

1847
03:52:54,345 --> 03:53:02,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will provide clear and comprehensive information on this moving forward for our students and families.

1848
03:53:02,331 --> 03:53:06,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want there to be any misconceptions about the graduation requirement.

1849
03:53:09,276 --> 03:53:10,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1850
03:53:12,899 --> 03:53:14,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, we have our

1851
03:53:15,853 --> 03:53:17,134
[SPEAKER_08]: School Committee condolences.

1852
03:53:18,394 --> 03:53:28,019
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Frank D'Alessio, the technology repair specialist for the Medford Public Schools.

1853
03:53:28,500 --> 03:53:31,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. D'Alessio was a 14-year district employee.

1854
03:53:31,821 --> 03:53:32,942
[SPEAKER_08]: He will be sorely missed.

1855
03:53:34,723 --> 03:53:42,867
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of John F. Bailey, a World War II veteran and member of the Mustang Hall of Fame.

1856
03:53:44,532 --> 03:53:56,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Norma L. Lasky, aunt of Fred Lasky, director of the MWRA, and Donna Lasky, a McGlynn Elementary school teacher.

1857
03:53:57,794 --> 03:54:11,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Kerry Honeycutt-Royce, niece of longtime Medford Public Schools supporter and owner of John Brewer's Tavern, Bill Honeycutt.
