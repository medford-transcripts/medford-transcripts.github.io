1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:03,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's settle down.

2
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:09,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

3
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:09,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Good afternoon.

4
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:17,021
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to welcome you all to our Women's History Assembly regarding the month that we've been recognizing.

5
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:20,524
[SPEAKER_12]: We have some people in the audience I'd like to recognize individually.

6
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,167
[SPEAKER_12]: We have State Representative Paul Donato here.

7
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:31,838
[SPEAKER_12]: City Councilman, Mr. Rick Caraviello.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,541
[SPEAKER_12]: School Committee Member, Mellie McLaughlin.

9
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:48,465
[SPEAKER_12]: The amazing women I have behind me on the stage that will be individually introduced.

10
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:54,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to give a special thank you to, hold on,

11
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,739
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to give a special thank you to Ms.

12
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:00,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Walker, our House M Assistant Principal.

13
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:09,610
[SPEAKER_12]: As well as Ms.

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Lisa Evangelista, our Medford Public School Relations Coordinator, for all the efforts they did to create this assembly, so thank you.

15
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:33,248
[SPEAKER_12]: So Women's History Month is a time to reflect the courage of women in past generations in how to celebrate their efforts and bravery afforded women opportunities and freedoms that we have today.

16
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:44,797
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a time to reflect often overlooked contributions of women in the United States history, a timeline that strikes back all the way before the United States was actually established.

17
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,763
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have a little story before we get started.

18
00:01:48,323 --> 00:02:00,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of you know I taught chemistry, and one of the things that I always stuck, that I always remember is when I was in biology class, they taught us about the double helix in DNA, and hopefully a lot of you remember that as well.

19
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,532
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was given credit to two men, James Watson and Francis Crick.

20
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:09,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Francis, sorry, Francis Crick, yes.

21
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:29,180
[SPEAKER_12]: And what people don't know is that even though they got the credit for it, there was a woman named Rosalind Franklin that did all the background work, that did all the x-ray technology, and didn't get that much credit for it, the two gentlemen did.

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,126
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of a theme of how powerful genders can be and what they contribute here to society.

23
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:43,033
[SPEAKER_12]: That being said, I'm gonna leave you with a quote, and then we're gonna move on.

24
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:56,878
[SPEAKER_12]: So a quote that I just recently saw that struck my mind is, a strong woman knows she has the strength for the journey, but it's a woman of strength knows that it's journey where she will become stronger.

25
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:04,140
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like to again welcome everyone, and I'm gonna turn this over to our superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent.

26
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:11,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.

27
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:14,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try that again.

28
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:15,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.

29
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.

30
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:18,285
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

31
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:22,266
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here for this wonderful, auspicious event today.

32
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:25,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so many phenomenal women on the stage.

33
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:32,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to steal the thunder, because I know we have many students that have practiced and are prepared to read their opening remarks.

34
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:35,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to say a special thank you to Ms.

35
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Walker and to Ms.

36
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:43,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Evangelista for all of their coordination efforts in getting this special event off today.

37
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:49,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say I'm very happy to be part of this panel and to be able to celebrate the positive contributions of women.

38
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank all of our special guests, but I also thank you, the audience.

39
00:03:54,671 --> 00:04:02,834
[SPEAKER_01]: We've received wonderful questions, and we look forward to hearing from all of you, staff and students, and anyone else who's here.

40
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just say thank you for supporting us.

41
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:10,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in true style, if I say Medford, you say Mustangs.

42
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:11,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford?

43
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:11,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Mustangs!

44
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:13,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford?

45
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:15,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford.

46
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:17,558
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, good job.

47
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:18,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

48
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:28,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to just invite our mayor up, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, who's part of the panel today, and she also has a few opening remarks.

49
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:34,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

50
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:36,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

51
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Good afternoon, everybody.

52
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:44,943
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an honor to be here with you today, celebrating women and sharing stories about our lives and careers.

53
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:50,648
[SPEAKER_17]: I thank the superintendent and the team at Medford High School for putting this wonderful event together.

54
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:58,875
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a secret that there are barriers and challenges that attempt to prevent women from achieving our deserved place as equals in society.

55
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:07,902
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I could tell you that by the time you students are ready to face the world outside these walls, you'll be met with recognition and support in all your endeavors.

56
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:10,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, that's not the case.

57
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:16,853
[SPEAKER_17]: You will be faced with adversity, with roadblocks, and with situations that are just frankly unfair.

58
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:23,614
[SPEAKER_17]: But as you'll hear from women here today, there is no reason for that to be accepted as an outcome.

59
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:31,856
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to be your own advocate, and above all, you must believe that your worth is not measured by anybody other than yourself.

60
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:36,337
[SPEAKER_17]: These are hard lessons, and it takes a lot of tough situations to learn them.

61
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:47,141
[SPEAKER_17]: But what you hear today from strong women who have repeatedly crashed through the glass ceilings, toughness is not attributed to just one gender.

62
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:47,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

63
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:51,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are ready for our student introductions of invited guests.

65
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

66
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

67
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:14,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Good afternoon, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

68
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,713
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Nadine Al-Kurdi, and I'm a ninth grader at the Medford High School.

69
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:27,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to the Women's History Month Assembly, an assembly dedicated to the acknowledgment of the accomplished women in Medford who have come to attend the gathering today.

70
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:36,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Our MHS students and peers will represent the astounding woman, and there will be an interview afterward for the sponsors.

71
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, and I will now begin the presentation.

72
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,805
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

73
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:45,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,804

85
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:15,725

[SPEAKER_06]: Her market is busy, working moms, educators, healthcare professionals, and post-graduate students, and she prides herself on creating a place where they can come to relax, feel beautiful, confident, and empowered.

92
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:04,210
[SPEAKER_06]: While her services are high-impact, they do not take all day.

93
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Paige is a master esthetician, laser technician, certified in spray tins, and hydrafacials.

[SPEAKER_06]: Paige happily resides with her family in the same Medford neighborhood as the shop.

99
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:37,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Supporting this community is incredible for her.

100
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, Paige Baldini, can you please stand?

101
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

102
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:50,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, guys.

103
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Alex Crowley, and I'm a senior at Medford High.

107
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:14,519
[SPEAKER_04]: She has been on CBS Channel 4 ever since.

108
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:17,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiffany is famous for asking lawmakers like the governor

109
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,201
[SPEAKER_04]: the hard questions.

110
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:24,404
[SPEAKER_04]: This means she strives to provide a full story, even if that means chasing a person for the interview.

[SPEAKER_04]: Tiffany is a proud graduate of Suffolk University and a member of the Asian American Journal Association.

[SPEAKER_04]: They have formed a bond of a lifetime.

116
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:53,586
[SPEAKER_04]: They do fun things together, like going bowling and having ice cream parties prior to midterms exams.

117
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely puts life perspective for all.

118
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:57,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiffany Chan, can you stand up?

119
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:11,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Marliana, and I'm a freshman here at Medford High School.

120
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be reading the biography of Jamie Chia.

121
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:16,589

126
00:11:51,307 --> 00:12:07,661
[SPEAKER_07]: She then served as a director of the high-throughput scientist facility at the Koch Institute of MIT for eight years, where she oversaw a facility outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and helped scientists design and execute their experiments in a larger, faster, more frivolous way.

127
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Jamie Chia, can you please stand up?

128
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:26,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Helen Lucas, a junior at Medford High School, and I'll be reading the biography of Congresswoman Catherine Clark.

129
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:40,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Since 2013, Catherine Clark has proudly represented Massachusetts' vibrant Fifth District, which stretches from the coastal communities of Revere and Winthrop through the northern Boston suburbs to the thriving towns of Metro West.

130
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:48,557
[SPEAKER_11]: In the fall of 2022, Clark was elected by her colleagues to serve as Democratic Whip, the second most senior position in the House Democratic Caucus.

131
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:57,761
[SPEAKER_11]: She previously served as Assistant Speaker of the House, as Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, and as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.

132
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:06,825
[SPEAKER_11]: One of only two women to ever serve as whip, she currently has the distinction of being the highest ranking woman in congressional leadership.

133
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:13,408
[SPEAKER_11]: From the school board to Capitol Hill, Clark's public service has been fueled by a passion for lifting up women and families.

134
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:25,236
[SPEAKER_11]: She is a leading proponent for ending wage discrimination, safeguarding access to abortion, ending gun violence, improving access to affordable, accessible child care, and guaranteeing paid leave.

00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:27,202

214
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:09,308
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give them an individual credit at the end of the assembly.

215
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, Q&A for our panelists.

216
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:21,299
[SPEAKER_11]: So for each question, we have about two to three minutes to answer.

217
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:33,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Our first question we have is, how did you navigate power structures early in your career versus later in your career when you had a more formal leadership role?

218
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,121
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can just raise your hand and anyone can answer.

219
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

220
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:41,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to answer all of the questions.

221
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:49,028
[SPEAKER_03]: We're thinking about the time, but if you would like to answer any questions that are posed, just raise your hand and you have about two to three minutes to respond.

222
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:50,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

223
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll read it, okay.

224
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:56,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

225
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:04,567
[SPEAKER_11]: How did you navigate power structures early in your career versus later in your career when you had a more formal leadership role?

226
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:17,228
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, so surface warfare officer means my job in the Navy is to fight and drive ships.

227
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:20,109
[SPEAKER_23]: So I actually was put into a leadership position right off the bat.

228
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:28,050
[SPEAKER_23]: As soon as I graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the Navy, I showed up to my first ship and was handed a division of sailors that were completely my responsibility.

229
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:33,311
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I started very early in my career with that and being in a chain of command.

230
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,652
[SPEAKER_23]: That's how the Navy is structured.

231
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:36,552
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a very linear system.

232
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:40,273
[SPEAKER_23]: And so the great thing is when you're in that, you give orders and people follow them.

233
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,348
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's pretty easy, which makes it nice.

234
00:25:43,368 --> 00:25:50,895
[SPEAKER_23]: Today, I'm responsible for everything on USS Constitution, the same if I was the captain of any ship in the Navy right now.

235
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:55,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Everything that happens is completely on my shoulders, my responsibility, and my decision.

236
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:02,485
[SPEAKER_23]: So the responsibilities just expanded as I progressed up the ranks, but they have definitely always been there.

237
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:04,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

238
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:25,576
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I had a very different experience coming into Congress.

239
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:29,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the most junior person in the minority.

240
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,398
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I came in in a special election.

241
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:41,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are 435 members of the House of Representatives, and we also are strict hierarchy.

242
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,302
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have official pins, and on the back of the pin, it tells you what number you are.

243
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,543
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I might be 434, 435.

244
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:53,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 474.

245
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was in negative numbers, my seniority.

246
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:05,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if they retired numbers of great members of Congress or exactly what was going on.

247
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,391
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had less than no authority.

248
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:14,497
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to make sure that I was getting things done for my district and Medford.

249
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are a very male-dominated Congress.

250
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:27,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I found worked for me was trying to find those common ground interests.

251
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:38,319
[SPEAKER_00]: and working from there, and forming relationships with people who could help me help my communities, even if we disagreed on a lot of other things.

252
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:52,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those issues that really came forward was working around the opioid crisis, because it was as devastating in a blue state of Massachusetts as it was in Kentucky

253
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:59,575
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ohio and some places that look very different politically and economically than back home.

254
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:11,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And found that building those relationships helped me develop the support system and the connections to be able to deliver.

255
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:17,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And also helped me keep the base that now when I have a leadership role,

256
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:37,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I really know the members in my caucus and can help put together and keep drawing on those common interests so that people see you as a leader because you really understand what they need and what the issues are facing their particular district at home.

257
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

258
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:53,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to say, as a young lawyer, you feel like you don't know anything, and you probably don't.

259
00:28:53,756 --> 00:29:02,181
[SPEAKER_19]: When I was at my first job, I spent a lot of time shadowing people, asking questions, trying to figure out how the system worked.

260
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:09,016
[SPEAKER_19]: trying to do any of the assignments that I was given, just do the very best I could with them.

261
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:12,318
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I was learning more and more.

262
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,499
[SPEAKER_19]: I was given more responsibility.

263
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:26,584
[SPEAKER_19]: And as I became higher up, I still find that I'm asking people questions to find out how other people feel about certain issues.

264
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:30,446
[SPEAKER_19]: And I find that it's very helpful to collaborate with people

265
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:35,079
[SPEAKER_19]: And in that way, I feel like we come to some of the better solutions.

266
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,140
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's one of the things that I would let you know.

267
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:53,986
[SPEAKER_15]: For our next question, how do you push for systematic change around ideas that are new or are not that popular?

268
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Tiffany Chan from Channel 4.

269
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:06,375
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's really interesting.

270
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:10,837
[SPEAKER_22]: One of my first roles was in state politics, and I was one of the only women doing it.

271
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:16,979
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's a lot of asking tough questions, finding your own stories, finding problems and solutions.

272
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,042
[SPEAKER_22]: One, finding your confidence in going out and doing kind of what's seen as a man's role.

273
00:30:24,102 --> 00:30:27,343
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember walking around the statehouse, no offense to Rep.

274
00:30:27,363 --> 00:30:32,766
[SPEAKER_22]: Paul Donato, but I was thinking, these men in suits are old enough to be my dad.

275
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:37,408
[SPEAKER_22]: I was 21 at the time, figuring out how I fit into this whole scenario.

276
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:41,150
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think a lot of it is finding your own confidence, finding your own voice.

277
00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:44,133
[SPEAKER_22]: and basically pushing through the nerves.

278
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:46,817
[SPEAKER_22]: The last year I was at this event, I know D.A.

279
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:55,468
[SPEAKER_22]: Ryan said a very, very important quote that actually stuck out to me, and is that we need to find our own talents, our own strengths, and own it ourselves.

280
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:59,754
[SPEAKER_22]: And especially as women, she was saying how sometimes we're our own worst critics.

281
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:04,395
[SPEAKER_22]: So to find our own strengths, find confidence in that, and really push forward.

282
00:31:04,435 --> 00:31:07,555
[SPEAKER_22]: And some of these roles that people see as, you know, men's jobs.

283
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:19,378
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's how we find our voice, and that's how we kind of push through and make sure that the things that we think are important are reflected in, you know, our communities, on television, here in the courts, in politics.

284
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:20,278
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yeah.

285
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:27,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Anna.

286
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:37,899
[SPEAKER_17]: As a female leader, I think you have to lead by example and you also have to break through the status quo and how things

287
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:40,074
[SPEAKER_17]: maybe were run in the past.

288
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:52,059
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I became mayor three years ago, I promised myself that I would always do what was right no matter what, no matter if it cost me votes or led to somebody being unhappy.

289
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:53,620
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll just give you an example.

290
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Systematic change, changing the system, part of that is the hiring process and making sure we have a diverse

291
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:03,624
[SPEAKER_17]: staff, especially within City Hall and our school department.

292
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:14,366
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had to interview for a position in the city, and I was stuck with, I had two candidates left that got moved to my office for the final interview.

293
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:29,550
[SPEAKER_17]: One was a Medford resident who, I knew her children, and one was a resident, it was not a resident, and it was a woman that was more qualified and spoke a second language.

294
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:38,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew I would get a little pushback, potentially, for not picking the candidate that was a Medford resident that I knew personally, and I did.

295
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:43,884
[SPEAKER_17]: I chose the candidate that had more experience and that spoke a second language, because that's what Medford needs.

296
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:45,586
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to embrace diversity.

297
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:49,770
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to have a culture where City Hall represents the entire city.

298
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:51,853
[SPEAKER_17]: So, breaking through the status quo.

299
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:01,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you ever felt the imposter syndrome?

300
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:03,333
[SPEAKER_14]: And if so, how did you navigate your way through it?

301
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:09,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like to take this one?

302
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:13,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

303
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:18,869
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I definitely have experienced quite a bit of imposter syndrome.

304
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:28,254
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sure this will resonate with some of the students here, but I came from a very poor biracial family with low education levels.

305
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:31,516
[SPEAKER_20]: So growing up in San Antonio, Texas was always challenging.

306
00:33:31,536 --> 00:33:35,998
[SPEAKER_20]: I went to a great school, but I definitely was from a bad neighborhood.

307
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:38,800
[SPEAKER_20]: So that kind of impacted my life growing up.

308
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,162
[SPEAKER_20]: But then as I got into college at Boston University,

309
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:57,863
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely had the fake it till you make it idea, and that not being, you know, fake who I am as a person or not remembering where I came from, but really just trying to learn and educate myself on how kind of things work, especially, you know,

310
00:33:58,223 --> 00:34:22,776
[SPEAKER_20]: socially, professionally, and from there I wound up developing, you know, a personal board of directors that I've kind of kept and changed in and out my entire life of people that could help me understand, you know, what's going on or how to get to the next level in my professional development or what education maneuvers I should be taking to really better myself, what progress and growth and professional development would help.

311
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:31,279
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something that I would say find people around you that will support you, that you can lean on, that can really help you get to the next level in your life.

312
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:39,462
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to be one of the most important pieces of helping you kind of navigate away from feeling like an imposter, especially in certain, you know, situations.

313
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:46,204
[SPEAKER_20]: And really just continue to educate and grow and, you know, always just think about helping others around you.

314
00:34:46,224 --> 00:34:47,765
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's also helped me quite a bit.

315
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:48,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

316
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,605
[SPEAKER_13]: I tell you what, this never gets easy.

317
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:58,212
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very nerve wracking being up here.

318
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Anybody in the room have TikTok?

319
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:01,887
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

320
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:03,228
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

321
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:10,052
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm considered somebody who's TikTok famous, and TikTok is a place that just lives with imposter syndrome.

322
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:13,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm also 40 years old in the makeup community.

323
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:17,596
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have learned to live my life by three simple phrases.

324
00:35:18,097 --> 00:35:20,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Do it scared, do it afraid, and do it anyways.

325
00:35:21,259 --> 00:35:28,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's so many people out there that are wanting to do exactly what it is that you're trying to do, but they're too scared to do it.

326
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:37,051
[SPEAKER_13]: So for me, it's a huge place to feel like you have imposter syndrome because the makeup influencer community is 20 years old.

327
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:38,492
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, hi, Alex Earl.

328
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:39,693
[SPEAKER_13]: She's so sweet.

329
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:41,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I've actually met her and traveled with her.

330
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:47,360
[SPEAKER_13]: But as a 40-year-old mom of two, small business owner, it can be a really scary place to kind of get yourself out there.

331
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,744
[SPEAKER_13]: So I always sit down and take a deep breath and tell myself, I'm scared, I'm afraid, but I'm going to do it anyway.

332
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:59,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if I reach one person out there that motivates them to do the same thing that I'm doing, then my job here is done.

333
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:06,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

334
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:15,867
[SPEAKER_18]: So I worked in the field of science, which you can imagine is up to now still a very male-dominated field.

335
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:18,150
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also full of Nobel Prize winners.

336
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I literally worked in buildings full of Nobel Prize winners, so imposter syndrome is a thing.

337
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:24,959
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's two things I really remember.

338
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:38,488
[SPEAKER_18]: One is what Tiffany said, finding your own confidence and understanding that you may be surrounded by all these amazing people, but you have worth too, and they're coming to see you because you know something that they don't, and they need your help.

339
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:39,948
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other thing is to...

340
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:46,034
[SPEAKER_18]: figure out that, and this is hard at a young age, it doesn't matter what other people think about you.

341
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:54,162
[SPEAKER_18]: You, as Tiffany said, you find that you are your own worst critic, and you project onto others what they think negatively about you.

342
00:36:54,242 --> 00:37:00,569
[SPEAKER_18]: So you need to push that behind you and realize that you are worth it, you are confident, and they need you.

343
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,451
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's how you push past imposter syndrome.

344
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:07,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

345
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,096
[SPEAKER_15]: We're running out of time.

346
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:11,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So now we're going to move on to our audience Q&A.

347
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:15,260
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can raise your hand and me and Lena will come over.

348
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:30,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Our first question.

349
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:34,530
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had any words to your younger self, what would it be?

350
00:37:57,103 --> 00:38:01,106
[SPEAKER_13]: If I had any words for my younger self, so I grew up pretty poor on welfare.

351
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:05,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I grew up in Revere, not too far from here, and I was just like a walking statistic.

352
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,350
[SPEAKER_13]: My mom has been married and divorced four times.

353
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:16,475
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I have all of the odds working against me, and it was really hard to have any type of confidence in yourself to make something of yourself.

354
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:18,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Couldn't afford to go to college.

355
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:21,419
[SPEAKER_13]: I did graduate high school right in Stoneham, so not too far.

356
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:27,044
[SPEAKER_13]: And the only advice that I ever would have given myself is to just believe that you can do it.

357
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:30,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I always knew I had something inside me that was a little bit different.

358
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:32,308
[SPEAKER_13]: I always had creative ideas.

359
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I always, like, wanted to start some type of business selling lemonade when I was a little kid.

360
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:48,411
[SPEAKER_13]: And you really just have to have that deep core belief in yourself that you're strong enough to do it and that you will be successful as long as you put your head down, stay in your own lane, and flex that hustle muscle.

361
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:58,583
[SPEAKER_22]: The message I would give my younger self is to embrace the things that make me different.

362
00:38:58,763 --> 00:38:59,984
[SPEAKER_22]: I grew up in Florida.

363
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:06,091
[SPEAKER_22]: I went to a private school where people did not look like me and they certainly didn't sound like me.

364
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:07,934
[SPEAKER_22]: English was not my first language.

365
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:08,915
[SPEAKER_22]: Chinese was.

366
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:13,360
[SPEAKER_22]: So having different cultural experiences growing up in high school.

367
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:17,865
[SPEAKER_22]: Those were the things that I really tried to kind of suppress in many ways.

368
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:31,463
[SPEAKER_22]: So when I got into news and I saw that people on TV really didn't look like me, it wasn't until probably about the last year or so that I really embraced my culture, my voice connecting with the Asian community, being the voice for them.

369
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:40,790
[SPEAKER_22]: So something that I really used to, I don't want to say be ashamed of, but just try to hide a little bit more because it made me different is really what's making me stand out in the news industry today.

370
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:45,594
[SPEAKER_22]: So really try to embrace the things that make you special would be my advice for my younger self.

371
00:39:52,569 --> 00:40:07,205
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, one piece of advice that I would give to myself if I could rewind the clock back would be to have taken even greater advantage of all the different opportunities that were before me starting in high school.

372
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:10,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I do wish that I had played more sports.

373
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in drama, I was reading, I was more kind of on the academic side.

374
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:20,651
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do wish that I had pushed myself in other areas just to be exposed to other people.

375
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:29,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the more that you're exposed to, the more well-rounded you are, and the better it is for you in the end to be able to interact with all different kinds of people.

376
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:31,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I would say.

377
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:35,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Take advantage of all of the opportunities that are here, because you don't get a redo of high school.

378
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So take advantage of it.

379
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:39,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

380
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would tell my younger self and all of you that failure is not always bad.

381
00:40:53,816 --> 00:41:06,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you're going to do stuff, you're going to bomb out, you're going to fail, you're going to be embarrassed, you're going to wish you had not tried, but it is where you're going to find your joy and your passion.

382
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:09,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And failing at something often teaches you the most.

383
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:11,870
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the risk.

384
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:13,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your joy.

385
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:15,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your life mission.

386
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:16,734
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd tell myself.

387
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:22,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

388
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to wrap up here.

389
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,641
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have two minutes.

390
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:25,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

391
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that the bios would take that long, and we tried to cut them down, too.

392
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:31,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again, panelists, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

393
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:40,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to say anything?

394
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:41,194
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

395
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:42,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass the mic.

396
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:43,626
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

397
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:47,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I just want to repeat what a lot of people have said.

398
00:41:47,708 --> 00:42:00,152
[SPEAKER_16]: I am a professor in electrical and computer engineering, and my entire life was trying to figure out how do I join my passions of

399
00:42:00,572 --> 00:42:29,806
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, art and electrical engineering and science, and I really didn't think these were things that could be joined together as one thing, and a lot of people told me that that wasn't possible, but I am today, you know, doing my own research and guiding my own research lab, doing exactly what I kind of wanted to do, joining those passions of art and light and how do we control those things on a computer chip.

400
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:42,554
[SPEAKER_16]: And so what everyone has said about kind of embracing those kind of passions and differences and outside thinking that you think is weird is exactly what's going to make you successful one day.

401
00:42:42,574 --> 00:42:43,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

402
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:49,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Please stay seated.

403
00:42:49,386 --> 00:42:50,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the bell is going to ring in a minute.

404
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:52,048
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to go over a few minutes.

405
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:53,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So please stay seated when the bell rings.

406
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be super quick.

407
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:55,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Paige.

408
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I own a skincare salon in Medford.

409
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just so grateful for the opportunity to be here, but for all of you.

411
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So

412
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:16,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi there, I know you all have to run, but thank you so much for you guys for being here.

413
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:41,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Something for my younger self is, even now, I'm almost 40, I own my own skincare salon, like I said, being up here makes me nervous, but to keep trying new things, because I had a bunch of great opportunities, a bunch of job opportunities that I did before I owned my own business that I didn't love, but from doing that, I got to learn, like Congresswoman Clark, what many of these women have said, is just keep trying, and if you can find something that you find joy in,

414
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:43,260
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not work, it's fun.

415
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you guys so much.

416
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:46,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

417
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:52,024

419
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:56,246

[SPEAKER_03]: Just want to give them another round of applause, please, before we leave.
