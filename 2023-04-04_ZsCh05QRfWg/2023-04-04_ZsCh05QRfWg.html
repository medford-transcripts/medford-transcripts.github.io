    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=0.385s">Okay,</a>  ladies and gentlemen, let's settle down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=7.372s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=9.274s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=10.375s">I'd</a>  like to welcome you all to our Women's History Assembly regarding the month that we've been recognizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=17.862s">We</a>  have some people in the audience I'd like to recognize individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=21.105s">We</a>  have State Representative Paul Donato here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=30.077s">City</a>  Councilman, Mr. Rick Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=37.5s">School</a>  Committee Member, Mellie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=44.363s">The</a>  amazing women I have behind me on the stage that will be individually introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=52.387s">I'd</a>  like to give a special thank you to, hold on, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=57.318s">I'd</a>  like to give a special thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=58.779s">Walker,</a>  our House M Assistant Principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=68.729s">As</a>  well as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=69.67s">Lisa</a>  Evangelista, our Medford Public School Relations Coordinator, for all the efforts they did to create this assembly, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=80.919s">So</a>  Women's History Month is a time to reflect the courage of women in past generations in how to celebrate their efforts and bravery afforded women opportunities and freedoms that we have today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=94.189s">It's</a>  a time to reflect often overlooked contributions of women in the United States history, a timeline that strikes back all the way before the United States was actually established. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=105.882s">So</a>  I have a little story before we get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=108.323s">Most</a>  of you know I taught chemistry, and one of the things that I always stuck, that I always remember is when I was in biology class, they taught us about the double helix in DNA, and hopefully a lot of you remember that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=121.61s">But</a>  it was given credit to two men, James Watson and Francis Crick. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=127.473s">Francis,</a>  sorry, Francis Crick, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=131.446s">And</a>  what people don't know is that even though they got the credit for it, there was a woman named Rosalind Franklin that did all the background work, that did all the x-ray technology, and didn't get that much credit for it, the two gentlemen did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=149.92s">So</a>  it's kind of a theme of how powerful genders can be and what they contribute here to society. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=159.312s">That</a>  being said, I'm gonna leave you with a quote, and then we're gonna move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=164.794s">So</a>  a quote that I just recently saw that struck my mind is, a strong woman knows she has the strength for the journey, but it's a woman of strength knows that it's journey where she will become stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=178.038s">So</a>  I'd like to again welcome everyone, and I'm gonna turn this over to our superintendent, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=190.543s">Good</a>  afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=193.404s">Let's</a>  try that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=194.404s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=195.264s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=198.125s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=198.325s">We're</a>  here for this wonderful, auspicious event today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=202.426s">We</a>  have so many phenomenal women on the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=205.986s">I'm</a>  not going to steal the thunder, because I know we have many students that have practiced and are prepared to read their opening remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=212.948s">I</a>  do want to say a special thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=215.351s">Walker</a>  and to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=216.553s">Evangelista</a>  for all of their coordination efforts in getting this special event off today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=223.662s">I</a>  want to say I'm very happy to be part of this panel and to be able to celebrate the positive contributions of women. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=230.49s">I</a>  thank all of our special guests, but I also thank you, the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=234.671s">We've</a>  received wonderful questions, and we look forward to hearing from all of you, staff and students, and anyone else who's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=242.974s">I</a>  want to just say thank you for supporting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=245.575s">And</a>  just in true style, if I say Medford, you say Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=250.716s">Medford?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=251.176s">Mustangs!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=252.737s">Medford?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=254.736s">Medford.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=256.477s">All</a>  right, good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=258.198s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=258.679s">I</a>  would like to just invite our mayor up, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, who's part of the panel today, and she also has a few opening remarks.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=274.609s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=275.029s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=276.85s">Good</a>  afternoon, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=279.679s">It's</a>  an honor to be here with you today, celebrating women and sharing stories about our lives and careers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=284.963s">I</a>  thank the superintendent and the team at Medford High School for putting this wonderful event together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=291.449s">It's</a>  not a secret that there are barriers and challenges that attempt to prevent women from achieving our deserved place as equals in society. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=298.895s">I</a>  wish I could tell you that by the time you students are ready to face the world outside these walls, you'll be met with recognition and support in all your endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=309.224s">Unfortunately,</a>  that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=311.146s">You</a>  will be faced with adversity, with roadblocks, and with situations that are just frankly unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=318.632s">But</a>  as you'll hear from women here today, there is no reason for that to be accepted as an outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=324.554s">You</a>  have to be your own advocate, and above all, you must believe that your worth is not measured by anybody other than yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=332.956s">These</a>  are hard lessons, and it takes a lot of tough situations to learn them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=336.838s">But</a>  what you hear today from strong women who have repeatedly crashed through the glass ceilings, toughness is not attributed to just one gender.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=347.601s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=350.492s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=354.8s">And</a>  so we are ready for our student introductions of invited guests.</p>

    <p>[Billie J.

    <p>[Helen Lucas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1564.467s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Katherine Clark]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1581.795s">So,</a>  I had a very different experience coming into Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1585.956s">I</a>  was the most junior person in the minority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1590.917s">So,</a>  I came in in a special election. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1594.038s">So,</a>  there are 435 members of the House of Representatives, and we also are strict hierarchy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1601.96s">So</a>  we have official pins, and on the back of the pin, it tells you what number you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1607.882s">So</a>  I thought I might be 434, 435. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1612.364s">I</a>  was 474. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1615.405s">So</a>  it was in negative numbers, my seniority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1619.047s">I</a>  didn't know if they retired numbers of great members of Congress or exactly what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1625.87s">But</a>  I had less than no authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1629.531s">But</a>  I wanted to make sure that I was getting things done for my district and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1635.278s">And</a>  we are a very male-dominated Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1639.943s">And</a>  so what I found worked for me was trying to find those common ground interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1647.892s">and</a>  working from there, and forming relationships with people who could help me help my communities, even if we disagreed on a lot of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1659.0s">And</a>  one of those issues that really came forward was working around the opioid crisis, because it was as devastating in a blue state of Massachusetts as it was in Kentucky <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1672.589s">and</a>  Ohio and some places that look very different politically and economically than back home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1680.456s">And</a>  found that building those relationships helped me develop the support system and the connections to be able to deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1692.445s">And</a>  also helped me keep the base that now when I have a leadership role, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1698.07s">I</a>  really know the members in my caucus and can help put together and keep drawing on those common interests so that people see you as a leader because you really understand what they need and what the issues are facing their particular district at home.</p>

    <p>[Kimberly Budd]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1725.39s">I</a>  just want to say, as a young lawyer, you feel like you don't know anything, and you probably don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1733.756s">When</a>  I was at my first job, I spent a lot of time shadowing people, asking questions, trying to figure out how the system worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1744.474s">trying</a>  to do any of the assignments that I was given, just do the very best I could with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1749.736s">And</a>  then I was learning more and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1752.338s">I</a>  was given more responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1755.379s">And</a>  as I became higher up, I still find that I'm asking people questions to find out how other people feel about certain issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1767.144s">And</a>  I find that it's very helpful to collaborate with people <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1771.058s">And</a>  in that way, I feel like we come to some of the better solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1775.199s">So</a>  that's one of the things that I would let you know.</p>

    <p>[Tiffany Chan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1802.714s">Tiffany</a>  Chan from Channel 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1805.295s">I</a>  think it's really interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1806.435s">One</a>  of my first roles was in state politics, and I was one of the only women doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1810.877s">So</a>  it's a lot of asking tough questions, finding your own stories, finding problems and solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1818.559s">One,</a>  finding your confidence in going out and doing kind of what's seen as a man's role. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1824.102s">I</a>  remember walking around the statehouse, no offense to Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1827.363s">Paul</a>  Donato, but I was thinking, these men in suits are old enough to be my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1832.786s">I</a>  was 21 at the time, figuring out how I fit into this whole scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1837.448s">And</a>  I think a lot of it is finding your own confidence, finding your own voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1841.931s">and</a>  basically pushing through the nerves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1844.214s">The</a>  last year I was at this event, I know D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1846.877s">Ryan</a>  said a very, very important quote that actually stuck out to me, and is that we need to find our own talents, our own strengths, and own it ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1855.829s">And</a>  especially as women, she was saying how sometimes we're our own worst critics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1860.294s">So</a>  to find our own strengths, find confidence in that, and really push forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1864.435s">And</a>  some of these roles that people see as, you know, men's jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1867.875s">And</a>  I think that's how we find our voice, and that's how we kind of push through and make sure that the things that we think are important are reflected in, you know, our communities, on television, here in the courts, in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1879.438s">So,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1880.298s">Thank</a>  you, Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1890.237s">As</a>  a female leader, I think you have to lead by example and you also have to break through the status quo and how things <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1898.493s">maybe</a>  were run in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1900.254s">So</a>  when I became mayor three years ago, I promised myself that I would always do what was right no matter what, no matter if it cost me votes or led to somebody being unhappy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1912.139s">So</a>  I'll just give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1914.82s">Systematic</a>  change, changing the system, part of that is the hiring process and making sure we have a diverse <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1920.803s">staff,</a>  especially within City Hall and our school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1924.364s">So</a>  I had to interview for a position in the city, and I was stuck with, I had two candidates left that got moved to my office for the final interview. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1935.046s">One</a>  was a Medford resident who, I knew her children, and one was a resident, it was not a resident, and it was a woman that was more qualified and spoke a second language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1950.971s">I</a>  knew I would get a little pushback, potentially, for not picking the candidate that was a Medford resident that I knew personally, and I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1958.358s">I</a>  chose the candidate that had more experience and that spoke a second language, because that's what Medford needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1963.964s">We</a>  need to embrace diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1965.866s">We</a>  need to have a culture where City Hall represents the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1970.211s">So,</a>  breaking through the status quo.</p>

    <p>[Nadine Al-Kurdi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1979.164s">Have</a>  you ever felt the imposter syndrome? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1981.128s">And</a>  if so, how did you navigate your way through it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1983.353s">Would</a>  you like to take this one?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Flores]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1993.526s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1993.586s">I</a>  think I definitely have experienced quite a bit of imposter syndrome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=1998.889s">And</a>  I'm sure this will resonate with some of the students here, but I came from a very poor biracial family with low education levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2008.274s">So</a>  growing up in San Antonio, Texas was always challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2011.536s">I</a>  went to a great school, but I definitely was from a bad neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2016.138s">So</a>  that kind of impacted my life growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2019.72s">But</a>  then as I got into college at Boston University, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2022.742s">I</a>  definitely had the fake it till you make it idea, and that not being, you know, fake who I am as a person or not remembering where I came from, but really just trying to learn and educate myself on how kind of things work, especially, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2038.223s">socially,</a>  professionally, and from there I wound up developing, you know, a personal board of directors that I've kind of kept and changed in and out my entire life of people that could help me understand, you know, what's going on or how to get to the next level in my professional development or what education maneuvers I should be taking to really better myself, what progress and growth and professional development would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2063.576s">It's</a>  something that I would say find people around you that will support you, that you can lean on, that can really help you get to the next level in your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2071.319s">That's</a>  going to be one of the most important pieces of helping you kind of navigate away from feeling like an imposter, especially in certain, you know, situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2080.482s">And</a>  really just continue to educate and grow and, you know, always just think about helping others around you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2086.224s">I</a>  think that's also helped me quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2088.425s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kelly Rose Serrano]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2095.219s">I</a>  tell you what, this never gets easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2096.786s">It's</a>  very nerve wracking being up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2098.332s">Anybody</a>  in the room have TikTok? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2101.607s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2102.928s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2103.268s">So</a>  I'm considered somebody who's TikTok famous, and TikTok is a place that just lives with imposter syndrome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2110.492s">And</a>  I'm also 40 years old in the makeup community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2113.254s">So</a>  I have learned to live my life by three simple phrases. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2118.097s">Do</a>  it scared, do it afraid, and do it anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2121.259s">Because</a>  there's so many people out there that are wanting to do exactly what it is that you're trying to do, but they're too scared to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2129.223s">So</a>  for me, it's a huge place to feel like you have imposter syndrome because the makeup influencer community is 20 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2137.111s">I</a>  mean, hi, Alex Earl. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2138.992s">She's</a>  so sweet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2139.713s">I've</a>  actually met her and traveled with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2141.735s">But</a>  as a 40-year-old mom of two, small business owner, it can be a really scary place to kind of get yourself out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2147.8s">So</a>  I always sit down and take a deep breath and tell myself, I'm scared, I'm afraid, but I'm going to do it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2154.184s">Because</a>  if I reach one person out there that motivates them to do the same thing that I'm doing, then my job here is done.</p>

    <p>[Jamie Chia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2165.811s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2168.877s">So</a>  I worked in the field of science, which you can imagine is up to now still a very male-dominated field. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2176.127s">It's</a>  also full of Nobel Prize winners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2178.29s">I</a>  literally worked in buildings full of Nobel Prize winners, so imposter syndrome is a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2182.215s">I</a>  think there's two things I really remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2185.86s">One</a>  is what Tiffany said, finding your own confidence and understanding that you may be surrounded by all these amazing people, but you have worth too, and they're coming to see you because you know something that they don't, and they need your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2199.088s">And</a>  the other thing is to... <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2201.349s">figure</a>  out that, and this is hard at a young age, it doesn't matter what other people think about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2206.174s">You,</a>  as Tiffany said, you find that you are your own worst critic, and you project onto others what they think negatively about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2214.242s">So</a>  you need to push that behind you and realize that you are worth it, you are confident, and they need you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2220.769s">And</a>  that's how you push past imposter syndrome.</p>

    <p>[Anna Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2226.755s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2227.876s">We're</a>  running out of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2229.136s">So</a>  now we're going to move on to our audience Q&A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2231.878s">So</a>  you can raise your hand and me and Lena will come over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2235.28s">Our</a>  first question.</p>

    <p>[Mary Fitzgerald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2251.848s">If</a>  you had any words to your younger self, what would it be?</p>

    <p>[Kelly Rose Serrano]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2277.103s">If</a>  I had any words for my younger self, so I grew up pretty poor on welfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2281.126s">I</a>  grew up in Revere, not too far from here, and I was just like a walking statistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2286.029s">My</a>  mom has been married and divorced four times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2288.83s">You</a>  know, I have all of the odds working against me, and it was really hard to have any type of confidence in yourself to make something of yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2296.915s">Couldn't</a>  afford to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2298.476s">I</a>  did graduate high school right in Stoneham, so not too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2302.099s">And</a>  the only advice that I ever would have given myself is to just believe that you can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2307.504s">I</a>  always knew I had something inside me that was a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2310.907s">I</a>  always had creative ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2312.768s">I</a>  always, like, wanted to start some type of business selling lemonade when I was a little kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2317.392s">And</a>  you really just have to have that deep core belief in yourself that you're strong enough to do it and that you will be successful as long as you put your head down, stay in your own lane, and flex that hustle muscle.</p>

    <p>[Tiffany Chan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2334.438s">The</a>  message I would give my younger self is to embrace the things that make me different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2338.763s">I</a>  grew up in Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2340.005s">I</a>  went to a private school where people did not look like me and they certainly didn't sound like me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2346.172s">English</a>  was not my first language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2348.034s">Chinese</a>  was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2349.035s">So</a>  having different cultural experiences growing up in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2354.321s">Those</a>  were the things that I really tried to kind of suppress in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2357.925s">So</a>  when I got into news and I saw that people on TV really didn't look like me, it wasn't until probably about the last year or so that I really embraced my culture, my voice connecting with the Asian community, being the voice for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2371.983s">So</a>  something that I really used to, I don't want to say be ashamed of, but just try to hide a little bit more because it made me different is really what's making me stand out in the news industry today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2380.87s">So</a>  really try to embrace the things that make you special would be my advice for my younger self.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2392.569s">If</a>  I may, one piece of advice that I would give to myself if I could rewind the clock back would be to have taken even greater advantage of all the different opportunities that were before me starting in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2407.706s">I</a>  do wish that I had played more sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2410.749s">I</a>  was in drama, I was reading, I was more kind of on the academic side. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2415.05s">But</a>  I do wish that I had pushed myself in other areas just to be exposed to other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2421.071s">Because</a>  the more that you're exposed to, the more well-rounded you are, and the better it is for you in the end to be able to interact with all different kinds of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2430.092s">So</a>  that's what I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2431.133s">Take</a>  advantage of all of the opportunities that are here, because you don't get a redo of high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2436.834s">So</a>  take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2439.014s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Katherine Clark]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2447.13s">I</a>  just would tell my younger self and all of you that failure is not always bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2453.816s">And</a>  that you're going to do stuff, you're going to bomb out, you're going to fail, you're going to be embarrassed, you're going to wish you had not tried, but it is where you're going to find your joy and your passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2466.646s">And</a>  failing at something often teaches you the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2470.549s">So</a>  take the risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2472.611s">Find</a>  your joy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2473.912s">Find</a>  your life mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=2475.633s">That's</a>  what I'd tell myself.</p>
