    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=0.385s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's settle down.
 Thank you.
 Good afternoon.
 I'd like to welcome you all to our Women's History Assembly regarding the month that we've been recognizing.
 We have some people in the audience I'd like to recognize individually.
 We have State Representative Paul Donato here.
 City Councilman, Mr. Rick Caviello.
 School Committee Member, Mellie McLaughlin.
 The amazing women I have behind me on the stage that will be individually introduced.
 I'd like to give a special thank you to, hold on,
 I'd like to give a special thank you to Ms.
 Walker, our House M Assistant Principal.
 As well as Ms.
 Lisa Evangelista, our Medford Public School Relations Coordinator, for all the efforts they did to create this assembly, so thank you.
 So Women's History Month is a time to reflect the courage of women in past generations in how to celebrate their efforts and bravery afforded women opportunities and freedoms that we have today.
 It's a time to reflect often overlooked contributions of women in the United States history, a timeline that strikes back all the way before the United States was actually established.
 So I have a little story before we get started.
 Most of you know I taught chemistry, and one of the things that I always stuck, that I always remember is when I was in biology class, they taught us about the double helix in DNA, and hopefully a lot of you remember that as well.
 But it was given credit to two men, James Watson and Francis Crick.
 Francis, sorry, Francis Crick, yes.
 And what people don't know is that even though they got the credit for it, there was a woman named Rosalind Franklin that did all the background work, that did all the x-ray technology, and didn't get that much credit for it, the two gentlemen did.
 So it's kind of a theme of how powerful genders can be and what they contribute here to society.
 That being said, I'm gonna leave you with a quote, and then we're gonna move on.
 So a quote that I just recently saw that struck my mind is, a strong woman knows she has the strength for the journey, but it's a woman of strength knows that it's journey where she will become stronger.
 So I'd like to again welcome everyone, and I'm gonna turn this over to our superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=190.543s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  Good afternoon, everyone.
 Let's try that again.
 Good afternoon.
 Good afternoon.
 OK.
 We're here for this wonderful, auspicious event today.
 We have so many phenomenal women on the stage.
 I'm not going to steal the thunder, because I know we have many students that have practiced and are prepared to read their opening remarks.
 I do want to say a special thank you to Ms.
 Walker and to Ms.
 Evangelista for all of their coordination efforts in getting this special event off today.
 I want to say I'm very happy to be part of this panel and to be able to celebrate the positive contributions of women.
 I thank all of our special guests, but I also thank you, the audience.
 We've received wonderful questions, and we look forward to hearing from all of you, staff and students, and anyone else who's here.
 I want to just say thank you for supporting us.
 And just in true style, if I say Medford, you say Mustangs.
 Medford?
 Mustangs!
 Medford?
 Medford.
 All right, good job.
 Thank you.
 I would like to just invite our mayor up, Brianna Lungo-Kern, who's part of the panel today, and she also has a few opening remarks.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=274.609s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  Thank you.
 Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.
 Good afternoon, everybody.
 It's an honor to be here with you today, celebrating women and sharing stories about our lives and careers.
 I thank the superintendent and the team at Medford High School for putting this wonderful event together.
 It's not a secret that there are barriers and challenges that attempt to prevent women from achieving our deserved place as equals in society.
 I wish I could tell you that by the time you students are ready to face the world outside these walls, you'll be met with recognition and support in all your endeavors.
 Unfortunately, that's not the case.
 You will be faced with adversity, with roadblocks, and with situations that are just frankly unfair.
 But as you'll hear from women here today, there is no reason for that to be accepted as an outcome.
 You have to be your own advocate, and above all, you must believe that your worth is not measured by anybody other than yourself.
 These are hard lessons, and it takes a lot of tough situations to learn them.
 But what you hear today from strong women who have repeatedly crashed through the glass ceilings, toughness is not attributed to just one gender.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=347.601s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  Thank you.
 Thank you, Mayor.
 And so we are ready for our student introductions of invited guests.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=368.41s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you.
 Of course.
 Good afternoon, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.
 My name is Nadine Al-Kurdi, and I'm a ninth grader at the Medford High School.
 Welcome to the Women's History Month Assembly, an assembly dedicated to the acknowledgment of the accomplished women in Medford who have come to attend the gathering today.
 Our MHS students and peers will represent the astounding woman, and there will be an interview afterward for the sponsors.
 Thank you, and I will now begin the presentation.
 All right.
 Thank you.
 I will now be presenting the biography of our Chief Justice, Kimberly Budd.
 Kimberly Budd was appointed to the SJC by Governor Charles Baker as both an Associate Justice sworn in on August 24th, 2016, and later as the Chief Justice sworn in on December 1st, 2020.
 She's the 25th Chief Justice appointed to the role since the adoption of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1780, which provided the court with its modern designation of Supreme Judicial Court.
 She earned her bachelor's degree in English from Georgetown University and earned her law degree from Harvard Law School.
 She began her legal career as a law clerk on the Massachusetts Appeals Court.
 She worked at Mintz-Levin before serving as an AUSA in the United States Attorney's Office in Boston.
 She then was a university attorney for Harvard University in the General Counsel's Office, and later served as director of the Community Values Program at Harvard Business School.
 Chief Justice Budd was appointed to the Superior Court by Governor Deval Patrick in 2009.
 In 2016, she served as the Regional Administrative Justice for Middlesex Criminal Business.
 Thank you very much.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=492.562s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  Chief Justice, will you stand please so we all know who you are?
 Thank you.
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=502.594s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  Hi, everyone.
 I'm Mary Fitzgerald, a sophomore at Medford High School.
 I'm going to be reading the biography of Paige Baldini, the owner of Paige Aesthetics in Medford.
 A graduate of Holliston High School, Immuno College with a BA in Psychology, Health, and Counseling, minor in Philosophy, and a graduate of Elizabeth Grady Aesthetics School, Paige is the solo aesthetician and business owner of Paige Aesthetics.
 She has curated an experience by blending together traditional salon with a medical spa.
 Her market is busy, working moms, educators, healthcare professionals, and post-graduate students, and she prides herself on creating a place where they can come to relax, feel beautiful, confident, and empowered.
 While her services are high-impact, they do not take all day.
 Paige is a master esthetician, laser technician, certified in spray tins, and hydrafacials.
 She additionally teaches simple, multi-purpose skincare to make those results last.
 Paige has handpicked her favorite skincare, body care, home scents, and boutique items, and designs curated gift boxes available for purchase or ship.
 She loves supporting and building genuine connections with others in the industry.
 I believe there's room for all of us to be successful and cheer each other on.
 Paige happily resides with her family in the same Medford neighborhood as the shop.
 Supporting this community is incredible for her.
 Please, Paige Baldini, can you please stand?
 Thank you.

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=589.929s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  Hi, guys.
 I'm Alex Crowley, and I'm a senior at Medford High.
 And I'm going to be talking about Tiffany Chan, who is a CBS 4 Boston News reporter.
 Tiffany Chan can be found on the CBS Boston weekdays news, either anchoring at the desk or reporting live from the scene of breaking news.
 From 2013 to 2017, Tiffany was one of very few women covering the state house politics in Boston.
 She has been on CBS Channel 4 ever since.
 Tiffany is famous for asking lawmakers like the governor
 the hard questions.
 This means she strives to provide a full story, even if that means chasing a person for the interview.
 Tiffany is a proud graduate of Suffolk University and a member of the Asian American Journal Association.
 She is a huge supporter of Team Impact.
 This nonprofit organization partners college sports teams with clinically ill children or children with disabilities.
 Most recently, Tufts women's field hockey team was paired with Little Mia, who is fighting leukemia.
 They have formed a bond of a lifetime.
 They do fun things together, like going bowling and having ice cream parties prior to midterms exams.
 It definitely puts life perspective for all.
 Tiffany Chan, can you stand up?
<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZsCh05QRfWg&t=668.427s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  Hi, I'm Marliana, and I'm a freshman here at Medford High School.
 I'll be reading the biography of Jamie Chia.
 Jamie Chia earned her B.Sc.
 in biochemistry from Medill University, where she specialized in protein crystallography.
 She attended the John Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD, for her Ph.D.
 in neuroscience in the laboratory of Dr. Solomon Sanders, studying ion signaling in the brain.
 She moved back to the Boston area to do her postdoctoral fellowship at the Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research and then joined the Broad Institute as a research scientist, where she led a team of researchers on a large-scale cancer cell profiling project correlating the genetics of cancer to drug responses.
 She then served as a director of the high-throughput scientist facility at the Koch Institute of MIT for eight years, where she oversaw a facility outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and helped scientists design and execute their experiments in a larger, faster, more frivolous way.
 Dr. Jamie Chia, can you please stand up?

 Since 2013, Catherine Clark has proudly represented Massachusetts' vibrant Fifth District, which stretches from the coastal communities of Revere and Winthrop through the northern Boston suburbs to the thriving towns of Metro West.
 In the fall of 2022, Clark was elected by her colleagues to serve as Democratic Whip, the second most senior position in the House Democratic Caucus.
 She previously served as Assistant Speaker of the House, as Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, and as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.
 One of only two women to ever serve as whip, she currently has the distinction of being the highest ranking woman in congressional leadership.
 From the school board to Capitol Hill, Clark's public service has been fueled by a passion for lifting up women and families.
 She is a leading proponent for ending wage discrimination, safeguarding access to abortion, ending gun violence, improving access to affordable, accessible child care, and guaranteeing paid leave.
 Before her election to Congress, Clark served her community and elected office as a state senator, state representative, and member of the Melrose School Committee.
 She also served as General Counsel for the Massachusetts Office of Child Care Services and as Policy Chief for the Massachusetts Attorney General.
 She lives in Revere with her husband and has three children.
