00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:45,229
All right, Medford Bites listeners, thanks for listening.

10
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,654
We have a very special guest tonight.

11
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:53,645
If you don't mind introducing yourself, so saying your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,702
All right, my name is Brittany Balacca.

13
00:00:56,882 --> 00:01:08,810
I use she, her, and I am the wife of the somewhat infamous Danielle Balacca, a resident of Medford of approximately nine years, originally from the West Coast.

14
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:12,333
And I've sampled many bites in the Medford scene.

15
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:16,796
So I'm excited to talk about our night tonight, as well as some of my favorite bites.

16
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,041
Oh, great.

17
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,942
Sounds like you've listened to the show before, Brittany.

18
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:22,123
Well, thank you for being here.

19
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:24,504
So yeah, you led into that nicely.

20
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:31,586
But if you could answer our most famous question, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

21
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:36,048
Well, I'm not one for competition, so it is hard to narrow it down.

22
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:39,449
But for breakfast, it's just really Goldilocks all the way.

23
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,671
I came to Boston looking for good bagels and was sorely disappointed everywhere I turned.

24
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:45,832
And then all of a sudden,

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,385
Lo and behold, Goldilocks appeared with the most delicious bagels, rosemary salt to be specific.

26
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:56,128
Although I do have high hopes for Altacuba, can you please open soon?

27
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:58,169
Thank you, Brittany.

28
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:09,258
So we are releasing this bonus episode to talk about our evening, which was we had the opportunity to go to a show at the Chevalier that's kind of being highlighted for Pride Month.

29
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:13,602
So do you want to say kind of how our evening began, where we went to dinner?

30
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:32,451
we ate absolutely so actually i should say that one of my other favorite places to eat is real gusto which is where we had dinner tonight and it used to be a bookstore and cafe which i thought i was going to be sad when they left but then it opened and is the most delicious authentic italian food

31
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:39,596
So we went there, we split some of our favorite dishes that we get, the salad and the mushroom pappardelle.

32
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:44,900
And we held out on dessert, hoping for Colleen's after, but it didn't happen.

33
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:51,344
So yeah, so like I said, we got the opportunity to see the Golden Girls show.

34
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,607
So it's called the Golden Girls.

35
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:56,608
Uh, the laughs continue.

36
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:59,010
So we, uh, we're invited to see the show.

37
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:02,433
Um, so I'll, I'll read a brief description of the show.

38
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,854
So the golden girls are back.

39
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:08,278
Miami's sassiest seniors have returned for one more hurrah.

40
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:13,903
2023 finds Sophia out on bail after being busted by the DEA for running a drug ring for retirees.

41
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:22,630
Blanche and Rose have founded Crack Creek Creekin, a thriving sex app for seniors and Dorothy's trying to hold it all together.

42
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,293
with help from her new young sex-crazed stud.

43
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,616
Relive the heartfelt hilarity of four ladies who never stopped being your friends.

44
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:33,218
There was also a 20-minute intermission.

45
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,180
So the show, we saw it on Wednesday night at 7 30.

46
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,363
It's going to be running again Thursday, June 22nd at 7 30, Friday the 23rd at 8,

47
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:49,509
Saturday, the 24th at 8, and then a matinee on Sunday, June 25th at 2 p.m.

48
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,932
So you can check those, you can get those tickets through the Chevalier Theatre.

49
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,294
So Brittany, would you recommend it?

50
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:56,594
Oh, certainly.

51
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:02,839
Yeah, so full disclosure, I actually think I probably watched maybe one Golden Girls episode in my entire life.

52
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,762
I'm guessing probably on rerun somewhere when someone in my family was watching it.

53
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:10,385
So I didn't really know what to expect, but it was very funny.

54
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:17,530
And I always liked Betty White, and I feel like the character who was portraying Betty White did a fantastic job.

55
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,830
The voice was spot on.

56
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:28,313
So, I mean, I don't know that I went in with any expectations, but I had a great time, lots of laughs, and I really love that Chevalier is so accessible.

57
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:35,595
And in Medford, it's easy to find parking, great food to eat, and it's a small theater, so you can get in.

58
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:40,036
We saw people we knew, we had a good time, and I would definitely recommend it, of course.

59
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:45,178
Yeah, no, I think I would agree with like the acting.

60
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:48,959
I think, you know, helpful to know it's like sort of like a drag show.

61
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,140
So it's like men playing the characters.

62
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,682
And I feel like that's like the Golden Girls have become sort of like queer icons in some way.

63
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:59,183
I was gonna say, somehow, somewhere along the line, yeah.

64
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:04,387
Yeah, no, like, um, so I don't know, I think like, I guess I'm wondering, you know, we moved to Medford 2014, 15.

65
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:14,675
And would you have expected when we when we moved here, like a show like this to be so popular in Medford?

66
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:29,365
I honestly know and I can't say that I would have, you know, expected it to be popular just generally but I think that Medford has really come a long way and embracing these pride events and promoting them and I think that it's really great that

67
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:36,707
it seemed from the crowd that was there that it was just a really good cross section of all different ages and folks that were there.

68
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:39,349
So it was really exciting to be in that kind of crowd.

69
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,951
And I think that there was a good energy there.

70
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:43,331
Everybody was really excited.

71
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:47,034
And, you know, it always feels good to be back among friends, if you will.

72
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,456
Yeah, no, I think that, too, I was impressed with

73
00:05:51,397 --> 00:06:14,033
the acting it's like the particularly Sophia so like the mom like the um I feel like the actor got like just the mannerisms and like the shuffle yeah yeah holding the purse yeah it was like it was so good yeah and like you said like um Betty White's character like the voice was like perfect it was interesting I feel like it was I'm trying to remember like what the show was like

74
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:25,605
And I feel like it is sort of this, you know, these like older people getting into their little like, you know, like sim, you know, sitcom type jams and getting and this was the 20, the version of that for 2023.

75
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:26,746
So it was funny.

76
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,349
I think it was like, definitely a good time.

77
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,070
I think it would, you know,

78
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:57,233
it made me feel nostalgic for when I live in a retirement community and I've never done that so it was it was exciting you felt you felt immediately drawn into it it wasn't awkward and getting to know the actors and falling into the storyline so I thought that was good but yeah no I think it was a great way to sort of like celebrate pride and I think we're excited to celebrate pride in all the different activities this month so um yeah I think it was

79
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:19,049
great that Medford is hosting something like this and that you know we saw like members from the Chamber of Commerce and other like business owners and friends like you know it seems like it's a kind of a normalized activity in the city and I think that's really hopeful for like for me and like uh yeah something that I don't know that I expected from Medford when we moved here but it's great yeah

80
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:27,437
I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 just because there were some inside jokes from not having watched the show that were over my head.

81
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,758
But outside of that, it just makes me want to watch the actual show.

82
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,159
And honestly, I would go back and watch it again.

83
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,140
It was funny.

84
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,201
It was a comfortable show.

85
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:38,542
Well, Brittany, thank you.

86
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,203
