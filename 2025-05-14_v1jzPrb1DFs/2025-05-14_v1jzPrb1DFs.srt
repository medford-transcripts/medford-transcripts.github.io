50
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,043
[SPEAKER_19]: 25076 offered by President Bayer's Resolution to Recognize Food Allergy Awareness Week.

51
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:43,547
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas more than 33 million Americans have food allergies, nearly 6 million are children under the age of 18.

52
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:48,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas research shows that the prevalence of a food allergy is increasing among children and adults.

53
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:57,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas nine foods cause the majority of all food allergy reactions in the United States, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, wheat, and sesame.

54
00:24:58,008 --> 00:25:11,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Food allergy reactions can range from mild symptoms to severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, whereas anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death, whereas every 10 seconds, food allergy sends a patient to the emergency room.

55
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:22,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Reactions typically occur when an individual unknowingly eats food containing an ingredient to which they are allergic, whereas emergency medical treatment for severe allergic reactions to food has increased by 377% in only a decade,

56
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:46,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas childhood food allergies cost us families $34 billion each year, whereas the food allergy research and education is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life and the health of individuals with food allergies, and to providing them hope to the promise of new treatments be resolved by the Medford City Council that we recognize may 11 to 17 2025 as food allergy awareness week in the city of Medford.

57
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:52,157
[SPEAKER_19]: and that we encourage the residents of Medford to increase their understanding and awareness of food allergies and anaphylaxis.

58
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved that we request that the mayor issue a proclamation to the same effect.

59
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:00,692
[SPEAKER_19]: And just to note, I believe the mayor did issue that proclamation.

60
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,400
[SPEAKER_19]: This was my item, just wanted to put it forward.

61
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:15,145
[SPEAKER_19]: That's an important issue and we often recognize different things, awareness weeks for different things here in this chamber.

62
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,007
[SPEAKER_19]: So the resolution otherwise speaks for itself.

63
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Does anyone else have anything they'd like to say on the matter?

178
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:19,287
[SPEAKER_11]: and it was mentioned that it might be a good opportunity for a Councilor to join this event as a listening session, and I thought I would offer it here so that we can

[SPEAKER_11]: send it to the Resident Services Committee.

180
00:34:25,122 --> 00:34:32,587
[SPEAKER_11]: This is sort of a formality, but also just a good opportunity for me to remind everybody that we do host those listening sessions at the Senior Center.

181
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:35,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be there on May 29th at 12 o'clock noon.

185
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:53,246
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's always the fourth Thursday of the month with a rotating member of the resident services committee, and it's a great opportunity to connect with

186
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:59,634
[SPEAKER_11]: the City Council and tell us what you're noticing and thinking about the city.

187
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:09,379
[SPEAKER_11]: And this will hopefully, eventually when we schedule it, be a great opportunity for us to have a similar conversation with our veterans.

188
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:10,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

189

194
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:40,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want people to understand that we do listening sessions and for folks, you know, who maybe do not come to city council meetings, you know, the purpose is really to hear from folks who are not coming here.

195
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:45,725

00:41:23,802 --> 00:41:28,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, to be honest with you, I think that, I mean, we could wait for them next week, but I think that's just preliminary.

293
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:33,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that you're seeing one o'clock as a, as a norm where the establishment is located.

294
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:38,310
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, uh, it falls outside the range of the neighborhood.

295
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,651
[SPEAKER_13]: So in a sense, traditional neighborhood.

296
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I know that we've extended permits to one o'clock, but

297
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:48,967
[SPEAKER_13]: for multiple locations.

298
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:56,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Now this council is taking a stance on open up different establishments till one o'clock all over the community.

299
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:08,356
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we, as I said in the past about keeping things consistent, I would recommend to award these hours with a 30, 60, 90 day review.

300
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:08,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

301
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:19,195
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 30-60-90 day review, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

302
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:23,796
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this?

303
00:42:23,856 --> 00:42:25,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Any objections or discussion?

304
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:30,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing none, on the motion as seconded, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

305
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:35,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

306
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:37,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

307
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:37,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro.

309
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

310
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:41,975
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lemon is absent.

311
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:43,056
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just kill him.

312
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:45,516
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just saying, present affairs.

313
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:56,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, 60 affirmative one absent the motion passes motions orders and resolutions to 4069 offered by Councilor Tseng amendment to the Human Rights Commission, enabling ordinance.

314
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:03,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to waive the reading in favor of a summary by the proponent.

315
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:11,005
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng the way of the reading seconded by seconded by Council is our own.

316
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:34,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins.

317
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:35,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

318
00:43:36,691 --> 00:43:39,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming is absent.

319
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:41,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng.

320
00:43:41,297 --> 00:43:41,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

321
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:42,518
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears.

322
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:42,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

323
00:43:42,778 --> 00:43:43,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

324
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,541
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion passes.

325
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:45,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Tseng.

326
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:46,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

327
00:43:47,126 --> 00:44:06,335
[SPEAKER_04]: At a moment where I think a lot of residents are scared, concerned, afraid about their human rights, civil rights of their own and their neighbors, I think it becomes incumbent upon us as elected officials to do the most that we can to safeguard those rights here in our community.

328
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:14,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the city council has repeatedly shown over the last, especially over the last few months, but in the last few years too,

329
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:18,102
[SPEAKER_04]: that we stand on the side of human rights.

330
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:33,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And we stand on the side of our city being more proactive in reaching out to residents to let them know about their rights, proactive about solving inequalities and disparities in our community, and to do better in general.

331
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:53,736
[SPEAKER_04]: This effort, this particular effort, came about over a year ago, if not two years ago, with members, former members of the Human Rights Commission who, you know, reached out to me and let me know how the existing ordinance, the one that we have right now, is quite outdated.

332
00:44:54,665 --> 00:45:02,531
[SPEAKER_04]: and has led to a lot of problems where the HRC can't do what HRCs normally do in surrounding communities as well.

333
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:17,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these are basic functions that we really think that we would conceive of a human rights commission doing, like hosting events and letting residents know about their rights, stuff like that.

334
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:24,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And as well as creating recommendations and studying data that we collect in the city.

335
00:45:25,852 --> 00:45:34,459
[SPEAKER_04]: In this day and age, I think it becomes important for us to act on that and fix those problems that we've seen in that old ordinance.

336
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:44,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so grateful to the hard work of a lot of our residents, a few of whom are here in the audience tonight, but I know a lot of folks at home are also watching this meeting.

337
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:55,273
[SPEAKER_04]: who, and, you know, this group of residents came together and we all worked together on a draft ordinance to update the HRC to make it fit for modern times.

338
00:45:56,354 --> 00:46:02,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm, you know, so thankful and grateful for their hard work because I know it was the labor of love.

339
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:14,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been spending a lot of time on this over the last few months, reaching out to our DEI director, to the mayoral administration, to different stakeholders, making sure that we have something that

340
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,523
[SPEAKER_04]: is ambitious and actionable.

341
00:46:19,624 --> 00:46:22,866
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I want to say about this.

342
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:33,935
[SPEAKER_04]: In essence, this ordinance update reestablishes the Human Rights Commission and re-empowers it to do even more and to be even more proactive in serving our city.

343
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:44,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people who are even currently on the HRC have been pushing for this because the HRC is

344
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,773
[SPEAKER_04]: currently pretty defunct.

345
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:51,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm excited for the city council to finally be voting on this tonight.

346
00:46:52,098 --> 00:47:01,500
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some small technical amendments for the most part that I would make a motion to adopt.

347
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Clerk, I'll send these to you via email as well.

348
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:17,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But in section 50-62, because we changed the committee composition for the kind of the staggered terms at the very start, we just need to fix the language there.

349
00:47:17,884 --> 00:47:22,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of a third of members shall serve for one year term, a third, a third,

350
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:27,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I would amend that to read two members shall serve for one year term.

351
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Three members shall serve for two year term and three members shall serve for three year term.

352
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:34,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the first amendment.

353
00:47:35,138 --> 00:47:43,206
[SPEAKER_04]: The second amendment would be to strike the words administration in the public school system after the word city in section 50-66 in subsection B.

354
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:51,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be in section 55-66.

355
00:47:52,566 --> 00:48:03,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the third edit would be also in section 50-66 to strike subsection D2 and to renumber the subsections.

356
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:07,956
[SPEAKER_04]: That last edit is a little bit more substantive

357
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:17,909
[SPEAKER_04]: it's still mostly technical, that was upon request of the school committee who said that the DESE reporting isn't necessarily a complete picture of what we have at the schools.

358
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:21,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we shouldn't put it in the ordinance.

359
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:22,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So D2?

360
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:23,532
[SPEAKER_04]: D2, yeah.

361
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:28,414
[SPEAKER_19]: And then what was the language strike in 5626B1?

362
00:48:28,934 --> 00:48:34,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in B1, just to strike the words administration and public school system, just to leave that.

363
00:48:34,897 --> 00:48:36,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Advise the city, got it.

364
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:40,752
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have one question on your amendment.

365
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:41,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

366
00:48:41,873 --> 00:48:43,954
[SPEAKER_19]: In 62 it says there's 11 members.

367
00:48:44,395 --> 00:48:44,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

368
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:48,557
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you named eight for the staggered terms.

369
00:48:49,738 --> 00:48:51,039
[SPEAKER_19]: My math.

370
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:52,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my math is off.

371
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:53,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

372
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:55,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant to say 344.

373
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:55,162
344.

374
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:55,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

375
00:48:55,903 --> 00:49:01,246
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, just make sure that gets corrected and what we send to the clerk as well.

376
00:49:01,787 --> 00:49:05,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that I can always count on Councilor Bears to check my math one more time.

377
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:14,272
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, and on the process, this was in resident services?

378
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:15,733
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, this is in resident services.

379
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:17,194
[SPEAKER_19]: And how many meetings did you have on it?

380
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:22,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We had quite a lot, few, we had five at least, five meetings on this, five or six.

381
00:49:23,157 --> 00:49:24,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you.

382
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:32,022
[SPEAKER_19]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve for first reading as amended, seconded by councilor Lazzaro.

383
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:34,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further discussions by members of the council?

384
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:36,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lazzaro.

385
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:53,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like to thank Councilor Tseng for his careful work on this project and thank the members of the current and former of the the committee, the commission, and just everybody who put work into this project.

386
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:53,844
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been

387
00:49:56,403 --> 00:50:04,889
[SPEAKER_11]: careful process, and I appreciate everybody putting in this effort because it's an important process that deserves careful study.

388
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:15,136
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate that, and I've enjoyed being a part of it, and I am eager to move it to the next step so it can be the best governing document that it can be.

389
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:15,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

390
00:50:17,378 --> 00:50:17,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

391
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,020
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Zang, just one other question.

392
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Did we strike all of D2 or just—okay.

393
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:28,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

394
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:34,692
[SPEAKER_19]: And could you, in addition to sending the amendments, could you send a clean copy in a Word document?

395
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:36,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, just for the advertising.

396
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further discussion by members of the Council on the motion?

397
00:50:44,145 --> 00:50:50,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing none, we will go to any discussion by members of the public, either in person or on Zoom.

398
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:55,852
[SPEAKER_19]: You can come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom, and you'll have three minutes.

399
00:50:56,172 --> 00:51:01,616
[SPEAKER_19]: I see on Zoom, you have me near, give me one moment.

400
00:51:05,238 --> 00:51:06,819
[SPEAKER_24]: Change the Zoom on me again.

401
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:14,622
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

402
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:19,706
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to recognize you and please name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

403
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:27,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

404
00:51:27,753 --> 00:51:28,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.

405
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:31,356
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Muneer Jamaris.

406
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 3 Summit Road.

407
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:46,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And very briefly, I served for several years at the HRC between 2017 and 2022 and served as chair for four years.

408
00:51:50,082 --> 00:51:58,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the fall of 2021, so several years ago, the HRC formed a subcommittee to generate a strategic plan for better definition of the role of the HRC.

409
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:10,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Since, as Councilor Tseng mentioned, the existing ordinance was outdated and it did not fully describe the role and responsibilities of the HRC.

410
00:52:11,653 --> 00:52:27,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And very quickly soon after that, the HRC decided to disband this committee and accepted an offer from Safe Medford to establish an ad hoc committee to assess the effectiveness of the HRC and to provide recommendations.

411
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:32,320
[SPEAKER_01]: This committee included three HRC members along with several Safe Medford members.

412
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:48,440
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee conducted several dozen interviews of current and past HRC stakeholders and surveyed the missions, goals, and activities of human rights commissions in nearby cities and towns, and also reviewed the ordinance that established the Medford HRC.

413
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:59,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, the subcommittee discussed and agreed upon a set of recommendations regarding the goals and roles of the HRC and operating guidelines for their implementation.

414
00:53:00,535 --> 00:53:18,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the course of this work and discussions, the committee concluded that to a significant extent, the HRC has been hampered by its current enabling ordinance, which was outdated, and it would need to carry out the mandate that the order defines.

415
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:36,075
[SPEAKER_01]: After presenting the recommendations of this committee to the HRC, the committee recommended that the new ordinance be generated clearly outlining the HRC's compositions, roles, and responsibilities, providing the HRC with independence and resources to fulfill those responsibilities.

416
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:47,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsequently, another group that included two previous HRC chairs, the previous DEI director, and several folks in Medford.

417
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:56,672
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with Councilor Tseng, for whom we are really very grateful, and we worked to offer such an ordinance, which is now under consideration.

418
00:53:57,392 --> 00:54:03,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge the City Council to adopt this ordinance with the edits that were made after discussion with the city administration.

419
00:54:04,218 --> 00:54:04,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

420
00:54:05,991 --> 00:54:06,611
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Muneer.

421
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:14,114
[SPEAKER_19]: We will go now to the podium.

422
00:54:15,515 --> 00:54:17,896
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

423
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:18,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

424
00:54:18,796 --> 00:54:19,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Micah Kesselman.

425
00:54:19,496 --> 00:54:21,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at 499 Main Street.

426
00:54:22,857 --> 00:54:24,518
[SPEAKER_02]: First, thank you, Councilor Tseng, for bringing this.

427
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:31,821
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a great ordinance to bring, and it's timely, and actually super

428
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:34,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to see it.

429
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:39,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not expecting it when I came, decided to come to the session today.

430
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:48,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do have some questions, though, that I would like some clarification on, I think.

431
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the data that is being

432
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:04,856
[SPEAKER_02]: written into this and being received from various departments is pretty limited in scope.

433
00:55:05,457 --> 00:55:17,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And in particular, I mean, I think, you know, especially right now with what's going on in the world, police activity and its impact on our residents' rights, their fundamental rights,

434
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:25,394
[SPEAKER_02]: is extremely important to investigate and inspect and see what we can do to make sure that everything is as above board as possible.

435
00:55:26,674 --> 00:55:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: But as this is written, the only data that you really have that you get from the police are basically police stop activity.

436
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am just like, is there a reason that it's not broader than that?

437
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:46,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why can't we just have a broad scope, broad net, the police have to, the Medford Police Department has to provide

438
00:55:47,809 --> 00:56:02,441
[SPEAKER_02]: activity data over, you know, however many last few months or something on a regular basis, because I think that would go a lot further and enabling this committee to actually craft laws and policies to advise the council on.

439
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:06,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other questions?

440
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:07,505
[SPEAKER_19]: Or is that the main question?

441
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:10,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that that's me.

442
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:10,608
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

443
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:12,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

444
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:13,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

445
00:56:15,074 --> 00:56:15,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

446
00:56:15,594 --> 00:56:15,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

447
00:56:16,034 --> 00:56:17,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognize Councilor Tseng.

448
00:56:17,735 --> 00:56:18,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the compliment.

449
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:22,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the Chair, I think that's an excellent question.

450
00:56:23,978 --> 00:56:32,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially the data that is listed out here are things that we know slash historically know the City has collected.

451
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:37,365
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the data is honestly one of the problems with

452
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:51,334
[SPEAKER_04]: these types of issues in municipal governance is that we don't have a lot of the data we really should be having, which is why there's a whole section on requesting that the city council and the city administration collect data.

453
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:57,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I think it's just we could create a whole list.

454
00:56:57,979 --> 00:56:59,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just wanted something from

455
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: different, you know, we wanted examples of data points that each department could collect or relevant departments could collect.

456
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:21,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Police stops is the main thing that we know at least, we know that the MPD does collect and that we have used in the past to analyze disparities.

457
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:27,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I do hear your point, which is why in front of every list, we've made sure to add

458
00:57:28,203 --> 00:57:44,260
[SPEAKER_04]: that these data points are minimum requirements, or at minimum, the HRC can request x, y, z. Or at minimum, departments should collect x, y, z and report x, y, z.

459
00:57:46,394 --> 00:57:51,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So all that's to say that the lists that we're referring to right now, they're not exhaustive.

460
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:56,880
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just a starting point for the HRC to be able to work on in the future.

461
00:57:57,901 --> 00:58:00,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is also a lot of worry.

462
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:09,768
[SPEAKER_04]: There would be a lot of worry from the administration, at least from an executive viewpoint, of an ordinance asking them to collect data that

463
00:58:11,398 --> 00:58:12,840
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't currently being collected.

464
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:29,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would create some consternation in the corner office, which is why part of the negotiating process was to have data that or to have these categories that we thought were implementable.

465
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:40,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I also know that a lot of this comes from the basis of this version of the HRC ordinance is kind of like a collection of different HRC ordinances from different municipalities as well.

466
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:46,580
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of this is based on what other municipalities HRCs are collecting and reporting on.

467
00:58:49,052 --> 00:58:49,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the long answer.

468
00:58:49,953 --> 00:58:54,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the short answer, the short answer is this isn't an exhaustive list.

469
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:56,697
[SPEAKER_04]: The HRC can request that.

470
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:00,120
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more data from the police department.

471
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,961
[SPEAKER_04]: That's within their powers here.

472
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:12,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just kind of put into the ordinance data that we know the city is slash has historically collected.

473
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:22,969
[SPEAKER_19]: recognize you for, well, actually I have to go back to Jennifer and then we'll come back to you.

474
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:27,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Jennifer, name and address, record you have three minutes.

475
00:59:27,911 --> 00:59:28,871
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Jennifer Yanko.

476
00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:30,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I live at 16 Monument Street.

477
00:59:31,352 --> 00:59:37,995
[SPEAKER_21]: And just in reference to this comment, there is state data that's available.

478
00:59:38,035 --> 00:59:41,296
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, arrests by race is available, freely available.

479
00:59:41,636 --> 00:59:44,097
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's other data sources that can be used.

480
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:54,201
[SPEAKER_21]: That said, I just want to commend the council on, you know, hearing this ordinance.

481
00:59:54,301 --> 01:00:12,270
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's so important, as Councilor Tseng has said, right now, we're in a place where our human rights and our civil rights are really under threat, and it's extremely important, I think, that we have an active, effective Human Rights Commission.

482
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:19,714
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think this ordinance is very, very comprehensive.

483
01:00:20,255 --> 01:00:31,542
[SPEAKER_21]: I did want to raise one concern and that has to do with, let's see, I think this is 5065B.

484
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:39,727
[SPEAKER_21]: We talked about having the resources to do the work that it would be called upon to do.

485
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:54,410
[SPEAKER_21]: And for as far as we know, I say we, as one of the people who's been working on the original recommendations, boards and commissions in the city of Medford do have a staff person assigned to them.

486
01:00:54,930 --> 01:01:09,693
[SPEAKER_21]: It could be a full-time, a part-time, an intern, but someone who is charged with sort of doing some of the clerical work that's involved, distributing agendas, making copies, and particularly,

487
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:18,294
[SPEAKER_21]: all new members of the HRC will need to have training in running meetings and so on.

488
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:35,737
[SPEAKER_21]: And so someone who could organize that as well as keep up with the routine clerical and administrative tasks that are associated with the HRC, I think that will really empower the HRC to do a much better job.

489
01:01:35,797 --> 01:01:38,138
[SPEAKER_21]: So I urge that section again,

490
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:53,258
[SPEAKER_21]: 50, 60, 50, 65 B, where it says the mayor shall assign a qualified city employee or city council liaison.

491
01:01:53,318 --> 01:02:09,307
[SPEAKER_21]: I would ask you to consider striking or city council liaison to provide staffing support to the commission because I think it's a significant task and it would be good to have someone who is assigned and who has the time

492
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:11,269
[SPEAKER_21]: and who is hired to do that.

493
01:02:12,109 --> 01:02:17,793
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was my one comment, but again, I'm really excited about this ordinance and thank you for considering it.

494
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:19,594
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

495
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:23,476
[SPEAKER_19]: I gotta go jump over you to Gaston and then come back to you.

496
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:26,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Gaston, name and address for the record.

497
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:28,859
[SPEAKER_19]: You have three minutes.

498
01:02:30,188 --> 01:02:33,170
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

499
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:37,032
[SPEAKER_20]: I support the spirit of the Human Rights Commission.

500
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:42,155
[SPEAKER_20]: I have reservations about some specific sentences.

501
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:47,458
[SPEAKER_20]: So let me proceed to just quote excerpts and ask a few questions about it.

502
01:02:48,933 --> 01:03:01,788
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first one in section 5062B, quote, appointments shall be made to ensure that no more than 60% of membership are of any one race or racial identity, end quote.

503
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:06,601
[SPEAKER_20]: This rule is imposing a quota based on race or gender.

504
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:12,805
[SPEAKER_20]: How isn't the quota based on race or gender completely against the purposes of the Human Rights Commission?

505
01:03:13,565 --> 01:03:16,628
[SPEAKER_20]: How isn't a quota based on race or gender plainly illegal?

506
01:03:17,328 --> 01:03:18,809
[SPEAKER_20]: So let me give you an example.

507
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:29,637
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's say that the commission already has 60% of its membership composed of Hispanics, Latinos, and I would like to get into the commission.

508
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:39,848
[SPEAKER_20]: then that means that because we're already at the cap of 60%, then I will be immediately disqualified just based on my racial identity.

509
01:03:41,169 --> 01:03:52,418
[SPEAKER_20]: So the second one, section 5066B3, quote, request periodic annual reports from the city administration detailing employment diversity efforts, end quote.

510
01:03:53,531 --> 01:04:07,076
[SPEAKER_20]: So my question is, how do we ensure that the employment diversity data is used to check that applicants were hired based on having been the most qualified for a job and not discriminated against based on the enumerations in Section 5061C?

511
01:04:09,297 --> 01:04:10,417
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the correct thing.

512
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:20,621
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead of using the enumerations in section 5061C to give some applicants extra consideration beyond their qualifications for the job.

513
01:04:21,761 --> 01:04:37,227
[SPEAKER_20]: And the last one, it's also section 5066C, quote, the MHRC shall also exert its moral authority on the full range of laws, practices, and policies that might have an impact of human rights, end quote.

514
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:41,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's the definition of what's moral?

515
01:04:42,105 --> 01:04:44,226
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's the definition of what's moral and what's immoral?

516
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:48,208
[SPEAKER_20]: The above gives wide undefined power to the commission.

517
01:04:49,209 --> 01:04:55,712
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are several examples throughout history where governments have committed atrocious human rights violations based on moral authority.

518
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:57,933
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are just my questions.

519
01:04:59,414 --> 01:05:07,418
[SPEAKER_20]: As I said, I support this Human Rights Commission spirit, but I would like to get some answers

520
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:10,406
[SPEAKER_20]: on my questions.

521
01:05:10,446 --> 01:05:10,867
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much.

522
01:05:10,927 --> 01:05:11,487
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

523
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:12,347
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you for your job.

524
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:12,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

525
01:05:12,968 --> 01:05:13,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

526
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:18,871
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll go back for a minute and then we'll, Justin, I hope is writing everything down.

527
01:05:18,891 --> 01:05:19,752
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll answer all the questions.

528
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:30,527
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford Police Department must collect more data than just police stops.

529
01:05:30,587 --> 01:05:37,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that we can get arrest or arrest data from state sources and everything.

530
01:05:37,109 --> 01:05:43,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I just don't see why it can't just be like a broad net of like get data from them, like whatever they have.

531
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:51,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they have records, they have data provided to the HRC council as an oversight board that makes sure that they're not violating any people's rights.

532
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:57,619
[SPEAKER_02]: But so I mean, it can always be fixed later.

533
01:05:57,699 --> 01:06:14,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, I don't see in this any requirements on the on the safe sources of data to actually provide it within a timely manner.

534
01:06:15,483 --> 01:06:18,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's maybe just because there isn't

535
01:06:18,898 --> 01:06:22,180
[SPEAKER_02]: for legal reasons went through review and that just isn't able to be put in here.

536
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:35,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be, if possible, saying, if you request data from the MPD, you request data from the housing authority, they must provide it within 30 days of the request or something like that.

537
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:46,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Give some sort of timeline so that there's an enforcement mechanism to say when they have, by the black letter of what's in the ordinance, are in violation of it.

538
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:57,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're setting yourself up to run into situations where you're gonna have malicious compliance or just straight up non-compliance because there's no reason for them to comply.

539
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:01,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are, yeah, a couple of my other sort of comments on that.

540
01:07:02,178 --> 01:07:02,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

541
01:07:02,678 --> 01:07:07,540
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna go to Barry and then I'll go to Councilor Seidert.

542
01:07:12,102 --> 01:07:12,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Barry, three minutes.

543
01:07:13,302 --> 01:07:15,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

544
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for taking this up.

545
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng for leading the charge on it.

546
01:07:22,822 --> 01:07:28,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to just restate every word that Jennifer Yanko has said.

547
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:35,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also want to bring up one, including her concern about having an assigned staff person.

548
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:42,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to ask a question, which I think is a concern.

549
01:07:42,511 --> 01:07:42,852
[SPEAKER_03]: If I heard

550
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng's amendments correctly.

551
01:07:50,335 --> 01:07:55,519
[SPEAKER_03]: He was suggesting excising section 5066 number two.

552
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:58,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

553
01:07:58,322 --> 01:07:59,703
[SPEAKER_19]: 56D6D.

554
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:01,765
[SPEAKER_03]: 66B number two.

555
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:12,394
[SPEAKER_19]: D2, so under research and reporting educational data such as school discipline rates and dropout rates from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education metrics on IEPs.

556
01:08:13,267 --> 01:08:14,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.

557
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:15,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that on here at all.

558
01:08:15,828 --> 01:08:16,568
[SPEAKER_19]: It's D2.

559
01:08:16,648 --> 01:08:18,389
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one page further.

560
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:21,730
[SPEAKER_19]: So it wasn't B2, the periodic.

561
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:22,470
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

562
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:23,650
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was not B2.

563
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:24,070
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

564
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:26,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the other change?

565
01:08:26,131 --> 01:08:28,572
[SPEAKER_19]: I was not able to hear that.

566
01:08:29,092 --> 01:08:31,333
[SPEAKER_19]: 25066B, the main section.

567
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:36,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Instead of reading the city administration and the public school system, it would just read the city.

568
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:38,435
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

569
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

570
01:08:41,562 --> 01:08:42,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to state my support.

571
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

572
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:46,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

573
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:46,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

574
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:50,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Tseng on the questions.

575
01:08:51,745 --> 01:08:52,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

576
01:08:52,165 --> 01:09:04,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there there's a lot so I'll take it one by one on the, the, the data from police department see authorities.

577
01:09:05,552 --> 01:09:14,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I would support inserting a sentence in there to request timely information.

578
01:09:15,378 --> 01:09:32,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the reason why we didn't is because there's not a neat place to put it, where some of the data that's under requests is more about requests rather than it is more about data that we might not currently have

579
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:35,323
[SPEAKER_04]: mixed in with data that we know we have.

580
01:09:35,403 --> 01:09:36,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be good as well.

581
01:09:39,627 --> 01:09:40,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's a good catch.

582
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:41,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

583
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:50,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that I'll have to, you know, the mayor's office will also have to sign off on this ordinance as well.

584
01:09:51,178 --> 01:09:57,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would suggest reaching out to her office because her office is the one that will execute this ordinance.

585
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:12,373
[SPEAKER_04]: On the second resident's concerns about the city staff person slash liaison situation, this is something we talked about in committee as well.

586
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:20,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially in committee, we discussed how currently there is no assigned city staff person to the HRC.

587
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:26,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically, it's been the DAI director, but the DAI director has said that she won't.

588
01:10:26,846 --> 01:10:28,849
[SPEAKER_04]: be the liaison to the HRC.

589
01:10:31,652 --> 01:10:37,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then it becomes, you know, it falls upon the mayor to decide who else will do it.

590
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:41,125
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I'm working with the mayor on currently.

591
01:10:42,226 --> 01:10:50,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the kind of people that we the city staff that we have traditionally kind of thought of to be well suited for this role.

592
01:10:50,957 --> 01:10:54,621
[SPEAKER_04]: No one has, you know, no one has offered.

593
01:10:56,304 --> 01:10:59,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one has said yes to it, which is why I'm part of.

594
01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:12,929
[SPEAKER_04]: through conversations with the mayor's office and with the DEI office, we put in the words or city council liaison were relevant to give us the most flexibility to make sure that we can at the very least get this off the ground.

595
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:19,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe once it's off the ground and up and running, we can get a city staff person to do that.

596
01:11:20,637 --> 01:11:29,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect this is also something that the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee is gonna keep working on in the future as well, to make sure that we do have an assigned city staff person.

597
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:49,390
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say that we shouldn't strike the words that were suggested, that was suggested to be struck, just in order to make sure that we give ourselves the most flexibility going forward with getting this new HRC up and off the ground.

598
01:11:50,539 --> 01:12:15,651
[SPEAKER_04]: With regards to the Section 50-62B, I believe that most of us can agree that the role of a Human Rights Commission necessitates diversity on that commission, or that we have that flexibility to make sure that we have

599
01:12:17,445 --> 01:12:27,292
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the best qualified residents joining, but in this case, qualification includes life experience and diversity as well.

600
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:36,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've seen in the past, especially with HRCs, but board and commissions in general, they don't always reflect the makeup of the city.

601
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:40,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this ensures the best outcome that we can get.

602
01:12:44,757 --> 01:13:04,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, with regards to the policy advocacy work, the research and reporting that the HRC does, I believe that inherently human rights includes questions of morality, and that's something for a representative body of our city to get together and discuss.

603
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:15,042
[SPEAKER_04]: something that we did actually make sure that was in this ordinance was that the HRC statements will be in the name of the HRC.

604
01:13:15,482 --> 01:13:27,072
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, this is also a public forum for just like City Council is, although I'm sure with different rules, is a public forum for residents to talk about what

605
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:29,787
[SPEAKER_04]: what we see as human rights.

606
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:40,113
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact is that so many of the human rights and civil rights that are under attack in our country right now are things that I would believe that at least 90% of the city believes in.

607
01:13:41,194 --> 01:13:45,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't see that language affecting that work.

608
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:57,445
[SPEAKER_19]: So there was a further amendment to add language in 5066D regarding timeliness of reporting?

609
01:13:58,195 --> 01:13:58,435
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

610
01:14:00,996 --> 01:14:01,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I can read it out.

611
01:14:02,156 --> 01:14:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

612
01:14:04,136 --> 01:14:21,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the end of the blurb in 66D, I would insert the words, the following list shall not be exhaustive and all requested information from the city shall be provided in a timely manner.

613
01:14:25,596 --> 01:14:26,757
[SPEAKER_19]: And just a clarifying question.

614
01:14:26,777 --> 01:14:28,839
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds like staff.

615
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,942
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor shall sign a city council liaison.

616
01:14:33,623 --> 01:14:36,405
[SPEAKER_19]: She asked the Councilor to do it, obligated to do it.

617
01:14:36,745 --> 01:14:37,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that correct?

618
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:41,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, I, that would not be correct.

619
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:51,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, um, it's this is the kind of similar language as in other commission ordinances where, um, you know, she's asked, like,

620
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:54,770
[SPEAKER_04]: With the current HRC, for example, it's the same language.

621
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:57,451
[SPEAKER_04]: She's asked the DI director.

622
01:14:57,491 --> 01:14:58,472
[SPEAKER_19]: They would not be obligated.

623
01:14:58,572 --> 01:14:59,953
[SPEAKER_04]: They would not be obligated.

624
01:15:01,354 --> 01:15:08,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And I suspect this is something that the city council could also vote on, although that's not a must.

625
01:15:09,759 --> 01:15:13,281
[SPEAKER_19]: So it could be a resolution to delegate that to someone.

626
01:15:13,321 --> 01:15:19,405
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess what I'm saying is it sounds like you're putting that in to allow city councillors to be considered.

627
01:15:19,726 --> 01:15:21,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, exactly, exactly.

628
01:15:22,138 --> 01:15:26,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that was a suggested language from the mayor's office.

629
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:26,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

630
01:15:30,261 --> 01:15:34,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further discussion by members of the council on the amended amendment?

631
01:15:36,723 --> 01:15:41,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none... There is one technical edit that I forgot to mention when I was reading out the amendments.

632
01:15:41,565 --> 01:15:42,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just cut off.

633
01:15:43,445 --> 01:15:47,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I would add our standard severability language at the end of this ordinance.

634
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:48,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

635
01:15:50,747 --> 01:16:08,159
[SPEAKER_04]: the standard language our city uses is the provisions in this ordinance are severable if any part or provision of this ordinance or the application of this ordinance to any person or circumstance is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected by such holding and shall continue to have full force in effect.

636
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:13,142
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in an earlier draft and I just forgot to copy and paste it into this one.

637
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:19,106
[SPEAKER_04]: That would just be its own section then.

638
01:16:19,406 --> 01:16:20,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Section 50-67?

639
01:16:20,786 --> 01:16:21,247
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

640
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:24,989
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

641
01:16:26,209 --> 01:16:28,150
[SPEAKER_19]: And please send the amendments on a clean copy.

642
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:28,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

643
01:16:29,671 --> 01:16:32,733
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to go to Steve Schnapp, name and address for the record.

644
01:16:32,753 --> 01:16:33,733
[SPEAKER_19]: Steve, you have three minutes.

645
01:16:34,814 --> 01:16:36,775
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to unmute you, and I'll restart the timer.

646
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:45,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

647
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,440
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

648
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,402
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 36 Hillside Avenue.

649
01:16:49,423 --> 01:16:56,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate Councilor Tseng and the council moving on reestablishing the HRC.

650
01:16:57,228 --> 01:16:58,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have one question.

651
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:03,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there another city commission that is not staffed by the administration?

652
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:06,735
[SPEAKER_19]: I do not.

653
01:17:06,815 --> 01:17:12,619
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I don't know if any city commissions are not staffed currently.

654
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,545
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't, I certainly can say there's no city commission staffed by city council.

655
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:27,382
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's curious to me that the city administration would not enable that.

656
01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:42,218
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would urge the council to reconsider putting the language in that Jennifer suggested or striking the language that Jennifer suggested.

657
01:17:42,998 --> 01:17:46,459
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, thank you very much for finally moving on this.

658
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,840
[SPEAKER_00]: We greatly appreciate it.

659
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:49,481
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

660
01:17:53,222 --> 01:17:56,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

661
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:02,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing none, I'm seeing no discussion members of the public.

662
01:18:02,071 --> 01:18:09,397
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have a motion from Councilor Tseng as amended to approve as amended by Councilor Tseng, is there a second on the motion?

663
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:11,319
[SPEAKER_19]: On the second by council Lazzaro.

664
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

665
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:17,404
[SPEAKER_15]: For approval for first reading.

666
01:18:17,424 --> 01:18:18,965
[SPEAKER_19]: For approval for first reading as amended.

667
01:18:20,226 --> 01:18:21,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

668
01:18:21,367 --> 01:18:21,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

669
01:18:22,328 --> 01:18:23,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice president Collins.

670
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

671
01:18:25,912 --> 01:18:26,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro?

672
01:18:27,773 --> 01:18:28,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Leming is absent.

673
01:18:29,514 --> 01:18:30,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

674
01:18:31,695 --> 01:18:32,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng?

675
01:18:32,435 --> 01:18:32,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

676
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:33,576
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears?

677
01:18:33,736 --> 01:18:36,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, 16 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

678
01:18:36,357 --> 01:18:47,623
[SPEAKER_19]: 25.075 offered by Vice President Collins, proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance, Medford Square District and West Medford Square District from the Community Development Board.

679
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,024
[SPEAKER_19]: This was referred from the

680
01:18:51,537 --> 01:18:55,860
[SPEAKER_19]: planning and permitting committee to our regular meeting the initial proposal.

681
01:18:56,481 --> 01:19:06,409
[SPEAKER_19]: The process from here is that the council is obligated to refer zoning amendments, rightfully presented zoning amendments such as this one to the community development board.

682
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,171
[SPEAKER_19]: The community development board will then hold a public hearing on the matter.

683
01:19:10,992 --> 01:19:13,654
[SPEAKER_19]: They may choose to make recommendations to the council.

684
01:19:14,295 --> 01:19:21,020
[SPEAKER_19]: The council will then hold a public hearing on the matter and consider any proposed recommendations from the community development board

685
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:29,690
[SPEAKER_19]: And then after the public hearing of the council is concluded, the council would vote to adopt or reject.

686
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:32,012
[SPEAKER_19]: With that, I will go to Vice President Collins.

687
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:34,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bears.

688
01:19:34,931 --> 01:19:44,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for outlining the steps that this proposal will take after a vote to refer it out to the Community Development Board this evening.

689
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:58,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to quickly recap the steps that have been taken to get us to this point, like all proposals that have been generated in our comprehensive zoning overhaul this year, or this term, rather,

690
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:20,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, these proposals, the zoning proposals for West Medford Square, Medford Square, and updates to our ADU's regulations were all developed in the Planning and Permitting Committee, um, with committee members, the zoning consultant, Innes Associates, and, um, city staff members of the Planning Development and Sustainability Department.

691
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:26,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We met on this proposal three times between March and April.

692
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:33,929
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a public Q&A on the three proposals last week after they're referred out of the City Council this evening.

693
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:38,674
[SPEAKER_06]: They will then begin the public hearing process before the Community Development Board.

694
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:41,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So far in the process, the Community Development Board has been

695
01:20:42,778 --> 01:20:49,166
[SPEAKER_06]: taking their time to hold as many hearings on the zoning topics as they have felt the need to, which I think is great and I'm sure they will continue to do.

696
01:20:49,927 --> 01:20:56,755
[SPEAKER_06]: That is another opportunity for community members to ask questions and give comment on these proposals as they have been doing.

697
01:20:58,697 --> 01:21:01,940
[SPEAKER_06]: when these proposals were in the planning and permitting committee as well.

698
01:21:02,781 --> 01:21:07,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So there has been a lot of discussion of these specific proposals themselves.

699
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:14,811
[SPEAKER_06]: In committee, there will be a lot more discussion about the specifics of the proposals in CDB when they're gone into in-depth.

700
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:16,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So I won't do that yet again here.

701
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:24,179
[SPEAKER_06]: But if folks want to learn more about these proposals before the CDB public hearings, there is a lot of information

702
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,462

[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you have to.

737

[SPEAKER_15]: This is a vote to table.

738
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:40,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

739
01:23:40,568 --> 01:23:41,708

01:24:05,318 --> 01:24:06,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Is she coming down here?

754
01:24:07,559 --> 01:24:07,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

755
01:24:09,321 --> 01:24:15,025
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I can just get us a little bit of preview damping while we get there.

756
01:24:17,838 --> 01:24:31,248
[SPEAKER_19]: So the update that we're receiving from the RFP Evaluation Committee tonight is regarding the awarding of the proposal submitted by transom.

757
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:45,980
[SPEAKER_19]: So we do have here from the mayor, dear President Bears and members of the Medford City Council, the evaluation for the request for proposals RFP for lease and development of real property has completed its review and evaluation work.

758
01:24:46,560 --> 01:25:03,582
[SPEAKER_19]: I respectfully request and recommend that council permit a presentation to be made to your honorable body on the proposals received the evaluation process and the committee's vote for the preferred developer director planning development and sustainability Alicia will be present at your meeting to present on behalf of the committee thank you for your kind attention to this matter sincerely Brianna Lugo-Curtin, Mayor.

759
01:25:04,698 --> 01:25:12,581
[SPEAKER_19]: We, the city, has had several plans on Medford Square over the past 20 years.

760
01:25:13,801 --> 01:25:20,144
[SPEAKER_19]: All of them have talked about activating these surface lots behind and adjacent to City Hall.

761
01:25:20,864 --> 01:25:28,767
[SPEAKER_19]: And last fall, an RFP was drafted regarding those lots, requesting that proponents

762
01:25:29,427 --> 01:25:29,987
[SPEAKER_19]: the City of Toronto.

763
01:25:30,007 --> 01:25:34,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Um submit proposals for the redevelopment of those lots based on a number of conditions.

764
01:25:35,251 --> 01:25:37,012
[SPEAKER_19]: The city did receive two proposals.

765
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:40,894
[SPEAKER_19]: There's an evaluation committee of which I was a non voting member.

766
01:25:40,954 --> 01:25:42,275
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor was a non voting member.

767
01:25:42,295 --> 01:25:48,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Um and city staff and our Chamber of Commerce president were voting members that

768
01:25:55,262 --> 01:26:16,293
[SPEAKER_19]: the two proponents, and then eventually, after review, and there's also a scoring sheet based on a bunch of objective criteria, the committee made a recommendation to award the proposal submitted by transom, and Director Hunt is here

769
01:26:17,067 --> 01:26:18,988
[SPEAKER_19]: to share a little bit more about that.

770
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:26,554
[SPEAKER_19]: The next steps from here are that now the city will be able to enter into negotiations with the proponent.

771
01:26:27,995 --> 01:26:45,187
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposal is a starting point, not a final product, so city staff working with the proponent will be able to tune that proposal, hopefully make some changes that I know the city has

772
01:26:45,987 --> 01:26:46,688
[SPEAKER_19]: wanted to make.

773
01:26:47,668 --> 01:26:59,556
[SPEAKER_19]: And then once a final agreement has been drafted, the City Council will need to vote to approve the lease agreement for the city-owned land that these new developments would sit on.

774
01:27:01,477 --> 01:27:05,940
[SPEAKER_19]: And with that, I think I provided some useful information and used the time well.

775
01:27:07,941 --> 01:27:11,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Could we allow Director Hunt to share her screen?

776
01:27:15,948 --> 01:27:18,902
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll recognize the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

777
01:27:19,992 --> 01:27:20,512
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

778
01:27:20,692 --> 01:27:21,173
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

779
01:27:21,493 --> 01:27:28,117
[SPEAKER_26]: And I do, I just feel the need to be very clear that I wasn't being rude writing in my office to be called down.

780
01:27:29,097 --> 01:27:34,580
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, I am a member of our traffic commission and we have been meeting since five o'clock hearing petitions.

781
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,063
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just told them that I am in favor of the rest of the petitions on the agenda and I had to now leave.

782
01:27:41,604 --> 01:27:48,028
[SPEAKER_26]: I just, I felt it was important to say that, that that's, that was not me just not being here.

783
01:27:48,988 --> 01:27:50,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

784
01:27:51,649 --> 01:28:07,712
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't normally share from Adobe, but I think there's a full screen option here.

785
01:28:07,852 --> 01:28:08,912
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's what you want to see.

786
01:28:09,252 --> 01:28:10,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it didn't change anything for us.

787
01:28:11,993 --> 01:28:14,133
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a little thing in the bottom right, just a little paper.

788
01:28:16,978 --> 01:28:17,738
[SPEAKER_26]: This one?

789
01:28:17,858 --> 01:28:19,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

790
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:20,159
[SPEAKER_19]: Does that do anything?

791
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:21,899
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

792
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:22,759
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

793
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,241
[SPEAKER_26]: When I go to full screen mode, it doesn't change it on your end.

794
01:28:31,321 --> 01:28:32,521
[SPEAKER_26]: I think I need to reshare.

795
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:37,082
[SPEAKER_26]: I need to put it in full screen and then share the screen.

796
01:28:37,142 --> 01:28:37,822
[SPEAKER_26]: So sorry.

797
01:28:37,982 --> 01:28:38,902
[SPEAKER_26]: My apologies.

798
01:28:39,442 --> 01:28:40,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have any tips?

799
01:28:40,423 --> 01:28:41,263
[SPEAKER_26]: Full screen mode.

800
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:42,023
[SPEAKER_26]: And?

801
01:28:46,778 --> 01:28:48,178
[SPEAKER_26]: No, that doesn't work either.

802
01:28:49,599 --> 01:28:50,039
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry.

803
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,980
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have our Medford Community Media Director, Kevin Harrington, to help out.

804
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:59,481
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you know how to do it, Kevin?

805
01:28:59,702 --> 01:29:00,442
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Adobe.

806
01:29:01,782 --> 01:29:04,563
[SPEAKER_26]: I do have a PowerPoint version, but I have to go find it on my computer.

807
01:29:04,603 --> 01:29:08,064
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're just doing the window, right?

808
01:29:08,104 --> 01:29:08,644
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

809
01:29:14,501 --> 01:29:16,102
[SPEAKER_26]: My apologies.

810
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:30,691
[SPEAKER_26]: And I will, as we start, I didn't catch everything that President Bears said, but as we get this started, we were supported by a grant from Mass Development.

811
01:29:30,731 --> 01:29:37,295
[SPEAKER_26]: There have been a couple of grants, and I'll get into that, but one of them was to support us with a consultant to write the RFP

812
01:29:38,155 --> 01:29:39,356
[SPEAKER_26]: and to help with all of this.

813
01:29:39,496 --> 01:29:46,160
[SPEAKER_26]: And in fact, the reason I'm in Adobe is because our consultants prepared the presentation for us in this associates.

814
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:49,922
[SPEAKER_26]: You may recognize their name from the planning study.

815
01:29:49,982 --> 01:29:52,323
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm going to tell you that that is a pure coincidence.

816
01:29:52,803 --> 01:30:01,108
[SPEAKER_26]: We asked mass development to please, would they support this effort of leasing out these lots and doing this development?

817
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:02,969
[SPEAKER_26]: And they said, absolutely.

818
01:30:03,029 --> 01:30:04,210
[SPEAKER_26]: You did the diff with us.

819
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:07,672
[SPEAKER_26]: You may all remember that, the development incremental financing.

820
01:30:08,492 --> 01:30:11,893
[SPEAKER_26]: that was a prelude to leasing out these lots.

821
01:30:11,933 --> 01:30:13,614
[SPEAKER_26]: They said, we want you to be successful.

822
01:30:14,554 --> 01:30:18,255
[SPEAKER_26]: We have on-call consultants that can help with an RFP like this.

823
01:30:19,616 --> 01:30:21,736
[SPEAKER_26]: Have you ever heard of a consultant, Emily Innes?

824
01:30:21,776 --> 01:30:23,497
[SPEAKER_26]: We think she'd be a good fit for you.

825
01:30:23,597 --> 01:30:24,797
[SPEAKER_26]: And I said, perfect.

826
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:29,399
[SPEAKER_26]: We're already working with her and she is aware of the needs and the preferences of the city.

827
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:30,979
[SPEAKER_26]: So that would be a great.

828
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:37,161
[SPEAKER_26]: So actually she has other staff, support staff that you all have not met through the zoning process.

829
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:39,022
[SPEAKER_26]: that were the consultants on this.

830
01:30:39,042 --> 01:30:41,164
[SPEAKER_26]: Should I just flip to the PowerPoint version of this?

831
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:43,886
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not open.

832
01:30:46,829 --> 01:30:56,176
[SPEAKER_26]: Share the whole screen and then go into... Yeah, so nobody text me.

833
01:30:56,236 --> 01:30:59,959
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't turn off my notifications.

834
01:31:01,918 --> 01:31:03,520
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know that we can promise that.

835
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,421
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

836
01:31:06,463 --> 01:31:08,565
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I've warned people.

837
01:31:08,645 --> 01:31:13,531
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, so this evening, so we this is the.

838
01:31:15,162 --> 01:31:34,992
[SPEAKER_26]: the space and the evaluation committee as we were discussing the mayor and President Bears were non voting members we were advised by Fiona our procurement officer Fiona Maxwell, as well as Emily in this from in his consultants and actually Claire O'Neill for mass development attended all of our meetings in met separately with

839
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:37,694
[SPEAKER_26]: Sal and myself as we went through this process.

840
01:31:38,194 --> 01:31:54,206
[SPEAKER_26]: And so then the evaluation committee was myself, Sal DiStefano our Director of Economic Development, Nina Nazarian the Chief of Staff, Tim McGiven our Commissioner of Public Works, and Andrew Mather as the President of the Board of Directors of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

841
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:59,311
[SPEAKER_26]: I will not read everything on all the slides but I did feel that that one was important.

842
01:31:59,772 --> 01:32:05,878
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is part of a much longer process for those who have not been involved in Medford politics for a long time.

843
01:32:05,898 --> 01:32:10,763
[SPEAKER_26]: There have been many Medford square master plans but we specifically referred back to a 2017 one.

844
01:32:12,425 --> 01:32:19,754
[SPEAKER_26]: And in 2019 there was an evaluation of the real estate development potential of the city owned properties done by gamble associates.

845
01:32:20,555 --> 01:32:23,139
[SPEAKER_26]: So that helped inform this process as well.

846
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:31,049
[SPEAKER_26]: The housing production plan called out these parcels as a good location to bring more housing and more development into the city.

847
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:48,016
[SPEAKER_26]: There was, we then did a process that some people may remember with the MAPC, where we went to the senior center I got yelled at a lot we went to the library we talked to people a lot we did a bunch of outreach, talking to people about what they would want to see what were the concerns.

848
01:32:48,456 --> 01:32:51,957
[SPEAKER_26]: Because when the city owns the parcels, you can ask for things.

849
01:32:52,298 --> 01:32:54,919
[SPEAKER_26]: You could ask them to just pay you money and you can sell them.

850
01:32:55,539 --> 01:33:05,763
[SPEAKER_26]: Or you can ask for community benefits where they provide things that the city wants to see that is not necessarily cost effective to the developer.

851
01:33:06,323 --> 01:33:14,887
[SPEAKER_26]: And if we lease the land, if we do it this other way, then we can get some more benefits, community benefits out of this.

852
01:33:15,878 --> 01:33:25,165
[SPEAKER_26]: And then based on that work, and from what we had heard from the community, we went and prepared an RFP for the lease and development of real property.

853
01:33:26,286 --> 01:33:30,549
[SPEAKER_26]: So then this RFP process, we put the proposals out, we got those back.

854
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:38,435
[SPEAKER_26]: We actually got those back, yes, in late December, but there's been a lot of work that's gone into this since then with reviewing them.

855
01:33:38,936 --> 01:33:41,598
[SPEAKER_26]: Innis as well did evaluations on these.

856
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:45,000
[SPEAKER_26]: We also, we then scored these.

857
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:52,605
[SPEAKER_26]: We also had another firm do an economic development review of the proposals as well.

858
01:33:53,345 --> 01:33:59,169
[SPEAKER_26]: And we requested additional follow-up information from the consultants, and we interviewed them as well.

859
01:34:00,129 --> 01:34:07,013
[SPEAKER_26]: And so now we are here making this recommendation of the preferred vendor, the preferred developer.

860
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:14,000
[SPEAKER_26]: We will also need the city council to formally declare the property surplus to municipal requirements.

861
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:17,863
[SPEAKER_26]: We did not prepare that for this evening, but that is one of the legal steps.

862
01:34:18,904 --> 01:34:25,130
[SPEAKER_26]: We are looking to meet with the developer next week to follow up with our lawyers who have also been involved.

863
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:31,236
[SPEAKER_26]: So there were sample leases and sample agreements in the RFP that were prepared by our lawyers.

864
01:34:34,013 --> 01:34:39,114
[SPEAKER_26]: So everybody is clear, I realize that it's not always, not everybody sees maps the same way I do.

865
01:34:39,814 --> 01:34:43,255
[SPEAKER_26]: To orient you, this is Medford City Hall, this is where we are right now.

866
01:34:44,655 --> 01:34:53,577
[SPEAKER_26]: This long strip is 93, and so the Salem Street Rotary is up here, Vita Real is here in this corner.

867
01:34:54,317 --> 01:34:57,878
[SPEAKER_26]: So the city owns this lot, and then

868
01:34:58,748 --> 01:35:08,261
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the pink lot, and that one we have been calling Lot C. B is the lot behind us where you often see the buses stopping.

869
01:35:08,281 --> 01:35:09,402
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a bus stop there.

870
01:35:09,843 --> 01:35:12,206
[SPEAKER_26]: We've incorporated that into it all along.

871
01:35:12,226 --> 01:35:13,248
[SPEAKER_26]: We said that's important.

872
01:35:13,688 --> 01:35:14,870
[SPEAKER_26]: Oops, I didn't mean to go forward.

873
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:17,713
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's where the post office trucks are.

874
01:35:18,715 --> 01:35:21,298
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't own this little small building on the corner.

875
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:27,325
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a three condo building and we have not been able to incorporate it into the project.

876
01:35:28,086 --> 01:35:32,712
[SPEAKER_26]: And then there's the this yellow lot down here is a lot a it's the one closest to the river.

877
01:35:34,254 --> 01:35:38,196
[SPEAKER_26]: So to orient you here is the Peace Garden and the Senior Center.

878
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:39,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Our taller buildings are down here.

879
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:40,798
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the river.

880
01:35:41,859 --> 01:35:49,244
[SPEAKER_26]: I will not spend this much time on all the slides, but I do really realize that people don't always see the maps the same way we all do.

881
01:35:50,385 --> 01:35:55,049
[SPEAKER_26]: So these are some of the criteria that we talked about and the things that we rated them on.

882
01:35:55,569 --> 01:36:10,002
[SPEAKER_26]: And you can see things that are very important to the city you see affordable housing and parking and what their management plan is and what their financial capacity was that's one of the things we brought in an outside consultant to review them and make sure they had the capacity to do this.

883
01:36:11,303 --> 01:36:12,304
[SPEAKER_26]: And what was their vision.

884
01:36:13,545 --> 01:36:20,012
[SPEAKER_26]: So we got two responses, the Davis Company's response and Transom Real Estate's response.

885
01:36:20,932 --> 01:36:22,334
[SPEAKER_26]: Both of them had architects.

886
01:36:23,054 --> 01:36:31,463
[SPEAKER_26]: Interestingly enough, they both had the same legal counsel with them, and Transom also brought along landscape architects and Beyond Walls, which is a placemaking.

887
01:36:32,343 --> 01:36:33,725
[SPEAKER_26]: They do a lot of large art.

888
01:36:36,178 --> 01:36:38,800
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is the two proposed programs.

889
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:45,885
[SPEAKER_26]: You will see, yes, Davis proposed more housing than Transom.

890
01:36:46,406 --> 01:36:51,690
[SPEAKER_26]: Transom proposed a higher percentage of affordable housing, which was one of the things we were looking for.

891
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:58,355
[SPEAKER_26]: They both proposed the same amount of commercial space, but that was also notably different when you get down into it.

892
01:36:59,055 --> 01:37:12,782
[SPEAKER_26]: And Davis had more parking but less parking per unit when you look at the total number of units versus the number of parking spots and parking and having available parking for the community was very important to us.

893
01:37:13,983 --> 01:37:17,044
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want to spend too much time on all of this.

894
01:37:17,144 --> 01:37:25,386
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that the punchline, most people have already seen the punchline of my proposal, which is that we selected one of them and which one we selected.

895
01:37:26,506 --> 01:37:30,087
[SPEAKER_26]: So this was Davis and they had three residential buildings.

896
01:37:30,867 --> 01:37:33,408
[SPEAKER_26]: They put the parking underneath each one of them.

897
01:37:33,808 --> 01:37:42,970
[SPEAKER_26]: They talked about pocket parks and they had a building over here that was a proposed pavilion that would have more

898
01:37:44,972 --> 01:37:50,323
[SPEAKER_26]: space for businesses and would also be sort of a recreation type space.

899
01:37:52,718 --> 01:37:54,399
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the transom proposal.

900
01:37:54,860 --> 01:38:02,345
[SPEAKER_26]: The transom proposal has a large residential building in the middle, and then a parking garage over on the right.

901
01:38:03,326 --> 01:38:09,050
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of their images of the parking garage, this is where they bring in beyond walls, is to make it not look like a parking garage.

902
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,551
[SPEAKER_26]: So your first thought is, that's art.

903
01:38:11,732 --> 01:38:14,594
[SPEAKER_26]: And your second idea is, oh, that's parking.

904
01:38:14,614 --> 01:38:17,356
[SPEAKER_26]: You may have seen some of this at Assembly Row.

905
01:38:17,996 --> 01:38:20,498
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen that kind of thing all over the world at this point.

906
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:32,077
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the third building closer to the river would also have residents will have three stories of housing but under that would be a large grocery store 14,000 square feet.

907
01:38:32,557 --> 01:38:38,660
[SPEAKER_26]: It also has open parking closest to the river, and that's actually interesting and very strategic.

908
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:44,303
[SPEAKER_26]: So first of all that parking is directly across from the senior center and how we would treat that and

909
01:38:44,743 --> 01:39:03,164
[SPEAKER_26]: how we would arrange the traffic flow would we put in a crossing there or further up at the corner that's something that we would look at, but it's very strategic because we have something that's called chapter 91 land chapter 91 is water is land that used to belong to the river that used to be water land.

910
01:39:03,844 --> 01:39:09,906
[SPEAKER_26]: And it comes with a very, very hefty permitting process that can take upwards of 18 months.

911
01:39:10,466 --> 01:39:14,787
[SPEAKER_26]: And so the idea here is that they would like to bring in this grocery store.

912
01:39:14,827 --> 01:39:17,688
[SPEAKER_26]: They would like to make some commitments early on.

913
01:39:18,588 --> 01:39:21,349
[SPEAKER_26]: It would be one that is of a modest size.

914
01:39:21,409 --> 01:39:24,070
[SPEAKER_26]: This would not be a very large grocery store.

915
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:27,151
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's not a chain that specializes in very large stores.

916
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:30,792
[SPEAKER_26]: But because this land would remain

917
01:39:31,472 --> 01:39:41,662
[SPEAKER_26]: public parking, which is its current use, there would be no change in use of the Chapter 91 land, which would allow this project to move dramatically faster.

918
01:39:42,223 --> 01:39:48,749
[SPEAKER_26]: Anything that involved a building or change of use on this area would require an 18-month permitting process.

919
01:39:49,878 --> 01:40:03,234
[SPEAKER_26]: So it both satisfies the desires of the senior center, but it also would speed things up and allows them to make some commitments down here around the business that would go in there as well.

920
01:40:04,377 --> 01:40:06,798
[SPEAKER_26]: So here are some conceptual drawings.

921
01:40:07,798 --> 01:40:09,078
[SPEAKER_26]: These are all available.

922
01:40:09,738 --> 01:40:12,119
[SPEAKER_26]: We can share the whole slide set out as well.

923
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:16,540
[SPEAKER_26]: They're in the proposals, some interconnected pocket parks.

924
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,880
[SPEAKER_26]: This was Transom's vision.

925
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:30,203
[SPEAKER_26]: They actually, what they're showing is you're standing at the Peace Garden, and on your left would be the grocery store, and on your right, there would be a cafe.

926
01:40:30,863 --> 01:40:34,224
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's how they would activate Riverside Ave.

927
01:40:34,304 --> 01:40:43,846
[SPEAKER_26]: Part of what we were looking for is that for people who come to the hotel, that right now they stand there and they look at a dark alleyway and they don't think they necessarily want to go down there.

928
01:40:44,387 --> 01:40:53,549
[SPEAKER_26]: And if there was a grocery store and a cafe there, they would be drawn down into Medford Square where we have a number of businesses and restaurants down the block.

929
01:40:55,290 --> 01:41:03,075
[SPEAKER_26]: This is, if you see here, this is this idea of a parking garage that actually is covered in art and doesn't really look like a parking garage.

930
01:41:05,776 --> 01:41:07,497
[SPEAKER_26]: So then we reviewed the proposals.

931
01:41:07,657 --> 01:41:09,718
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, there was one other thing that I did want to highlight.

932
01:41:09,758 --> 01:41:16,362
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a little bit here, is that this area between City Hall and the building they're proposing would be a bus stop.

933
01:41:16,802 --> 01:41:23,426
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have been working with the MBTA on getting some rapid transit lines from Medford Square to various locations.

934
01:41:23,966 --> 01:41:34,295
[SPEAKER_26]: One of them that is planned is from here through Sullivan Square to Kendall Square every 15 minutes at all times and every eight minutes during rush hour.

935
01:41:34,656 --> 01:41:40,180
[SPEAKER_26]: And part of what the MBTA needs is some facilities for their bus drivers at the end of the line.

936
01:41:40,681 --> 01:41:46,266
[SPEAKER_26]: And so Transom has agreed that there could be bus driver facilities available in this building for them.

937
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,782
[SPEAKER_26]: So all the members scored them.

938
01:41:50,602 --> 01:41:54,486
[SPEAKER_26]: And people have asked me, particularly the two developers who I notified,

939
01:41:56,283 --> 01:41:57,504
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there any one thing?

940
01:41:57,924 --> 01:42:07,929
[SPEAKER_26]: And basically I would tell everybody that transom across the board scored higher and all the people who scored them, there was something else.

941
01:42:07,989 --> 01:42:14,052
[SPEAKER_26]: It wasn't one thing in any one of these, but across the board, there were various things that were important to various people.

942
01:42:14,733 --> 01:42:24,378
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's where we ended up with transom having better scores across the board than Davis did in the various areas we were rating.

943
01:42:25,971 --> 01:42:41,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said, we did the interviews, we had questions, we did a final meeting, FXM associates did a final evaluation of the fiscal impacts of both proposals to help support what we were saying that there were no financial concerns on all of them.

944
01:42:43,907 --> 01:42:55,334
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the city said that we should designate transoms the city started the team recommended that the city should designate transom as the team as the preferred developer and begin negotiations.

945
01:42:56,014 --> 01:42:59,977
[SPEAKER_26]: So, the long term lease is the part city council would have to vote to approve that.

946
01:43:00,857 --> 01:43:10,624
[SPEAKER_26]: But we're at the point now where we would start negotiating the details of this, and all of this could change and there's some concern is this the right place for a parking garage and the parking garage move.

947
01:43:11,045 --> 01:43:17,830
[SPEAKER_26]: How do we manage that in their proposal, they are actually proposing that they should build the parking garage.

948
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:30,540
[SPEAKER_26]: They would like to guarantee revenue in that parking garage by leasing back spots for some of their apartments, but they would like to turn the parking garage and its management over to the city for ownership.

949
01:43:31,441 --> 01:43:42,431
[SPEAKER_26]: We asked what about putting some offices in there, and they said yeah if you want to put us to put offices as part of it so we're picturing maybe the parking office might want to have their offices directly in the parking garage.

950
01:43:43,512 --> 01:43:45,073
[SPEAKER_26]: We talked with the parking director.

951
01:43:45,133 --> 01:43:47,455
[SPEAKER_26]: They are comfortable with running a parking garage.

952
01:43:47,475 --> 01:43:52,581
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, they don't have the staff now, but by the time it is built, that is something that they could do.

953
01:43:53,622 --> 01:43:59,628
[SPEAKER_26]: And there would be guaranteed revenue because the buildings would lease some of the spaces back.

954
01:44:00,148 --> 01:44:10,472
[SPEAKER_26]: and then some of the spaces would be available as public parking, as well as I mentioned earlier, that open lot closest to the river, at least for now, would remain open parking.

955
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:13,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people have said to me, could it later be developed?

956
01:44:13,354 --> 01:44:14,914
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, we would still have that.

957
01:44:14,934 --> 01:44:15,675
[SPEAKER_26]: It would still be.

958
01:44:16,135 --> 01:44:22,698
[SPEAKER_26]: But it would take that 18-month permitting process for Chapter 91 in order to build something on that back space.

959
01:44:23,318 --> 01:44:31,344
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's part of the, all of this could move a lot faster if we leave that as the open space back there, or the open parking.

960
01:44:32,585 --> 01:44:37,809
[SPEAKER_26]: So we do need to go through detailed negotiations on exactly what we would have.

961
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:44,193
[SPEAKER_26]: So the next steps, well, we have formally notified the designated development team.

962
01:44:44,233 --> 01:44:46,235
[SPEAKER_26]: We decided that they shouldn't hear from the press.

963
01:44:46,335 --> 01:44:47,576
[SPEAKER_26]: They should get phone calls from us.

964
01:44:47,596 --> 01:44:50,338
[SPEAKER_26]: So actually, both teams have heard from us.

965
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:58,333
[SPEAKER_26]: We will need to declare the property surplus to municipal requirements in order to actually sign a lease.

966
01:44:58,374 --> 01:44:59,995
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a formal designation.

967
01:45:00,715 --> 01:45:10,181
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll negotiate the development program, negotiate the terms of the lease, and then the lease needs to come back to you for approval, and then we would execute that.

968
01:45:12,082 --> 01:45:13,423
[SPEAKER_26]: And that is the last slide.

969
01:45:15,724 --> 01:45:16,204
[SPEAKER_26]: Questions.

970
01:45:16,504 --> 01:45:17,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

971
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:20,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have questions or comments from members of the Council?

972
01:45:23,153 --> 01:45:23,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

973
01:45:25,437 --> 01:45:25,758
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

974
01:45:26,078 --> 01:45:29,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the hard work and I know this is a long time coming but

975
01:45:31,105 --> 01:45:39,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that I have just a few questions as we go through the process and I know this is so important because this is one bite at the apple and I'm so glad that we're doing it.

976
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:53,218
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so kudos to taking the bite, we should think it's very important but I, you know, I know that there was there was questions that we looked into the drip different talking about those discussions and maybe looking into traffic flow with the rest of the square and how that would impact.

977
01:45:54,940 --> 01:46:05,020
[SPEAKER_13]: You know this this development we if we talked about is ring road still available because I'm sure in your field you realize that it's a laughingstock across the Commonwealth that.

978
01:46:05,878 --> 01:46:13,163
[SPEAKER_13]: The joke is, what is the only city that has an access road that leads away from the center of your town?

979
01:46:13,663 --> 01:46:15,665
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that that's what we're doing.

980
01:46:15,745 --> 01:46:22,089
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like, you know, it'd be something nice to use the water and develop that area.

981
01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:31,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Have we, you know, the other questions I would have is if we talk to... I'm gonna forget all your... Yeah, no, no, I appreciate it.

982
01:46:31,176 --> 01:46:32,677
[SPEAKER_13]: You know that looking at the...

983
01:46:36,879 --> 01:46:55,882
[SPEAKER_13]: We met with the other owners of the other buildings in Medford Square and worked with them about maybe finding a way to look at the totality of the square and working Riverside Mall and using and talking and working their vision to try to

984
01:46:56,874 --> 01:47:03,096
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, uplift the rest of that area and try to truly make it a truly redeveloped area.

985
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:12,698
[SPEAKER_13]: The other question is probably the biggest one and you said you, you talked a little bit about it because you, you know, you're going to get the biggest

986
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:17,771
[SPEAKER_13]: complaints and concerns and issues from our seniors right now.

987
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:19,812
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the biggest fear right now is the parking.

988
01:47:20,172 --> 01:47:24,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think the parking is enough that's there.

989
01:47:24,894 --> 01:47:29,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we've had in different municipalities that I've been involved in

990
01:47:31,154 --> 01:47:55,418
[SPEAKER_13]: We've worked on some creative ways and maybe possibly talking about meeting with the seniors and implementing a plan that makes sure that maybe setting up a shuttle service from even though it's just right down the street, it's a huge difference when you're a senior citizen and you're disabled in any way to try to make it from right across the street to behind the hotel.

991
01:47:59,597 --> 01:48:18,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I think and I think that'd be important is really reaching out because I've been contacted by a bunch of the seniors from the senior center and they're in an uproar and you know, they, you know, they have we talked about for instance, one young lady came tonight and asked, have we talked about maybe making sure that the parking goes up first.

992
01:48:20,678 --> 01:48:43,495
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah sorry yeah talking about the parking first so and I'm glad to see that we're being creative with the parking garage something that we talked about in the past if this is something that's willing to do how about have we entertained possibly doing a bubble on the top floor of the parking garage where it's a recreational space to bring in more revenue both as a recreational space and

993
01:48:44,816 --> 01:48:50,458
[SPEAKER_13]: and a revenue generating source, if we're given the freedom to do that.

994
01:48:50,558 --> 01:49:08,325
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, on the highway side, I wouldn't mind going up an extra story to put something like that in for the fact that it's creating revenue, it's creating a recreational space for our youth, especially, and a vital space that we know that we need here.

995
01:49:09,566 --> 01:49:12,767
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, these are some questions I think that, you know,

996
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:21,154
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, everybody who looks at me like I'm going to be the negative person and I'm going to talk negative about everything I think we need to move.

997
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:33,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a good step, but I think that being cautious that this is one bite of the apple and making sure that we've exhausted everything possible and the community is really part of it.

998
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:37,031
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I've said that from the beginning of the rezoning you know that.

999
01:49:37,592 --> 01:49:51,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that being more proactive, especially with the seniors and getting your butt kicked a little bit, it's part of the job we all know that, but really making our senior citizens feel like they're part of this process, not alienating because the room is, again,

1000
01:49:52,526 --> 01:50:10,898
[SPEAKER_13]: keeps coming to Council Scarpelli, the rumors that I'm hearing what people think that there's rumors out there saying that maybe possibly we're going to lose the senior center completely, which is a farce, but it's something that I think having the meeting there and bringing it to that backyard and trying to find avenues to

1001
01:50:11,878 --> 01:50:23,744
[SPEAKER_13]: just to calm everybody down and say listen we're thinking of you these are options and our number one priority should be our seniors in their, their safety in their comfort in their, you know, state of mind.

1002
01:50:23,904 --> 01:50:30,728
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I know that's a lot, but I appreciate it's the first time I could speak on it so I'm really excited about, you know, the designs I was.

1003
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:50,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I was I was fortunate enough to have said it 1000 times that when may occur to Tony back in 2008 started this little little project that he brought me to this little despicable piece of land and he opened up a trailer and showed this amazing plan that went from one end to the other and that's still growing.

1004
01:50:50,718 --> 01:50:55,003
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and I think that's why I bring up the fact that I'd love to see what

1005
01:50:55,813 --> 01:50:58,496
[SPEAKER_13]: what options are moving throughout the whole square.

1006
01:50:58,516 --> 01:50:59,597
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

1007
01:51:01,719 --> 01:51:19,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Just if I could really quickly to Councilor Scarpelli's point, something that, you know, having talked in the council in general and looked at the plans and worked with the team, in the RFP before we got proposals to the request for proposals, we did include some additional language around

1008
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:34,656
[SPEAKER_19]: the city owned parking lots behind the strip along Riverside Avenue and also the City Hall property itself to see if maybe we could encourage some potential expansion and renovation of this building.

1009
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:40,784
[SPEAKER_19]: And we spoke with Atrius Health to see if we could leverage the parking garage.

1010
01:51:41,164 --> 01:51:49,952
[SPEAKER_19]: And we spoke with Hamilton, well, not me, but you spoke with Hamilton companies about all of the property that they own on Riverside.

1011
01:51:50,392 --> 01:51:53,495
[SPEAKER_19]: So those were included in the process.

1012
01:51:53,715 --> 01:52:02,143
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, at least for me, as I continue to participate in the process, going back at bites at those apples and really trying to see if we can get them

1013
01:52:03,315 --> 01:52:05,916
[SPEAKER_19]: on board is going to be a priority for me.

1014
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:16,840
[SPEAKER_19]: And Davis had also done some preliminary designs on potentially some upgrades to this building, which I think would be really great that maybe we could try to incorporate as well.

1015
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:22,382
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to put all of that out there that those were some things that I raised as part of the process that are still going to be a priority for me.

1016
01:52:22,882 --> 01:52:26,223
[SPEAKER_19]: But thank you for giving me time and Director Hunt, I'll turn it over to you.

1017
01:52:26,914 --> 01:52:28,135
[SPEAKER_26]: respond to some of those.

1018
01:52:28,155 --> 01:52:30,436
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll just build on that quickly.

1019
01:52:30,636 --> 01:52:38,379
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have been talking, as President Zack Baer says, to a number of the property owners in the area.

1020
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:45,862
[SPEAKER_26]: I will tell you that I met with the owner of the Hamilton Company as recently as late last week.

1021
01:52:46,462 --> 01:52:51,965
[SPEAKER_26]: Theirs is the building that has Ebisuya that people know about, that it does look like it needs to come down.

1022
01:52:52,765 --> 01:53:02,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, and in fact, I have asked him to please have his his architect contact me as soon as he has somebody on board because they should not be designing to the zoning that exists.

1023
01:53:03,315 --> 01:53:07,459
[SPEAKER_26]: But actually, we would like to work directly with their architect on what they're thinking.

1024
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:11,503
[SPEAKER_26]: He is open to redoing the entire stretch.

1025
01:53:12,184 --> 01:53:15,987
[SPEAKER_26]: He actually owns the entire set of buildings facing the river.

1026
01:53:17,789 --> 01:53:38,025
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know how to describe it off the top of my head but from here from the parking lot, the building that exists the health building, all the way down, not the bank building so short of the bank building so all of that, being able to work with them would really open up some opportunities we have a river street that would be great if it went all the way through his building to river street.

1027
01:53:38,425 --> 01:53:41,648
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's one of the things we want to talk to him about is how could we leverage

1028
01:53:42,008 --> 01:53:58,839
[SPEAKER_26]: some of the city parking, some of the city spaces, to open that back up, getting access to having River Street going straight through to the river, to the ring road, as you name it, the Clippership Drive, as people know it now, would really help us facilitate changing the directions of the roads.

1029
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:10,447
[SPEAKER_26]: We asked the developers if they had thought about that, and they kind of said yes, but things were a little too rushed for them, even though they had three months to respond, to really dig into that

1030
01:54:10,907 --> 01:54:13,309
[SPEAKER_26]: and they're open to it, we still want to discuss it.

1031
01:54:13,949 --> 01:54:16,211
[SPEAKER_26]: There are a couple of very creative solutions.

1032
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:35,124
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know if it's easier for me to point to the map, but one of the things that we have thought about is could you actually redirect the main flow of traffic instead of sweeping around and coming between that building and the senior center to actually cut and come up to this street here that is between City Hall

1033
01:54:36,045 --> 01:54:39,148
[SPEAKER_26]: and the medical building, have that be the main route.

1034
01:54:39,608 --> 01:54:46,573
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the area that's between this new building and the senior center, have that be emergency access only.

1035
01:54:46,934 --> 01:54:50,056
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe it's just a bus lane and emergency access.

1036
01:54:50,517 --> 01:54:55,781
[SPEAKER_26]: And so that the seniors would have the open parking there behind the buildings by the river.

1037
01:54:56,281 --> 01:55:02,106
[SPEAKER_26]: And then it would just be an open, more of a bus lane that they're crossing and not a road.

1038
01:55:02,506 --> 01:55:04,747
[SPEAKER_26]: that they're crossing to get over to the senior center.

1039
01:55:05,047 --> 01:55:07,609
[SPEAKER_26]: That would change up a lot of the traffic flows.

1040
01:55:08,049 --> 01:55:15,333
[SPEAKER_26]: That would also allow us to make this area over here between this building and the new garage more of a plaza area.

1041
01:55:16,033 --> 01:55:23,277
[SPEAKER_26]: We have to look at exactly how the traffic would flow, but we'd like to be creative with this and think outside of the box.

1042
01:55:23,817 --> 01:55:31,506
[SPEAKER_26]: It is we do understand now that one way streets can be a real killer for for economic development for business districts.

1043
01:55:32,007 --> 01:55:36,472
[SPEAKER_26]: And so this may be the time to change the traffic flows of these streets.

1044
01:55:36,873 --> 01:55:41,098
[SPEAKER_26]: I do think that working with the Hamilton company is going to be necessary to part of that.

1045
01:55:42,539 --> 01:55:48,502
[SPEAKER_26]: So all of that to be said is absolutely part of this discussion and negotiation that we're still having.

1046
01:55:49,182 --> 01:55:55,726
[SPEAKER_26]: We did hire a consultant to do a first look past design for the water area.

1047
01:55:56,167 --> 01:56:09,454
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's part of what ended up with this pop-up park, because one of the things that really became aware is that anything permanent we wanted to do between Clippership and the water was gonna have to go through a chapter 91 process.

1048
01:56:10,695 --> 01:56:17,057
[SPEAKER_26]: Bill putting in benches or a water a dock, putting in a seating wall and stuff.

1049
01:56:17,537 --> 01:56:23,918
[SPEAKER_26]: And that meant none of that was going to happen in a short time frame, anything we were going to go over to over there was going to take a long time.

1050
01:56:24,398 --> 01:56:31,300
[SPEAKER_26]: So we would like to do that and we do have some draft ideas that we've put together we've put out to the public a couple of times some ideas.

1051
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:49,805
[SPEAKER_26]: The other thing is that we did this diff that which takes any a portion of the tap the new revenue taxes that would come from anywhere in the square into a special account to feed back into the square, so that could help pay for some of the permitting that would be needed for the, the park area.

1052
01:56:50,185 --> 01:56:54,406
[SPEAKER_26]: for some of the things like a new dock that we could capture some of that money there.

1053
01:56:55,467 --> 01:57:01,769
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's some of the, and that's part of what is absolutely can be, is under discussion and we'll need to be discussing with them.

1054
01:57:03,949 --> 01:57:07,070
[SPEAKER_26]: We did think, we did ask about like space around a garage.

1055
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:10,431
[SPEAKER_26]: I like the idea of a space on top for recreation.

1056
01:57:10,471 --> 01:57:12,432
[SPEAKER_26]: We had talked about how could we build a gym in

1057
01:57:12,972 --> 01:57:23,221
[SPEAKER_26]: basically what we need to do is how do we get enough community benefit out of this to make this amazing for the city without killing the project, right?

1058
01:57:23,321 --> 01:57:26,263
[SPEAKER_26]: What is their pain point where they say we can't do this anymore?

1059
01:57:27,304 --> 01:57:28,905
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's where we are looking at this.

1060
01:57:28,945 --> 01:57:31,788
[SPEAKER_26]: We had thought about could we put recreation offices over there?

1061
01:57:31,848 --> 01:57:32,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Could we put a gym?

1062
01:57:32,829 --> 01:57:34,030
[SPEAKER_26]: Like how does this look?

1063
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:37,813
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think these are all the kinds of things that we want to be talking about with them.

1064
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:54,964
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, and I think I'll just wrap it up by saying that both developers when we met with them felt very strongly that us doing this project is going to be transformational between this and the rezoning of Medford square which is now being moving its way

1065
01:57:55,464 --> 01:58:02,792
[SPEAKER_26]: through the process, that will absolutely open up and get developers interested in this.

1066
01:58:03,253 --> 01:58:08,799
[SPEAKER_26]: I've had other property owners, smaller buildings, approach me and say, but what do we do if we have no parking?

1067
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,062
[SPEAKER_26]: And so that's part of what we need to figure out.

1068
01:58:11,462 --> 01:58:19,544
[SPEAKER_26]: The Hamilton space is frankly big enough that they can be doing real parking for their spaces and they can be putting residential and stuff in there.

1069
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:24,505
[SPEAKER_26]: So how do we make this work and how do we make that building face the river and have plazas?

1070
01:58:24,565 --> 01:58:28,646
[SPEAKER_26]: You can have outdoor dining facing the river and not facing Riverside Ave.

1071
01:58:29,167 --> 01:58:29,707
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely.

1072
01:58:29,727 --> 01:58:34,848
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a separate project, but it is very much on our radar and something that we're looking to work with.

1073
01:58:35,428 --> 01:58:37,909
[SPEAKER_26]: We've also, the Hamilton company has indicated that

1074
01:58:38,629 --> 01:58:44,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Potentially, if there were other developers interested in partnering with them, they're not closed to that idea.

1075
01:58:44,850 --> 01:58:53,692
[SPEAKER_26]: They were not ready to make any kind of agreement in the short window that had from when we released the RFP to when the RFP had to be closed.

1076
01:58:54,712 --> 01:58:57,232
[SPEAKER_26]: But they're not closed to that idea.

1077
01:58:57,912 --> 01:59:02,273
[SPEAKER_26]: So in fact, they had a development partner who was closed to that idea, and they bought them out.

1078
01:59:05,234 --> 01:59:05,654
[SPEAKER_26]: Anything else?

1079
01:59:08,186 --> 01:59:09,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1080
01:59:09,247 --> 01:59:10,268
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a great question.

1081
01:59:10,849 --> 01:59:23,121
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing that as we talked about, you know, mainstays and the, you know, the, uh, you know, the, um, gateways, uh, is the money been exhausted?

1082
01:59:23,161 --> 01:59:27,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there was money years ago for the parking garage that failed behind Colleen's.

1083
01:59:27,406 --> 01:59:30,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I think that that might be having two types of

1084
01:59:31,524 --> 01:59:32,945
[SPEAKER_13]: two types of anchor parking.

1085
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:48,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we would hate, honestly, to waste spot, people tell you in your field, you know that putting a parking garage is frowned upon because it's valuable space in a sense, but where we already have parking

1086
01:59:49,280 --> 02:00:10,573
[SPEAKER_26]: have we there's been any discussion again to rebuild that parking garage behind Colleen's so there was a grant I'm gonna say it was roughly 2010 I do have files on it but the city the council at the time which none of these members including yourself were on the council at the time voted not to accept that grant so that would have to be plus it was 15 years ago

1087
02:00:10,973 --> 02:00:14,417
[SPEAKER_26]: So it would have to be sort of re approached a project like that.

1088
02:00:15,278 --> 02:00:25,451
[SPEAKER_26]: It is an interesting question whether they're behind the Colleen's is the right location for a second parking garage, or whether this would be sufficient for all of it.

1089
02:00:25,871 --> 02:00:29,435
[SPEAKER_26]: It's certainly something I think that if we move this project forward.

1090
02:00:29,996 --> 02:00:38,364
[SPEAKER_26]: because it's ready and built this garage and said, we have parking pressure on the square and we could have more development if there was more parking.

1091
02:00:38,725 --> 02:00:47,093
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the kind of thing that you go back to mass development and you say, we need more city infrastructure in order to unlock more development in the city.

1092
02:00:47,553 --> 02:00:49,195
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's, we would go back to them for it.

1093
02:00:50,096 --> 02:00:53,099
[SPEAKER_26]: I think my instinct and Claire's not here, right?

1094
02:00:53,519 --> 02:00:53,900
[SPEAKER_26]: If we,

1095
02:00:55,332 --> 02:00:59,855
[SPEAKER_26]: She might be online, but she had tried to make it to here this evening.

1096
02:01:01,577 --> 02:01:07,201
[SPEAKER_26]: If we were to ask them for that money right now, they would say, do you have a parking study?

1097
02:01:07,241 --> 02:01:07,921
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you approve it?

1098
02:01:07,961 --> 02:01:09,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Do this project first?

1099
02:01:09,502 --> 02:01:11,223
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, what's, you know, where is that?

1100
02:01:11,784 --> 02:01:15,346
[SPEAKER_26]: That doesn't mean that we wouldn't ask Mass Development for money.

1101
02:01:16,167 --> 02:01:23,012
[SPEAKER_26]: I will just sort of jump in there with, you can get Mass Development for infrastructure needs in order to unlock development potential.

1102
02:01:23,792 --> 02:01:27,773
[SPEAKER_26]: and that is part of where that RFP support came from.

1103
02:01:28,613 --> 02:01:42,576
[SPEAKER_26]: We have checked with our water and sewer, Tim McGivern was on this committee, and there is no concern about the city infrastructure that we own around water supply, sewer, et cetera, storm drains, being able to handle this.

1104
02:01:42,756 --> 02:01:46,677
[SPEAKER_26]: I know some people have sort of asked, but we are confident on that in this location.

1105
02:01:46,697 --> 02:01:52,958
[SPEAKER_26]: And if we were looking for money, it would be around redoing the streets and the layout of the streets

1106
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:55,361
[SPEAKER_26]: lights and stuff like that.

1107
02:01:58,726 --> 02:01:59,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you.

1108
02:01:59,468 --> 02:02:00,790
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

1109
02:02:02,178 --> 02:02:03,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1110
02:02:03,558 --> 02:02:04,999
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very exciting project.

1111
02:02:05,339 --> 02:02:11,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really quite happy to see these plans coming together after so many years of work.

1112
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:13,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few comments and then a couple of questions.

1113
02:02:15,202 --> 02:02:29,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that in one of the master plans, there really was an analysis of Medford Square and the very specific types of businesses that we have there and the difference between the types of businesses that we have and the types of businesses that create a really walkable, safe,

1114
02:02:30,487 --> 02:02:35,391
[SPEAKER_08]: a kind of vibrant square that I think everyone here talks about and wishes for.

1115
02:02:35,411 --> 02:02:47,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And many people even look back to 30, 40 years ago with warmth about how it used to be more that way when there were bookstores and other places that people frequented.

1116
02:02:47,479 --> 02:02:51,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So I say that because I'm very excited about the grocery store coming in.

1117
02:02:51,742 --> 02:02:54,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also very excited to see a coffee shop coming in.

1118
02:02:56,205 --> 02:03:02,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and I really also do appreciate all the work that you do in talking specifically to developers.

1119
02:03:02,571 --> 02:03:11,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I recently got, you know, an email from a resident, asking if they can if we can stop a bank from coming into Medford Square.

1120
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:20,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they they're like we can't have more banks and insurance companies and places where you don't you know need to go or enjoy to go.

1121
02:03:20,662 --> 02:03:30,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And please, I hope no one is offended by my mention of those two specifically but I think there are there are many in Medford Square that are.

1122
02:03:31,151 --> 02:03:38,133
[SPEAKER_08]: not the types that were identified in that master plan as being ones that are going to create the vibrancy we want.

1123
02:03:38,173 --> 02:03:54,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do appreciate all of the work that you are doing too, because we cannot simply dictate as a city council what people rent to and what businesses come in, but we can talk to developers and try to encourage them to bring certain types of businesses in.

1124
02:03:54,738 --> 02:03:56,719
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate all your work there.

1125
02:03:58,257 --> 02:04:26,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I did want to mention also that I think one of the benefits, and I think this came up in a conversation that we had about this particular project, one of the benefits of having a garage that is not underneath the residential units, that is actually a small bit away and maybe you have to cross the street, is that I certainly hope that the residents who move in will

1126
02:04:27,450 --> 02:04:45,957
[SPEAKER_08]: hesitate to jump in their cars just a little bit more and be more likely to walk to walk into Medford Square, we're talking, you know, obviously, those who are young and able to do that, but hoping that people that this creates naturally just a little bit more of a walkable square.

1127
02:04:47,457 --> 02:04:57,907
[SPEAKER_08]: and lowers our need for like people get very concerned about the traffic that's caused by new development and new residents moving in and new housing.

1128
02:04:58,688 --> 02:05:04,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope that that will be a little bit ameliorated by the fact that the garage is not underneath

1129
02:05:04,733 --> 02:05:06,114
[SPEAKER_08]: the building of the residence.

1130
02:05:06,134 --> 02:05:10,736
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really appreciate that as a very thoughtful way to approach some of these things.

1131
02:05:11,196 --> 02:05:12,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a couple of questions.

1132
02:05:13,017 --> 02:05:14,778
[SPEAKER_08]: One is about the parking.

1133
02:05:14,838 --> 02:05:23,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do understand that there are a lot of some of the seniors who are concerned that the senior center parking will not be as large.

1134
02:05:24,362 --> 02:05:27,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm curious if any of the parking will be designated for seniors or

1135
02:05:29,284 --> 02:05:32,345
[SPEAKER_08]: how many of those spots will be designated as handicapped spots.

1136
02:05:33,085 --> 02:05:41,507
[SPEAKER_08]: That might also help for those seniors who really do need to have a spot that is very, very close to the senior center.

1137
02:05:41,907 --> 02:05:47,788
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have a larger number of handicapped spots because it is directly across the street from the senior center.

1138
02:05:47,808 --> 02:05:48,849
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to ask about that.

1139
02:05:49,829 --> 02:05:55,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this is more my curiosity about your opinion based upon a lot of the zoning that we have done.

1140
02:05:56,590 --> 02:05:58,871
[SPEAKER_08]: But my second question is really about step

1141
02:05:59,111 --> 02:05:59,811
[SPEAKER_08]: a step back.

1142
02:06:00,432 --> 02:06:15,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So looking at the sort of envisioning diagram that they, the picture that they painted of what it might look like when standing in the memorial garden, that it does create a little bit of a sort of a corridor, like one of these wind tunnels of height.

1143
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:21,603
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was curious, because in my mind, the step backs where you start off

1144
02:06:22,183 --> 02:06:31,591
[SPEAKER_08]: like coming up from the sidewalk, but then the top couple of floors are actually backed away, that that might help to reduce a little bit of that feeling.

1145
02:06:31,911 --> 02:06:33,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was curious about what your thoughts were about that.

1146
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:41,720
[SPEAKER_26]: So I will say it's sort of the detailed exactly how many spots are here and there and how many are handicapped.

1147
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:47,865
[SPEAKER_26]: I really feel that that is part of the detailed negotiation that we start to look at as we get further into it.

1148
02:06:48,565 --> 02:06:54,490
[SPEAKER_26]: It would certainly be some part of the site plan review and is something that we'll be looking at and considering.

1149
02:06:55,210 --> 02:07:02,916
[SPEAKER_26]: But I certainly couldn't like, oh, this is how nothing is set in stone at this point, but this is where we're looking at it.

1150
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:11,462
[SPEAKER_26]: For the step backs, it is true that when you put those are more expensive to build than building straight up.

1151
02:07:12,242 --> 02:07:28,187
[SPEAKER_26]: Just in the details of building the building so developers never propose those to begin with, that is the kind of thing that we start looking at shadows and we asked them about and look and feel, and that's the kind of thing that you push into, and it's the kind of thing that we really will need to think about.

1152
02:07:28,767 --> 02:07:31,630
[SPEAKER_26]: where do we want to push them for community benefits?

1153
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:37,975
[SPEAKER_26]: Is a little bit larger parking garage with a few more spots, is that more important?

1154
02:07:38,135 --> 02:07:39,376
[SPEAKER_26]: Or is it the step back?

1155
02:07:39,416 --> 02:07:41,618
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, like, is it another affordable unit?

1156
02:07:41,658 --> 02:07:45,422
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, where do we like all of these things have costs?

1157
02:07:45,482 --> 02:07:51,267
[SPEAKER_26]: Can we get recreational space out of it as well, which is honestly is something that has been on our minds and something

1158
02:07:51,787 --> 02:07:53,708
[SPEAKER_26]: that we have been floating around.

1159
02:07:54,749 --> 02:07:59,112
[SPEAKER_26]: So it is something that we'll be talking about, we'll be looking at as the details of this.

1160
02:07:59,572 --> 02:08:06,356
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll have a lot more say in this than we would in a building that is 100% privately proposed and developed.

1161
02:08:07,176 --> 02:08:10,178
[SPEAKER_26]: So those are the types of things that we will be looking at.

1162
02:08:10,278 --> 02:08:13,280
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that I hit the things you'd asked about.

1163
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:14,821
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yes.

1164
02:08:15,141 --> 02:08:15,641
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much.

1165
02:08:17,162 --> 02:08:17,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1166
02:08:17,923 --> 02:08:19,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other comments or questions from members of the council?

1167
02:08:21,688 --> 02:08:27,206
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to note along those points, too, that I think the flip side of some of this is

1168
02:08:29,347 --> 02:08:33,410
[SPEAKER_19]: How much bigger do certain elements of the project get to allow for more community benefits?

1169
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:37,392
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, what is the financing capacity of the entity that we're working with?

1170
02:08:37,492 --> 02:08:42,776
[SPEAKER_19]: And so those are two of the other things that we're working through.

1171
02:08:43,216 --> 02:08:49,280
[SPEAKER_26]: I will add that we are interested in seeing if we can do more housing and so more units.

1172
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:53,563
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of the stuff that plays into this, and I've seen floated around,

1173
02:08:54,143 --> 02:08:57,664
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm afraid that I'm going to get the numbers wrong off the top of my head.

1174
02:08:58,164 --> 02:08:59,064
[SPEAKER_26]: But there's a certain.

1175
02:08:59,324 --> 02:09:01,365
[SPEAKER_26]: So if you go over five stories.

1176
02:09:01,765 --> 02:09:03,885
[SPEAKER_26]: Now you're getting into steel construction.

1177
02:09:04,305 --> 02:09:09,887
[SPEAKER_26]: And so you can do two stories of concrete, which may be like your parking garage, and then five stories of wood.

1178
02:09:10,347 --> 02:09:15,868
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you go bigger than that, you're in steel construction, it has a completely different costs.

1179
02:09:16,308 --> 02:09:19,329
[SPEAKER_26]: So one of the things that I have been generally hearing is

1180
02:09:19,809 --> 02:09:21,230
[SPEAKER_26]: why aren't we going taller?

1181
02:09:21,610 --> 02:09:26,713
[SPEAKER_26]: And I will tell you that we were very clear with the developers that all the guardrails were off.

1182
02:09:27,073 --> 02:09:32,076
[SPEAKER_26]: They should not be looking at our zoning, that they should be proposing what they really think they can do here.

1183
02:09:32,576 --> 02:09:36,658
[SPEAKER_26]: And as you go more units, you kind of do need some more parking.

1184
02:09:36,758 --> 02:09:42,641
[SPEAKER_26]: It is unreasonable to think that people will live immediately next to an entrance to 93 and not own a car

1185
02:09:44,842 --> 02:09:48,744
[SPEAKER_26]: even if what they use that car for is for weekend travels, right?

1186
02:09:49,784 --> 02:09:50,804
[SPEAKER_26]: So there is some of that.

1187
02:09:50,845 --> 02:09:56,607
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll ask for zip car spaces and things like that and Uber lift drop-off spaces as well.

1188
02:09:57,347 --> 02:10:05,791
[SPEAKER_26]: But it is actually true that they don't wanna go too tall because then they hit other things with the building code and it suddenly becomes a lot more expensive.

1189
02:10:06,191 --> 02:10:11,433
[SPEAKER_26]: And we hear you about the banks and can I say something about the spot that's back up the loop?

1190
02:10:13,105 --> 02:10:18,750
[SPEAKER_26]: So there was a bank coming to Medford Square and the real estate agents are now looking for a new tenant for that space.

1191
02:10:19,771 --> 02:10:20,652
[SPEAKER_26]: So yay.

1192
02:10:20,772 --> 02:10:23,935
[SPEAKER_26]: And yes, it's the vault is back on the market.

1193
02:10:24,775 --> 02:10:30,981
[SPEAKER_26]: And so the real estate agents do know that we would strongly prefer some other kind of business in that space.

1194
02:10:31,001 --> 02:10:32,182
[SPEAKER_18]: A restaurant.

1195
02:10:32,442 --> 02:10:33,323
[SPEAKER_18]: A restaurant.

1196
02:10:33,343 --> 02:10:34,845
[SPEAKER_18]: A fully functioning restaurant.

1197
02:10:35,385 --> 02:10:42,749
[SPEAKER_26]: with a bar that is open after the Chevalier ends, you know, we all want to stop out for a drink afterwards.

1198
02:10:44,229 --> 02:10:50,232
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're hoping and we try, but you're right, we cannot prevent them from coming.

1199
02:10:52,113 --> 02:10:53,634
[SPEAKER_26]: But we try to push for them.

1200
02:10:55,845 --> 02:11:10,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's the five over two and even Davis, they proposed three, five over twos, but didn't go above that, even though Hyatt Place is obviously taller and the Medford Housing Authority buildings are obviously taller.

1201
02:11:10,656 --> 02:11:18,182
[SPEAKER_19]: And even the zoning we are gonna pass is gonna allow more in those spaces or zoning that's been proposed is allowing that.

1202
02:11:18,362 --> 02:11:22,325
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, it's a tough, tough one.

1203
02:11:23,006 --> 02:11:24,547
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lazzarodo and Councilor Tseng.

1204
02:11:26,214 --> 02:11:26,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor.

1205
02:11:26,534 --> 02:11:28,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Um Councilor Tseng has okay.

1206
02:11:28,835 --> 02:11:31,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to note that sometimes when, um.

1207
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:39,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Our residency are zoning proposals where there are allowable taller buildings.

1208
02:11:40,062 --> 02:11:46,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Um it gets a little concerning for residents because they say, Well, that's going to be so many big tall

1209
02:11:52,457 --> 02:11:56,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, something is allowable and it doesn't immediately happen.

1210
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:59,881
[SPEAKER_11]: So just it's it's expensive to build.

1211
02:12:00,002 --> 02:12:04,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's It would be really hard to make something like that happen.

1212
02:12:04,784 --> 02:12:07,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a great case in point.

1213
02:12:07,446 --> 02:12:08,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and

1214
02:12:09,788 --> 02:12:17,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got an email from somebody who had found out that there was a bank going in where the vault used to be and asking if I could do anything to stop that.

1215
02:12:17,895 --> 02:12:28,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And I asked her if I could call her because I wanted to explain the reasoning that I've heard from business owners about why banks are a great thing to have as a tenant.

1216
02:12:29,505 --> 02:12:29,926
[SPEAKER_11]: clean.

1217
02:12:30,026 --> 02:12:31,008
[SPEAKER_11]: They pay their rent.

1218
02:12:31,028 --> 02:12:33,934
[SPEAKER_11]: They're really consistent.

1219
02:12:34,876 --> 02:12:36,199
[SPEAKER_11]: They're never bad tenants.

1220
02:12:37,621 --> 02:12:39,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not up to us to say no.

1221
02:12:41,668 --> 02:12:43,669
[SPEAKER_11]: to an owner of a space.

1222
02:12:43,789 --> 02:12:47,151
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course we listen to our residents and we live here too.

1223
02:12:47,371 --> 02:12:56,356
[SPEAKER_11]: And we know what it's like to live in a neighborhood that is adjacent to a business district that is full of banks.

1224
02:12:57,657 --> 02:12:58,478
[SPEAKER_11]: We do.

1225
02:12:58,518 --> 02:13:00,999
[SPEAKER_11]: We all need banks for a variety of things, but we don't

1226
02:13:01,319 --> 02:13:03,001
[SPEAKER_11]: we don't need that many of them.

1227
02:13:03,261 --> 02:13:04,662
[SPEAKER_11]: That being said, thank you for your work on this.

1228
02:13:04,722 --> 02:13:06,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a lovely proposal.

1229
02:13:07,784 --> 02:13:14,670
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do appreciate that it's still a moving picture to some degree.

1230
02:13:15,811 --> 02:13:17,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks.

1231
02:13:18,053 --> 02:13:21,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would, has anybody, motion to approve?

1232
02:13:23,097 --> 02:13:23,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1233
02:13:25,078 --> 02:13:25,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I would do that.

1234
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:27,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1235
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:29,751
[SPEAKER_19]: never a bad tenant until they need a bailout.

1236
02:13:31,971 --> 02:13:32,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

1237
02:13:33,432 --> 02:13:33,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1238
02:13:34,312 --> 02:13:37,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you all have been working really, really hard on this.

1239
02:13:37,393 --> 02:13:43,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hearing updates here and there, and every time I hear an update, it's even more exciting.

1240
02:13:43,155 --> 02:13:52,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've just gotten so many positive comments about this happening in the city, and people are really excited.

1241
02:13:52,219 --> 02:13:55,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even if people have questions about parts of it, I think overall,

1242
02:13:56,762 --> 02:13:58,642
[SPEAKER_04]: there's just this enthusiasm.

1243
02:13:58,922 --> 02:14:08,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I want to remind everyone, I mentioned this a few meetings ago, but the first time it was knocking on doors, Medford Square came up alive.

1244
02:14:08,564 --> 02:14:18,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think at the time people asked us, or asked me at least, when are we going to stop planning and when are we going to start doing?

1245
02:14:19,266 --> 02:14:23,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is us doing, and I'm really, really excited about that.

1246
02:14:24,247 --> 02:14:25,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a key point is,

1247
02:14:27,597 --> 02:14:39,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with any big redevelopment project like this, you're never going to get 100% of what everyone envisions Medford Square to be, because we all have different visions and different needs and priorities too.

1248
02:14:39,859 --> 02:14:52,261
[SPEAKER_04]: But I actually think that the transit proposal reaches really high marks on what people who have very different lived experiences are asking of Medford Square.

1249
02:14:52,281 --> 02:14:53,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really impressive.

1250
02:14:56,237 --> 02:15:00,939
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think you've addressed a lot of what I've heard most tonight.

1251
02:15:01,499 --> 02:15:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm hearing a lot from seniors about parking, hearing, and I'm glad to hear that, you know,

1252
02:15:09,619 --> 02:15:22,306
[SPEAKER_04]: we're getting that parking lot and that it's not just gonna be any parking lot, that it'll be a parking lot that the city has some say over, that they'll be public art integrated to.

1253
02:15:23,667 --> 02:15:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Vic Schrader joked to me, because there are residents who are concerned about increasing parking too.

1254
02:15:31,025 --> 02:15:42,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And Big Freighter joked to me that with Alicia Hunt leading the charge, we're going to get the most environmentally friendly, most artistic, beautiful parking lot we can get.

1255
02:15:42,435 --> 02:15:47,459
[SPEAKER_17]: I never heard that.

1256
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:54,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the renderings are anything to go by, I think we're definitely heading in that direction.

1257
02:15:55,086 --> 02:15:56,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am grateful for that.

1258
02:15:59,269 --> 02:16:02,831
[SPEAKER_04]: very funny comment from him.

1259
02:16:03,131 --> 02:16:07,033
[SPEAKER_04]: With the riverside, I think that's the riverfront opening up that capacity.

1260
02:16:07,073 --> 02:16:10,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something I hear just as much, to be honest.

1261
02:16:11,796 --> 02:16:21,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's really important to let folks at home know that, you know, the City of Medford is not in itself a private property developer, so we can't

1262
02:16:22,849 --> 02:16:39,184
[SPEAKER_04]: build the buildings the way that we want to see it, but we can work with developers and work with property owners to nudge them in the direction that we want to see, to work with them to make sure that, you know, their vision is aligning with what our vision is.

1263
02:16:40,385 --> 02:16:48,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm grateful that you guys are doing so much of that hard work reaching out to, I guess, to that point.

1264
02:16:51,181 --> 02:17:01,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was really important for residents to hear tonight that we are working really hard to try to reorient the square towards our natural features, towards our strengths.

1265
02:17:05,216 --> 02:17:12,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's also important to hear the timelines and the permitting processes that go behind a lot of these.

1266
02:17:13,021 --> 02:17:19,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like most of these permitting steps are state law requirements.

1267
02:17:20,925 --> 02:17:30,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything besides what's in the current zoning update on our front that is adding to that timeline delay?

1268
02:17:31,311 --> 02:17:44,641
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's my hope that will, as we finalize the zoning for this that this will be coming as a right building, so there won't be any need to go to zoning board, because of the size of it it will need to go to site plan review.

1269
02:17:45,161 --> 02:17:50,465
[SPEAKER_26]: It is my hope that we will negotiate this so Danielle Evans and I the senior planner.

1270
02:17:51,306 --> 02:17:53,248
[SPEAKER_26]: We advise the Community Development Board.

1271
02:17:53,748 --> 02:17:57,151
[SPEAKER_26]: We understand what they're looking for in projects.

1272
02:17:57,292 --> 02:18:02,537
[SPEAKER_26]: It is our goal that this project will be legally advertised as site plan review.

1273
02:18:02,617 --> 02:18:03,878
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll go in front of them.

1274
02:18:03,938 --> 02:18:04,859
[SPEAKER_26]: They will look at it.

1275
02:18:04,999 --> 02:18:12,066
[SPEAKER_26]: It will not be the first time they've ever seen it because it'll be all over public meetings and the press, and they'll say, right, this is perfect.

1276
02:18:12,106 --> 02:18:12,907
[SPEAKER_26]: We're good with this.

1277
02:18:12,987 --> 02:18:13,488
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's go.

1278
02:18:14,008 --> 02:18:14,668
[SPEAKER_26]: keep going.

1279
02:18:15,429 --> 02:18:18,170
[SPEAKER_26]: We have had projects in and out in one meeting.

1280
02:18:19,230 --> 02:18:29,634
[SPEAKER_26]: When the developer is good, when the architects are good, I'll tell you Herb Chambers was in and out in one meeting because their stuff, they knew what we were looking for and they provided it up and we were done.

1281
02:18:30,654 --> 02:18:37,176
[SPEAKER_26]: It's only when it takes many, many iterations, the site plan review could drag out for months.

1282
02:18:37,697 --> 02:18:40,938
[SPEAKER_26]: It's usually not because we're dragging it out.

1283
02:18:42,598 --> 02:18:43,878
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't see any.

1284
02:18:44,039 --> 02:18:45,839
[SPEAKER_26]: We are keeping this as of a scale.

1285
02:18:45,959 --> 02:18:50,800
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not on state roads that require MEPA permits.

1286
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:53,581
[SPEAKER_26]: So we do think this will be able to move quickly.

1287
02:18:53,601 --> 02:18:58,902
[SPEAKER_26]: And actually, Chapter 91 is one of the reasons why Clipper Ship Connector took so long.

1288
02:18:59,282 --> 02:19:08,064
[SPEAKER_26]: And we have a couple other shared use paths projects that we're doing with that DOT that have been hung up in state permitting projects along the river.

1289
02:19:08,844 --> 02:19:12,045
[SPEAKER_26]: that's really get bogged down by state permits.

1290
02:19:12,945 --> 02:19:14,846
[SPEAKER_26]: So, and ones on state roads.

1291
02:19:15,206 --> 02:19:24,330
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're hoping, I don't see any reasons why this should get bogged down other than now us negotiating the terms of this lease and the details of this project.

1292
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:27,551
[SPEAKER_26]: So they asked if we could meet next week.

1293
02:19:27,571 --> 02:19:29,271
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have a meeting next week, this week?

1294
02:19:30,192 --> 02:19:31,032
[SPEAKER_26]: We're setting it.

1295
02:19:31,691 --> 02:19:40,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, we were talking to them so sell our economic development director has been talking to them trying to get a meeting set up within the next week to get this this ball rolling.

1296
02:19:40,637 --> 02:19:51,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear that I think it's really important that folks at home know that, at least on our side, we are really coordinating all our efforts, the zoning effort.

1297
02:19:51,925 --> 02:20:03,120
[SPEAKER_04]: the Medford square projects to make sure that things can happen as quickly as possible on our side, and you know the state permits that's that's a whole other world chapter 91 that's a whole other world.

1298
02:20:04,402 --> 02:20:05,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you've also addressed.

1299
02:20:07,223 --> 02:20:21,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also been hearing quite a lot about banks and, you know, businesses that, at least in our last report were like labeled as, you know, we have a lot of these, we don't need that many more, you know.

1300
02:20:23,504 --> 02:20:25,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a question that residents have brought up.

1301
02:20:26,586 --> 02:20:33,851
[SPEAKER_04]: is that instead of why why why not instead of banning it outright because we know we still want these businesses here.

1302
02:20:35,072 --> 02:20:41,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Why shouldn't be in zoning put something like a special special permit process for businesses that we see a lot of and.

1303
02:20:42,337 --> 02:21:04,530
[SPEAKER_26]: I think this is a great with a lot of folks watching at home this might be a forum for you to address that question right and so some of that is what you're allowed to do and not allowed to do so a special permit can't be completely arbitrary around like oh we have too many now you can't be the 10th one but you could have been the fifth one right you can't quite use it for that you could use it to say well you know

1304
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:10,375
[SPEAKER_26]: small is okay, bigger is not, or we want them on the side streets, not the main.

1305
02:21:11,656 --> 02:21:16,220
[SPEAKER_26]: They're more used for uses where they could be difficult on the neighbors.

1306
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:23,547
[SPEAKER_26]: The problem is banks are boring, if I might, but they're not, like we were saying, actually bad neighbors.

1307
02:21:23,927 --> 02:21:28,111
[SPEAKER_26]: The bad part is that it's dark in the evening and it's not good for economic development.

1308
02:21:28,491 --> 02:21:36,475
[SPEAKER_26]: But they're not loud and rowdy and they don't stink and you know like they're not that kind of a problem neighbor.

1309
02:21:37,376 --> 02:21:42,599
[SPEAKER_26]: And there are such things as banking deserts, there are places where people can't get easily to a bank.

1310
02:21:42,959 --> 02:21:46,100
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we don't see it as much now that so much is online.

1311
02:21:46,821 --> 02:21:52,964
[SPEAKER_26]: But the reality is that people who need to walk to a bank need to walk to a bank or like to walk to a bank.

1312
02:21:55,165 --> 02:21:57,807
[SPEAKER_26]: you don't wanna accidentally then create a banking desert.

1313
02:21:58,127 --> 02:22:07,473
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that if we said like, we don't allow banks in our business districts, some bank is gonna come along and try to take us to court over that.

1314
02:22:07,573 --> 02:22:10,035
[SPEAKER_26]: Like it just feels like an overreach.

1315
02:22:10,655 --> 02:22:17,520
[SPEAKER_26]: So our goal is to, we do recruit, Sal actively recruits businesses, we meet with businesses.

1316
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:24,585
[SPEAKER_26]: I will tell you that we do not have trouble with businesses not wanting to come to Medford, either Medford Square or any of the other districts.

1317
02:22:25,786 --> 02:22:29,568
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't remember which meeting I said this in recently, or Sal said it.

1318
02:22:30,829 --> 02:22:40,536
[SPEAKER_26]: There are a couple of spaces where we have very long-term empty spaces, and those spaces are not empty because nobody wants to rent them.

1319
02:22:41,097 --> 02:22:46,600
[SPEAKER_26]: They're empty because what the landlords are asking is too much, or they're not responsive.

1320
02:22:47,141 --> 02:22:52,265
[SPEAKER_26]: And we have tried to get in touch with these landlords and try and work with them, and they don't want to hear from us.

1321
02:22:53,405 --> 02:22:59,248
[SPEAKER_26]: But we have businesses that absolutely want to move into West Medford and Medford Square to all over Medford.

1322
02:22:59,688 --> 02:23:01,949
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't have trouble with that piece of it.

1323
02:23:02,349 --> 02:23:04,590
[SPEAKER_26]: We've actually been working with some real estate agents.

1324
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:22,278
[SPEAKER_26]: And so we encourage you, if you know businesses that want to come to Medford, to talk to Sal, because also what we have been doing is we are sometimes aware of businesses that might be willing to lease their space or might be willing to move or downsize and let someone else come in there, and they're not actively on the market.

1325
02:23:23,178 --> 02:23:26,439
[SPEAKER_26]: And so sometimes we're able to make some of those pairings up as well.

1326
02:23:27,319 --> 02:23:28,559
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's really exciting.

1327
02:23:28,579 --> 02:23:34,520
[SPEAKER_26]: Like you might have noticed the new pinball parlor in Medford Square, that space they're in, that was not on the market.

1328
02:23:35,101 --> 02:23:41,402
[SPEAKER_26]: That was the landlord deciding that he wanted to bring that business in and let deep cuts expand like that.

1329
02:23:42,102 --> 02:23:48,543
[SPEAKER_26]: So we are also aware of some of these opportunities that we'll try and bring businesses in and do some matchmaking.

1330
02:23:49,904 --> 02:23:50,964
[SPEAKER_26]: And we have staff to do it now.

1331
02:23:52,015 --> 02:23:52,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

1332
02:23:52,816 --> 02:24:05,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, again, if there's anything that we can help with, you know, this, for at least the City Council, I know the City Council is very supportive and, you know, we'll have questions.

1333
02:24:05,889 --> 02:24:10,074
[SPEAKER_26]: I should have asked for the surplus vote tonight.

1334
02:24:10,354 --> 02:24:12,676
[SPEAKER_26]: We're in such a good mood.

1335
02:24:13,357 --> 02:24:20,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I mean, I think any time that we can get together and talk about these issues, I know residents really do appreciate it.

1336
02:24:21,544 --> 02:24:31,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even if we're asking questions that are just clarifying points that we know a little bit about, I think it becomes a great moment for our city to get that information.

1337
02:24:31,807 --> 02:24:32,007
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1338
02:24:32,127 --> 02:24:41,171
[SPEAKER_26]: And we have our office, people don't have to speak to me directly, call our main line talk to our staff, several more of the staff are here to talk to you this evening on other topics.

1339
02:24:41,651 --> 02:24:46,473
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't want to belabor this too much, but we also particularly have a new economic development planner.

1340
02:24:47,373 --> 02:24:50,175
[SPEAKER_26]: who is part of her role is going to be helping small businesses.

1341
02:24:50,555 --> 02:24:58,980
[SPEAKER_26]: So if small businesses aren't sure how to navigate City Hall, that's part of what she's going to do is help them with the figure out this process as well.

1342
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:03,662
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'll just also let you all know that we hired a new housing planner who started this week as well.

1343
02:25:03,842 --> 02:25:06,004
[SPEAKER_26]: Last week, last week was her first week.

1344
02:25:06,484 --> 02:25:08,405
[SPEAKER_26]: So Medford resident, very exciting.

1345
02:25:08,805 --> 02:25:09,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1346
02:25:09,105 --> 02:25:09,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

1347
02:25:11,447 --> 02:25:11,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1348
02:25:11,867 --> 02:25:12,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you all.

1349
02:25:12,527 --> 02:25:12,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1350
02:25:12,907 --> 02:25:15,569
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, you know, we're gonna

1351
02:25:16,343 --> 02:25:32,987
[SPEAKER_19]: try to go as big as we can and make sure that whatever we do either enables some of the longer term things that we talked about, or at least doesn't block them and sets us up for those future discussions so I'm really looking forward to continuing to work on that with you guys.

1352
02:25:35,392 --> 02:25:38,593
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have another update for the council, hopefully, you know, next few months.

1353
02:25:39,233 --> 02:25:39,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

1354
02:25:40,353 --> 02:25:40,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1355
02:25:40,974 --> 02:25:46,195
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's a motion from councils are to receive and place on file seconded by seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1356
02:25:46,215 --> 02:25:54,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have any further discussion by members of the council or members of the public, either in person or raise your hand on zoom.

1357
02:25:56,098 --> 02:25:57,598
[SPEAKER_19]: If one person on zoom.

1358
02:26:00,499 --> 02:26:02,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Marine, name and address for the record, please.

1359
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:03,220
[SPEAKER_19]: You have three minutes.

1360
02:26:03,892 --> 02:26:07,533
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, it's Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford Mass.

1361
02:26:08,013 --> 02:26:14,414
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm wondering if it, is it too early for me to ask about what level of affordability will be available for renters?

1362
02:26:15,014 --> 02:26:17,355
[SPEAKER_25]: And these are all rentals, correct?

1363
02:26:18,455 --> 02:26:27,957
[SPEAKER_19]: The units are all rentals and the proposal was 20% of the units affordable at 80% AMI, but that's not the final

1364
02:26:28,705 --> 02:26:29,146
[SPEAKER_19]: answer.

1365
02:26:30,247 --> 02:26:39,137
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's either potential for more units, you know, if it's a bigger project, maybe more units at that level, or maybe a change in the distribution of the affordability requirements.

1366
02:26:39,157 --> 02:26:42,841
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you have anything more on that, Director Hunt.

1367
02:26:44,322 --> 02:26:44,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1368
02:26:44,943 --> 02:26:47,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Nope, we're good.

1369
02:26:47,946 --> 02:26:49,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Any more questions, Marie, on that?

1370
02:26:49,651 --> 02:27:07,878
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, just, I mean, if you could clarify exactly what is 80% of AMI for rental, so that people have an idea of what a rent would be like as an affordable rent, because I don't think we know that as a public.

1371
02:27:09,067 --> 02:27:09,587
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1372
02:27:09,647 --> 02:27:11,228
[SPEAKER_19]: So sorry to use that term.

1373
02:27:11,248 --> 02:27:18,410
[SPEAKER_19]: 80% of the area median income, and that changes depending on the household size and it looks like Director Hunt.

1374
02:27:19,090 --> 02:27:20,551
[SPEAKER_19]: And it also changes every year.

1375
02:27:21,431 --> 02:27:30,414
[SPEAKER_19]: But Director Hunt has the income and then just before you read the income I believe it's the way it works is it's, it can be a maximum of 30% of your income but I'll just let you.

1376
02:27:32,655 --> 02:27:51,489
[SPEAKER_26]: To be clear, when we talk about affordable units, we're not talking about naturally occurring affordable, like they're not just cheap, but they're actually deed restricted, which means that they get, and the city asks for them to be eligible for the state housing inventory of deed restricted affordable units.

1377
02:27:53,130 --> 02:27:55,554
[SPEAKER_26]: And so along with that they will be lotteried out.

1378
02:27:56,074 --> 02:27:58,899
[SPEAKER_26]: We, as part of the lottery.

1379
02:27:59,860 --> 02:28:01,643
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to be income qualified.

1380
02:28:02,203 --> 02:28:08,292
[SPEAKER_26]: We have the ability to ask for a certain amount of those to be designated for Medford residents first.

1381
02:28:09,033 --> 02:28:16,956
[SPEAKER_26]: And the state has to approve the amount that we want to be, if we want any of it to be special for Medford residents, the state has to approve that.

1382
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:32,660
[SPEAKER_26]: We have been successfully justifying and getting approved for the last at least five years, but possibly 10 years, 70% of the spaces to be for Medford residents first, as opposed to a fully public lottery.

1383
02:28:34,201 --> 02:28:36,262
[SPEAKER_26]: So we will be pursuing that as well.

1384
02:28:38,019 --> 02:28:45,204
[SPEAKER_26]: And then a deed-restricted affordable unit, you do have to prove your income qualifications, you have to, it also looks at your assets.

1385
02:28:45,884 --> 02:29:01,255
[SPEAKER_26]: The 2025, so 80%, so this is also by region, and sorry, I thought I had up, we're in the area called the Quincy area, right?

1386
02:29:01,495 --> 02:29:02,595
[SPEAKER_26]: Yep, let me just check.

1387
02:29:04,914 --> 02:29:08,818
[SPEAKER_26]: So in Middlesex County right now the 80% limit this year if you're a household of one is $92,000.

1388
02:29:08,879 --> 02:29:11,822
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're a household of four it's $132,300 is what 80% of area median income is.

1389
02:29:22,234 --> 02:29:30,258
[SPEAKER_26]: So the idea is that if 100% of median income would be the median income in the area, and this is 80% of that.

1390
02:29:30,678 --> 02:29:36,541
[SPEAKER_26]: So you could then go down, 50% would be people who have lower incomes, 30% would be very low income.

1391
02:29:37,422 --> 02:29:40,503
[SPEAKER_26]: So those numbers are not very low in our area.

1392
02:29:41,444 --> 02:29:50,028
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're not really addressing the issue of what people can actually afford based on income in Medford, is that correct?

1393
02:29:50,764 --> 02:30:00,350
[SPEAKER_26]: That does come into it that you actually have to be in an income band, because if you make too little, then you can't afford your share unless you have a Section 8 voucher.

1394
02:30:00,770 --> 02:30:17,541
[SPEAKER_26]: So Section 8 vouchers will allow you to then, they will subsidize you up to market rate, whereas if you just are an affordable unit, then you must make enough money such that the rent is not more than 30% of your income.

1395
02:30:20,142 --> 02:30:24,384
[SPEAKER_26]: And I will tell you that Medford then monitors all of these.

1396
02:30:24,464 --> 02:30:27,045
[SPEAKER_26]: We spot check all the affordable units every year.

1397
02:30:27,105 --> 02:30:28,706
[SPEAKER_26]: It's part of the housing planner's job.

1398
02:30:29,466 --> 02:30:40,010
[SPEAKER_26]: And if those buildings that have affordable units want to raise the rent on the affordable units, then we actually have to approve those rent raises.

1399
02:30:40,090 --> 02:30:43,552
[SPEAKER_26]: We can't unreasonably deny rent raises.

1400
02:30:44,372 --> 02:30:52,234
[SPEAKER_26]: But we also will review them and make sure that they're reasonable so people aren't getting hit with really large rental raises.

1401
02:30:52,254 --> 02:30:54,555
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm gonna look back and say, did I get that good enough?

1402
02:30:55,335 --> 02:30:55,615
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1403
02:30:56,155 --> 02:31:00,197
[SPEAKER_26]: Teresa was doing the rental verifications for us for a while, so.

1404
02:31:01,517 --> 02:31:12,460
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, Marie, to your larger question, like the question of, you know, what is something that a person can afford to rent is part of the discussion of like,

1405
02:31:13,455 --> 02:31:15,316
[SPEAKER_19]: well, 80% of AMI is very high.

1406
02:31:15,377 --> 02:31:23,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Should we look at 50% of AMI or 30% of AMI and that would pretty significantly reduce the deed restricted rent amounts?

1407
02:31:24,106 --> 02:31:29,689
[SPEAKER_19]: The problem is that it also reduces the revenue and that reduces the ability to finance the project.

1408
02:31:31,210 --> 02:31:37,594
[SPEAKER_19]: And because of how you know we're doing this, we're getting public benefits because we're leasing the land.

1409
02:31:38,635 --> 02:31:46,120
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is a portion of the cost, but a huge portion of the cost of housing is the construction cost and the state does not

1410
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:50,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly, the federal government and state government do not provide money for us to do that.

1411
02:31:50,102 --> 02:31:54,966
[SPEAKER_19]: They also don't allow cities to, for example, take out bonds to fund the construction of housing.

1412
02:31:54,986 --> 02:32:04,833
[SPEAKER_19]: And that could, you know, that maybe could be a choice that the city could say, if that was an option afforded to us, we could maybe try to be a part of financing this project, but the state doesn't allow us to do that.

1413
02:32:05,934 --> 02:32:11,197
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're kind of, you know, reliant, again, around financing

1414
02:32:12,892 --> 02:32:13,573
[SPEAKER_19]: issues here.

1415
02:32:14,134 --> 02:32:26,010
[SPEAKER_25]: But if it is leased as opposed to having to purchase the land, I would assume that the developer will be making plenty of money to be able to then, you know,

1416
02:32:27,246 --> 02:32:29,147
[SPEAKER_25]: give people the opportunity.

1417
02:32:29,167 --> 02:32:33,469
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, we have like no workforce housing, which is what we need the most.

1418
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:36,231
[SPEAKER_25]: And we don't seem to be addressing that at all.

1419
02:32:36,251 --> 02:32:40,573
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, this is a lease, this is not a purchase.

1420
02:32:42,034 --> 02:32:50,458
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just don't understand why we can't, you know, go in sort of at a more deeper level and really address the needs of the community.

1421
02:32:51,761 --> 02:32:54,023
[SPEAKER_19]: It's definitely going to be part of the conversation.

1422
02:32:54,043 --> 02:32:59,888
[SPEAKER_19]: The lease payment, I think, proposed by Transom is about a million dollars a year.

1423
02:33:01,389 --> 02:33:09,535
[SPEAKER_25]: Which is nothing compared to the cost of land to anyone else other than a developer like this.

1424
02:33:11,017 --> 02:33:12,698
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's a concern for me.

1425
02:33:13,519 --> 02:33:15,040
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I think we'll have to look at the

1426
02:33:17,305 --> 02:33:20,786
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we could there's a financial proposal as part of the request for proposal.

1427
02:33:22,427 --> 02:33:26,588
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not doing this to give the developer a windfall like that's not the intent of this.

1428
02:33:27,809 --> 02:33:39,633
[SPEAKER_19]: But the purchase cost of the land versus the least cost of the land versus like as a proportion of the cost of the project is smaller than you would think the land is not like half the cost of the project.

1429
02:33:40,653 --> 02:33:44,694
[SPEAKER_19]: the construction costs are the vast majority of the costs, at least from the financial point of view.

1430
02:33:44,714 --> 02:33:46,374
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, I totally understand that.

1431
02:33:46,734 --> 02:33:47,734
[SPEAKER_25]: I totally understand that.

1432
02:33:48,034 --> 02:33:58,536
[SPEAKER_25]: But private people are spending much more than this developer is for that level of land with the number of units that they're going to be able to construct there.

1433
02:33:59,396 --> 02:34:09,578
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would assume this is all luxury housing, except for what we're calling affordable, which isn't affordable at all for Medford folk, anyway, from what I gather.

1434
02:34:11,577 --> 02:34:17,480
[SPEAKER_19]: It is 25%, you know, it's 20% affordable.

1435
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:20,662
[SPEAKER_19]: It's 25% more affordable units that are required by the inclusionary zoning.

1436
02:34:20,682 --> 02:34:22,583
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been going back and forth.

1437
02:34:22,603 --> 02:34:23,223
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I understand.

1438
02:34:23,263 --> 02:34:38,671
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just speaking to the actual income of one person making almost $100,000 and, you know, getting that benefit to be, you know, and people that are making $50,000, which are the people in this city.

1439
02:34:39,693 --> 02:34:45,278
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it's not being able to afford to live here, which is the big issue that we have in this city.

1440
02:34:45,798 --> 02:34:49,181
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not about whether or not we're going to be able to build anything or not.

1441
02:34:49,282 --> 02:35:00,672
[SPEAKER_25]: It's more like we can't afford to keep our children, you know, house here one way or the other, you know, whether it's to be able to to buy or to be able to rent.

1442
02:35:01,642 --> 02:35:03,263
[SPEAKER_25]: you know, so they're having to go elsewhere.

1443
02:35:03,604 --> 02:35:10,529
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that's key regardless of sort of what, you know, the goals are related to, you know, the developers.

1444
02:35:10,909 --> 02:35:12,090
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's a big concern.

1445
02:35:13,371 --> 02:35:13,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1446
02:35:14,112 --> 02:35:19,536
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, I do want to let some other people go, Marie, and I'm always happy to, I'm always happy to talk about it more.

1447
02:35:19,596 --> 02:35:24,980
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think just the thing I would say is the affordable housing piece was a big component of the proposal.

1448
02:35:26,121 --> 02:35:29,284
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a big proponent, like component of,

1449
02:35:30,596 --> 02:35:37,720
[SPEAKER_19]: the negotiation, and we're gonna do our best as part of the... I hear you.

1450
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:39,261
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't think it's efficient.

1451
02:35:39,781 --> 02:35:40,162
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all.

1452
02:35:40,322 --> 02:35:41,442
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all I... I hear you.

1453
02:35:41,823 --> 02:35:42,383
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1454
02:35:43,263 --> 02:35:43,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1455
02:35:43,644 --> 02:35:48,727
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna go to Paul Garrity.

1456
02:35:48,867 --> 02:35:50,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Paul, name and address for the record.

1457
02:35:51,028 --> 02:35:51,929
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll have three minutes.

1458
02:35:56,731 --> 02:35:57,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

1459
02:35:57,212 --> 02:35:57,692
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is

1460
02:35:58,668 --> 02:36:00,690
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in 40 Cedar Road in Bedford.

1461
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:03,672
[SPEAKER_12]: And I kind of want to continue Ms.

1462
02:36:03,832 --> 02:36:05,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Izzo's statements there.

1463
02:36:06,214 --> 02:36:11,578
[SPEAKER_12]: My question is, is that, does the project have a specific revenue plan?

1464
02:36:12,438 --> 02:36:14,380
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it ties into the previous question.

1465
02:36:15,301 --> 02:36:19,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Say, what kind of money do we need to support the objective?

1466
02:36:19,444 --> 02:36:21,485
[SPEAKER_12]: The objective is to increase affordable housing.

1467
02:36:21,965 --> 02:36:26,809
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, what is the revenue stream that we're going to be working with over the life of the lease?

1468
02:36:27,712 --> 02:36:39,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And my question is, is that, can someone talk a little bit more about what is the revenue plan or what will be the revenue plan for this project going forward?

1469
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:39,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1470
02:36:41,041 --> 02:36:41,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1471
02:36:42,082 --> 02:36:45,744
[SPEAKER_19]: I can go to a director, but there is a financing plan.

1472
02:36:45,804 --> 02:36:47,105
[SPEAKER_19]: That's part of the proposal.

1473
02:36:47,125 --> 02:36:50,868
[SPEAKER_19]: It outlines in pretty significant detail

1474
02:36:51,929 --> 02:37:07,199
[SPEAKER_19]: what the proponent expects to receive in rents, both from the affordable units and the non-affordable units, the market rate units, how those are coming in over time.

1475
02:37:07,779 --> 02:37:12,382
[SPEAKER_19]: There is a, and it goes out at least 30 years, I think longer than that.

1476
02:37:12,402 --> 02:37:17,285
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you wanna talk a little bit more about the specific financial proposal.

1477
02:37:18,708 --> 02:37:23,231
[SPEAKER_26]: I did not prepare stuff on it, and I don't want to misspeak on it.

1478
02:37:23,331 --> 02:37:39,042
[SPEAKER_26]: We did have FXM associates review their financial proposal and their financing to make sure that they agreed that this was sufficient, that they were going to recoup enough profit in order to put back into this to maintain these buildings.

1479
02:37:39,422 --> 02:37:41,963
[SPEAKER_26]: To be clear, it's not the city's financing plan.

1480
02:37:42,504 --> 02:37:45,766
[SPEAKER_26]: We are not getting the income to build affordable housing.

1481
02:37:46,136 --> 02:37:49,357
[SPEAKER_26]: the developer is gonna be building and managing the housing on this.

1482
02:37:49,757 --> 02:38:03,022
[SPEAKER_26]: There will be linkage payments to the city as part of this, there will be building permit fees, and there will be taxes, new growth in addition to annual lease payments to the city.

1483
02:38:03,042 --> 02:38:08,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and I mean, I think the easiest answer to the question on the financing plan is

1484
02:38:09,797 --> 02:38:27,603
[SPEAKER_19]: if the developer can, I mean, subject to having the equity and the banks, you know, the financing to do it, if the developer can build more market rate units and they can provide more public benefits, whether that's more affordable units or other public benefits or affordable units at a deeper level of affordability.

1485
02:38:29,004 --> 02:38:36,907
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's kind of the, we're still in the really tough Catch-22 situation here where

1486
02:38:38,745 --> 02:38:43,828
[SPEAKER_19]: This is privately financed and it's privately financed by private finance institutions that are seeking a profit.

1487
02:38:43,908 --> 02:38:46,689
[SPEAKER_19]: It is not a publicly financed project.

1488
02:38:46,829 --> 02:38:54,113
[SPEAKER_19]: By leasing the land, we're getting some more public benefit because of how we're doing it and because we are a stakeholder.

1489
02:38:55,474 --> 02:39:06,120
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's different than, say, if we were having a nonprofit developer trying to help us finance this and having the money for it or

1490
02:39:06,802 --> 02:39:14,128
[SPEAKER_19]: especially if there was government financing available, public financing or funding available, that would be a completely different conversation.

1491
02:39:14,268 --> 02:39:26,698
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's essentially a version of what we do with our inclusionary zoning on private land, but just somewhat improved in a sense because it's also a lease of this public land.

1492
02:39:26,718 --> 02:39:29,120
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you wanna add to that at all.

1493
02:39:29,921 --> 02:39:34,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, Paul, I'm just gonna go to Josh a little.

1494
02:39:36,123 --> 02:39:56,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor, my question though is that, what I'm concerned is that if one of our goals is to increase affordable housing, is the final plan going to be such that it can reflect carrying those costs as well as the maintenance of the buildings and all the associated costs with taking care of them?

1495
02:39:56,428 --> 02:40:05,110
[SPEAKER_12]: I think my concern here is that if the major point here was to get affordable housing here, I think the revenue plan needs to deal with that directly as well as

1496
02:40:05,637 --> 02:40:09,161
[SPEAKER_12]: ancillary costs to maintain the buildings for the next number of years.

1497
02:40:12,484 --> 02:40:15,046
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the developer's financing plan.

1498
02:40:15,127 --> 02:40:28,600
[SPEAKER_19]: So if they can have more affordable housing, you know, if they can get the equity to do that, then more affordable units or units at a deeper affordability or both would be on the table.

1499
02:40:37,637 --> 02:40:39,118
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna go to Joshua.

1500
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:42,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Joshua.

1501
02:40:47,145 --> 02:40:52,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

1502
02:40:58,535 --> 02:40:59,095
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh God.

1503
02:41:05,140 --> 02:41:06,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry about that everyone.

1504
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:11,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further public comment?

1505
02:41:13,423 --> 02:41:15,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll go to direct to Councilor Callahan.

1506
02:41:17,546 --> 02:41:17,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1507
02:41:17,787 --> 02:41:25,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate the constituent who is bringing up the specifics of the affordable housing.

1508
02:41:25,473 --> 02:41:34,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to make a short comment, which is that if you actually run the numbers, I will say I was a little surprised that 80% of AMI is 92,000.

1509
02:41:34,180 --> 02:41:34,921
[SPEAKER_08]: That's higher than I thought.

1510
02:41:39,243 --> 02:41:44,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you run the numbers at 92,000, 30% of that per month is 2,300.

1511
02:41:45,085 --> 02:41:48,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And I assume that's one person, so it'd be a one bedroom.

1512
02:41:49,406 --> 02:42:01,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm making a guess because between 92 and 132K, which you said was one person and four person, 80% of AMI, making a guess for two people that it's around 108.

1513
02:42:01,208 --> 02:42:03,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's accurate, but something like that.

1514
02:42:05,189 --> 02:42:08,531
[SPEAKER_08]: that would that would be around like 2700 a month for a two bed.

1515
02:42:08,551 --> 02:42:16,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like actually running the numbers and these numbers don't, to me appear to be much different from market rate.

1516
02:42:17,093 --> 02:42:19,894
[SPEAKER_19]: They are significantly below market rate for new construction.

1517
02:42:20,835 --> 02:42:23,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hang on, hang on.

1518
02:42:24,336 --> 02:42:29,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So and I understand that you're saying market rate for new construction.

1519
02:42:29,818 --> 02:42:29,958
[SPEAKER_08]: So

1520
02:42:31,872 --> 02:42:51,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want us to be sensitive to the fact that if this is close to market rate for a lot of our existing housing, then calling this affordable when it's new construction, I just want us to be sensitive to this idea that

1521
02:42:53,038 --> 02:42:55,762
[SPEAKER_19]: I think a lot of people say affordable they say small a affordable.

1522
02:42:56,544 --> 02:43:01,572
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is big a affordable it's legally, the definition of subsidized housing inventory affordable.

1523
02:43:01,872 --> 02:43:02,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1524
02:43:02,313 --> 02:43:07,882
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and I think that is in fact what I'm bringing up which is, I think that people in the city want

1525
02:43:09,357 --> 02:43:11,197
[SPEAKER_08]: colloquially affordable housing, right?

1526
02:43:11,557 --> 02:43:14,778
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want something that fits the legal definition of affordable housing.

1527
02:43:15,178 --> 02:43:20,119
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not actually creating more housing in our city, that is gonna be affordable for people.

1528
02:43:20,139 --> 02:43:27,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even at 80% of AMI, let alone what the constituent was mentioning of people who aren't at 80% AMI.

1529
02:43:27,781 --> 02:43:34,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I hope that we can consider having some steps or something, that's all.

1530
02:43:35,062 --> 02:43:51,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know it's conversation, but I think actually looking at the numbers and being open with the public about what numbers we are looking at and whether we're creating lowercase a, colloquially understood to be affordable housing, I think is an important discussion.

1531
02:43:52,653 --> 02:43:54,834
[SPEAKER_26]: So part of it is there is a housing crisis.

1532
02:43:54,874 --> 02:43:56,755
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is exactly the definition.

1533
02:43:57,155 --> 02:44:00,537
[SPEAKER_26]: You'd be stunned at how expensive units are these days.

1534
02:44:01,478 --> 02:44:04,600
[SPEAKER_26]: But one of the theories is that when you build new housing,

1535
02:44:05,095 --> 02:44:14,458
[SPEAKER_26]: The people who are in the older housing and can afford the new housing will move into it, and that will free up spaces in the older housing for people.

1536
02:44:14,818 --> 02:44:20,219
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, the hope is that those don't then get snatched up and renovated and turned into expensive housing as well.

1537
02:44:20,719 --> 02:44:34,143
[SPEAKER_26]: It's one of the things that we're actually hoping to see with the tough storm, where that's gonna be moving approximately 650 juniors and seniors out of housing, mostly in Medford and Somerville, into there, and that's gonna free up

1538
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:39,242
[SPEAKER_26]: run down cheap housing, because that's where the students are living these days.

1539
02:44:39,742 --> 02:44:46,485
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're hoping that this will become more available to residents who need lower cost housing, for example.

1540
02:44:46,546 --> 02:44:55,390
[SPEAKER_26]: But that's the idea, that you build new stuff, the people in the older buildings move into the new buildings, and then the older buildings are like, oh no, we have nobody to live here.

1541
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:58,471
[SPEAKER_26]: And so then they keep the rents lower to bring people in.

1542
02:44:58,752 --> 02:45:03,314
[SPEAKER_26]: But because of the housing crisis, we are just seeing people are snatching up everything.

1543
02:45:04,690 --> 02:45:20,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, and I don't disagree that like we also have a very specific issue in Medford which is we have a lot of older folks, we have the largest of my understanding from the Senior Center, and the Council on Aging is that we have the largest proportions or cohort of seniors that we have ever had.

1544
02:45:21,299 --> 02:45:24,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of them, especially I've talked to tons of them they live in.

1545
02:45:26,543 --> 02:45:34,193
[SPEAKER_08]: They live in a four or five bedroom home and they're by themselves or with two people and they don't actually even want that, but there's nowhere in Medford to go.

1546
02:45:34,233 --> 02:45:40,943
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that this will resolve that issue, but I think creating affordable housing is its own

1547
02:45:41,804 --> 02:46:01,618
[SPEAKER_08]: question, and that I would love for the City Council and the Planning Department and the Mayor and everyone to sort of grapple with in a real way, that I hope we aren't just creating more housing and hoping that that theoretically resolves a lot of our problems, but that we actually make some efforts to create

1548
02:46:02,479 --> 02:46:05,602
[SPEAKER_08]: affordable housing in the different variety of ways that it can be.

1549
02:46:05,662 --> 02:46:07,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't necessarily mean create as in built.

1550
02:46:07,844 --> 02:46:23,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I just mean that, you know, whether that's the Royal Community Land Trust, whether that's the Affordable Housing Trust, whether, you know, there's many avenues, I think, doing our best to create housing that is lowercase a affordable is something that I hope we can

1551
02:46:25,758 --> 02:46:41,660
[SPEAKER_26]: And one of the things we asked for in this was we said we're looking for housing we're not looking, looking for luxury housing, looking for smaller units we're looking for things targeted at seniors and targeted at for example graduate students young professionals from tough.

1552
02:46:42,201 --> 02:46:44,703
[SPEAKER_26]: Tufts is going to start running a shuttle to Medford Square.

1553
02:46:44,763 --> 02:46:49,687
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know if everybody heard that, but with the opening of the new dorm, they've committed to a shuttle to Medford Square.

1554
02:46:50,288 --> 02:46:56,013
[SPEAKER_26]: That is also something that would help young staff at Tufts be able to live here.

1555
02:46:56,453 --> 02:47:05,321
[SPEAKER_26]: And so we've asked them to think about more smaller units rather than fewer big luxury units, because that's what we need to see more of in the city.

1556
02:47:06,402 --> 02:47:08,944
[SPEAKER_26]: And we push that with developers fairly frequently.

1557
02:47:09,672 --> 02:47:19,320
[SPEAKER_19]: And we did solicit a lot of different bids, you know, if a nonprofit housing developer had bid on this would be in a different conversation probably because it's probably who he would have gone with.

1558
02:47:19,881 --> 02:47:24,565
[SPEAKER_26]: And they looked at it and they some of them did in fact attend the walkthrough, but they did not bid on it.

1559
02:47:26,486 --> 02:47:30,810
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I mean, I think, right, you're, you're completely right.

1560
02:47:30,850 --> 02:47:31,851
[SPEAKER_19]: And Marie's completely right.

1561
02:47:31,891 --> 02:47:33,873
[SPEAKER_19]: And others are completely right that, like,

1562
02:47:35,572 --> 02:47:40,916
[SPEAKER_19]: the market has failed, and the government is not intervening in the failure of the market.

1563
02:47:43,158 --> 02:47:48,962
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the question is, do you do nothing and hope that a different government will set different rules?

1564
02:47:49,683 --> 02:47:54,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, how much do you want to try to wait out like the public housing renaissance and the social housing renaissance in this country?

1565
02:47:56,543 --> 02:48:02,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Or do you try to preserve as much existing naturally affordable housing as you can by at least trying to meet market demand.

1566
02:48:03,588 --> 02:48:07,990
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we're in a, in a difficult situation with that so like I completely agree.

1567
02:48:08,010 --> 02:48:13,374
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's, as for me, many, you know, five years up here.

1568
02:48:14,664 --> 02:48:25,791
[SPEAKER_19]: really hard that these kinds of decisions are put on us at this level of government because the state and federal government are completely ignoring and absent and in some cases making the situation a lot worse.

1569
02:48:27,552 --> 02:48:38,959
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why I brought up like the if the state just allowed like us to use municipal bond rates that would open up some financing options here even if it wasn't like us actually paying back the bonds themselves just if the city could help

1570
02:48:39,846 --> 02:48:41,267
[SPEAKER_19]: finance it at those rates, right?

1571
02:48:41,387 --> 02:48:48,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Like that would be a game changer versus like these guys had to go out and find $200 million in financing at the current rates.

1572
02:48:48,513 --> 02:48:52,557
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's tough and it's hard.

1573
02:48:54,378 --> 02:48:55,199
[SPEAKER_19]: There's one more comment.

1574
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Molly, could you start your video before I let you speak?

1575
02:49:00,463 --> 02:49:05,948
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, you seem to be a real person.

1576
02:49:05,968 --> 02:49:08,350
[SPEAKER_19]: You're upside down, but I trust you're not gonna zoom on me.

1577
02:49:12,188 --> 02:49:14,570
[SPEAKER_19]: Molly, name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1578
02:49:16,771 --> 02:49:19,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Molly Dressel, 20 Hancock Street.

1579
02:49:20,233 --> 02:49:23,334
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry, can I turn my video off because I feel it's really distracting.

1580
02:49:23,354 --> 02:49:25,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, you can now, yes, that was just a verification.

1581
02:49:26,016 --> 02:49:28,697
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, sorry about that.

1582
02:49:29,598 --> 02:49:35,521
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I've been living here for seven years, and I've been a Local 7 union ironworker for six of those years.

1583
02:49:36,902 --> 02:49:38,703
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've never had a job opportunity in

1584
02:49:39,519 --> 02:49:40,159
[SPEAKER_23]: Medford.

1585
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:57,931
[SPEAKER_23]: I've worked in the surrounding areas like Somerville High School, Union Square, Elwha Station, I think there's something coming up in Everett, and I know that in Medford we've done some steel building like the Great American Beer Hall and the Herb Chambers, but all has been non-union.

1586
02:49:57,951 --> 02:50:02,955
[SPEAKER_23]: I know Tufts University is, the carpenters are picketing out there right now

1587
02:50:03,593 --> 02:50:05,374
[SPEAKER_23]: and they're about to build all those dorms.

1588
02:50:06,315 --> 02:50:09,658
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know that's not out to bid yet, but I'm doubting that it's going to go union.

1589
02:50:10,918 --> 02:50:18,904
[SPEAKER_23]: So I guess I'm just here today to be a voice for the union members and advocate that these projects coming up prioritize union labor.

1590
02:50:20,065 --> 02:50:29,192
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm recognizing that it usually comes at a higher price, but the unions like Local 7 are ensuring that the workers have proper training and certifications.

1591
02:50:29,902 --> 02:50:31,243
[SPEAKER_23]: needed to do the work correctly.

1592
02:50:31,263 --> 02:50:34,546
[SPEAKER_23]: Construction work is a dangerous trade.

1593
02:50:35,126 --> 02:50:40,430
[SPEAKER_23]: The unions are fighting to secure fair wages for us and benefits without discrimination.

1594
02:50:40,450 --> 02:50:44,613
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's all about protecting the workers and ensuring their safety.

1595
02:50:45,294 --> 02:50:56,983
[SPEAKER_23]: This includes utilizing the proper safety techniques and complying with OSHA, thereby making a safer job site for the workers and also the surrounding community while the construction is taking place.

1596
02:50:58,727 --> 02:51:09,653
[SPEAKER_23]: I think rebuilding right around City Hall and using union labor would make a strong statement that Medford supports the unions and recognizes their importance, especially right now when work is really hard for us to come by.

1597
02:51:10,273 --> 02:51:20,118
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm just here to say that we're here, we need the work, we need to provide for our families, we have the skill and the proper training to get things done safely and efficiently.

1598
02:51:21,158 --> 02:51:38,211
[SPEAKER_23]: And just a quick note on, I know that Alicia was saying a lot of the buildings are going to be wood and under five stories, but a lot of other places smaller are also going for steel now for a very good reason of the long-term benefits.

1599
02:51:39,252 --> 02:51:42,474
[SPEAKER_23]: It won't rot or warp like wood will.

1600
02:51:42,774 --> 02:51:45,557
[SPEAKER_23]: It can better withstand natural disasters.

1601
02:51:45,877 --> 02:51:50,040
[SPEAKER_23]: It's resistant to pests and the elements, especially being right by the water.

1602
02:51:50,997 --> 02:52:03,213
[SPEAKER_23]: And for longevity purposes, it could also provide the ability to expand in the long term, maybe if you want to add on more stories to the existing, to the new buildings that you're making.

1603
02:52:04,115 --> 02:52:04,655
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I had.

1604
02:52:04,896 --> 02:52:05,216
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1605
02:52:05,236 --> 02:52:08,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Molly.

1606
02:52:14,591 --> 02:52:19,293
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that's going to be an issue that we try to balance as well as part of the project.

1607
02:52:22,554 --> 02:52:24,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have anything more you want to add on that, Director Hunt?

1608
02:52:26,656 --> 02:52:29,737
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd just say I appreciate the comment, and it's good to hear that.

1609
02:52:29,897 --> 02:52:34,519
[SPEAKER_26]: And we will take that into account and discuss with the developers.

1610
02:52:35,339 --> 02:52:37,520
[SPEAKER_19]: We would love some big, beautiful steel buildings.

1611
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:38,240
[SPEAKER_19]: I can tell you that.

1612
02:52:38,260 --> 02:52:39,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1613
02:52:43,886 --> 02:52:49,990
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, we had a motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Nazaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1614
02:52:51,871 --> 02:52:53,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1615
02:52:53,852 --> 02:52:57,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you share that with us?

1616
02:52:57,335 --> 02:52:58,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1617
02:53:00,116 --> 02:53:00,617
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have it.

1618
02:53:00,717 --> 02:53:03,178
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can share it with me, if you share with the clerk, actually.

1619
02:53:03,679 --> 02:53:04,059
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1620
02:53:04,359 --> 02:53:06,420
[SPEAKER_13]: It was very helpful to share with people.

1621
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:06,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1622
02:53:08,662 --> 02:53:11,263
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

1623
02:53:15,068 --> 02:53:15,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Calling him.

1624
02:53:16,909 --> 02:53:17,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

1625
02:53:18,030 --> 02:53:18,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1626
02:53:18,290 --> 02:53:20,631
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a little Zorro.

1627
02:53:20,651 --> 02:53:22,912
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lemon is absent.

1628
02:53:23,793 --> 02:53:24,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1629
02:53:26,214 --> 02:53:28,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

1630
02:53:28,215 --> 02:53:28,456
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1631
02:53:28,476 --> 02:53:37,120
[SPEAKER_19]: 60 affirmative one absent the motion passes 25078 amendments to the parking ordinance section 78 173.

1632
02:53:39,042 --> 02:53:41,423
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, Director Hunter you on any of this or.

1633
02:53:44,842 --> 02:53:45,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, it's fine.

1634
02:53:45,923 --> 02:53:51,248
[SPEAKER_19]: So as a member of the traffic commission.

1635
02:53:51,268 --> 02:53:55,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so we had a there was a committee of the whole meeting, the

1636
02:53:56,512 --> 02:53:57,653
[SPEAKER_19]: Chief of Staff talked about it.

1637
02:53:57,693 --> 02:54:13,724
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a proposal to repeal an ordinance section on municipal employee and municipal business parking because the Traffic Commission is now putting in regulations around municipal parking to address the parking shortage at City Hall and people parking at City Hall for non-municipal business.

1638
02:54:14,345 --> 02:54:22,350
[SPEAKER_19]: And the request is to repeal this ordinance so that there's no conflict between the Traffic Commission regulations and the city ordinance.

1639
02:54:23,551 --> 02:54:25,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there anything else you'd want to add on that, Alicia?

1640
02:54:31,875 --> 02:54:36,058
[SPEAKER_26]: If there are questions, I am familiar with this from traffic commission so I can answer it.

1641
02:54:36,338 --> 02:54:41,701
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that chief, I think the chief of staff and the parking director talked about this with folks in committee the whole, I wasn't able to attend that meeting.

1642
02:54:42,301 --> 02:54:46,664
[SPEAKER_19]: It's my first miss this year, but I wasn't able to be there.

1643
02:54:48,445 --> 02:54:53,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there anything else that folks who were at that meeting want to add about the proposal or anything that I missed from the discussion at that meeting?

1644
02:54:58,891 --> 02:54:59,071
Okay.

1645
02:55:02,497 --> 02:55:03,498
[SPEAKER_13]: prison council.

1646
02:55:03,538 --> 02:55:10,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's the biggest thing people things when calls hang out was this means we're taking public parking wafer.

1647
02:55:10,107 --> 02:55:10,487
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not.

1648
02:55:10,808 --> 02:55:12,610
[SPEAKER_13]: No, so just so that's all this.

1649
02:55:12,970 --> 02:55:14,532
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty self explanatory.

1650
02:55:14,612 --> 02:55:17,716
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's, it's actually in here pretty specifically about.

1651
02:55:20,280 --> 02:55:24,143
[SPEAKER_19]: The above changes allow the city to update the signage at City Hall and enforce parking restrictions.

1652
02:55:25,084 --> 02:55:30,928
[SPEAKER_19]: Currently, we have commuters who are parking in the lot and using the bus or walking over to Harvard Vanguard.

1653
02:55:31,549 --> 02:55:34,911
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're not using the Harvard Vanguard lot and they're not using the commuter lot.

1654
02:55:34,951 --> 02:55:42,477
[SPEAKER_19]: They're using City Hall and it's making it hard for employees and people who want to do business at City Hall to do business.

1655
02:55:42,697 --> 02:55:43,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Collins.

1656
02:55:44,952 --> 02:55:49,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you president bears I think all of the important points have been stated already but I was present at this meeting.

1657
02:55:50,517 --> 02:56:05,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Talked about it with Chief of Staff Nazarian and Director McDermott and they emphasized that this was really just a targeted change to make sure that visitors to City Hall and City Hall employees can access the parking that they need to go to City Hall and do business and go to their jobs.

1658
02:56:06,610 --> 02:56:30,300
[SPEAKER_06]: not intended to be punitive and the committee did ask for a guarantee that it wouldn't just be all of a sudden tickets are being issued there's going to be a substantial you know informational period and warning period and issuing warnings before they start doing enforcement related to fines so really not intended to be punitive just want to make sure that people who need to park at city hall are able to do so and

1659
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:37,361
[SPEAKER_06]: the large amount of public parking that is next to that lot is still, for the moment, public parking.

1660
02:56:37,762 --> 02:56:38,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1661
02:56:39,942 --> 02:56:40,322
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1662
02:56:40,342 --> 02:56:41,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion to approve for first reading?

1663
02:56:43,443 --> 02:56:47,664
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1664
02:56:49,144 --> 02:56:50,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1665
02:56:56,866 --> 02:56:57,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

1666
02:56:59,036 --> 02:56:59,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

1667
02:57:00,116 --> 02:57:00,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1668
02:57:01,557 --> 02:57:02,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1669
02:57:02,337 --> 02:57:02,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1670
02:57:03,977 --> 02:57:05,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Leming is absent.

1671
02:57:05,858 --> 02:57:06,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1672
02:57:06,818 --> 02:57:07,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1673
02:57:07,698 --> 02:57:08,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng?

1674
02:57:08,239 --> 02:57:08,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1675
02:57:08,899 --> 02:57:09,499
[SPEAKER_19]: President Paris?

1676
02:57:09,539 --> 02:57:13,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1677
02:57:13,400 --> 02:57:15,121
[SPEAKER_19]: 25079, appropriation of free cash for Carr Park.

1678
02:57:15,641 --> 02:57:19,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's take both of you, let's talk about it all at once, even though there's two papers for Carr Park.

1679
02:57:20,002 --> 02:57:21,522
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm guessing it's for the same reason.

1680
02:57:22,363 --> 02:57:27,044
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have an appropriation of free cash and a CPC appropriation for Carr Park.

1681
02:57:28,533 --> 02:57:30,836
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Teresa will just do the community garden piece when.

1682
02:57:31,557 --> 02:57:31,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1683
02:57:31,917 --> 02:57:32,197
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1684
02:57:32,858 --> 02:57:38,065
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have from the mayor, a request for 65,000 contingency funding fees to a car park renovation.

1685
02:57:38,085 --> 02:57:45,254
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is a funding match with the CPA is also a funding match so I'll go to a planner central.

1686
02:57:46,535 --> 02:57:55,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, thank you so much for having me, Amanda central I work in the Office of planning development and sustainability for the city, and I work on parks projects, good to see you all.

1687
02:57:56,621 --> 02:58:02,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think everyone here is very familiar with the car park project but if you want me to go into more detail just let me know.

1688
02:58:02,958 --> 02:58:07,199
[SPEAKER_05]: We are within phase two of the renovation, which is currently underway.

1689
02:58:07,339 --> 02:58:14,501
[SPEAKER_05]: We started construction in February and that work will continue until the end of this calendar year.

1690
02:58:16,082 --> 02:58:32,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick recap, it includes a lot of cool stuff, playground, dog park, two basketball courts, one is open air, one has a shade structure over top with solar panels, a skate park, a small splash pad, teen and fitness areas,

1691
02:58:32,907 --> 02:58:33,107
[SPEAKER_05]: more.

1692
02:58:35,308 --> 02:58:41,550
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're presenting tonight is a request for some contingency funding for the project.

1693
02:58:42,191 --> 02:58:45,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So contingency funding is really important.

1694
02:58:45,792 --> 02:58:58,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It allows for, as a project is underway, for the project team to make swift decisions about what to do when unforeseen issues arise or new conditions sort of present themselves.

1695
02:58:59,738 --> 02:59:01,399
[SPEAKER_05]: It's considered a best practice to have.

1696
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:10,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And I took a look at other projects of comparable scales in the city that were actually performed by the same contractor that we've done.

1697
02:59:12,551 --> 02:59:16,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Gillis Field car park phase one and McGlynn playground.

1698
02:59:16,915 --> 02:59:20,958
[SPEAKER_05]: and took a look at how much contingency funding we used on each of those projects.

1699
02:59:21,658 --> 02:59:26,622
[SPEAKER_05]: It ranged a bit from like 2.3 to 4% of the total project budget.

1700
02:59:27,662 --> 02:59:42,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this appropriation ask is in combination with the CPA ask to follow, plus contingency funds that we've already dedicated to the project from linkage funding would amount to about 3.6% of the project budget.

1701
02:59:42,492 --> 02:59:44,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of right within that range.

1702
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:46,622
[SPEAKER_05]: The.

1703
02:59:49,098 --> 02:59:57,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now in the project, we're in the phase where we're underground, which in my experience is where you encounter kind of the most unknowns.

1704
02:59:58,585 --> 03:00:03,488
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have city records and things like that, but sometimes you really don't know what's there until you dig into it.

1705
03:00:04,269 --> 03:00:16,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, we found under our existing tennis and basketball courts, a set of full athletic courts from many years ago that we had to remove and demolish.

1706
03:00:17,414 --> 03:00:18,635
[SPEAKER_05]: buried underneath the ground.

1707
03:00:18,915 --> 03:00:32,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you just run into some unknowns and having contingency funding is a surefire way to be able to address those needs in a timely way, and I keep mentioning timing because when construction is active.

1708
03:00:34,563 --> 03:00:35,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Timing is key.

1709
03:00:36,624 --> 03:00:40,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes delays of even a couple of days incur costs.

1710
03:00:41,766 --> 03:00:49,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of it, the sequencing of this project, we have, as I listed out, so many wonderful things going into a compact space.

1711
03:00:49,349 --> 03:00:52,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have lots of different types of installments happening.

1712
03:00:52,731 --> 03:00:55,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means you're scheduling a lot of different types of

1713
03:00:55,952 --> 03:00:58,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it work and cruise on the site.

1714
03:00:59,395 --> 03:01:05,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have a delay on one thing, it kind of has this ripple effect of delaying everything else.

1715
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:13,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I'll pause there and just see if folks have questions about the nature of the ask.

1716
03:01:13,667 --> 03:01:21,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the free cash request is for $65,000 and the following CPA request is as a match of 65,000 for 130,000 total.

1717
03:01:27,112 --> 03:01:28,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Any questions from members of the council?

1718
03:01:30,534 --> 03:01:31,615
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have one.

1719
03:01:31,915 --> 03:01:33,356
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the contingency percentage?

1720
03:01:34,256 --> 03:01:36,438
[SPEAKER_19]: If we didn't, like, if we didn't approve this, what was the contingency?

1721
03:01:37,018 --> 03:01:47,905
[SPEAKER_05]: If we didn't approve this, we had, let's see, so we already dedicated 46,000 to the project, which we have essentially expended at this point.

1722
03:01:47,985 --> 03:01:48,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1723
03:01:49,345 --> 03:01:49,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would be

1724
03:01:52,476 --> 03:01:57,077
[SPEAKER_19]: 0.09%.

1725
03:01:53,076 --> 03:01:57,077
[SPEAKER_19]: So a lot less than that 2.3 to 4, 2.6.

1726
03:01:57,757 --> 03:02:01,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 2.3 to 4% is the range of just comparable projects.

1727
03:02:02,439 --> 03:02:06,300
[SPEAKER_19]: And if the contingency funds aren't used, then they go back to the source?

1728
03:02:06,541 --> 03:02:06,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1729
03:02:06,901 --> 03:02:11,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And in this case, would they go evenly back to the source or have you talked about that?

1730
03:02:13,623 --> 03:02:15,144
[SPEAKER_09]: manager, Teresa Dupont.

1731
03:02:15,524 --> 03:02:17,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I also work here at City Hall, just for the record.

1732
03:02:18,366 --> 03:02:26,310
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, we actually decided at the CPC that we encourage any sort of funding that's left over to be split evenly back.

1733
03:02:26,350 --> 03:02:34,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's $100,000 left, which would be great, $50,000 would go back to free cash, $50,000 would go back to the CPA coffers.

1734
03:02:35,094 --> 03:02:36,575
[SPEAKER_19]: So don't dig up any more problems.

1735
03:02:37,856 --> 03:02:38,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1736
03:02:38,816 --> 03:02:40,757
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1737
03:02:40,817 --> 03:02:42,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further questions from members of the Council?

1738
03:02:45,288 --> 03:02:48,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing none, do we have any questions or comments from members of the public?

1739
03:02:52,230 --> 03:02:56,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing no hands in person or on Zoom, is there a motion?

1740
03:02:56,652 --> 03:03:00,933
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1741
03:03:01,353 --> 03:03:04,654
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a dead tie and I was looking at Councilor Lazzaro, which felt unfair.

1742
03:03:06,835 --> 03:03:09,096
[SPEAKER_19]: So motion to approve the free cash appropriation

1743
03:03:09,904 --> 03:03:13,267
[SPEAKER_19]: by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1744
03:03:13,287 --> 03:03:13,667
[SPEAKER_15]: $65,000, yes?

1745
03:03:13,848 --> 03:03:14,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1746
03:03:15,429 --> 03:03:16,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan?

1747
03:03:16,430 --> 03:03:16,550
Yes.

1748
03:03:17,611 --> 03:03:18,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

1749
03:03:20,854 --> 03:03:21,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1750
03:03:23,076 --> 03:03:23,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1751
03:03:24,177 --> 03:03:24,297
Yes.

1752
03:03:25,017 --> 03:03:25,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Leming is absent.

1753
03:03:26,118 --> 03:03:26,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1754
03:03:26,939 --> 03:03:27,099
Yes.

1755
03:03:27,940 --> 03:03:28,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng?

1756
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:28,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1757
03:03:29,481 --> 03:03:30,042
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears?

1758
03:03:30,302 --> 03:03:30,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1759
03:03:30,522 --> 03:03:32,844
[SPEAKER_19]: 16 vote and one absent, the motion passes.

1760
03:03:33,825 --> 03:03:36,708
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you want to stick around for the next, you know,

1761
03:03:38,208 --> 03:03:39,629
[SPEAKER_19]: we'll happily entertain you.

1762
03:03:39,669 --> 03:03:53,837
[SPEAKER_09]: But so there was only one little thing in addition to the, there was a... In addition to the car park phase two and procedurally for the future, whenever we have two separate appropriations, would you like to see those as separate motions?

1763
03:03:54,477 --> 03:03:54,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1764
03:03:54,937 --> 03:03:56,498
[SPEAKER_22]: Not when we're calling the roll, I'll tell you that.

1765
03:03:58,859 --> 03:04:00,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are here tonight.

1766
03:04:00,620 --> 03:04:12,424
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to the $65,000 appropriation request for Carr Park, we're also here asking for appropriation the amount of $5,500 to go to the Medford Community Gardens.

1767
03:04:13,064 --> 03:04:15,485
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually going to be for a project which is kind of new.

1768
03:04:15,505 --> 03:04:16,626
[SPEAKER_09]: We're very excited to see it.

1769
03:04:17,066 --> 03:04:19,987
[SPEAKER_09]: A pop-up community garden here in Medford Square.

1770
03:04:20,927 --> 03:04:29,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to address that the garden itself, and actually, thank you, Teresa, I'm reminding myself that I have slides that I can share just to give some visuals.

1771
03:04:29,834 --> 03:04:31,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be quick here.

1772
03:04:33,056 --> 03:04:39,921
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would actually be placed on one of the parcels that was being discussed earlier for redevelopment.

1773
03:04:39,961 --> 03:04:45,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So the nature of this project is temporary.

1774
03:04:46,026 --> 03:04:47,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Apologies here.

1775
03:04:49,376 --> 03:04:51,779
[SPEAKER_09]: share screen, sharing screen.

1776
03:04:54,302 --> 03:04:54,663
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1777
03:04:54,723 --> 03:05:00,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a thousand windows open here, so let me just minimize real quick.

1778
03:05:00,109 --> 03:05:00,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1779
03:05:01,982 --> 03:05:05,604
[SPEAKER_09]: So the garden here would actually be placed on an empty parcel.

1780
03:05:05,624 --> 03:05:09,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna skip ahead in my slides here to show exactly the location here.

1781
03:05:11,607 --> 03:05:17,790
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the site of the former farmer's market for folks who've been here for more than 14 years or so.

1782
03:05:17,810 --> 03:05:19,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I myself haven't been.

1783
03:05:20,611 --> 03:05:23,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's located adjacent from the senior center.

1784
03:05:24,233 --> 03:05:26,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you can see here in the pictures, if you're facing it,

1785
03:05:28,083 --> 03:05:29,306
[SPEAKER_09]: City Hall's there in the back.

1786
03:05:29,967 --> 03:05:33,034
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll back up here and just kind of give a quick overview of this.

1787
03:05:35,066 --> 03:05:48,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, temporary in nature, because we want to test out the need for this particular area of the community, as well as to, in the future, take it and test it out amongst other areas of neighborhoods here.

1788
03:05:48,774 --> 03:05:50,255
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be a total of 28 beds.

1789
03:05:51,636 --> 03:06:00,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Water sourcing, they're going to get creative with some rain barrels, as well as exploring some options from the DPW to provide a permanent water source there.

1790
03:06:02,887 --> 03:06:12,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to go into more detail here, but we feel like this is a really prominent, highly visible location in the city to help promote and do some outreach for community gardens.

1791
03:06:13,357 --> 03:06:19,682
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's an educational, it's a vibrancy coming to the R Square here for short money.

1792
03:06:20,523 --> 03:06:22,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And we would ask for your support in this project.

1793
03:06:23,666 --> 03:06:25,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Also the site of the former carnival.

1794
03:06:25,968 --> 03:06:27,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, how long ago was that?

1795
03:06:27,630 --> 03:06:27,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Too long.

1796
03:06:29,545 --> 03:06:34,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Callahan, and then we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve.

1797
03:06:34,689 --> 03:06:36,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

1798
03:06:36,830 --> 03:06:37,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1799
03:06:37,311 --> 03:06:44,256
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this $5,500, is this adding to a fund to make this happen, or is that the whole amount to make this happen?

1800
03:06:44,356 --> 03:06:45,717
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great question.

1801
03:06:46,298 --> 03:06:49,100
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not the full funding amount for this project.

1802
03:06:49,120 --> 03:06:51,762
[SPEAKER_09]: The Garden Commission will be doing some fundraising.

1803
03:06:52,302 --> 03:07:00,107
[SPEAKER_09]: The committee, the Community Preservation Committee elected to fund the reusable portions of this project.

1804
03:07:00,548 --> 03:07:06,592
[SPEAKER_09]: There are costs associated with renting some fencing, some temporary fencing to secure the garden as well as loom and soil.

1805
03:07:07,532 --> 03:07:13,276
[SPEAKER_09]: The committee felt that that would not be an appropriate use of CPA funds to pay for those temporary nature things.

1806
03:07:13,296 --> 03:07:18,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are funding the infrastructure, if you will, and the gardens will be fundraising for the remaining.

1807
03:07:19,961 --> 03:07:22,090
[SPEAKER_09]: garden, soil, fencing.

1808
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:24,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

1809
03:07:24,179 --> 03:07:24,500
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1810
03:07:25,989 --> 03:07:34,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say it does strike me that like this project is like $5,000 and replacing the HVAC system in the school is $25 million.

1811
03:07:35,732 --> 03:07:37,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I understand that these things are real, but like, wow.

1812
03:07:39,913 --> 03:07:42,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been long in the municipal arena and I feel that way every day.

1813
03:07:42,974 --> 03:07:44,395
[SPEAKER_09]: How much?

1814
03:07:45,835 --> 03:07:51,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we're happy that we can stretch our CPA dollars to fulfill this project.

1815
03:07:51,755 --> 03:07:59,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and just to note, these were both unanimous votes of the CPC to recommend and the conditions you mentioned about the community garden were mentioned here.

1816
03:08:02,684 --> 03:08:03,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I am excited about it, thank you.

1817
03:08:04,566 --> 03:08:08,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, I just have one question actually for Amanda, which is kind of why I asked you to stay, I'm so sorry.

1818
03:08:08,189 --> 03:08:13,934
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's, you don't need to answer it for too long.

1819
03:08:14,154 --> 03:08:19,659
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you think that the fact that those courts were buried is the reason that like the courts above ended up becoming like

1820
03:08:20,788 --> 03:08:21,909
[SPEAKER_19]: cracked and broken and stuff?

1821
03:08:23,010 --> 03:08:24,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's possible.

1822
03:08:25,633 --> 03:08:27,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not an engineer.

1823
03:08:27,594 --> 03:08:32,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you have different, well, the soil in that area is terrible.

1824
03:08:33,960 --> 03:08:38,945
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of organic material, which means that it settles at different rates.

1825
03:08:39,405 --> 03:08:45,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And then add to that the fact that you have these concrete and base course bits in the mix.

1826
03:08:47,651 --> 03:08:54,196
[SPEAKER_05]: you're having different parts of what's up top settle at different rates.

1827
03:08:54,416 --> 03:08:56,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And that causes cracking over time.

1828
03:08:56,517 --> 03:08:59,419
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's something you're accounting for in this project.

1829
03:08:59,519 --> 03:08:59,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1830
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:00,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1831
03:09:00,200 --> 03:09:15,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the cool, it was cool to watch one of the things that we were doing specifically under the basketball court with the shade structure, because that's a heavy structure, is these special ground improvements where you dig into the ground very deeply.

1832
03:09:15,831 --> 03:09:21,734
[SPEAKER_05]: and you create these empty columns, and then you fill the columns with gravel and shake it, and it compacts the gravel.

1833
03:09:21,834 --> 03:09:28,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you're creating these strong pillars within the ground to keep it from moving around so much.

1834
03:09:29,217 --> 03:09:38,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the things that we're doing, and regrading the site a bit, using new, fresh materials for some of the heavier portions of the site.

1835
03:09:39,710 --> 03:09:40,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you.

1836
03:09:40,570 --> 03:09:41,390
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that.

1837
03:09:42,131 --> 03:09:47,152
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve the CPC appropriation request seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1838
03:09:47,772 --> 03:09:48,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1839
03:09:53,634 --> 03:09:54,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

1840
03:09:55,374 --> 03:09:56,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

1841
03:09:56,835 --> 03:09:57,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1842
03:09:58,275 --> 03:09:59,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1843
03:10:00,576 --> 03:10:01,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lennon is absent.

1844
03:10:01,756 --> 03:10:02,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1845
03:10:03,857 --> 03:10:05,837
[SPEAKER_19]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1846
03:10:06,157 --> 03:10:06,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we got two more.

1847
03:10:07,177 --> 03:10:07,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry.

1848
03:10:07,838 --> 03:10:08,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng.

1849
03:10:09,728 --> 03:10:10,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Prison Affairs.

1850
03:10:11,489 --> 03:10:15,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1851
03:10:16,754 --> 03:10:19,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Six of the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1852
03:10:21,718 --> 03:10:23,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for your support.

1853
03:10:23,079 --> 03:10:24,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Saw which way that one was going.

1854
03:10:29,004 --> 03:10:29,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks you guys.

1855
03:10:33,588 --> 03:10:33,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1856
03:10:36,555 --> 03:10:39,838
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a first term trigger of some kind.

1857
03:10:39,898 --> 03:10:41,980
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you were the last in the alphabet at the time.

1858
03:10:42,980 --> 03:10:47,084
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Schiarpelli.

1859
03:10:47,104 --> 03:10:51,327
[SPEAKER_19]: 25081 submitted by the mayor approval for a lease purchasing finance agreement for the school security upgrades.

1860
03:10:51,347 --> 03:10:56,251
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have our assistant superintendent, Peter Cushing with us.

1861
03:10:56,291 --> 03:10:57,332
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been with us all night.

1862
03:10:57,372 --> 03:11:00,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Peter for sticking with us.

1863
03:11:00,615 --> 03:11:02,416
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is on the agenda because

1864
03:11:03,197 --> 03:11:05,960
[SPEAKER_19]: We approved the funding for this, a free cash appropriation.

1865
03:11:05,980 --> 03:11:14,510
[SPEAKER_19]: And it turns out there's a state law that requires us to also for specifically for lease to own agreements, we have to pass a separate thing.

1866
03:11:14,710 --> 03:11:16,853
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll go to Peter to explain that a little more.

1867
03:11:17,943 --> 03:11:22,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so the governing body when it comes to overall finances.

1868
03:11:23,185 --> 03:11:28,326
[SPEAKER_14]: My understanding is always with the governing body of the public schools, the school board, which is true.

1869
03:11:28,346 --> 03:11:33,848
[SPEAKER_14]: But when it comes to a five year lease option, which will bridge numerous visitors five.

1870
03:11:34,829 --> 03:11:40,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, we need the approval of this August body to approve that.

1871
03:11:41,617 --> 03:11:42,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give you a quick background.

1872
03:11:43,018 --> 03:11:43,819
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I mentioned it.

1873
03:11:44,240 --> 03:11:49,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was last week that I was here, but tonight I've traveled from softball to home back to the bridge town meeting.

1874
03:11:50,887 --> 03:11:53,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so I'm very sick of civically engaged this evening.

1875
03:11:54,251 --> 03:12:01,356
[SPEAKER_14]: The, the point of the matter is, is that we started out with this on state contract, which gives us a 20% discount.

1876
03:12:02,396 --> 03:12:11,762
[SPEAKER_14]: We've negotiated or I've negotiated, but she wasn't negotiating up to a 28% discount with significant other add ons, including.

1877
03:12:12,742 --> 03:12:25,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe 32 vape sensors that are being given to the district for the term of this, as well as, and then will be ours on outright once the end of, so there'll be no payments on those vape sensors.

1878
03:12:26,333 --> 03:12:32,738
[SPEAKER_14]: I might be off on the number just a little bit, but it is a high number that we have a hard negotiation.

1879
03:12:33,238 --> 03:12:51,283
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a comprehensive security upgrade that will address cameras in all areas of our schools, electronic access at our doors, security vestibules, and other things that really are not the purview of a public discussion but would be executive.

1880
03:12:52,204 --> 03:12:53,085
[SPEAKER_14]: committee type work.

1881
03:12:53,205 --> 03:13:08,122
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to know that this is a significant investment of time, effort, and negotiating skill to bring in a project several hundred thousand dollars less than we were at a few years ago when we looked at this.

1882
03:13:08,822 --> 03:13:10,603
[SPEAKER_14]: and added significant value.

1883
03:13:10,843 --> 03:13:22,267
[SPEAKER_14]: That being, in particular, the security vestibules, vape sensors, and just another comprehensive security tool that is going to really be an asset to the district moving forward.

1884
03:13:23,108 --> 03:13:26,169
[SPEAKER_14]: I really would appreciate the vote of this body.

1885
03:13:26,569 --> 03:13:34,572
[SPEAKER_14]: We've worked extraordinarily hard since last Friday when we got legal opinions on contracts to land those with Motorola where they need to be.

1886
03:13:35,152 --> 03:13:42,318
[SPEAKER_14]: The hope is that they will be able to be entered into DocuSign procurement office tomorrow and be able to move forward.

1887
03:13:44,380 --> 03:13:44,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1888
03:13:44,960 --> 03:13:45,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Peter.

1889
03:13:45,621 --> 03:14:02,814
[SPEAKER_19]: And just to note the specific language, dear President Bears and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body vote to authorize a lease purchase financing agreement under Chapter 44 of Section 21C of the General Laws for the acquisition of security equipment upgrades for Medford Public School buildings for which an appropriation was approved.

1890
03:14:03,855 --> 03:14:16,266
[SPEAKER_19]: By vote of the city council on April 29 2025 council paper number 25 066 the term of such agreement not to exceed five years and further that the school committee shall be authorized to enter into such agreement and any related documents on behalf of the city.

1891
03:14:16,926 --> 03:14:20,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for your kind attention to these matters respectfully submitted brand Lungo-Koehn mayor.

1892
03:14:20,829 --> 03:14:23,231
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is the item before us.

1893
03:14:23,472 --> 03:14:30,818
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have any comments or questions on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve seconded by seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1894
03:14:33,088 --> 03:14:34,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Any public discussion?

1895
03:14:35,990 --> 03:14:36,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1896
03:14:39,512 --> 03:14:39,832
[SPEAKER_19]: On this.

1897
03:14:41,013 --> 03:14:42,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1898
03:14:42,133 --> 03:14:48,857
[SPEAKER_19]: I assume you had a study depending on 4421 C. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1899
03:14:50,878 --> 03:14:51,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan.

1900
03:14:53,200 --> 03:14:54,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

1901
03:14:54,541 --> 03:14:54,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1902
03:14:58,327 --> 03:14:59,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Leming is absent.

1903
03:14:59,969 --> 03:15:03,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

1904
03:15:03,932 --> 03:15:06,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1905
03:15:06,935 --> 03:15:14,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Public participation to participate outside of Zoom, please email ahertabase at medford-ma.gov.

1906
03:15:14,802 --> 03:15:16,564
[SPEAKER_19]: We did have a paper from Anne Driscoll.

1907
03:15:16,584 --> 03:15:19,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have Anne on the meeting?

1908
03:15:25,079 --> 03:15:27,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Anne, I don't think you're here in person.

1909
03:15:27,440 --> 03:15:28,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Anne, are you on Zoom?

1910
03:15:31,783 --> 03:15:36,906
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion to... Yeah, what do you think?

1911
03:15:36,946 --> 03:15:38,867
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we just carry it over?

1912
03:15:38,907 --> 03:15:39,867
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just gonna carry it over.

1913
03:15:41,608 --> 03:15:45,811
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can just go to open public participation, name and address for the record.

1914
03:15:45,951 --> 03:15:46,731
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll have three minutes.

1915
03:15:46,791 --> 03:15:49,933
[SPEAKER_19]: You can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

1916
03:15:51,414 --> 03:15:53,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so Micah Hesselman, 499 Main Street.

1917
03:15:56,951 --> 03:16:07,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel compelled to come and make in person, many of the comments that I have emailed you all as a group collectively about over the

1918
03:16:09,228 --> 03:16:10,128
[SPEAKER_02]: last few weeks.

1919
03:16:11,389 --> 03:16:17,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's unfortunate because otherwise this has been a really pleasant City Council session with really fun, cool stuff.

1920
03:16:18,572 --> 03:16:28,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevertheless, we live in increasingly dangerous times with increasing federal overreach and lawlessness coming from our federal government.

1921
03:16:30,278 --> 03:16:30,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Every

1922
03:16:32,128 --> 03:16:48,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day, it feels like there is a new example of extreme federal overreach and blatantly illegal behavior that is continuing to go unchecked.

1923
03:16:49,061 --> 03:16:54,565
[SPEAKER_02]: It's increasingly becoming normalized, which is in and of itself horrific.

1924
03:16:55,490 --> 03:17:07,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We have secret police effectively that are roaming around picking up people without due process, without providing warrants, without providing any sort of judicial order.

1925
03:17:08,866 --> 03:17:19,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get flack about this, yes, there are certain situations where federal agents can make arrests without providing a warrant or lawful judicial order.

1926
03:17:19,550 --> 03:17:20,671
[SPEAKER_02]: They're incredibly narrow.

1927
03:17:21,151 --> 03:17:31,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And the very fact that they are pre-planning and premeditating these arrests means that they do not fall within those very narrow bounds of when they can

1928
03:17:32,535 --> 03:17:34,077
[SPEAKER_02]: do warrantless arrests.

1929
03:17:34,778 --> 03:17:42,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So by virtue of that alone, these people are acting in an completely illegal rogue state.

1930
03:17:43,106 --> 03:17:44,448
[SPEAKER_02]: They're effectively criminals.

1931
03:17:45,389 --> 03:17:50,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we're not going to get the police to commit to arresting criminals that have badges.

1932
03:17:52,135 --> 03:17:52,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

1933
03:17:54,858 --> 03:17:55,179
[SPEAKER_02]: However,

1934
03:17:56,648 --> 03:17:59,390
[SPEAKER_02]: there needs to be continued pressure for them to do something.

1935
03:17:59,770 --> 03:18:13,397
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be continued pressure for the mayor to do something and make some substantive statement and formulate and articulate an actual substantive action and policy beyond, we're not gonna cooperate with them.

1936
03:18:13,997 --> 03:18:17,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly non-cooperation means jack shit, okay?

1937
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:21,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Other cities, I will tone it down.

1938
03:18:21,461 --> 03:18:22,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Not the tone it down, but the swear words.

1939
03:18:23,242 --> 03:18:23,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will.

1940
03:18:25,075 --> 03:18:25,975
[SPEAKER_02]: use cleaner language.

1941
03:18:25,995 --> 03:18:26,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Kevin's gonna have to.

1942
03:18:27,176 --> 03:18:53,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Other cities, sorry, I don't wanna make anyone's transcription job more of a pain, with similar, if not identical, non-cooperation policies have nevertheless had their law enforcement cooperate, enable, facilitate, and even completely misinform the public about what federal agents can and cannot do.

1943
03:18:55,160 --> 03:19:11,118
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to have our police and our executive administration here in the city actually counter this narrative and say something affirmatively to reassure us as residents that we're not going to stand for this here in Medford.

1944
03:19:12,079 --> 03:19:13,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see more being done.

1945
03:19:14,021 --> 03:19:16,264
[SPEAKER_02]: The HRC reestablishment

1946
03:19:17,833 --> 03:19:23,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a wonderful surprise to me because I had not expected that and it's at least some.

1947
03:19:23,795 --> 03:19:28,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I mean it's meager steps forward but it's better than just treading water.

1948
03:19:31,317 --> 03:19:46,708
[SPEAKER_02]: would like to see more communication on a more regular basis from our chief of police that is specifically about what's going on in regards to ICE and federal incursions into our local space.

1949
03:19:47,969 --> 03:19:57,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, I think that every step, every stage of our government should be willing, our municipal government should be willing to

1950
03:19:59,721 --> 03:20:06,584
[SPEAKER_02]: tiptoe into great legal gray areas right now, because the other side is ignoring the law.

1951
03:20:07,705 --> 03:20:13,968
[SPEAKER_02]: The other side is literally talking about a suspending hobbyist corpus, which is crazy.

1952
03:20:13,988 --> 03:20:16,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and literally can't be done.

1953
03:20:17,589 --> 03:20:18,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that they need to anyway.

1954
03:20:19,130 --> 03:20:27,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, if there are certain actions that we decide to take as a community that are not

1955
03:20:27,875 --> 03:20:32,537
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal but not legally are in a legally ambiguous space.

1956
03:20:32,998 --> 03:20:34,658
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the end of the world.

1957
03:20:35,039 --> 03:20:41,922
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is to protect our neighbors and protect our residents, and we should be willing to take that risk and do what needs to be done to keep our residents safe.

1958
03:20:42,682 --> 03:20:43,603
[SPEAKER_19]: We're a little bit over.

1959
03:20:43,783 --> 03:20:44,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1960
03:20:44,523 --> 03:20:45,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Appreciate it.

1961
03:20:45,144 --> 03:20:46,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Appreciate the comment.

1962
03:20:46,905 --> 03:20:47,485
[SPEAKER_19]: I can just say

1963
03:20:48,712 --> 03:21:03,304
[SPEAKER_19]: As one Councilor, I have been communicating a similar message to the mayor and the chief of police, especially last week when we had federal masks, unidentified federal agents in the city, intimidating the public.

1964
03:21:03,764 --> 03:21:16,675
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we have this abuse of power and intimidation and essentially a form of extortion as well to extort our compliance with illegality, I don't think our response can be

1965
03:21:18,015 --> 03:21:19,116
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't do anything about it.

1966
03:21:19,556 --> 03:21:29,485
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally received communications from people asking me are, are these, who are these people, is there a criminal gang in my neighborhood.

1967
03:21:31,481 --> 03:21:34,183
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, and it's people are very, people are very scared.

1968
03:21:34,483 --> 03:21:52,094
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think and what we saw in Worcester last week, and how Worcester police handled that abhorrently, and is now pushing what I consider to be a pretty reactionary administration in the city of Worcester to consider a city policy about what the city will do in response to this.

1969
03:21:52,675 --> 03:21:57,538
[SPEAKER_19]: I think for folks who have said that they are

1970
03:21:58,763 --> 03:22:10,030
[SPEAKER_19]: on board with this, I think we need to be doing the same and have a very clear policy about this, how the city responds to federal intimidation and abuse of power, as well as informing the public about it.

1971
03:22:10,231 --> 03:22:15,794
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that public health and community safety brought up some of these concerns last week.

1972
03:22:15,814 --> 03:22:17,095
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you guys want to add anything.

1973
03:22:17,135 --> 03:22:18,296
[SPEAKER_19]: I see Councilor Lazzaro.

1974
03:22:20,277 --> 03:22:21,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1975
03:22:21,958 --> 03:22:24,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate this conversation.

1976
03:22:24,320 --> 03:22:27,822
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there is more discussion to have

1977
03:22:29,069 --> 03:22:52,370
[SPEAKER_11]: there are limitations to what our public safety officers will be able to do is my understanding, but I also know that we as local elected officials and local leaders have an obligation to

1978
03:22:53,942 --> 03:22:56,583
[SPEAKER_11]: do what we can to try to keep our residents safe.

1979
03:22:56,863 --> 03:23:00,204
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's been at the forefront of my mind for a long time.

1980
03:23:01,364 --> 03:23:05,265
[SPEAKER_11]: And that means like physical safety and psychological safety.

1981
03:23:05,926 --> 03:23:15,929
[SPEAKER_11]: So I continue to grapple with that, with how best to try to achieve that for our residents.

1982
03:23:16,369 --> 03:23:23,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that there's,

1983
03:23:24,253 --> 03:23:41,546
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely more to be done within our local government and in our communities and mutually not participate in the hierarchy of law enforcement because there are limitations to that.

1984
03:23:43,067 --> 03:23:50,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am thinking about how we keep each other safe all the time and all the ways that we do that.

1985
03:23:51,914 --> 03:23:53,275
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you for bringing this up.

1986
03:23:54,777 --> 03:23:55,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1987
03:23:57,459 --> 03:24:12,247
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I'm gonna watch the recording, see what was said, but what really frustrated me about what happened in Worcester, what I don't wanna see happen here is local police functionally being used to facilitate and protect people executing legally dubious or illegal orders.

1988
03:24:12,287 --> 03:24:17,490
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a serious, I think that's maybe a gap in the non-cooperation agreement that we have right now.

1989
03:24:18,010 --> 03:24:18,911
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Collins.

1990
03:24:22,506 --> 03:24:23,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bearson.

1991
03:24:23,607 --> 03:24:26,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a difficult topic to bring up.

1992
03:24:26,468 --> 03:24:29,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank the president for bringing it up, continuing to bring it up.

1993
03:24:31,451 --> 03:24:41,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking for only myself as one Councilor, this is something that is obviously, I'm sure I'm not speaking only for myself when I say this is something that is extremely preoccupying to many of us right now.

1994
03:24:41,797 --> 03:24:49,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're in uncharted territory relating to how a local government can and should respond

1995
03:24:50,622 --> 03:24:51,102
[SPEAKER_06]: to this.

1996
03:24:52,524 --> 03:24:58,428
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I think is unacceptable would be to say, because this is uncharted, we have no agency to chart our own path here.

1997
03:24:59,469 --> 03:25:01,771
[SPEAKER_06]: That would at least be unacceptable to me.

1998
03:25:01,791 --> 03:25:16,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the work ahead of us right now collaboratively throughout the entire government of the city of Medford is to craft a policy collaboratively so that we can all be sure that we are doing what we can to make sure that public safety in Medford

1999
03:25:17,443 --> 03:25:20,604
[SPEAKER_06]: is in every way directed towards public safety in Medford.

2000
03:25:20,864 --> 03:25:24,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of our very most initial conversations about this, obviously, it's a fraught topic.

2001
03:25:25,025 --> 03:25:27,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think that everybody's intentions about this are good.

2002
03:25:28,826 --> 03:25:36,948
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that we have to keep in mind that a response can look like a lot of things and be more helpful than what it is right now.

2003
03:25:37,789 --> 03:25:45,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there is a very... I think that, you know, it's kind of trite,

2004
03:25:47,332 --> 03:25:52,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Inaction is action, and I think that's what we have to be wary of when it comes to what we are declining to do.

2005
03:25:52,874 --> 03:25:58,555
[SPEAKER_06]: When it comes to our response to ICE and other federal agencies in Medford, we can't just do nothing.

2006
03:25:58,575 --> 03:25:59,755
[SPEAKER_06]: That's obviously insufficient.

2007
03:25:59,815 --> 03:26:01,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the resident said that very well.

2008
03:26:02,456 --> 03:26:08,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we have a lot of ordinary residents in the community that are taking on the work of

2009
03:26:11,042 --> 03:26:27,051
[SPEAKER_06]: figuring out what public safety looks like in this time when federal agents are coming into our community, barely letting even our chief of police know, certainly not letting other city leaders such as ourselves know, being in public property, being on residential streets, masked, unidentified.

2010
03:26:27,091 --> 03:26:30,093
[SPEAKER_06]: There's residents taking on the onus of saying, hey,

2011
03:26:32,834 --> 03:26:33,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Who are you?

2012
03:26:33,615 --> 03:26:34,356
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing here?

2013
03:26:34,376 --> 03:26:36,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this okay?

2014
03:26:36,318 --> 03:26:37,158
[SPEAKER_06]: This seems suspicious.

2015
03:26:37,198 --> 03:26:39,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make sure the people in the neighborhood are okay.

2016
03:26:39,701 --> 03:26:45,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Because our local government has not taken on the onus of doing that community safety work.

2017
03:26:45,166 --> 03:26:46,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that needs to change.

2018
03:26:46,167 --> 03:26:49,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to share that responsibility with the community, obviously.

2019
03:26:49,810 --> 03:26:54,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And we share the responsibility of, if ICE has been present in the community,

2020
03:26:55,135 --> 03:26:59,479
[SPEAKER_06]: using our official channels and our official power to say, what comes next now?

2021
03:26:59,519 --> 03:27:00,420
[SPEAKER_06]: What do people need now?

2022
03:27:00,480 --> 03:27:01,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Are people good?

2023
03:27:01,121 --> 03:27:01,701
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they need?

2024
03:27:01,721 --> 03:27:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they know their rights?

2025
03:27:04,084 --> 03:27:09,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there support that's needed in the wake of being visited by ICE?

2026
03:27:09,308 --> 03:27:10,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And it goes further than that as well.

2027
03:27:10,610 --> 03:27:12,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I think is really unacceptable is to say,

2028
03:27:14,353 --> 03:27:18,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Our responsibility is to do nothing and pretend that that's enough, because it obviously isn't.

2029
03:27:18,776 --> 03:27:31,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank community members for leading the way here, and I feel resolute that, frankly, city leadership needs to follow in the footsteps of residents who are already doing the work of figuring out what community safety looks like in this time.

2030
03:27:33,407 --> 03:27:35,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So the conversation has to continue.

2031
03:27:35,228 --> 03:27:35,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2032
03:27:37,329 --> 03:27:37,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2033
03:27:41,280 --> 03:27:45,483
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, we do have one item under unfinished business eligible for third reading.

2034
03:28:04,274 --> 03:28:05,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

2035
