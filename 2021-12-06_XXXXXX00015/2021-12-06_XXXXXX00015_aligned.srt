1
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:05,768
Hey, Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:11,631
On today's episode, I talked with Shannon Heaton, Medford resident, who is also a podcaster who plays Irish music.

3
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:19,534
I also talked with Max Heinig, English teacher at Medford High School, who is also an artist and musician and one of the founders of Medford Brewing.

4
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:25,916
There's a full version of this episode only available on Spotify that includes songs by each of today's guests.

5
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,076
I hope you enjoy.

6
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,977
All right, thanks so much for joining me today.

7
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:37,504
If you could just introduce yourself with your name and pronouns.

8
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,028
Sure, thanks for having me.

9
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:40,793
I'm Shannon Heaton, she, her.

10
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:41,494
Awesome.

11
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:47,986
So we'll get to talking about kind of your work and what you do in your professional life and personal life.

12
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:54,948
But the first question that I've been asking folks is what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to order there.

13
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,308
OK.

14
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:56,868
I don't know.

15
00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:57,829
Do I have to pick just one?

16
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,730
I love Tom Yum Goong right across from the post office.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,711
Great Thai food.

18
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,052
They make, of course, great Tom Yum, which is like a spicy soup.

19
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:13,116
But they also have lots of good renditions and variations of pad thai.

20
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:17,339
Pad thai bummy, all sorts of fun pad thai.

21
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:18,800
I've been there a couple times.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,081
I'm always in search of Thai food.

23
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,022
They're pretty good.

24
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,264
Awesome.

25
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:30,029
So yeah, if you could just get us started, kind of describe what you do and how you kind of arrived at this for yourself.

26
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,672
Long and winding road.

27
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:37,299
Well, I play Irish music in a duo with my husband, Matt.

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,142
I play Irish flute and I sing.

29
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:46,212
And I've organized Irish music events that bring together a lot of different people.

30
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:58,204
variety of ages, variety of levels, trying to make events and environments that are welcoming and accessible, especially to learners, to people who are new to the tradition.

31
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:00,706
But really, I love Irish music.

32
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:28,660
Yeah, so it's been really fun over the years to come up with ways to share that with a broader audience, but also to create opportunities for people within our community to really feel empowered to learn more, regardless of their level and their chosen way of participating, whether they want to be professional players or just learn a few tunes.

33
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,038
And why Irish music?

34
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:31,803
What led you to that?

35
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:48,006
Well, it's a tradition that I came to after having music in my life and traveling around a great deal and having Irish music in my family a little bit, but also living in Thailand.

36
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:51,228
Strangely enough, I got into this Thai music crew.

37
00:02:51,248 --> 00:03:00,273
And when I got back to the States, I really wanted to be part of this community music, this traditional music, where people would get together and teach each other tunes.

38
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:05,737
And I really couldn't find that in Chicago where I was living at the time in a neighborhood close to me.

39
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:19,947
And so I accidentally kind of lucked into Irish music and I found a lot of similarities in that just getting together and teaching each other and engaging as a social event above all.

40
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,049
So that's the appeal for me.

41
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,991
I mean also the music sounds great and it's really fun to play.

42
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,636
Yeah, I've listened to your, I've seen some of the stuff you've put on Instagram, listened to some of your music.

43
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:38,984
It's interesting, like, so Irish music by way of Thailand, and it sounds like the community aspect of the way that Irish music works in the community around it.

44
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:43,288
Have you found that in Medford, or what's the community like in Medford for that?

45
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:46,872
Well, we're very lucky here in Medford regarding Irish music.

46
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,153
We have some of the finest.

47
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:54,117
players around and a lot of their kids have ended up playing as well, which is really exciting.

48
00:03:55,098 --> 00:04:01,903
Ellery Klein, George Keith, Noel Scott, Martin Langer, so many fine musicians right here in town.

49
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:11,210
And you know, it's really exciting to get to play with fine musicians who are also just really kind, fun people.

50
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:12,451
Yeah.

51
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,473
Maura Shons-Ganlin, Connor Hearn, all living in Medford, all great musicians.

52
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,294
So Ellery was on the podcast a couple weeks ago, too.

53
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:20,894
Yeah.

54
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:21,414
Great.

55
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:39,441
Yeah, and you mentioned kind of like the child aspect, and we've had a couple episodes where we try to include like kids' voices and sort of think about like the benefit to children, and like we talked about Girls on the Run and how that, you know, what that kind of, the values that that sort of gives our kids, and I wonder if you can talk about like the

56
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:43,304
the impact on kids that you've seen with the music?

57
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:50,850
Well, I think the exciting thing, like the girls on the run thing, I mean, Eve is bringing together all of these girls to run together.

58
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:57,216
And of course, when you're doing one specific applied thing, you don't have to engage in conversation.

59
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:00,779
You don't have to, if you're outgoing,

60
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:07,041
or if you're the person who prefers to listen, you're all still engaged in the same thing.

61
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:16,585
So it's kind of a nice equalizer in a way, takes a little bit of the social pressure off maybe, and it paves the way for maybe then some social connections.

62
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:28,493
I think that's true with the Irish traditional music thing that for adults and for kids that it just is this it's something to do.

63
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:36,819
It's a way to enjoy life and then it can or doesn't have to forge these deeper relationships.

64
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:47,447
And it's cool, you can be best friends and play great Irish music together and you can not know each other or not even have a lot in common and still play very enjoyable music together.

65
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:54,592
So I think that's important for kids, I think, to learn is that maybe a skill and a pastime

66
00:05:55,773 --> 00:06:02,296
can be a good thing to engage in, that it can open the door to other deeper connections that can sustain you in different ways.

67
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,517
Sure, yeah.

68
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:12,802
I remember being in, I played some music in high school, I was in like a jazz band with kids I never would have met, like we never would have crossed paths otherwise, and I remember just sort of the

69
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:19,644
the lesson in like, if you don't practice when you show up at band, it's like not going to go well.

70
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:27,426
So like that's that sort of lesson and like a little bit of discipline and sort of wanting to like show up and be prepared and things like that.

71
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:29,867
So that felt like an important lesson for me with music too.

72
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:38,490
But yeah, no, that feels like a great just sort of life lesson there too with, you know, meeting different people and connecting in that way.

73
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:46,332
Yeah, I do think the discipline aspect can feel very stark and very obvious with, say, a musical skill.

74
00:06:47,493 --> 00:07:00,697
And it has been an interesting thing to balance for me, welcoming people into this tradition and making people feel welcome and encouraged and inspired and empowered to learn.

75
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:10,408
and to still not get hung up on performance aspects, not to feel too anxious about things being perfect.

76
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:14,574
I care about this music a lot, and I love it when people put a lot of time into it.

77
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,377
And maybe that's not all there is to it.

78
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:22,878
Yeah, that's important to hear, I think, like the balance of enjoyment with doing something well.

79
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,643
Yeah, I think that that can put people off for sure, that pressure.

80
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:27,944
Cool.

81
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,708
So I know you also have your own podcast.

82
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,550
So would you like to talk about that at all?

83
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,231
Sure.

84
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:52,499
Irish Music Stories is a show that I started five years ago after I received a grant from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, part of the Artist Fellowship Program that really helped me launch Irish Music Stories, which is the show about traditional music and the bigger stories behind it.

85
00:07:53,179 --> 00:08:00,422
Really, in my show, I try to take one central topic like immigration, parenting,

86
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:10,088
gender inclusivity, and I try to filter that through Irish music and dance lens.

87
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:27,979
So I'll talk to three or four different people about that one central topic, and I try to weave it all together, and then I try to have some big central story, something fun to listen to, like the story of a kid's journey to Ireland to compete in a music competition, for example.

88
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:39,425
Or when I talked about gender inclusivity and gender equality and balance, I took the story of the Benjamin Moore brothers, who are from County Monaghan.

89
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,566
You know, they make paints.

90
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:41,826
They made paints.

91
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:45,548
And so imagine that, telling the story of the paint company.

92
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:53,391
musing on gender politics through an Irish music lens and making it all accessible and really fun and poppy.

93
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:56,051
It's a really fun puzzle for me to work on.

94
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:57,252
So I've really enjoyed it.

95
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:12,816
But really, the central mission is just to make this living tradition of Irish music, of getting together to play these tunes and sing these songs together and learning them from each other, to just show that there's a lot behind that.

96
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:15,937
It isn't just a fun jig to tap your toe to.

97
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:16,377
Sure.

98
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:19,858
And what's been challenging about the podcast for you?

99
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:21,858
It's a lot of work.

100
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:31,641
And the deadline of publishing a podcast, as you know, weekly for yourself, for me monthly, can be relentless.

101
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:32,621
Yeah.

102
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,021
Yeah.

103
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:34,202
The deadlines.

104
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:34,482
Yeah.

105
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:35,282
A lot of work, too.

106
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:40,923
And that sounds like it's a big job to sort of synthesize all the ad information into one episode.

107
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,724
What's been rewarding about it for you?

108
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:56,492
Well, when I get together to play Irish music with folks, generally we play tunes, maybe sing some songs, and we talk about life.

109
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,254
We talk about our kids.

110
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,296
We talk about our neighborhoods.

111
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:03,679
We talk about where we've traveled recently.

112
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,543
We don't sit around and talk about music and how it feels to engage in Irish music.

113
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:10,203
We just do it.

114
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:25,392
So having a little bit of a pause with some of my peers to hear their thoughts about this music, about playing it, and really what it means to them, it's been incredibly illuminating and inspiring for me.

115
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:29,932
Sounds like a nice way to, or like a different way to connect with folks too.

116
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:30,713
Yes.

117
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:31,194
Yeah.

118
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:35,658
And so I guess I'm also, I'm always curious to sort of connect back to Medford and the community of Medford.

119
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:40,883
So what hopes do you have for like an impact on the community from the work that you're doing?

120
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:41,644
Yeah.

121
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:48,571
So I think anything, uh, any project that engages people, that empowers people, that brings people together.

122
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:50,837
Why not, right?

123
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:59,219
So Ellery Klein, with whom you spoke recently, she and I started this session in Somerville.

124
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:04,340
But it actually started in her home in Medford Heights, where I live as well.

125
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,821
And it was really, we called it the guided session.

126
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:15,023
And it was an opportunity once a month for players who are learning Irish music, or maybe they're on a second instrument.

127
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:20,569
to come together and play through some standard tunes, not too fast.

128
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,212
And that was a really wonderful thing.

129
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:27,837
You know, we did that for a couple of years until COVID suspended our activities.

130
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:31,702
And still getting wind players together indoors is a little tenuous.

131
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:35,166
And so we're not back in person yet, but we've continued it online.

132
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,530
And so that has felt really rewarding to me.

133
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:47,259
My friend Laura Cortese, who also lived in Medford for some time before she moved to Belgium, she and I started a festival called the Boston Celtic Music Festival.

134
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:49,802
And it's going on, I think, 18 years now.

135
00:11:51,344 --> 00:12:10,704
It's coming up in January and that too was meant to bring players who have a great skill and brand new players together, give people an opportunity to learn from each other, to play together, to just engage in something bigger than themselves.

136
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:14,266
and bigger than this one moment, right?

137
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:20,247
A living tradition is centuries strong, and it involves lots more people than you.

138
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:32,770
So no matter how great you play, or no matter how new you are, you're not that important in the continuum of Irish music, which can be really, kind of take the weight off, and it can give a little perspective, I think.

139
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:40,172
So I think engaging in something that's bigger than you, something that's fun to do, something that benefits from working together,

140
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:42,653
It doesn't matter what it is.

141
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:46,694
In my case, it's Irish music.

142
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:51,757
When I hear the word tradition, it evokes something a little scary.

143
00:12:51,917 --> 00:13:01,721
But to hear the way that you've infused some important today topics, like immigration and gender equity, that feels really cool.

144
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,042
That feels less intimidating.

145
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:15,430
Yeah, tradition can be a loaded word and a living tradition, I think, can just mean something that is older and more well-worn than any one generation.

146
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:29,139
And so it really is wide open to a nine-year-old playing with a 49-year-old and really having a deep musical connection and a lot of respect for each other and a lot of

147
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,742
love for this music that has brought us together.

148
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:42,628
And then sometimes you do, you know, you'll be playing with somebody and just, you both go into another tune together.

149
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:43,929
You didn't plan it.

150
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,770
You don't know how it happened.

151
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,133
I mean, that's like the bright side of tradition sparkling, I think.

152
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:53,716
The fact that this has been done before many times.

153
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:58,079
I think it doesn't mean that there isn't room for lots of innovation.

154
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,524
And lots of welcome for lots of new players and new approaches.

155
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:07,230
But it's existing material that then you can kind of find your own way.

156
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,033
Yeah, very cool.

157
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:14,120
Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about in your own work here?

158
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:25,978
You know, I love being able to play Irish music and being here in Medford with all these great fellow musicians and also being right next to the Fells.

159
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:38,602
I spend a lot of time in there and I have to say my podcasts have really come, and my music, my compositions, sometimes just to the energy that I have to perform and to teach.

160
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:43,287
has been fueled by my hikes and runs in the fells.

161
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:50,048
So I really am grateful to this area, this part of the world.

162
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,589
I'm grateful to my neighbors who have been highly supportive.

163
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:57,570
And wow, we now have a beautiful sidewalk going up to Wright's Pond.

164
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,111
Yes.

165
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:03,792
Thanks in no small part to Paul Donato for helping to move that along.

166
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:08,333
So yeah, I'm really happy to be doing what I'm doing in Medford.

167
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:09,293
It's a good home for

168
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:14,778
Sure, yeah, that was a scary section of road before the bond, yeah.

169
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:24,647
Yeah, no, I think that's like something that I've definitely taken away from doing this podcast is sort of the impact that the residents can have in a city like Medford.

170
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,071
And so I'm wondering, where can we find you?

171
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,113
Where can we find your music, your podcast?

172
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,276
Yeah, you can find all of it at Shannon Heaton Music.

173
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,023
And the podcast is on Spotify?

174
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,543
It's on all the things.

175
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:41,724
Yeah, just look for it.

176
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,525
Irish Music Stories and all the podcast catchers.

177
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,627
And you said the podcast comes out monthly.

178
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,488
Is there like a time of month to look out for it?

179
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:51,989
Yeah, it's the second Tuesday of every month.

180
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:53,269
Great.

181
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,870
Unlike your good podcast that's coming out weekly.

182
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,510
And how has that gone for you, putting the podcast together?

183
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,510
It's been great.

184
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:09,253
I mean, I think there's been a lot of benefits for me, I think, in just learning about the city in a different way and meeting so many people.

185
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:15,375
that I never would have otherwise met, but also hearing every time I talk to someone, they say like, oh, you should also talk to this person.

186
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:21,197
And so I just feel like the web of people that I've been able to connect with has been growing and it's really cool.

187
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:26,079
I mean, it definitely helps my sense of community and I hope others as well, but.

188
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,020
Yeah.

189
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,460
Indeed.

190
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:28,920
Awesome.

191
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:31,441
Well, thank you so much for joining me today.

192
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:31,882
Thanks.

193
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:32,622
Thanks for doing this.

194
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:32,882
Yeah.

195
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,422
Hopefully we'll connect again soon.

196
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:35,103
Yeah.

197
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:42,888
Thanks so much to Shannon.

198
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:48,450
You can hear more of her music and her podcast by going to her website, shannonheatonmusic.com.

199
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,490
Now on to our next interview.

200
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:56,912
All right, thanks so much for joining me today.

201
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,053
If you could just start by introducing yourself with your name and pronouns.

202
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:00,593
You bet.

203
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:01,413
I'm Max Heinegg.

204
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:02,454
He, him.

205
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:03,554
He, him, is.

206
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:04,364
Great.

207
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:11,818
So the first question I always ask people is what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

208
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:20,910
So I'm going to say that it's actually something that I've been needing in Medford since I started teaching here around 1998, which is I like to go to Amici's.

209
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:30,373
When I was in my early 20s, I used to go there at lunch and just basically get their pizza.

210
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:36,635
But now that I have kids who are 17 and 15, we continue to patronize them.

211
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,736
And they've always been really nice to me.

212
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,537
So I have a soft spot in my heart for their pizza.

213
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:43,518
for their kindness, but also for their pizza.

214
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:44,038
Nice.

215
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,898
Delicious.

216
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:46,399
Awesome.

217
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,139
So could you tell us a little bit about yourself?

218
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,120
And you're here to talk about your work with Medford Brewing.

219
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,400
Yep.

220
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,801
So I'm 48.

221
00:17:54,181 --> 00:18:01,964
I started out as a sixth grade teacher for five years at the middle schools, for five years.

222
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,944
And then I've been to high school for 19 years.

223
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,886
I do lots of different things.

224
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:09,826
I'm a recording artist.

225
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:10,587
I'm making records.

226
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:13,088
Almost 30 years.

227
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:16,671
I have a new record coming out in a couple of weeks, maxheinig.com.

228
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:26,439
New record is a series of adaptations of poems from the public domain that have turned into music and song, although traditionally I'm an original singer-songwriter.

229
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:29,562
I was in the Boston rock scene for quite a long time.

230
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,984
I'm a published poet.

231
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,447
My first book just won a prize and is coming out.

232
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:36,547
in March of 2022.

233
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:46,250
So I've been, you know, published in a bunch of different countries and published somewhere around 250 poems at this point.

234
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,711
I'm a music critic.

235
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,371
I'm a poetry critic.

236
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,552
I'm a restaurant critic.

237
00:18:53,452 --> 00:19:11,321
I've published a lot of different reviews of poetry books and basically I'm a writer, I'm a singer, I'm a guitar player, I'm a cook, and around like 15 years ago I discovered that I had a really big interest in making alcohol.

238
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:15,193
And then I read every book on the subject.

239
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:18,095
And I started to get competitive.

240
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:19,736
And I started entering beer competitions.

241
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:21,577
And then I started winning.

242
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:26,440
And then I decided I was getting really chubby from beer.

243
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:36,166
So I decided to take six years off of drinking and just brew and just pursue it from a perspective of giving it to people.

244
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:41,409
And around that time, maybe I'm jumping into the next topic, but

245
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,773
My daughter and a friend's daughter were hanging out.

246
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,895
We had a Halloween party where I provided the beer.

247
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,537
And he said, this is pretty good.

248
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,359
Have you ever thought about doing a company?

249
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,500
And I said, no.

250
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,022
And he said, well, we should.

251
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,203
And he was persistent.

252
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:58,224
And then we ended up around.

253
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:02,308
I guess at this point it was like five or six years ago starting Medford Brewing Company.

254
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:10,254
So I'm sort of, I dabble in a lot of different things, but my background is basically in language and in cooking and in music.

255
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:22,084
And my goal is to sort of bring everything together in one place where people can gather to enjoy the beers we make, to hear some music from local artists and to hear readings.

256
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:27,658
So that sounds like that's kind of what you're imagining for the space that's going to be opening in a few months?

257
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:28,079
Yeah.

258
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:38,749
It's a community-centered spot that's not open too late, that serves quality more than quantity, that's basically handmade stuff.

259
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,455
It's going to be on a seven-barrel system, so it's basically not that big, if you really think about it.

260
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:52,160
It's only about 10 times bigger than the pot that I have in my basement, where I've done all the prototypes for all the beers over the years.

261
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,745
And just, you know, I'd already created a poetry reading series at the Medford Historical Society that my company had sponsored.

262
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:22,235
then COVID hit and we are sort of, you know, it's on hiatus, but trying to bring it all together in one place where people can still hear their conversations like a toad or, you know, I love the lizard lounge, but quieter than the lizard lounge and just a comfortable place where people can gather to talk to their neighbors and their friends.

263
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:26,657
And, you know, selfishly, it's about a mile from my house.

264
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:32,801
So where were you brewing before you started this space?

265
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:50,210
So the first 10 years of brewing was all home brewing and in conjunction with like the Boston Homebrew Club, the Worts, W-O-R-T-S, W-O-R-T dot org, which is the liquid that you make when you combine grains and water and steep it and then you have to ferment it for it to be beer.

266
00:21:50,930 --> 00:22:07,897
So I was brewing in my basement and then we started doing, we tried to get someone to distribute our beer so I was making homemade batches and going into meetings and saying try my homebrew and eventually Atlantic Distribution liked it and once they okayed the homebrew stuff

267
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:13,221
We moved into contract brewing, which is distinct from gypsy brewing.

268
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:18,847
So gypsy brewing, you go in and you take over the space and you run the infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera.

269
00:22:19,768 --> 00:22:31,399
Contract brewing is you write a recipe and then you go in and you talk to them and then you go in on brew day and then you go in and you taste it before they can it and you make sure that everything's been done correctly.

270
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:32,139
So we've done that.

271
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,201
A series of different locations.

272
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:36,824
We started out in Nashville, New Hampshire at Great North Aleworks.

273
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:39,727
We then moved to Dorchester Brewing.

274
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,969
Then we were at Down the Road Brewing in Everett.

275
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,671
Then we were at Newburyport.

276
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:47,315
I think they're in Newburyport, but I just...

277
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:52,680
I'm having a mental moment where I'm forgetting the name of them, and it's not out of spite because I do love them.

278
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,461
And now we're at Ipswich.

279
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,624
So there's the one missing piece of that equation.

280
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:11,155
So we've been to five different locations, all with varying results, all with, as you might imagine, if you had like a chocolate chip cookie recipe and you gave it to five friends, even if they were skillful bakers or on the British Bake Off,

281
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:17,981
you'd end up with, you know, after they said bake, you'd end up with five different like, you know, things.

282
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:25,787
And it's all been, it's all been interesting to see the permutations and the various ways in which my beers have been made.

283
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:30,352
But we've done, I think at this point, eight commercial products and we're about to do our ninth this week.

284
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:31,533
So.

285
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:58,378
contract brewing It's an interesting process and involves talking to brewers and trying to get them to do what you want When everyone is very set in their ways Because everyone has their own ways of dealing with stuff, especially when they own the stuff like this is my million-dollar brewery and you're coming in here and you're like a home brewer and you don't really know what I'm doing in terms of say, you know pH management or stuff and I've been

286
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:08,032
out of my element a little bit initially, and I had to learn maybe more chemistry than I thought I would have to learn or more of the technical aspects of brewing than I would have thought.

287
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:16,000
Because my background, you know, as an English teacher and a hobbyist and a home cook, brewing is sort of akin to both baking and cooking.

288
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:20,545
So baking, as like we all know, is like if you mess up the temperature or the,

289
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:24,209
tablespoons of baking soda or powder you're gonna have a terrible situation.

290
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,172
But cooking there's more like latitude.

291
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:37,045
So with brewing it's like you can go with bigger flavors or more ingredients or more alcohol or more, you know, I don't know, more more cacao nibs or something or more raspberries.

292
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,546
You can cover a multitude of sins.

293
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:42,688
But at the end of the day, there's also sort of a technical component that can't be overlooked.

294
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,589
You have to add the right amount of salt.

295
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:47,550
You have to add the right amount of gypsum or calcium chloride.

296
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,131
And if you don't, your beer can end up tasting like baking soda.

297
00:24:54,613 --> 00:24:57,854
Have you had any big failures in that way or any beers that didn't work out well?

298
00:24:58,074 --> 00:24:58,334
Yes.

299
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:00,776
We won't say which place they came from.

300
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:08,640
But yes, there have been a couple times where things were done at really, you know, oddball temperatures.

301
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,163
And beer is, at lower alcohol levels, beer is sensitive.

302
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:15,865
And at higher alcohols, it's sensitive in different ways.

303
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:18,046
We generally make ales.

304
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:20,387
So the grape families of beers are divided into

305
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:25,610
room temperature fermented beers, which are ales, and cold fermented temperature beers, which are lagers.

306
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:33,955
And the idea is that basically most small time breweries like ours, we can't make lagers because it takes too much time in the brewery.

307
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:39,498
It occupies three to four weeks of a brewery, whereas a lager, a lager three, four weeks, and an ale can be done in five days.

308
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,699
If you dry hop it, it might be like 10, 12 days.

309
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:48,041
So when you're renting out your space to somebody, you don't mind Medford Brewing coming in because we're out of your hair in 10 days.

310
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:56,085
But if we came in and tried to make a clone of Budweiser or something, we would have to pay triple because we'd be occupying their tanks for like three to four weeks.

311
00:25:57,025 --> 00:26:06,313
So the mistakes we've made were probably, you know, a good portion were my fault, like trying to figure out, you know, I would say something like, all right, use this hop.

312
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:12,238
But I would know how much to add, but I might have neglected to look at how bitter that hop was.

313
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,963
So within hops, every hop has a number that's attached to it that tells you basically how bitter it is.

314
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:19,524
And they vary wildly.

315
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:27,450
to give you an idea like one could have a bitterness level of three and another one could have a bitterness level of like 18.

316
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:43,180
And so what you're doing when you're throwing it in by the pound is you could very quickly end up with making something that's just so bitter that it's undrinkable or the opposite where you haven't counterbalanced the malt sweetness and then you've got something that's cloyingly sweet.

317
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:47,023
So that's really like the balancing act that we do in recipe creation.

318
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:48,245
Sounds like chemistry.

319
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:50,166
It gets pretty boring.

320
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:50,906
Yeah, I know.

321
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:56,969
And has there been a favorite part of this for you?

322
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:04,512
Like last night, we were at the tree lighting, bumping into parents of kids that I taught 24 years ago.

323
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:08,434
And they were saying that they're happy for our success.

324
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:12,876
And to be honest, at this point, this has been an investment.

325
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,416
We're driving.

326
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:18,438
I'm driving a car that has 130,000 miles on it.

327
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:34,443
I'm not complaining because I have a car, but my point is like, you know, it's all invested at this point, and the building is about to happen, and the construction, and the renovation, and the proof has got to be in the pudding, and I have to learn how to do this on a larger scale.

328
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:41,205
But the exciting part is that we're doing something that's essentially very community oriented for the purposes of,

329
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:45,026
having more fun while we live here, like while we live.

330
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:49,307
Like I said, you know, I'm going to be 50 in a year.

331
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:52,809
I don't expect to live forever.

332
00:27:53,209 --> 00:28:03,812
And I want to do something that impacts the town directly, that is fun, but is also, you know, a little more cultural.

333
00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:05,733
So I'm not trying to open up

334
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:21,788
bar we know we're not trying to open up a place that's you know for its alcohol is complicated you know the Buddha the Buddha says brewers don't get into heaven so so I think about that you know I think okay Buddha

335
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:40,485
want to do something good with it and I want to make sure that people feel welcome at it and that's what's been fun is just connecting with the community and also just on a selfish level like it's it's really exciting to think of something in your car like I'm going to think of a beer that's

336
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:46,430
this color and that's this taste and that's this sweet or this this.

337
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,512
And then you you make it.

338
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:56,978
And that alchemy, you know, that real alchemy is really what I think every home cook and every home baker delights in.

339
00:28:57,098 --> 00:29:02,443
It's the same pleasure we all experience if we make something for people we love and care about and they eat it and they go, this is really good.

340
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:04,327
And then they want to know how you did it.

341
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:10,779
And you get to lord it over them and say, well, you know, I started out this morning and I milked the cow myself.

342
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,201
And it's like, no, you didn't.

343
00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:13,424
But yeah.

344
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:25,975
Well, I hear like an overlap in that sort of like creating something when you're talking about beer and also the space, right, like that people have created something, music or poetry or art that they're going to be able to bring into that space and share with the community.

345
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:29,115
I think that's something that Medford will really benefit from.

346
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:30,556
I'm excited to check it out.

347
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:36,597
Is there anything that you hope on a community level sort of like an impact for the community that will come out of it?

348
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:47,619
I'm hoping not only to see people's faces and to talk to them and share their stories and our stories, but to share the future of what the company is going to do together.

349
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:53,280
And I can't help but notice there's an anchor on the carpet here, which is on the front of all of our beers.

350
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,321
So I think that's insofar as things can be auspicious.

351
00:29:58,101 --> 00:30:02,402
I think that that's going to be really great because, you know, I have parent night tonight.

352
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:06,683
And I've taught over 3,000 kids in the community.

353
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:07,604
I've met a lot of parents.

354
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:10,565
I've met thousands of parents.

355
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:15,167
And ultimately, it's about feeling like you have some sort of connection to the place you live.

356
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:21,869
And this is a time in America where connections need to be made.

357
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,052
People need to be accepting and to have more conversations rather than fewer.

358
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,853
And I think a gathering spot will do that.

359
00:30:30,593 --> 00:30:40,844
And also just the contemplation of art, which takes us out of our own solipsisms, our own just egocentrism, our own sense of just, it's just me, me, me, my own problems, et cetera.

360
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,185
Like, we all have problems.

361
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:48,191
Was it that Rob Williams saying, like, everybody's fighting a battle you know nothing about.

362
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:51,995
Find an opportunity to listen to a good song together.

363
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:57,418
find an opportunity to hear someone read something that they wrote.

364
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,285
The poet laureate of Medford, Terry Carter, has done a really good job.

365
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:10,017
having all these events and being generous enough to invite me and some of the other poets to just get out and read for the kids.

366
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:16,901
And even if, you know, it's like 15, 20, 30 people, I'm not expecting that if we have a poetry reading at the brewery that, you know, there'll be lines out the door for the poetry reading.

367
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:19,202
They might just be there, you know, for the beer.

368
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:27,427
But, you know, people can sometimes be more receptive to, you know, a singer-songwriter they've never heard or a cellist or, you know,

369
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,771
you know, something like that, or a chess club if there's a pint involved.

370
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:32,411
Yeah.

371
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,294
I remember going to, what's it, is it Veggie Plant?

372
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:39,218
What's the one in Harvard Square that's Club Passime is also there?

373
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:39,418
Yep.

374
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:45,545
I remember going to see, like several times, an act that I was really excited about, and the opener was like amazing, right?

375
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:45,785
Right.

376
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:50,670
Like being there for one thing doesn't mean you're not going to really enjoy the exposure to something else.

377
00:31:50,890 --> 00:32:11,657
Exactly, that's the whole the whole beauty of like a well curated opening act if you pick somebody You know the artist isn't doing it because I know I'm like larger tours It's like well this person is a single or something but someone who you think that you know if they like you then they might like that and so I'm excited for the bully pulpit or the the curator aspect to say I

378
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:34,789
You know and I've participated in the West Medford open studios in the past and I brought my students to go do that I just think there's a real opportunity to have All the different pockets of people who are doing good things enter into not a more formalized dialogue But just a sense that we can we can talk to each other and do these things and you know by the time we get the the beer garden Operational, you know you can

379
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:44,950
go out in the back and have a saison, have a lager, and talk to somebody who's doing the open studios.

380
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,090
And then that afternoon, you can go over and you can buy their photographs.

381
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,371
And these are the things that eventually make this a better place to live.

382
00:32:53,091 --> 00:33:00,892
One of the things that we're always brushing back against with our students is they say, well, to do something exciting, I have to go to Arlington, or I have to go to Winchester, or I have to go to Cambridge.

383
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:03,893
And I think it's on all of us to

384
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:06,081
you know unless we're all just happy.

385
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:26,721
you know, having to go to those places, I think that there's an opportunity to have more things to do, and I'm starting to see them pop up more, especially as the, there is a sort of, I don't want to say demographic change, but there are a lot of young people moving into Medford, and with them, they bring energy, enthusiasm, and young children, and the children need to be entertained.

386
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:33,506
So they're out, like last night, there are all these people out with their kids, and the kids are dancing, and the parents are talking.

387
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:35,887
So I think that's a positive,

388
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:40,231
thing and we can all be a part of that positive change.

389
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:45,836
It's not going from negative to positive, it's going from having a little less to do to having a little bit more to do.

390
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:47,618
And from a musical venue standpoint, when

391
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:49,217
booksellers closed.

392
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:56,202
Not only did we lose a bookstore, but we also lost a place where you could go and bring your acoustic guitar and sing a song.

393
00:33:56,282 --> 00:34:00,726
And there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to have acoustic music in Medford.

394
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:05,849
We're not trying to have a death metal club where you can't hear yourself breathe.

395
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:13,615
We want to be respectful of volume and people's space, but I think music is integral.

396
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:15,657
Who doesn't love it?

397
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,940
Yeah, well, and you said we're not going from negative to positive.

398
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:27,708
But what I imagine this to be is a little more of going from kind of a state of being pretty disconnected from each other to sort of moving towards more connectedness.

399
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:32,533
So what can we expect in terms of a timeline if you have one for the opening?

400
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:35,276
So two months ago, we bought the place.

401
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,899
This week, we have applied for our permitting.

402
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,341
Last month was spent.

403
00:34:42,438 --> 00:35:00,191
getting the contractors and getting all the different moving pieces from plumbing to electrical to filling in holes in the concrete to planning the movement of our beer equipment, which we bought two years ago because we were ready to do this before COVID.

404
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:03,133
People have been very patient with us, especially our investors.

405
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:04,834
We've been storing the stuff at the Fifth Brewery.

406
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:09,377
The name that I just remembered is Newbury, is not Newburyport, it's Riverwalk in Newburyport.

407
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:11,338
And they have our gear there.

408
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:15,219
So we have to coordinate moving it in, installing it, the drains.

409
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,361
So the long and short of it is we're hoping to be open by the spring.

410
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:27,363
We need to be open within four to six months or else we're going to be losing money.

411
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:29,783
So we need to get going.

412
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:31,904
And we're certainly not.

413
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:50,516
trying to wait because you know we we want to wait for anything other than what needs to be done so the beginning things may not we might not have every bell and whistle initially it may be a little bit more spartan or i don't want to say industrial but it might be a little bit more bare bones

414
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,518
But we're hoping to do renovations in sort of two phases.

415
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:55,939
One is to get open and get going and serving the public.

416
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:06,127
And then two, to refine things and paint, you know, the unpainted areas and, you know, to finish the renovations.

417
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:07,668
So let's just say spring.

418
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:11,090
Something to be really excited about.

419
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,171
Awesome.

420
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:13,771
Is there anything else?

421
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:18,273
Is there any way we can track the progress or anywhere to follow Medford Brewing?

422
00:36:18,353 --> 00:36:20,594
So Medford Brewing is in a couple places.

423
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:24,055
So our Instagram tends to be not very posh.

424
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:28,097
And it doesn't feature any shots of my bare midriff.

425
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:33,521
Mercifully, but there will be pictures of you know, like stuff there.

426
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:52,500
We're on Facebook Because we're older than dirt and we're we have a website Although at this point I think that is more sort of telling you where the beer can be located And we also send direct emails to the 300 or so people from Medford who've invested in us but essentially Facebook tends to be where we do a lot of our communication both and

427
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,821
through Nick and myself individually into saying, hey, this is our new beer.

428
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:58,162
I went down to Ipswich and here's our new beer.

429
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:06,205
We're making a pastry stout that's going to be out before Christmas that's going to be around 8.5% alcohol made with vanilla beans and cacao nibs.

430
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,966
And it's going to be sweet and creamy and fireplace zipper.

431
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:12,453
But yeah, the announcements will be there.

432
00:37:12,473 --> 00:37:13,414
We won't be shy about it.

433
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:19,918
We'll be doing some publicity and some interviews with the transcript and stuff like that to keep everyone aware.

434
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:27,182
And if you go by 30-34 Harvard Ave, which is where we're located, there's a big sign on the front that says, coming soon.

435
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:30,585
And once we have something to report in terms of the changes, the sign will say,

436
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:51,020
You know, coming in a month or coming in, you know, it's conditional on on getting the permits and getting the work done, the floors and the ceilings and making sure the bathrooms are clean and, you know, that there's everything you would expect in a twenty five hundred and sixty foot square foot little microbrewery doubling as a taproom.

437
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:53,245
Well, it sounds really exciting.

438
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,146
Awesome.

439
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,527
Well, thank you so much for coming in today.

440
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:59,948
Is there anything else that you'd like to share before you go?

441
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:04,851
All I'd like to say is that there are going to be a variety of different beers, because I started out as a Belgian beer brewer.

442
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,432
And I then became a bit of a German beer brewer.

443
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:12,574
And then the last thing I learned how to make, because the market demanded it, was hoppy beer.

444
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:16,676
So I spent the last five, six years working on hoppy, hoppy, hoppy, hoppy, hoppy.

445
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:20,737
And I just want everybody to know that I also make cider.

446
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:32,131
We'll be making more than it won't just be an IPA place that it's going to have 8 to 10 taps and that there will always be stuff that varies in terms of strength.

447
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:35,354
in terms of sweetness, bitterness, and hoppiness.

448
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,235
So the IPA drinker will be happy, because we'll have your New England IPA.

449
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:40,736
But we'll also have lager.

450
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:45,398
We'll also have stuff that you can just have a beer and go back to what you're doing.

451
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:47,579
Everything won't be super strong.

452
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,060
There have been a lot of trends towards very hoppy, very bitter, and very boozy.

453
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:54,922
And we want everyone to know that there's going to be something for everyone.

454
00:38:55,162 --> 00:39:10,410
yeah and cider it sounds like for the gluten-free people which is important any alcohol free option I think they were going to be looking into making a sarsaparilla like a root beer beer there's a bunch of sarsaparilla essentially like in the fells so I'm going to be looking at trying to do

455
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:17,195
I feel a little bit complicated about soda, just because everything is caloric, and if you have a soda every now and then, it's no big deal.

456
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:21,098
But I do need to think of a non-alcoholic beer.

457
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:22,979
We can also make an NA beer.

458
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,721
You just make a hoppy beer, and then you heat it up.

459
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:29,324
Once it's hot enough, the alcohol evaporates, and then you've got an NA beer.

460
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:32,167
So we'll be probably designing one of those, too.

461
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:35,249
But it's going to be a variety of stuff.

462
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,091
It's going to move seasonally, and it's going to be connected to local business.

463
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:47,137
So if there's, say, you know, Wink Wink, a local coffee roaster, then there'll be a coffee beer, you know, in the fall and the winter, and so on and so forth.

464
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:53,421
We're going to do things artisanally, seasonally, and if there's a popular staple, there'll be a popular staple.

465
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:54,882
And we're also looking at having

466
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,103
a beer that'll be a little bit more affordable.

467
00:39:57,503 --> 00:40:05,487
It'll just sort of be like just a standard regular beer for the person who's not the craft beer enthusiast who's just like, I just want a beer, man.

468
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:06,267
Can I get a beer?

469
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:07,388
And be like, well, this is a beer.

470
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:12,670
Just a yellow, fizzy, tastes like bread, middle-of-the-road type thing.

471
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,112
And we're going to be designing that over the winter break.

472
00:40:17,092 --> 00:40:18,133
It's very exciting.

473
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:19,814
Well, Max, thanks so much for being here.

474
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:20,734
Thank you so much.

475
00:40:20,894 --> 00:40:23,215
Yeah, and we're excited to see how things turn out.

476
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:23,795
Awesome.

477
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:24,476
Hope to see everybody.

478
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:32,769
