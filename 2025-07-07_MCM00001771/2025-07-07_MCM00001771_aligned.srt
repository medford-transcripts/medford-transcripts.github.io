1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:00,511
Thank you.

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,397
OK, we're going to start the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

3
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:16,542
Today is Wednesday, April 2nd, and I'm going to call the meeting to order for attendance.

4
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:18,684
Kayla?

5
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:19,484
Here.

6
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:20,645
Roberta?

7
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:23,907
Carrie?

8
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:29,091
Carrie informed me that she will not be able to join the meeting.

9
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:32,855
Penny?

10
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:33,455
Here.

11
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:34,916
Lisa Sun?

12
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:35,956
Here.

13
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:38,957
Madam Mayor?

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,459
Here.

15
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:43,859
Here.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,180
And myself, Lisa, we're here.

17
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:57,724
So if there are no edits to the meetings from February 5th, 2024 meeting minutes, excuse me, from February 24th,

18
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:04,578
February 5th, 2024, I'd like to request a motion to approve the minutes.

19
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:09,841
I so move the motion to approve the minutes for February 5th, 2025.

20
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:11,842
Second.

21
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:17,726
Okay, we'll do a roll call.

22
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:18,507
Kayla?

23
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:19,308
Aye.

24
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,769
Roberta?

25
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:22,250
Here.

26
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,490
Penny?

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:23,690
Yes.

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:23,811
Lisa?

29
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:23,991
Sun?

30
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:24,151
Yes.

31
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:29,676
Madam Mayor?

32
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:31,057
Yes.

33
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:41,745
Mayor Brianna?

34
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,347
Yes, can you hear me?

35
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:46,869
Yes, now we can, thank you.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,033
And myself, yes, Lisa.

37
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:56,497
So motion approved to pass the minutes from February 1st.

38
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:05,827
Okay, we've got the next item on the agenda is funding application guidelines and frameworks.

39
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:13,050
Kayla has an update for the developer's application from form based on the last board meeting.

40
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,391
Kayla, would you like to give an update?

41
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:15,951
Of course.

42
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:21,994
Aditi, do you have, maybe we could start with the application package?

43
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:27,136
Yeah, just a minute.

44
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:29,337
Here you go.

45
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:34,275
Can everybody see my screen?

46
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:36,456
Yep.

47
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:36,816
Yes.

48
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,056
Yep.

49
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:44,798
So these are mostly edits that we talked about during the last meeting.

50
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:48,559
Main edits will start on page three.

51
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,420
Yes.

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,662
Here we added a total row at the bottom for sources.

53
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:08,060
We made some changes of language when we talked about the targeted populations.

54
00:03:11,902 --> 00:03:20,286
And then if you look at the next page, the unit composition, we updated this.

55
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:27,570
So now we have a total column, a 30% AMI column and lower, a 60% AMI column and lower,

56
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:38,867
80, 100, and then we just have the other with the ability for them to fill in, and then a market rate column.

57
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:44,910
And then we did add, I think also I added SRO, which is single room occupancy.

58
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:56,055
Below, we talked about accessible units planned by unit type, and note the affordability which we can type in period proposed.

59
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,343
I think those were the main changes.

60
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:14,428
I think the only other changes I identified in the attachments under number three, under community need, I also included a link to Medford's comprehensive plan in addition to the housing production plan.

61
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,870
Thank you for making those edits.

62
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,510
I'll move approval.

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,365
Okay, and we will do a roll call for approving the funding application.

64
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:34,985
Kayla?

65
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:35,526
Aye.

66
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:36,747
Roberta?

67
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,327
Aye.

68
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:41,010
Carrie's not here.

69
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,752
No, Carrie's here, right?

70
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,154
No, Carrie's not here, sorry.

71
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:46,275
Penny?

72
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:46,895
Yes.

73
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:49,697
Lisa Sun?

74
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:52,980
Yes.

75
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,841
Madam Mayor?

76
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:53,921
Yes.

77
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:01,483
and I approve motion to approve the development application.

78
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:05,289
Great.

79
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:12,600
And then I also put together, and I don't think this has been circulated yet, a very brief notice of funding availability.

80
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:26,603
Um, again, I tried to keep this very brief and really almost completely exclusively did not include any priorities or how we're really going to rank or decide criteria.

81
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:36,031
Um, so just trying to say, yeah, this is for creation or support or preservation of affordable housing, uh, for 2025.

82
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:44,576
I also left the amount blank because, you know, we might need to talk internally if we need to hold funds for other reasons.

83
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:50,718
You know, did a very brief overview of what eligible activities are.

84
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:57,721
Reference the housing production plan, the comprehensive plan, and the community preservation plan.

85
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:06,445
Reference the fact that the funds do include Community Preservation Act funds and would be required to comply with those requirements as well.

86
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:21,730
Didn't know if we were going to plan on having non-CPA funds for this round or if we were just going to be using our CPA funds and kind of not count on any other sources for the 2025 round.

87
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,995
So if that's all we're going to use, we could remove that comment.

88
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:34,187
And then talk about that the affordable units created should have a use restriction that's going to continue in perpetuity.

89
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:37,955
I think that's fairly the norm at this point anymore.

90
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:43,678
Maybe just stop there if there's any questions up to that point.

91
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,058
Yeah.

92
00:06:44,238 --> 00:07:00,241
Minor suggestion that where it says requests will be evaluated with respect to the criteria that are consistent, we could add a sentence at the end of that paragraph stating that a affordable housing trust action plan is anticipated in the summer of 2025.

93
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:00,702
Okay.

94
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:01,642
Yeah, that's great.

95
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:05,683
I had a question.

96
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:16,842
Because I see, and I love seeing rental assistance and direct assistance activities here, but realize we have not set up the framework for evaluating those.

97
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:23,184
So I'm wondering if that is a goal to develop that and approve something like that at the next meeting.

98
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:32,148
If so, I can assist with that, but otherwise I just kind of, within the scope of this, I'm just naming that I see those and we haven't set up

99
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,522
that part of the process yet.

100
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:36,843
No, yeah, that's, that's absolutely true.

101
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:48,209
I thought we should at least, I was wondering whether we should include it, because I thought, you know, depending on what we say in the action plan would probably guide if we're going to try to talk about that.

102
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:55,712
But then again, this application is really just based for a specific kind of project, a specific kind of request.

103
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:04,747
I think this is a big topic that needs further discussion.

104
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:16,275
Maybe for this NOFA, we want to just focus on development projects and add the potential for affordable housing programs in the future.

105
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:22,999
And among our group, that's a big area for discussion.

106
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:31,382
Yeah, so then I might make the adjustments on the first paragraph where we specifically say rental assistant requests.

107
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:40,687
Although I think that that could be that can encompass more than just direct assistance, but definitely in the eligible activities.

108
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:50,672
Maybe reduce that to just the first pre development activities, development activities, housing preservation and improvement activities.

109
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:54,338
And then cut the last sentence, last part of that paragraph.

110
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,900
Can we scroll down and see that?

111
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:58,321
Yes, thanks.

112
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:02,365
So just actually, sorry, can you go back up?

113
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:05,147
I was referencing that.

114
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,710
Yeah, that first paragraph.

115
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,430
Thank you, sorry.

116
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,071
Yep, it's okay.

117
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:16,527
Yeah, I'm just sorry if I could direct response through the chair.

118
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:30,256
I do think it's like, there are a lot of different things like to Roberta's point, like we're learning a lot and we're about to hear a lot of the feedback that we've been getting and ideas that, you know, that we're having to respond to that feedback of what people need.

119
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:42,123
And I think those, yeah, setting the structure to be able to evaluate those when we are setting up, you know, I think it's a slightly different timeline, which needs to align with the

120
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:49,039
Erika Endrijonas-Nova, COB]: Action plan I, but I speak for myself, I guess, when I say I think it's a foregone conclusion that we would.

121
00:09:49,059 --> 00:10:00,545
Erika Endrijonas-Nova, COB]: find help find affordable housing development projects in Medford as part of our action plan right, so I don't that I don't know why, but I feel like comfortable cutting that for this.

122
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,204
I just want to make sure that I heard you correctly, if you don't mind.

123
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:20,139
It sounds like you are comfortable with striking anything with rental assistance, any programmatic, anything referencing programmatic.

124
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:37,286
funds in this particular NOFA because this NOFA sounds like we're really anticipating developers coming and not agencies coming to ask for funding.

125
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:55,276
It sounds that is what I am saying, based on what my understanding is, it's like we're releasing this in April with the deadline of like June 30 and just like like for a side or kind of on the topic one idea that needs to come up again.

126
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:56,297
It's like support for.

127
00:10:56,918 --> 00:11:03,244
aging in place, monies and like all the pieces that would need to go into thinking through how that works to get applications.

128
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:05,947
And then I don't know, I feel like we're just not there yet.

129
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:10,291
And so that's why I feel comfortable for this, having that more specific is what I'm saying.

130
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:10,751
Perfect.

131
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:11,472
Thank you.

132
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:20,180
I just want to back that up by saying that the rush to get this application out is because we understand that there are

133
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:25,330
developers who are anxiously waiting for these funds to become available.

134
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:32,014
And the CPC already funded housing stability programs in FY25.

135
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:43,842
So the funding that's available, like the 250,000 that came to the trust is in addition to 100,000 that went to housing stability funds already this year.

136
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,285
So I think like in the future,

137
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:57,225
It's up for discussion how we're going to arrange the relationship between the CPC and the trust with respect to housing stability programs.

138
00:11:57,285 --> 00:12:00,906
But for just this round, this is where we are.

139
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:01,726
Yeah.

140
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:03,587
Lisa would like to make a question.

141
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:11,549
Do we have a date anticipated that we'll be providing a decision on the funds?

142
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:15,710
I wonder if that's helpful for any developers that have

143
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:19,964
like time sensitive funding needs?

144
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:22,545
Yeah.

145
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:27,107
So, um, right now I don't have a specific date in mind.

146
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:33,050
I did have a pretty tight deadline of saying that we wanted full applications in by June 30th.

147
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:43,715
Um, and then I said just kind of a, generally we're going to review those submissions during the summer of 2025 may request additional information or presentations to the board.

148
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:49,594
And then funding decisions will be issued thereafter following a majority vote for each application.

149
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,555
So, no, I don't.

150
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:51,935
I don't have a date.

151
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,816
I think we can certainly discuss here if we're comfortable putting a date on that.

152
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,918
I think if memory serves correctly, and I can look back, oh, we don't have.

153
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:09,043
I think it was discussed at the last last month's meeting and matches me matches meeting.

154
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:13,808
Yeah, we, we did a quick little timetable of what was going to happen.

155
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:23,660
Unfortunately, I don't have my notes from that meeting, but we sketched out a timetable where if the application is coming in June.

156
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:41,008
We talked about whether or not we were gonna want the developers or the applicants to come and make a presentation to the trustees, and then whether or not we would deliberate at that meeting and then make a decision.

157
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:50,054
So I think we did a timeframe, don't quote me on this, but we're looking more like in August maybe,

158
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:58,959
in June, July they come in, August probably a vote.

159
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:11,291
But I think we also talked about those two months having to make special meetings because most people have, we take off the summer is my recollection.

160
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:14,594
So we're talking late, talking August, September maybe.

161
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:28,868
Just to add to Nisa's comment, I think the developer who requested these funds is expecting a decision to be made by late summer, early fall.

162
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,089
Yeah.

163
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:33,890
Can I ask a question?

164
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,952
It's my first NOFA, so I'm wondering if we need to be more specific

165
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:45,514
You know, if we think we might have another note in 2025, who knows, right.

166
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:53,884
Do we need to say for like spring 2025 or like say a specific time period in the like at the top and then named in it.

167
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:58,150
I'm just wondering for like that matters or if we can

168
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,972
I don't think it's matters, but it's helpful.

169
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:05,116
That way we can keep track of the NOFRs that we send out.

170
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:05,756
Great.

171
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:06,417
That's helpful.

172
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:15,824
And through you, I think, I mean, it says for fiscal year 2025, which of course, like opening this is reflecting monies we've gotten for fiscal year 2025.

173
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,245
So that makes total sense.

174
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:23,350
But yeah, I would love to have that specificity just for our records and quick glance to know.

175
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,150
that would be helpful.

176
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,511
Thank you.

177
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:25,091
Yep.

178
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:25,852
Okay.

179
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:44,304
So a specification that this will be our spring NOFA 2025, and then also under the overview, say specifically it'll be for the spring NOFA for fiscal year 2025, a certain amount is what we're going to allocate to this NOFA process, this first NOFA process.

180
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:44,845
Yes.

181
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:45,265
Okay.

182
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:46,706
All right.

183
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:52,110
So I've got removing the direct assistance, kind of making it specifically a,

184
00:15:53,559 --> 00:16:03,906
development specific notice of funding availability, making it clear that it's our first round and that there may be other rounds, but leave that open.

185
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:04,126
Yeah.

186
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:05,107
Okay.

187
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:05,687
Yeah.

188
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:06,367
That sounds great.

189
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:09,049
And then I, last thing is I put in priorities.

190
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:17,435
If we're not ready, I think perfectly fine to just take it out and I'll reference the upcoming action plan as where we would list our priorities.

191
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,188
And just, I want to go back to Lisa's question.

192
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:27,451
Lisa, did you want something in the NOFA that says anticipated decision dates?

193
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:37,055
I was just thinking some developers might have time sensitive requests.

194
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:45,319
So I know this is a very specific push to help one particular developer.

195
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,840
So it might not be as

196
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,126
relevant.

197
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:56,934
But I think if we know we're going to have a decision by early fall, maybe that is a good enough time frame to put down just fall 2020 or early fall 2025.

198
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:21,545
I just, unfortunately, I don't have my notes in front of me, but I recall at the last meeting, we did spell out exactly what the timeline was going to be.

199
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:29,049
So I wonder if that is in the minutes for the last meeting, not the one that we have minutes for today.

200
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:39,795
Because I just want to make sure that we actually schedule the meetings over the timeline that we need to in order to make the decision in the timeline that we

201
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:47,618
Because we kind of figured out there was exactly, we went through saying the exact same with the action plan.

202
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:49,339
Like everything was like fast forward.

203
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,300
I've got some of it.

204
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,043
Um, and maybe we'll go through month by month, make sure that that is conforms with everyone's recollection before you move on.

205
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:58,984
So this one is April.

206
00:17:59,264 --> 00:18:01,745
Um, it was going to be our goals and the SNOFA.

207
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:07,968
Um, I've got May is talking about guidelines and procedures.

208
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,881
June, a draft of the action plan.

209
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:18,562
And I think this is a present to the council, city council.

210
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,222
Developer presentation.

211
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:22,183
Oh, sorry, developers presentation.

212
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,043
Yeah.

213
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:25,663
And we're going to have a public meeting.

214
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:26,844
Was that going to be in July?

215
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:28,764
I have a July meeting.

216
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:29,844
Community meeting.

217
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:33,605
And so that was going to be like where we were going to take July off.

218
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:36,466
We'll have a community meeting instead of taking it off.

219
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:36,846
Yeah.

220
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:37,686
And I think I have

221
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:41,240
July 16th as our draft date for that today.

222
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:48,282
I think maybe post that, there was going to be a report to the city council on the plan plus comments from the public.

223
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:51,783
And in August, it would be approving the draft plan.

224
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:58,504
And I have the only note I have right now is a decision in August, which I think might be.

225
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,505
OK, so that's the answer.

226
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:03,906
We'd be making a decision, say, by September 1.

227
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:05,466
Yeah, by September 1.

228
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,457
Okay, and I think we picked in a tentative date of August 6th.

229
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:12,958
To the chair.

230
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,178
Okay, great.

231
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,199
Yes, can I ask a question?

232
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,002
Is there any stuff of like, we're viewing applicants.

233
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,564
Or is that a decision meeting?

234
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:27,466
Yeah, I think there's some amount that will be decision meeting.

235
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:29,907
I think that's a good question.

236
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:34,910
If we should do like a subcommittee of like, a really deep dive into the application, it is going to be.

237
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:40,958
fairly dense, depending on how much of the attachments and things.

238
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:47,999
Yeah, I don't think we did talk about procedures on how the applications were going to be reviewed.

239
00:19:48,019 --> 00:20:03,062
And I just took for granted, and maybe this is me, that trust staff would be the one reviewing the application, evaluating the application, going back to the developer if there was any missing applications.

240
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:04,422
So the developer would be,

241
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:18,860
or developers, let me rephrase that, would be coming to the meeting with a complete application and a presentation that would be made and the material that we get

242
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:29,002
for that meeting decision would contain the application, it would contain the performers, it would contain a write-up from the trust staff.

243
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,883
Sorry, Aditi, if I'm assuming an awful lot.

244
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,164
No, no, that's fair.

245
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:42,868
But given the transitions, I'm just trying to see who would be in my place, who would be reviewing these documents.

246
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:45,069
And it's slightly tricky.

247
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:47,731
I don't know how that's going to move forward.

248
00:20:49,343 --> 00:21:09,271
It might be safe to have at least one member of the trust board take that responsibility, hopefully with staff support, but we know that somebody owns it, even if the staff support is not up to speed yet.

249
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:10,192
Yeah.

250
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:11,572
Agreed.

251
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:18,266
I don't think this throws off any other parts of the timeline.

252
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:37,065
I do think we can clarify more of the same guidelines and procedures, but I do agree that kind of tapping someone who has that role and then, you know, that doesn't have to delay this going out, but that we figure that out in the more detailed timeline over the summer will be a step in the right direction for setting that up.

253
00:21:43,175 --> 00:22:02,529
And then if I may, through the chair, I'd just like Lisa's point that we outline, even if it just says fall, when we will be awarding monies to developers, because it would be nice if we do a press release, either through the city or

254
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:18,001
and the city can support it, make sure we publicize and are transparent so everybody has, you know, the information and all developers that are gonna help with affordable housing have a shot to apply.

255
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:22,985
Yeah, great, yeah.

256
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:32,773
Do we wanna add for May's meeting to talk about the actual evaluation process and

257
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,686
who is able to assist trust staff with reviewing the application.

258
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:43,989
Do we want to add that to our May's agenda?

259
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:45,971
Yes.

260
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:46,491
Yes.

261
00:22:47,392 --> 00:22:47,612
Yes.

262
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:54,218
Can we add some sort of press into one of our June agenda?

263
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:09,463
I was going to say, I mean, uh, Mary, you reminded me about city support for getting the word out if they're a stick again, my 1st note, but is there a standard places?

264
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:10,344
These are posted.

265
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:13,527
So, just in terms of that outreach to let you know about it.

266
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:24,250
I think once we're ready to push out the application process, we can do social media, press release.

267
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:28,772
It can be in the Planning, Development and Sustainability's newsletter.

268
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:30,573
It can be in the city newsletter.

269
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:35,635
There's a number of different avenues, depending on how far of a reach we want.

270
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:40,377
Does it get posted in any newspapers?

271
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:48,906
Does Medford have a regular newspaper, like actual newspaper that would go in a public notice?

272
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:50,786
Because I know that we post.

273
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:54,227
Well, I think that we posted now with the summer goal in Medford.

274
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,128
So I think, was that covered?

275
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,108
Yeah.

276
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:05,970
I was also going to suggest our stakeholder list that we included in our plan development.

277
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,112
We can make a contact list that would include them.

278
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:15,234
I'll also say I think this is your great idea.

279
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,676
We heard from folks who attended that meeting, how they heard from it.

280
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:22,319
And I just want to say like city outreach, it sounds like turned a lot of people out for that meeting.

281
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:23,660
That's where they found out about things.

282
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,645
So thank you for that support and getting the word out and let's use them again for more things.

283
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:30,085
Thank you.

284
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,918
Yeah, we put the last one at that meeting in a robocall too.

285
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:43,572
So I'm not sure if we'd do that with this, but we will look at all avenues.

286
00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:55,819
The chair may move on to the application process and schedule.

287
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,404
I've got a couple notes in here already, but we could start looking at that.

288
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:07,034
So just says this NOFA and the supporting application was distributed to the public on a certain date.

289
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:16,542
full applications to be submitted, electronic deferred, blank for the address at which they will be receiving it.

290
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:24,648
And then I just say that they will be reviewing the submissions during the summer of 2025, and they request additional information or presentations.

291
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:29,092
Funding decisions will be issued thereafter following a majority vote.

292
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:34,036
Based on these comments, I will put in here specifically early fall 2025, or do you want to say by September 1st?

293
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:41,431
I kind of leave it a little open early fall if you don't mind.

294
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:48,001
Yeah, early fall sounds like a good time just to relieve us from a little pressure and make sure we do it right.

295
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:48,962
Yeah.

296
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,462
Um, the next paragraph was something I did see in a bunch of other NOFAs.

297
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:58,144
I'm not sure it's going to be applicable here, but I thought we at least leave ourselves this room.

298
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:12,091
This is to, if we need to vote to retain certain outside consultants that could provide information analysis to assist the trust and that we may, um, request reimbursement from the applicants for such costs.

299
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:18,094
And then the last paragraph on the next page, um,

300
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:25,153
Again, kind of a form statement, but just talking that they're going to have to execute some sort of grant agreement with the trust.

301
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:28,618
It's going to memorialize the terms and conditions of the trust funding.

302
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:36,889
And I also just say that the funds may also be made available as a deferred payment loan that is secured by a mortgage and a promissory note.

303
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:41,366
We haven't talked about terms in the past.

304
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:52,770
A deferred payment loan is no payments being made, but if we're doing, I've seen trusts do cashflow payments, monthly interest.

305
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,372
Are we going to do a 0% loan?

306
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:01,493
Are we going to do a low interest loan?

307
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,855
Yeah, it's sort of, I think, should we just say maybe

308
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:11,681
may be made available by loans that are secured by, and then we'll leave that open to the next meeting.

309
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:19,643
And if we're going to do the loans and mortgages, I would maybe say a recorded restriction.

310
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:21,584
Yeah.

311
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:24,545
Affordable housing restriction.

312
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:49,928
I just wanted to suggest that maybe we also need to add to the agenda for one of the next two meetings draft terms and conditions so that we have that ready when we are ready to award a grant.

313
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,671
To have it reviewed by whatever

314
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:58,546
legal body we need.

315
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:02,850
I guess I just was hoping to get some clarity on the turn of phrase.

316
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:08,996
I know you said you saw it in some others about using outside consultants to get information.

317
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:14,461
Is there a situation where we would do that before we ask the applicant for more information?

318
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:14,881
I don't know.

319
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:27,661
Like without the application involved, because I don't know about like springing a bill on an applicant or something that wasn't part of the, I don't know, I just want a little more clarity on like, when it can be used or like, we want to include it.

320
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:33,025
So the examples I saw, I believe were, you know, like an appraisal.

321
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,647
So like a third party appraisal.

322
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,529
I'm trying to think the other one.

323
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:44,473
But I agree with you, I think we would always ask.

324
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:48,396
The developer first to explain any information.

325
00:28:48,416 --> 00:29:08,315
Okay, so this is from Wareham Affordable Housing Trust, including but not limited to cost of appraisals and the cost of an outside housing consultant reviewing an applicant's financial statements.

326
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:17,553
So I think it's just if there's this very specific thing that we as a body don't have a collective expertise in.

327
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:30,905
But I think you're right, it would be a little presumptuous to just hire them without talking to them first and then billing them later for services.

328
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:34,721
One would assume that that would happen.

329
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:40,428
We would hire consultants after we made the award.

330
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:45,854
I think this was actually supposed to be an app, like a review of the application.

331
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:52,772
Well, through the chair, it sounds like an example you just gave, like, maybe they didn't have the expertise.

332
00:29:52,792 --> 00:30:02,618
So maybe a question for us is, like, do we feel like there are going to be areas in this application that we lack expertise to evaluate and would want that?

333
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:08,861
Maybe I'm just kind of wondering about this turn of phrase, and it's like, it's just in there, and everyone uses it.

334
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:13,484
But I'm just, like, genuinely curious if we are anticipating anything like that now that it's been brought up.

335
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:20,268
Yeah, I'm trying to think of like an example.

336
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:33,776
We can't just put it in there, just to cover our examples that come up.

337
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:36,477
I mean, because you could do, excuse me, I'm sorry.

338
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:46,803
You could do a conditional, we could have the presentation, blah, blah, blah, do a vote on a conditional approval.

339
00:30:47,637 --> 00:31:13,428
that these items, whatever the ones that we sort of flagged that we may need additional assistance, that these items, let's say a financial audit of the developer's financials, upon review of financial audits, and that way they know that it's gonna happen and it could be reimbursed.

340
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:16,090
I mean, I'm just thinking of

341
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:21,379
You don't know what you don't know until you see what you have.

342
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,620
Does that make sense?

343
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:33,923
How about we could add the trust me vote after consultation with the applicant to retain certain services.

344
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:40,086
So at least we're telling them that we'll give them notice before we actually hire anyone to do anything.

345
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,806
Does that make sense?

346
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:42,586
I'm not too sure.

347
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,187
I feel like that sounds like that.

348
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:45,347
Thank you.

349
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:10,106
Oh, and then my last comment here is whether it is.

350
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:16,628
It is going to be required for our funds to also include a monitoring agreements.

351
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:22,070
Monitoring agreements do often come with an annual compliance fee for.

352
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:32,899
you know, oversight and services that someone would have to provide in order to make sure that the units are being rented to the correct type of tenants.

353
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,441
So it did include it.

354
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:37,702
Again, saw it in a couple places.

355
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:49,890
I didn't know if this is maybe something we talk about in the future, and I just maybe say we might also require a monitoring agreement in this NOFA and not say we're going to require an agreement.

356
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,292
All right.

357
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:54,237
Go ahead.

358
00:32:55,418 --> 00:33:06,102
I think the regulatory agreements that the developer side will have language on doing annual monitoring process.

359
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:11,805
And I do that for other inclusionary housing units across the city.

360
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:19,388
So I mean, this is an option, but we would still go ahead and do the monitoring for new developments as well.

361
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:30,422
I just wanted to provide some scenarios that we could imagine.

362
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:43,708
I've seen affordable housing trusts that work primarily with small developers who are not nonprofits, who don't have their, like they don't typically work with income qualified.

363
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:47,350
So they would want to contract out monitoring of their units.

364
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,112
Whereas if we're working with nonprofit developers primarily,

365
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:58,561
they probably are already have a system for managing income qualifying tenants.

366
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:09,105
But if the city wanted to take on the responsibility of that monitoring, do we want that to be reimbursed?

367
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:15,368
Like, should they be contracting with the city to do that, if not themselves?

368
00:34:17,738 --> 00:34:20,200
Great questions.

369
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:32,129
I would also say that I've seen a larger developers doing their own monitoring, but city staff is actually monitoring to make sure that they're doing it correct.

370
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:33,631
Yes, that's what I meant to clarify.

371
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:34,832
Yeah, right.

372
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:37,253
So the way I've seen it in my experience is,

373
00:34:44,419 --> 00:35:01,089
the developer is monitoring and then sending rent rolls, sending leases, or whatever the criteria is to the city, and the city is just checking and making sure that these are in fact there.

374
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:11,255
I have seen language that says that they may be able to charge a fee for their service.

375
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:21,968
But I don't know what the city of Medford does and their their ability to continue monitoring.

376
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:28,937
I do know from experience that when the city takes something on and as the inclusionary program.

377
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:47,404
grows and the trust fund, the trust developments, the affordable housing stock grows, then the capacity on the city, so it might, the city may have the capacity now, but they may not have the capacity in the future.

378
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:59,377
So another question is, I think the monitoring is focused on whether the tenants are qualified.

379
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:07,819
Are we monitoring to ensure that the units are actually being rented out at the affordability level that they are supposed to be?

380
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,299
That's why you asked for the rent rules.

381
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:18,542
Because I'm hearing cases of affordable units escalating in rent much higher than what affordable units should be.

382
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:34,151
In my experience, what I've seen is the developer is sending everything to the staff monitoring, and it also includes a copy of the lease.

383
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,693
It includes a copy of the rent rolls.

384
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:44,617
It includes, in some cases, the copy of the rent ledgers because it's just a little bit.

385
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:47,159
But yes, I would,

386
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:51,832
Aditi, you can speak to what Medford does.

387
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:55,434
Yes, yes, I'm happy to share what Medford does.

388
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:59,155
And like the Chair mentioned, we have a similar process.

389
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:04,157
The developers, they do the initial income verification and eligibility.

390
00:37:05,537 --> 00:37:15,000
And then once a year, I send out forms so that they can fill out the existing rents, lease terms, and share a sample of the lease agreement.

391
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:21,222
And as I monitor, I may request more documents to see if they are income eligible and so on.

392
00:37:21,682 --> 00:37:32,786
And once that's done, the HUD area income limits are released, and then we have rent increase request, and I approve based on the previous information they submitted.

393
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:37,272
So the first round of reviewing is always done by the developers.

394
00:37:41,597 --> 00:37:44,822
So that doesn't answer the question on whether or not we want to change.

395
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,882
It doesn't hurt to have it in there.

396
00:37:51,902 --> 00:38:00,165
Because in my experience also, once you get a NOCA done, usually take that template and then update it for what you need to do.

397
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:04,867
So if it's already in there, hopefully it stays in there.

398
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:10,349
So city may have the capacity now, but they may not have the capacity in the future.

399
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,150
Yes, sounds good.

400
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,470
Thank you.

401
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,422
Thank you, that's great.

402
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:23,970
Any addition to the Airbone Snowfire?

403
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:40,766
Mosey, I'm down to item four, the action plan working group community meetings and draft action plan.

404
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,709
Sorry, Chair, if I may.

405
00:38:47,669 --> 00:38:53,932
So are we finalizing the total funding allocated for this in the next meeting?

406
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,134
That's a good question.

407
00:38:57,154 --> 00:39:01,696
The money, the money.

408
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:07,855
If we're putting it out, when are we publishing this?

409
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:11,939
Because right now, all we have is $250,000.

410
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:17,164
Is there an expectation that there will be more than $250,000 come May?

411
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:39,111
Through the chair, the only other thing I can think of is the sale of the McCormick Ave lots, which President Behrs has been very helpful moving along.

412
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:43,333
I'm going to triple check and make sure it's on next Tuesday's agenda.

413
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:48,316
But I believe he is on top of that as we've been going back and forth by email.

414
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:50,417
But I just don't know if that would be by May.

415
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:56,940
So, and then anything coming in from Tufts wouldn't be until probably another year or two down the line.

416
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:00,456
That's all I can think of.

417
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:02,738
CPA is all I can think of.

418
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:10,804
And maybe the chair Cameron of the CPA commission would know if we're getting any more funding from CPA before me.

419
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:20,011
Okay, we got two hands up in the room and I don't know who went first, Roberta.

420
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:26,716
So a quick answer to the mayor's question and suggestion.

421
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:36,880
There is a tiny bit of funds left in the CPA right now.

422
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:45,864
And at least one, if not two potential off-cycle applications are already in the ether.

423
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:53,247
So there isn't much, but I think there's potentially a small amount, like maybe $50,000 that could be

424
00:40:57,528 --> 00:41:00,609
that we could request if need be.

425
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:04,391
And that is by the end of June.

426
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:08,773
Starting July 1, there could potentially be more funding available.

427
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:19,037
But what I was going to suggest is that for fiscal year 25, a minimum of $250,000 is available to fund eligible requests.

428
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:23,619
Additional funds may be added before the fiscal year

429
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:27,361
before the funding is awarded in the fall?

430
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:36,648
Does NOFA have to name a specific amount or can it be stated that way?

431
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:51,100
I've always seen a specific amount because then you're not setting up expectations of somebody coming in with a $500,000 ask and we don't have a $500,000 ask.

432
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,062
Or we could say 250,000 is currently available.

433
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:06,747
Additional funds may become available later this year.

434
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:18,355
But if you get additional funds, don't you have to put out another RFP to make it transparent for other developers coming in?

435
00:42:18,795 --> 00:42:22,358
With the CPA, what we typically do is state

436
00:42:23,212 --> 00:42:27,073
what the anticipated, what the estimated funding is going to be.

437
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:37,576
And then when the time comes, like eight months later, when we actually award the funds, we look in the bank account and see that there's actually more available.

438
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:45,418
We'll award the projects based on what's actually available, not what was estimated at the beginning of the year.

439
00:42:46,427 --> 00:42:52,452
I mean, the question is, if we put this out, because we need to get it out for them to be able to fulfill it.

440
00:42:52,533 --> 00:43:02,281
If we put it out now, and then we get another $100,000, do we say, nope, sorry, we can't give that out because we didn't advertise it?

441
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:12,871
Or can we just put it in this to say that we estimate this amount, but if we have more, we'll share?

442
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:20,323
That might be a question for legal.

443
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,486
I'm seeing a bunch of heads nodding.

444
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,468
I'm sorry, I think I know I would support that language if.

445
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,437
If we can make that change, I do think that's probably a legal question.

446
00:43:39,058 --> 00:43:41,499
All of the CPA funds are available for this.

447
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,341
We don't need any portion of them for anything else.

448
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:47,263
I'm just confirming that before we put all the 250 out there.

449
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,404
Is there anything else?

450
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:48,804
Okay.

451
00:43:48,884 --> 00:44:00,631
Because we've already made the decision that we're not really doing programmatic stuff because all the programs have really been already funded through the CPC.

452
00:44:04,238 --> 00:44:10,661
I am a Boston sports fan, so I'm nervous about being too optimistic about additional funds for the end of the school year, baking that in.

453
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:18,366
But if we can't have ambiguity, because I also, my father is going to be like, I do think we need to post this this month.

454
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:21,348
So probably at this meeting, we need to sign off on it.

455
00:44:22,048 --> 00:44:27,931
So with maybe that caveat of the legal question, it could be big.

456
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:28,732
Go ahead.

457
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:32,014
Through the chair, if I may, so I can ask,

458
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:42,508
The legal team, if we can include a general language saying that additional funds might be available.

459
00:44:42,528 --> 00:44:52,254
And my second question was, in terms of the time frame, are we planning to send this out by end of April or early May?

460
00:44:57,705 --> 00:45:04,527
I mean, if we send it out in May, most developers can get an application in within 30 days.

461
00:45:06,527 --> 00:45:06,827
Yeah.

462
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,288
So our next meeting would be May 7.

463
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:17,750
We can get the feedback from legal and have another clean version of the NOFA ready to go.

464
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:24,692
And then that would be the NOFA and the application ready to be published after our next meeting.

465
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:27,358
Sounds good.

466
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:28,259
Thank you.

467
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:29,419
Thanks.

468
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:35,522
Typical response period, like seven, six, seven weeks.

469
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:38,204
In my experience.

470
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:53,912
Okay, so do we need a motion to approve as the approve the NOFA as written now?

471
00:45:55,516 --> 00:46:11,918
HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She or Her HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, She

472
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:26,931
Do we want to put a motion on the table to approve the NOFA as written subject to legal opinion for the amount, or do we want to hold off until May?

473
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:32,094
Can I make a friendly amendment that we decide who the completed application goes to?

474
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:38,158
Yes, that would be appreciated.

475
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,682
I was going to get home and see that playing and be like, oh no, I didn't ask that question.

476
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:56,223
Aditi, who at the city should receive applications on June 30th and the 9th?

477
00:46:57,624 --> 00:47:02,105
Could we have the general PDS email ID?

478
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:09,347
It's ocd at medford-ma.gov.

479
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:10,687
OK.

480
00:47:12,088 --> 00:47:15,569
Do we need an album?

481
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:18,279
Sorry.

482
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,580
No, go ahead.

483
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,360
I interrupted you.

484
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:20,901
I'm sorry.

485
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:30,385
And once we have the new housing planner, maybe we can include their email address and name on the application.

486
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:37,288
And then do we need a physical address for the application?

487
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:41,670
Because I'm just seeing this preferred, electronic is preferred.

488
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,631
What would be the physical address?

489
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:45,892
Yeah, that's room 308.

490
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:52,019
Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Medford City Hall.

491
00:47:58,381 --> 00:48:02,361
I can send those details to Kayla as well as we update the NOFA application.

492
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:38,120
I had wanted to, so we weren't quite settled on approve the NOFA and application as amended.

493
00:48:42,473 --> 00:48:50,135
tonight and pending legal approval or wait to approve it in May.

494
00:48:50,855 --> 00:48:55,276
And the question is, how long do we want to give them to respond?

495
00:48:56,637 --> 00:49:11,061
So if we wait until May, then they have a shorter period of time to prepare to respond versus if this is ready to go a couple of weeks earlier,

496
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:18,269
before our next meeting, then they have a little more time.

497
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,891
I'll move approval pending legal's opinion.

498
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:26,272
I'll second.

499
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:31,574
OK, roll call.

500
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:32,254
Sorry.

501
00:49:32,954 --> 00:49:33,434
Kayla?

502
00:49:33,594 --> 00:49:33,874
Yes.

503
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:35,195
Roberta?

504
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:35,595
Yes.

505
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:36,555
Penny?

506
00:49:36,735 --> 00:49:37,015
Yes.

507
00:49:37,396 --> 00:49:38,116
Lisa Sun?

508
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:38,856
Yes.

509
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:40,437
Madam Mayor?

510
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:41,377
Yes.

511
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:51,987
And myself, yes, so motion approved to... Yeah, thank you.

512
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:55,588
Except as amended, waiting for legal opinion.

513
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,111
Okay, and now we can move to action item four.

514
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:09,875
Action plan working group updates community meeting and draft action plan.

515
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:14,932
The trust held a community meeting on March 12th.

516
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:20,174
Would the board like to debrief about the meeting?

517
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:21,215
Would you like to debrief?

518
00:50:22,475 --> 00:50:22,735
Sure.

519
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:25,696
I can start us off.

520
00:50:27,397 --> 00:50:28,697
I thought it went really well.

521
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:38,061
So we had a community meeting that lasted about two hours, I think, and the great presentation for the action plan team, and then

522
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:51,559
I would say a pretty candid, like, a conversation Q and a, that kind of the conversation is built into Q and a. So we heard some great and creative ideas for some real problems people are experiencing.

523
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:51,700
Um, and.

524
00:50:54,908 --> 00:51:01,432
I guess I will name we have a tech issue that we want to bring that up in this context.

525
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:10,098
So we did have a Zoom bombing experience of someone explicitly Zooming into the meeting.

526
00:51:10,578 --> 00:51:23,707
And so I just want to first off commend the staff that were supporting that meeting that really quickly dealt with it, and then kind of raise it as something to consider having protections in place for future meetings.

527
00:51:24,772 --> 00:51:25,752
Um, that was the same component.

528
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,093
I think the hybrid thing kind of work.

529
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:31,374
Well, I, uh, honestly, I'm curious what the experience was and folks were online.

530
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:34,654
Um, but we did get feedback from everybody.

531
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:34,954
So.

532
00:51:36,415 --> 00:51:43,336
And a lot of survey results, which you'll hear more about, but I think that was like, in tandem with this meeting was a. A feedback route.

533
00:51:45,017 --> 00:51:45,477
Thank you.

534
00:51:46,300 --> 00:52:06,834
Yeah, and I'd like to actually add a little bit about the zoom bomb experience and find out what does the city do when they're having hybrid meetings and, you know, whether or not do all cameras are usually shut off or is it the way that the meetings are set up?

535
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:09,916
Can we get walked through that process?

536
00:52:11,357 --> 00:52:21,599
Yeah, the only way to prevent that is to shut off everybody's camera and you there's also an option to mute everybody unless they're raising their hand.

537
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,240
So we do that on the school on the school committee for school committee meetings.

538
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:33,161
We actually same thing had didn't do it during MSBA meeting and we got zoom bombed as well.

539
00:52:33,641 --> 00:52:36,742
So I'm sure we'll change all our MSBA meetings to just

540
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:48,995
blanks, you know, no, no pictures and whether or not you want to choose to have to mute and unmute individuals as they raise their hand is is an option of each chair.

541
00:52:53,138 --> 00:52:59,722
So moving forward, I think even even our trust, although our trust meetings have been

542
00:53:00,937 --> 00:53:02,138
All right.

543
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,419
Publicly attended.

544
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:07,523
Publicly attended, but maybe that we should do.

545
00:53:07,823 --> 00:53:18,133
Would we have to vote on doing something like that, keeping videos off while we are doing our public meetings?

546
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:19,894
No.

547
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:24,418
We can just do it, except for members of the trust.

548
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:26,921
Thank you.

549
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:42,600
If I may, so Derek and I were exploring our zoom settings to see if we could turn off participants camera prior to sending the meeting invite and we didn't find that option.

550
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,403
Our only option was to do that once the meeting has begun.

551
00:53:47,264 --> 00:53:49,145
So we're still exploring that option.

552
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:53,369
To change the settings before we even start the meeting.

553
00:53:55,333 --> 00:54:07,946
And can you answer when you're setting up the meetings for the public meetings, do we set up the meetings as a zoom meeting or zoom webinar?

554
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,896
It's a Zoom meeting.

555
00:54:10,656 --> 00:54:11,417
It's a Zoom meeting.

556
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:19,183
Because I use Zoom for another public meeting that I do, and we set it up as a Zoom webinar.

557
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:26,689
And then you have panelists that will automatically come on with their cameras on and whatnot.

558
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:32,073
And then the members of the public are then set off on the side and their cameras in use.

559
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:35,456
And you can set it that way to keep the cameras off.

560
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:39,412
But then they can't participate with the webinar?

561
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:41,414
Yes, they can.

562
00:54:42,255 --> 00:54:42,756
Oh, they can?

563
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:45,358
Okay, I thought usually webinars, I can't participate.

564
00:54:45,398 --> 00:54:46,239
I just kind of watch.

565
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,103
But yeah, you can have it in the in the audience.

566
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:52,326
Well, let me you can have it in the audience.

567
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:58,092
And then when when they have a question, and they put their hands up, you can then call on them.

568
00:54:58,112 --> 00:54:58,152
Um,

569
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:04,247
but we could try it out just in case I'm misremembering.

570
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:11,769
We do currently have the ability to stop people's videos and mute them and boot them if necessary from here.

571
00:55:13,649 --> 00:55:19,051
I might have to check this, but I don't know if our Zoom account currently has the webinar option.

572
00:55:20,531 --> 00:55:22,852
I'm unsure of that, but I'll look into that.

573
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:34,654
It just might be an option because if they come on with the TV and this is what happened, like they came on and immediately we had to pull everything out.

574
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:40,536
And it's just, it's disruptive for everybody.

575
00:55:41,316 --> 00:55:49,958
And whether we have it on the monitor where the room can see it or just the people that are joining the meeting from the public hybrid.

576
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:55,642
So whatever we can do to prevent it, it would be greatly appreciated.

577
00:55:55,662 --> 00:55:58,084
Thank you.

578
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:05,229
All right, and then for the community survey, we received nearly 70 responses.

579
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,633
Aditi, will you share the results of the survey?

580
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:09,713
Yes.

581
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:16,818
Can everybody see my screen?

582
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:18,059
Yes.

583
00:56:26,785 --> 00:56:31,327
As our chair mentioned, we received nearly 70 responses.

584
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:36,809
So this is just an overview of what the results look like.

585
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:46,353
We discussed these responses with the subcommittee working group last week and are just resharing the results with the entire board.

586
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:47,513
So 42.6% of the

587
00:56:52,182 --> 00:56:54,403
responses said that they work in Medford.

588
00:56:57,345 --> 00:57:09,010
And most of the responses were from West Medford, followed by Hillside, and then South Medford, and then Wellington.

589
00:57:14,873 --> 00:57:15,934
And we have around

590
00:57:17,753 --> 00:57:28,579
60% of the responses who said that they own their current home, and nearly 35% of the responses rent their home.

591
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:44,887
Less than 5% of the responses said that they live in housing that is reserved for low and moderate income households.

592
00:57:48,157 --> 00:57:51,259
Does your housing currently meet your needs?

593
00:57:51,379 --> 00:57:57,543
Nearly 22% of the responses said that their housing currently does not meet their needs.

594
00:57:57,863 --> 00:58:12,972
And some of the most common reasons were that their current home is too expensive, or their home is overcrowded, not enough bedrooms, or they would prefer to have separate housing from their current members.

595
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:18,757
Home is unsafe due to its condition, and home is not accessible to persons with disabilities.

596
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:40,594
Most responses we received were from the white population, followed by Asian community, and then African-American community, and then Middle Eastern or North African community.

597
00:58:49,038 --> 00:58:57,845
We received 21 responses from those whose members of their household are above the age of 65.

598
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:04,170
And then we received 14 responses from those whose members of their households are below the age of 18.

599
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:13,717
And then 11 responses from those whose members of their households have some kind of disability or mobility limitations.

600
00:59:20,362 --> 00:59:27,008
I think the most responses that we received were from households that earn $150,000 or more, followed by $100,000 to $149,000.

601
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:30,732
And then the third most responses came from households that earned between $25,000 to $49,000.

602
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:52,721
What kind of activities would you like the Affordable Housing Trust to focus on?

603
00:59:53,862 --> 01:00:09,751
I think the majority of them responded that the trust should be focusing on creating more affordable housing, rental housing, followed by home ownership housing, and then providing housing stability or rental assistance for tenants.

604
01:00:10,432 --> 01:00:15,955
And the fourth option, providing home ownership assistance for income eligible households.

605
01:00:20,592 --> 01:00:25,156
Which of the following types of income-restricted affordable housing should be developed in Medford?

606
01:00:25,877 --> 01:00:38,989
I think most of them responded that they prefer rental affordable housing followed by accessible housing for persons with disabilities and home ownership housing.

607
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:44,674
Then housing that includes two to four unit buildings.

608
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:57,701
followed by mixed housing and commercial building, and then larger multifamily buildings, and then accessory apartments or ADUs.

609
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:06,486
Which of the following types of households should the city prioritize in assisting?

610
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:13,390
Most responses said that people at risk of being displaced from Medford.

611
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,143
would be their preference, followed by people experiencing homelessness.

612
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:28,849
And then the third most type of households that require assistance would be families with children in Medford schools.

613
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:35,473
Or did I miss, the fourth one is seniors, yeah.

614
01:01:39,873 --> 01:01:49,815
Do you know of strategies or potential funding sources that could provide financial support to the trust to address housing challenges for low-income households?

615
01:01:50,255 --> 01:01:52,376
These are some of the responses that we received.

616
01:01:52,436 --> 01:02:03,638
The most common ones were realistic transfer-free, prioritizing tax pilot funds for the Affordable Housing Trust, CPA funds, and then

617
01:02:04,983 --> 01:02:25,817
increasing permitting fees that would go towards the affordable housing trust, linkage fee, condo conversion fee, increased property taxes, and sale of McCormick Avenue parcels, updating linkage fee again, CPA funds, real estate transfer fee,

618
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:36,630
It looks like real estate transfer fee, linkage fee, and then CPA funds were some of the most common responses.

619
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:44,093
Those were the overall results.

620
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,715
Does anybody have any questions or comments?

621
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:05,738
Some comments that were said in the room, not in the survey per se, were about getting creative with video and properties.

622
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:06,619
I really liked it.

623
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:07,921
Some people got really creative.

624
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:12,608
We heard growing food hydroponically on the river and then using some

625
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:23,996
Like some other spaces that haven't been on the table in terms of publicly owned spaces that like aren't used that are underutilized and in busy areas that could be considered for housing.

626
01:03:24,036 --> 01:03:26,517
So I love that creative thinking.

627
01:03:26,858 --> 01:03:32,101
And then there were some other, you know, there was feedback on like,

628
01:03:32,653 --> 01:03:36,054
People wanted to make sure they knew where to go to get the info on things that were happening.

629
01:03:37,494 --> 01:03:49,678
I also really liked hearing creative ideas about collaborations, like with voc tech programs, with people changing careers, refugee classes, Habitat for Humanity, Land Trust.

630
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:54,699
These ideas came up to both maximize what we can do with partners.

631
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:56,980
So I just wanted to name those as well.

632
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:00,861
Thank you.

633
01:04:03,933 --> 01:04:09,814
All right, and then we're going to move on to the action plan, unless anybody else has any questions or comments.

634
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:16,515
So Roberta, will you share an updated action plan with the board for input?

635
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:18,236
Sure.

636
01:04:19,436 --> 01:04:24,017
Maybe perhaps if Aditi, you can share the action plan.

637
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,457
And I'm going to jump straight to page 30.

638
01:04:32,988 --> 01:04:55,838
So I've made since presenting the plan, the data to the whole trust board a few months ago, I have filled in a lot of missing, filled in a lot of gaps since we had them.

639
01:04:56,898 --> 01:05:00,000
And so it's a much cleaner looking plan, but,

640
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:12,606
The body of the plan up until page 30 covers most of what we heard at the public meeting last month, the data presentation.

641
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:22,031
There's also several pages that describe what we learned from the stakeholder workshops and the public meeting and the survey.

642
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:24,292
Starting on page 30 is what I wanted to

643
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:43,833
go over with the housing trust board to make some choices together about kind of what is the heart of our mission, our goals, that's it.

644
01:05:45,053 --> 01:05:51,378
And so everything that I have highlighted in blue in this draft right now is for our discussion as a group.

645
01:05:52,250 --> 01:06:01,434
So last week, the subcommittee met and we ironed out the draft that we see in the plan right now.

646
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:07,097
But I wanted to ask for everyone's input on what is in the draft.

647
01:06:07,657 --> 01:06:16,661
So we drafted a mission statement for the Affordable Housing Trust, which is very simple, to create and preserve community housing.

648
01:06:17,228 --> 01:06:23,130
including affordable home ownership and rental opportunities for low and moderate income residents in Medford.

649
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:29,492
Perhaps having a mission statement at all is redundant and we don't need it.

650
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:37,415
Or if we feel like it's helpful to include it, would we modify or add anything to this?

651
01:06:46,776 --> 01:06:47,696
and opinions.

652
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:55,598
We can also come back to it, maybe review more of the plan and come back.

653
01:06:55,618 --> 01:06:57,459
I like it, through the chair.

654
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:03,660
The short but sweet one sentence covers what we're trying to do.

655
01:07:05,161 --> 01:07:11,583
And it guides us through what we're doing so we don't lose track as the year is going on.

656
01:07:12,803 --> 01:07:13,003
Great.

657
01:07:13,931 --> 01:07:15,835
And then we identified some goals.

658
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:21,907
These goals are drawn primarily from the afford the housing production plan.

659
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:25,536
maybe filtered through the comprehensive plan.

660
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:37,062
And we boiled down what were more goals into the, the, the ones that are most relevant to the housing trust.

661
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:51,148
So number one, to promote a welcoming, diverse, intergenerational and inclusive city with an ideal mix of housing choices that offer diverse options to residents with varying needs and preferences.

662
01:07:53,112 --> 01:08:08,237
Second, to use financial and property resources to address local housing needs and meet production goals established in the housing production plan and to preserve the affordability of existing affordable homes.

663
01:08:10,432 --> 01:08:16,496
Three, foster safe, well-designed, accessible, and sustainable housing.

664
01:08:17,036 --> 01:08:24,200
Integrate affordable and diverse housing options throughout the city at a scale that is compatible with the built environment.

665
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:36,027
Four, expand local capacity to implement housing initiatives by building partnership with mission-driven and nonprofit developers.

666
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:44,413
And five, increase communication about housing resources across the community.

667
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:57,981
Have we missed anything or overstated or have better ways of articulating these goals?

668
01:09:01,903 --> 01:09:03,184
We'll offer something.

669
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:25,680
would like to strike the part that says at a scale that is compatible with the built environment, which I think might have been directly pulled, but to me, I think it is both like, I don't know, I personally

670
01:09:26,815 --> 01:09:35,359
This makes me think of like neighborhood character arguments that I would rather, that I don't think personally are appropriate in the affordable housing conversation.

671
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:44,722
And I also think that like, I think through this new zoning process, we're both expanding our possibilities, but hearing that a lot of things have been built not to code to the state.

672
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:50,005
So then, I don't know, I think maybe I will just offer it seems a little redundant that

673
01:09:51,365 --> 01:09:57,166
And I would, I would hope that we strike that peace, but it's time for our debate.

674
01:09:57,586 --> 01:09:58,527
Yeah.

675
01:10:04,168 --> 01:10:07,068
Does anybody have any feelings about striking?

676
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:12,589
I am in support of any.

677
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:15,250
I agree.

678
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,570
Thank you.

679
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:42,755
Through the chair, you're thinking it should more say something like integrate affordable and diverse housing options throughout the city, and then mention something about just complying with the current zoning and the new zoning that is being worked through.

680
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:51,671
I would be afraid to limit ourselves from encouraging friendly 40 bees.

681
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,492
Yeah, sure.

682
01:10:54,572 --> 01:11:04,615
I think my intention was to like end a sentence that the word city and then hope that that doesn't like build in limitations like that we don't want to open but

683
01:11:10,762 --> 01:11:14,004
Yeah, I mean, I agree with that suggestion.

684
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:31,572
And if there were people who had a concern about the rest of the sentence, maybe it's negotiable to play with the language to make it as flexible as possible.

685
01:11:31,672 --> 01:11:37,295
But I would agree with ending the sentence across the city, throughout the city.

686
01:11:50,658 --> 01:11:50,878
Yeah.

687
01:11:53,999 --> 01:11:57,020
So maybe we could move to the next, Lisa.

688
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:02,161
Lisa's side.

689
01:12:02,181 --> 01:12:06,783
I see something about partnering with developers.

690
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:18,646
Did we want to also mention working with just nonprofit organizations, so not development-driven organizations?

691
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:39,450
Or did we want to maybe expand that line item to include both developers and nonprofit organizations that work to either advocate for, connect with resources, or organize around affordable housing?

692
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:47,172
Or is that not something we're looking to do as the trust?

693
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:48,372
I'm not sure what.

694
01:12:49,747 --> 01:12:53,969
the full scope of what we want to accomplish there.

695
01:12:54,309 --> 01:13:03,774
If it's just to know what others are doing and not encroach on their expertise, then we don't have to mention that in our goals.

696
01:13:05,035 --> 01:13:06,976
I think that's a good catch.

697
01:13:07,236 --> 01:13:12,598
Maybe the fix is simply to add the word organizations after mission-driven.

698
01:13:12,618 --> 01:13:17,841
And that captures the group that you're talking about.

699
01:13:19,568 --> 01:13:21,610
As well as nonprofit developers.

700
01:13:22,391 --> 01:13:23,272
Yeah, I think that works.

701
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:31,120
Um, through the chair earlier, Roberta, you mentioned some trust work with developers who aren't nonprofit per se.

702
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:33,483
So, again, kind of in the interest of, like.

703
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:37,748
I don't know if we've officially made that decision or limiting us in that way.

704
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:38,869
I've just named that.

705
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:40,450
Yeah, I, I think.

706
01:13:41,555 --> 01:13:43,456
Mission driven developers is an umbrella.

707
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:51,321
I do think calling out service organizations that we've heard about in stakeholder groups, super good catch, should definitely be baked in as partners.

708
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:57,725
But just want to make sure, again, the language is expansive for our relationships that we're building.

709
01:13:58,205 --> 01:14:04,069
Maybe instead of nonprofit developers, we could say developers seeking to build affordable housing.

710
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:27,501
An example that I've seen before specifically was a developer, a small local developer who came forward to convert a historic house into eight units of housing with a friendly 40B of which two of the units were affordable and two of the units were handicap accessible.

711
01:14:28,061 --> 01:14:29,522
So that was a win-win.

712
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:34,124
It wasn't 100% affordable, but it was supported by the trust and so it was

713
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:38,605
And it used a friendly 40B, so it struck all of those.

714
01:14:41,847 --> 01:14:50,170
And it was small in scale and historic preservation, so we would encourage that kind of creativity.

715
01:14:53,191 --> 01:14:58,473
One question from what Lisa said, and I think maybe I just also need clarification.

716
01:14:58,513 --> 01:15:03,275
The mission statement that you've laid out does seem to gear more towards

717
01:15:04,549 --> 01:15:13,216
development maybe as and not to me on first reading as much to rental assistance, let's say.

718
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:18,220
So I think when I read the mission statement and the goal of that seemed cohesive in that.

719
01:15:18,673 --> 01:15:28,476
But if we are still trying to broaden that focus, maybe we need to broaden the mission statement to then include that in some of our goals.

720
01:15:28,656 --> 01:15:40,619
To me, the first mission statement, at first reading, didn't feel like rental assistance, didn't feel like housing stabilization, felt like units in my first read of it.

721
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:45,660
Was that the intent or was that not the intent?

722
01:15:47,982 --> 01:15:59,464
I don't know, I would translate preserve community housing as maybe not community housing, maybe preserve housing.

723
01:15:59,484 --> 01:16:12,787
And that way you're preserving tenancy for somebody who may be... I'm also gonna hear what you're saying.

724
01:16:14,347 --> 01:16:18,069
I see preserved rental opportunities as a way of that.

725
01:16:18,089 --> 01:16:25,714
But I do also like maybe being explicit about the term phrase that we cut out of the first thing.

726
01:16:25,734 --> 01:16:33,018
So it wasn't rental assistance only, it was other forms of assistance or

727
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:45,338
including affordable home ownership and rental opportunities and other forms of assistance.

728
01:16:47,839 --> 01:16:49,720
Other forms of housing assistance.

729
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,461
Other forms of housing assistance.

730
01:16:51,981 --> 01:16:52,221
Yeah.

731
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:55,603
Thank you.

732
01:16:55,623 --> 01:17:05,728
Shall we move to the next?

733
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:28,297
So potential sources of funding, I added a section on Community Preservation Act funding and a conversation that I think we need to have with the Community Preservation Committee later in the summer, perhaps.

734
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:35,693
Maybe a subcommittee could meet with the community preservation committee or.

735
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:43,522
a or we could have a joint meeting of the two boards.

736
01:17:44,002 --> 01:17:47,323
So I've laid out a question on the page 31.

737
01:17:47,364 --> 01:17:55,548
The Community Preservation Committee currently distributes funds through an annual grant application process.

738
01:17:57,509 --> 01:18:03,772
And in FY 25, the Affordable Housing Trust received funds by applying through that process.

739
01:18:04,459 --> 01:18:13,985
Moving forward, there are several options for how the Affordable Housing Trust can coordinate with the Community Preservation Committee to distribute affordable housing funds.

740
01:18:14,005 --> 01:18:30,015
So one is that the Affordable Housing Trust could think about what kinds of projects we want to do, how much money do we think we need for those projects, apply for the funding through the Community Preservation Committee.

741
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:40,377
That's a large output of effort on the Affordable Housing Trust's end and you lose time in the process.

742
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:57,966
The second slightly less onerous method would be for the Affordable Housing Trust to just apply to the CPC like we did this year for a random amount of money and then figure out what we do with that amount of money over the next year.

743
01:18:59,205 --> 01:19:23,972
The third option is that the CPC doesn't require an application from the Affordable Housing Trust, but the CPC decides annually how much money they want to give to the Affordable Housing Trust based on how much money is available in consideration of other projects that are applying for funds.

744
01:19:24,882 --> 01:19:30,344
And the fourth option is that the no application from the trust is required.

745
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:38,348
And the CPC budgets annually how much money they want to give to the trust.

746
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:51,714
And that gives the trust the maximum reliability of a revenue stream, which enables the trust to plan in advance what types of programs we're going to run.

747
01:19:55,123 --> 01:20:14,378
It's really if the CPC is going to be the source of the trust revenue, then the trust needs to collaborate with the CPC to gauge their level as a board, their level of trust in the trust to be the distributor of its affordable housing funds.

748
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:17,220
So that's a conversation to be had.

749
01:20:18,895 --> 01:20:32,699
And so that is something like maybe I can make a proposal to the CPC to consider these as well, just extracting what's written in this section.

750
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:46,983
And besides the CPA potential revenue sources, like we can identify what are potential revenue sources and what are the barriers, what are the actions that might be needed to achieve those revenue sources.

751
01:20:48,147 --> 01:20:55,776
So skip down to the next blue section, other potential sources of priority actions.

752
01:20:57,959 --> 01:21:03,826
And what the subcommittee identified for priority actions in this draft.

753
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,202
is first fund housing stability programs.

754
01:21:08,403 --> 01:21:17,890
And does the Medford Affordable Housing Trust take over the funding programs that receive funds directly from the CPA currently?

755
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:26,717
And a big question is, do we continue to work with the same recipients who have applied directly to the CPC in the past?

756
01:21:27,737 --> 01:21:34,338
Or do we put out an RFP or a NOFA to invite new organizations to request funding?

757
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:51,702
So I don't know if that's a question we want to bother to try to answer tonight or to save that for a future time, given that we may want to spend more time discussing this.

758
01:21:54,158 --> 01:22:00,202
but just a background of how we got to work with the organizations that are currently working with.

759
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:22,498
The CPC began to have housing stability programs during the pandemic by reaching out to a number of organizations around the region who provide housing stability programs to their communities and asked that they would be willing to apply for Medford CPA funds

760
01:22:23,058 --> 01:22:32,361
to run a similar program in Medford and ABCD and Housing Families were the two organizations that responded to that invitation.

761
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:47,766
So it wasn't formally a NOFA, it wasn't an RFP, it was just a stakeholder invitation to apply for funding similar to how the

762
01:22:50,105 --> 01:22:53,047
other CPA program funds have been applied for.

763
01:22:53,067 --> 01:23:12,359
And we did hear feedback during the stakeholder sessions that knowing that Medford already has a relationship working with these programs might inhibit other organizations in the region from applying for funds.

764
01:23:12,939 --> 01:23:13,179
So,

765
01:23:14,841 --> 01:23:34,138
I think we need to consider whether we want to spread the program more thinly given our limited amount of funding so that different organizations, because people who are looking for housing aren't necessarily going to know which organization to approach to get funding in Medford.

766
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:36,180
So I think it's a

767
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:47,056
strategic question of whether it's better off spreading our limited funding over different organizations or directing people to one organization to provide programs.

768
01:23:48,618 --> 01:23:50,679
So that was the number one priority action.

769
01:23:51,079 --> 01:24:00,821
The second priority action is to build affordable housing in partnership with nonprofit mission-driven affordable housing developers, as well as Medford Housing Authority.

770
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:06,643
Medford Community Land Trust, if established, would also be a potential partner.

771
01:24:08,908 --> 01:24:23,524
I'd like to make a friendly amendment on that only to just to reflect what we did in our goals and take off nonprofit and put affordable housing in partnership with

772
01:24:29,992 --> 01:24:42,096
mission-driven housing developers and developers with mission-driven organizations and developers seeking to build affordable housing.

773
01:24:42,116 --> 01:24:54,960
Third is

774
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:00,693
to support existing homeowners and first-time home buyers.

775
01:25:02,434 --> 01:25:11,440
And options, we could provide some examples of what potential programs could look like or leave it open-ended.

776
01:25:14,882 --> 01:25:24,369
Next is to advocate for affordable housing development and policies that maximize the resources available to meet the city's housing needs.

777
01:25:25,707 --> 01:25:27,168
And I gave a couple of examples.

778
01:25:27,248 --> 01:25:35,956
We could explore and act upon funding opportunities for the trust and work with, we could strike the word nonprofit.

779
01:25:36,496 --> 01:25:46,285
We could work with developers to build support and help navigate the planning and approval process to build affordable housing.

780
01:25:52,872 --> 01:26:07,379
So some of the ideas like real estate transfer fee are things that would require advocacy on like a state level, for example, to get past, which like, you know, advocacy is one of our, our things we can do.

781
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:08,279
So does that fit?

782
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,580
Like, does that fit here?

783
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,600
Is that a funding opportunity?

784
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:18,064
Because I got like a short list of like funding opportunity suggestions, like, there are ones that need like city council approval, there's some that need state approval.

785
01:26:18,084 --> 01:26:20,485
I have a couple others, but I'm just wondering if like,

786
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:25,503
Is that covered by explore and act upon funding opportunities for the trust?

787
01:26:25,523 --> 01:26:27,925
Okay, thank you.

788
01:26:29,146 --> 01:26:43,558
And a question is whether we want to expand all of these bullet points to provide more explanation of these things.

789
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:55,155
If so, maybe we could delegate writing what some of the examples might be.

790
01:26:56,816 --> 01:26:57,817
Or do we keep it simple?

791
01:26:57,857 --> 01:27:10,008
Or we have the simple version that we could put at the front of the plan, and then the more in-depth explanation can go in this section.

792
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:21,182
Except before I give my opinion, does anybody have an opinion or a thought?

793
01:27:25,263 --> 01:27:30,625
I think simpler at the beginning and more explanation here is my opinion, but through the chair.

794
01:27:32,045 --> 01:27:32,545
Thank you.

795
01:27:33,646 --> 01:27:36,527
I would say that as well.

796
01:27:36,647 --> 01:27:40,488
I feel like this is, we want to try to keep it simple.

797
01:27:40,508 --> 01:27:42,248
We don't want to put ourselves in a box.

798
01:27:46,165 --> 01:27:47,645
Yeah, thank you.

799
01:27:51,566 --> 01:28:14,790
If you have a couple other bullets, I don't know if you're inviting those at this time, for priority action, something that, and I mean, maybe these are, all the bullets are discussions, I guess, of what we're putting on there, but the ability to age in place or stay in an apartment, stay in a housing situation over the course of a lifetime and funds to

800
01:28:16,215 --> 01:28:24,881
rehab was placed to do that, I don't know if that... That would be a sub-bullet under support existing homeowners and first-time homebuyers.

801
01:28:24,901 --> 01:28:42,212
Okay, so maybe that's an example of a potential program is like, yeah, funding for rehabilitation to stay in place for whatever reasons, but like, I think accommodations for aging and access came up, like first floor bathrooms, I think that's something someone, in bedrooms, someone specifically mentioned.

802
01:28:44,373 --> 01:28:50,517
I also had another funding source that I feel like I saw was budget allocations.

803
01:28:51,317 --> 01:29:03,705
So that is, does require someone's approval, but less of a, I mean, it is a process, but, you know, that was specifically named, I think some other trust had that as funding.

804
01:29:09,868 --> 01:29:10,529
City funds.

805
01:29:11,789 --> 01:29:12,650
Correct.

806
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:37,009
And I think that we can hold off because our timeline said that we would look at guidelines next month.

807
01:29:37,569 --> 01:29:43,212
So I did throw some draft guidelines in there, just an example of what it could look like.

808
01:29:43,852 --> 01:29:45,473
As with the mission statement,

809
01:29:46,620 --> 01:30:03,474
We could leave it out altogether, or if we want to include it, I just put something down on paper for everyone to respond to, and I would take anyone's feedback.

810
01:30:03,855 --> 01:30:13,323
And that's why it's actually in a funny font, is so you can see that what is in that funny font is just for a potential example.

811
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:19,166
Thank you, Roberta.

812
01:30:20,186 --> 01:30:22,807
My vote would be to act to include them.

813
01:30:23,367 --> 01:30:29,529
I'm a huge fan of having everything in one place instead of having things scattered in different files.

814
01:30:29,569 --> 01:30:33,930
So I would vote to have the guidelines in the action plan.

815
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:37,712
So that's just my opinion.

816
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,452
Does anybody else have an opinion?

817
01:30:41,473 --> 01:30:44,474
So I would invite everyone to take

818
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:56,181
some time to look at what I put in as an example and offer suggestions if you have any next month.

819
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:08,208
And then the goal was to be able to finalize this in the May meeting.

820
01:31:08,228 --> 01:31:12,110
Yeah, so the homework that I'm seeing

821
01:31:13,045 --> 01:31:24,533
is to expand on the potential funding sources and provide a more expansive explanation under the actions.

822
01:31:27,135 --> 01:31:36,701
And then we can create the abbreviated actions as a summary up front.

823
01:31:38,283 --> 01:31:41,645
I have some follow up questions if we're going to be

824
01:31:42,673 --> 01:31:49,328
If the goal is to get this approved, voted in May to go to the city council in June.

825
01:31:51,836 --> 01:31:57,960
What it's talking about on page 31 and no, not 31.

826
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,181
Yeah, 31.

827
01:32:02,482 --> 01:32:12,628
The funding sources for the CPC from the CPC and whether or not we're going to do an application on an annual basis, et cetera, et cetera.

828
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:21,813
Is that a decision that we need to be able to make before we can finalize this action plan?

829
01:32:23,133 --> 01:32:35,178
So there is a five-year estimate, funding estimate, that is in here, right?

830
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:37,639
I think I gave a five, I didn't put it in a table.

831
01:32:42,623 --> 01:32:52,791
So I gave a range of the five-year funding availability of somewhere between $350,000 to $700,000 per year, potentially, of CPA funding, pending

832
01:33:01,698 --> 01:33:20,471
how the CPC wants to so the it's a good question the action plan may say this is what we anticipate for funding but we don't know exactly how much we will have but however much money we have these are our goals and the things we're going to focus on.

833
01:33:22,012 --> 01:33:30,077
I think like just like with the NOFA we're not going to know in advance how much we actually have available

834
01:33:32,081 --> 01:33:39,385
So let me rephrase my question, because I didn't say it, Claire.

835
01:33:39,565 --> 01:33:47,129
On page 31, the first four steps, we have four choices on how we want to go to the CPC for funding, right?

836
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:57,474
Is that a decision that has to be made on how are we going to go to the board for this action plan?

837
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:18,281
I think, so remind me, you looked at the timeline earlier, whether the June meeting was, remind me what we said we were going to do at the June meeting.

838
01:34:18,441 --> 01:34:21,782
Yeah, I think this was to finalize the draft.

839
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:35,011
action plan, now including guidelines, procedures, action plan, rules, guidelines, procedures, action plan, and maybe have the developer start presenting as soon as they're ready.

840
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:36,633
That's all I have for June right now.

841
01:34:36,733 --> 01:34:40,337
So it may be possible for us to be on the May agenda.

842
01:34:40,985 --> 01:34:44,306
for the CPC to have that conversation.

843
01:34:44,326 --> 01:34:50,288
I think that that is doable for that to be on the May.

844
01:34:50,308 --> 01:34:54,649
I was thinking June, but I think May might be doable.

845
01:34:57,630 --> 01:35:04,872
So the idea was we would go to the May CPC with maybe our preferred 1, 2, 3, 4.

846
01:35:06,922 --> 01:35:12,205
advocate for 1, 2, 3, 4, whatever we've decided, and then see what their response is from CPC.

847
01:35:12,385 --> 01:35:12,626
Yes.

848
01:35:12,946 --> 01:35:21,111
And so to answer your question more specifically, the, so this meeting, we're just reviewing the draft.

849
01:35:21,871 --> 01:35:24,853
Next meeting, we're going to review the other items in the draft.

850
01:35:25,514 --> 01:35:35,400
And then the June meeting, we will have a final draft that we will, um, release in June.

851
01:35:36,089 --> 01:35:37,252
for public comment.

852
01:35:52,171 --> 01:36:02,717
I'm just thinking like, there's three, there's four options in the action plan for me and action plan is this is what we're going to do instead of these are our option for funding.

853
01:36:02,817 --> 01:36:05,059
So that's why that's where I'm stuck.

854
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:06,800
Like, I'm stuck.

855
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:15,625
Like, do we have to make this decision in order to in order to finalize this or or is there something in right or.

856
01:36:16,385 --> 01:36:28,175
I don't have my glasses, so I can't see what it says in front of me right now, but does it say, like, these are the options that we will pursue over the next few years?

857
01:36:28,255 --> 01:36:30,757
These are decisions that we're going to make.

858
01:36:31,117 --> 01:36:35,361
Maybe that that will help me with more of an action plan that it's an action plan.

859
01:36:38,143 --> 01:36:38,784
Understood.

860
01:36:38,804 --> 01:36:49,092
Yeah, I think that by June we'll have picked which of those four, but we won't know whether where it falls within the 350 to 700,000 range.

861
01:36:49,132 --> 01:36:52,956
That's a wild guess because the CPC can't commit in advance.

862
01:36:53,456 --> 01:36:53,716
Right.

863
01:36:54,257 --> 01:37:01,583
But I did want to note that on the schedule for next time is to look at the guidelines and procedures.

864
01:37:02,394 --> 01:37:09,439
So I wanted to ask whether you're drafting procedures or am I?

865
01:37:09,499 --> 01:37:11,360
I was planning to.

866
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:11,640
Good.

867
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,021
Perfect.

868
01:37:13,281 --> 01:37:14,041
All right.

869
01:37:14,362 --> 01:37:16,743
So we'll put those two pieces together at the next.

870
01:37:17,244 --> 01:37:19,005
Good.

871
01:37:19,265 --> 01:37:24,048
I don't want to duplicate nor have each of us think the other one is going to do it.

872
01:37:26,489 --> 01:37:26,590
OK.

873
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:29,832
All right.

874
01:37:29,912 --> 01:37:30,252
Thank you.

875
01:37:30,883 --> 01:37:33,744
Does anybody have any other questions or comments?

876
01:37:34,324 --> 01:37:34,824
Aditi?

877
01:37:35,524 --> 01:37:43,807
Can I clarify if the board is going to vote on the four options right now before the board attends the CPC meeting next month?

878
01:37:44,927 --> 01:37:49,688
No, the four options are for the CPC to decide.

879
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:51,349
It's the CPC's choice.

880
01:37:53,775 --> 01:37:59,537
I was a question because then the Claire, I'm going to follow that up with a clarifying question.

881
01:37:59,557 --> 01:38:15,461
Does the board have to decide on who in the trust would go to the CPC to make a presentation to say, here's our idea as we're leaning more towards here, but we'll accept.

882
01:38:15,761 --> 01:38:18,322
Is that something that we need to decide tonight?

883
01:38:18,502 --> 01:38:21,683
It's in order for it to get onto the agenda or in May.

884
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:24,598
That would be helpful, yes.

885
01:38:25,139 --> 01:38:29,181
The CPC meets the second Tuesday of each month.

886
01:38:29,381 --> 01:38:33,904
So if we made a decision next month, it would be still in time.

887
01:38:34,465 --> 01:38:46,352
But if we, I mean, the question would be, if one of us attends the CPA, CPC meeting, then we don't need to post it as a

888
01:38:47,964 --> 01:38:55,408
as a trust meeting, but if it's the subcommittee attending, then we would need to post the subcommittee.

889
01:38:56,188 --> 01:39:00,350
And if it's the full trust, then we would need to post the full trust.

890
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:01,331
OK.

891
01:39:03,692 --> 01:39:05,273
Is that the 13th of May?

892
01:39:05,293 --> 01:39:06,333
It looks like so.

893
01:39:06,353 --> 01:39:07,834
That will factor.

894
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:09,000
Thank you.

895
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:18,862
Actually, I'm really glad that you asked that question because just earlier this evening, Teresa asked if we could move up the date of that meeting.

896
01:39:19,902 --> 01:39:27,523
So I am incorrect that we can't make a decision in May who would attend.

897
01:39:27,563 --> 01:39:32,984
We have to make that decision now because the meeting will be on the 6th next month.

898
01:39:33,004 --> 01:39:33,724
The first Tuesday?

899
01:39:34,165 --> 01:39:34,405
Yeah.

900
01:39:34,965 --> 01:39:35,325
Thank you.

901
01:39:47,658 --> 01:39:50,480
There's a school event on the set, so I won't be able to make it.

902
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,882
I don't know if we're letting you know if we're available right now.

903
01:39:54,184 --> 01:39:54,744
Thank you.

904
01:39:54,884 --> 01:40:03,011
I was just going to say, is there anybody pitching to go to the CPC to make a presentation to them?

905
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:13,260
And one, I think we probably have to pick at least one of the four that are up here to make the presentation.

906
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:33,448
I think what we want to do is give this explanation as it is to the CPC and then say the trust would really appreciate if you would choose option four because that gives the trust the best

907
01:40:35,549 --> 01:40:45,673
basis, but if you have concerns, maybe we could put the options in reverse order so that we put our best foot first.

908
01:40:45,853 --> 01:40:50,995
And if there are concerns, then these are some compromise options.

909
01:40:53,896 --> 01:40:54,176
All right.

910
01:40:54,416 --> 01:41:03,480
So the question remains, is there anybody here who would like to make a presentation to the CPC on

911
01:41:04,098 --> 01:41:04,958
May 6th.

912
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,019
Through the chair, may I ask a question?

913
01:41:08,059 --> 01:41:28,906
Does it need to be a presentation or could we just write a joint letter from the Affordable Housing Trust Board requesting that, you know, and thank them in advance for considering and determining an annual percentage of revenue to be distributed to the trust?

914
01:41:30,397 --> 01:41:32,157
so that we can plan accordingly.

915
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:37,399
We have a lot of work that's going on, so that would obviously be the best option for us.

916
01:41:37,419 --> 01:41:48,141
So that night, I'm willing to deliver our message, however we determine is most appropriate.

917
01:41:48,181 --> 01:41:51,842
But also, if anyone else really wants to, I just am available.

918
01:41:53,002 --> 01:41:57,403
Madam Chair, if you prefer, defer to you.

919
01:41:58,684 --> 01:41:59,884
No, I would welcome.

920
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:01,520
I agree.

921
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:05,003
I agree with both maybe just one person and go present the letter from the full trust board.

922
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:40,225
Yeah, well, I'm trying to think what's nimbler than pulling a letter out of this and approving like a letter, right?

923
01:42:41,046 --> 01:42:47,551
They've moved to make this argument with the support of the, is that a motion?

924
01:42:48,032 --> 01:42:49,173
With the support of the past?

925
01:42:49,233 --> 01:42:51,775
Or can you just say like, do you need to use the right tactic?

926
01:42:51,855 --> 01:42:52,435
Okay, great.

927
01:42:52,495 --> 01:42:52,956
Yeah.

928
01:42:54,056 --> 01:43:03,560
Yeah, I would suggest the content of the letter could be to state, you know, thank the committee for the funds that were given last year.

929
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:10,643
And the trust is in the process of developing an action plan to determine how to spend funds going forward.

930
01:43:10,763 --> 01:43:13,644
And what are some additional potential sources of revenue and.

931
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:29,649
that as part of our plan, we need to identify how we're going to work together with the CPC and offer these options that are described here.

932
01:43:30,069 --> 01:43:44,738
And we can also mention that as part of our action plan, we've held, we've received input from stakeholders and from members of the public through our workshop and survey and kind of what are some of the things that we found

933
01:43:45,451 --> 01:43:51,553
And a rough draft mission statement and goals we could mention.

934
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:59,436
And so, I mean, just maybe a two page summary of the whole plan as it is so far.

935
01:44:00,096 --> 01:44:07,839
And then the ask, would you be willing to commit funding for us going forward?

936
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:20,695
I saw you taking diligent notes as Roberta was giving some great feedback on what the letter could be written.

937
01:44:20,715 --> 01:44:37,944
I just wanna make sure that whether who's gonna write the letter and whether, Aditi, please feel free to say no, because I know you're on limited hours, but as the trust staff, were you anticipating writing the letter?

938
01:44:39,449 --> 01:44:40,450
I was, yes.

939
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:43,512
But given the limited hours, I'm not very sure.

940
01:44:43,612 --> 01:44:49,196
And I don't know what the time frame of my transition is going to be at this point.

941
01:44:51,238 --> 01:44:58,383
But if I have a representative from the board, I can probably work with them and then keep them updated.

942
01:44:58,403 --> 01:45:02,225
I would be happy to work with you to do it.

943
01:45:02,265 --> 01:45:04,667
Just I think we should decide which of us drafts first.

944
01:45:04,707 --> 01:45:05,548
So if you want to.

945
01:45:06,863 --> 01:45:11,787
start a volley and then send it back or the reverse, whichever would be honest is easier.

946
01:45:11,807 --> 01:45:17,071
As our chair noted, was vigorously writing down these great ideas.

947
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:19,853
And it was like in the room when a lot of this was drafted.

948
01:45:19,913 --> 01:45:24,456
So frankly, I'd be happy to throw that in and send that your way and then workshop it together.

949
01:45:24,616 --> 01:45:33,943
And then would, am I understanding that you'd be able to circulate it for our approval via email in advance of that meeting, since it is like right before our next meeting?

950
01:45:34,764 --> 01:45:35,885
Yes, I can do that.

951
01:45:36,684 --> 01:45:37,205
Thank you.

952
01:45:38,426 --> 01:45:39,167
Thank you, Penny.

953
01:45:39,207 --> 01:45:40,108
Thank you, Aditi.

954
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:41,109
Thank you, Roberta.

955
01:45:41,129 --> 01:45:56,485
All right, and I think, let's see, we have funding, item five is the funding of the trust, the McCormick Avenue parcels.

956
01:45:57,204 --> 01:46:19,754
We updated the city council about the trust approval to support the sale and the transfer of the Warnick Avenue parcels subject to the city council's approval for the purpose of funding the affordable housing trust fund to establish an affordable housing linkage through a nexus study and support affordable housing developments.

957
01:46:20,954 --> 01:46:22,815
On March 25th, 2025, the city council discussed the matter

958
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:33,110
Aditi, would you provide a brief update about the conversation?

959
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:34,731
Sure.

960
01:46:35,252 --> 01:46:47,963
I think mayor already updated the board earlier this evening, but yes, I was at the meeting and unfortunately the city council didn't vote on it yet.

961
01:46:48,623 --> 01:46:53,708
So they tabled the conversation for an upcoming city council meeting.

962
01:46:56,195 --> 01:47:02,221
But the discussion revolved around selling city-owned parcels.

963
01:47:02,461 --> 01:47:06,505
Would that be really necessary for a one-time nexus study?

964
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:14,253
But we did have support from Councillor Lemming, who

965
01:47:15,557 --> 01:47:24,186
recommended that we sell the McCormick Avenue parcels, but there was no decision taken.

966
01:47:24,507 --> 01:47:32,676
So hopefully in the next CC meeting, there will be a motion to either approve or not.

967
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:36,179
Thank you, Aditi.

968
01:47:36,199 --> 01:47:37,561
You're welcome.

969
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,205
All right.

970
01:47:40,365 --> 01:47:50,200
And then, Penny, would you like to lead the discussion you've already planted a seed already on this about exploring other funding sources that the city may be.

971
01:47:52,022 --> 01:47:52,763
Yeah, absolutely.

972
01:47:52,803 --> 01:47:59,048
So I'm glad for the opportunity to have space to like brainstorm and talk about some opportunities.

973
01:47:59,128 --> 01:48:07,095
So first of all, this was not on my radar before this meeting, but I do think like we want to check in about that remaining CPA money.

974
01:48:07,135 --> 01:48:15,823
And if we want to ask for any and get in that ether of people interested in that approximately 50,000, I think that is overall here.

975
01:48:15,903 --> 01:48:17,385
I'd love to put that on the table.

976
01:48:18,085 --> 01:48:23,687
I also, it's budget season, so I brought up that someone suggested budget allocations.

977
01:48:23,707 --> 01:48:31,991
We've seen some other borough housing trusts that get, for instance, recap allocations or other specific monies to them from the city.

978
01:48:32,111 --> 01:48:44,475
So I guess I haven't watched every budget presentation, but I'm just curious about the appetite or mechanics of that advocacy, if that would be a possibility.

979
01:48:46,427 --> 01:48:47,188
that would be great.

980
01:48:47,468 --> 01:48:59,042
So just throwing those out and I guess the floor is open if there are other funding opportunities that we would need to make decisions about today or thoughts on those too.

981
01:48:59,062 --> 01:49:01,986
Over here.

982
01:49:11,665 --> 01:49:20,772
Would you be willing to draft a paragraph with your ideas and share that with me?

983
01:49:21,873 --> 01:49:33,142
And I could incorporate some ideas about potential funding sources into the draft action plan.

984
01:49:35,854 --> 01:49:56,419
I mean, I don't feel like there's any, for the potential 50,000 CPA, I would say that that is like, if there's an emergency, if we really needed 50,000, which I don't think we'd be ready to award that anyway, it's actually maybe better if the CPC holds onto that.

985
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:03,741
And if there's an emergency, a developer can apply directly to the CPC right before the end of this fiscal year.

986
01:50:06,042 --> 01:50:14,304
July 1, the amount of money that's available potentially increases, but then it would be preferable to wait until the application cycle.

987
01:50:15,084 --> 01:50:24,526
Then it's, then the question is, what is the method by which the CPC will consider how much money to award?

988
01:50:24,546 --> 01:50:26,046
Great.

989
01:50:26,146 --> 01:50:33,147
And then maybe just to context, I think this is kind of in general about funding, less than like the action plan bullets of what we're doing.

990
01:50:33,207 --> 01:50:35,888
So kind of like, yeah, just, I'm specifically thinking

991
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:38,449
coming in the next few months that we might need to think about.

992
01:50:38,889 --> 01:50:46,013
So I just want to talk about the possibility of going back to the CPC for funding.

993
01:50:46,513 --> 01:50:56,178
We anticipate at least one, if not two, developers coming to the table and filling out our NOFAs.

994
01:50:56,198 --> 01:51:04,382
$250,000 is not a lot of money when you're looking at trying to fill a gap into creating

995
01:51:06,607 --> 01:51:16,395
Developing affordable housing, you're talking that's not even a unit that's not that that's like a half a unit that we would be able to fund for that.

996
01:51:16,555 --> 01:51:21,779
And I would imagine the gaps are pretty they're pretty substantial at the moment.

997
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:35,924
does it make sense to actually go to the board, go to the CPC now before we put out our NOFA to see if there is a possibility of putting that out?

998
01:51:35,944 --> 01:51:46,193
I'm really glad you asked because the CPC meeting next week is when they're going to be deciding on a budget for next year.

999
01:51:46,974 --> 01:51:49,676
And unlike Somerville, which usually

1000
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:57,123
free programs, most of its funds to the different program area reserves.

1001
01:51:57,763 --> 01:52:05,388
Medford has typically promised the minimum to each of the areas.

1002
01:52:05,629 --> 01:52:08,671
Sometimes they've doubled the minimum for housing.

1003
01:52:10,672 --> 01:52:18,955
But doubling the minimum for housing still puts us around the $250,000, $350,000 range.

1004
01:52:19,575 --> 01:52:29,960
And if we're hoping for more, next month's meeting would actually be an opportunity to advocate for a higher level of funding.

1005
01:52:32,061 --> 01:52:33,802
Not next month's, next week's meeting.

1006
01:52:33,842 --> 01:52:39,244
Next week's meeting would be to go into the CPC and say, hey, we're expecting

1007
01:52:41,748 --> 01:52:44,950
Yeah, so have we had an idea how much to expect?

1008
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:51,633
I mean, so when the CPC allocates the minimum to each program area,

1009
01:52:52,177 --> 01:53:04,959
That's leaving the maximum flexibility so that in the fall, should they see a big chunk coming at them for housing, they can dedicate most of their funds to that big chunk.

1010
01:53:05,219 --> 01:53:09,960
But if they see a big chunk coming at them for another area, they have that available.

1011
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:11,340
It's the most flexibility.

1012
01:53:12,021 --> 01:53:16,341
So that's why they've done it that way in the past.

1013
01:53:17,902 --> 01:53:19,922
But if we want to advocate for them to

1014
01:53:21,067 --> 01:53:24,809
give housing more weight, they can do that.

1015
01:53:26,629 --> 01:53:44,117
But if we see somebody coming to us, so if we receive multiple responses to the NOFA in September, that just barely aligns with the CPA timeline to apply for funding for next year.

1016
01:53:44,823 --> 01:53:56,750
So this is like what I think we need to discuss with the CPC in May is how are we going to request funding from you?

1017
01:53:56,770 --> 01:53:59,171
No, I understand.

1018
01:53:59,331 --> 01:54:00,352
I hear what you're saying.

1019
01:54:00,412 --> 01:54:00,992
Thank you.

1020
01:54:01,212 --> 01:54:03,093
And that's looking forward.

1021
01:54:03,113 --> 01:54:08,116
I'm looking at the present and I'm looking at we've got a NOFA coming out.

1022
01:54:08,176 --> 01:54:10,277
We're expecting something coming in.

1023
01:54:10,912 --> 01:54:23,279
In June, end of June, we're going to be reviewing it and come July, giving June, July, August, the possibility of the vote.

1024
01:54:23,939 --> 01:54:27,081
If we can go in to the city, if we know 250,000.

1025
01:54:30,129 --> 01:54:38,493
I'll be flabbergasted if the request is less than $250,000 or their need, maybe not their request, but their need is less than 250.

1026
01:54:39,694 --> 01:54:55,462
So we can go in like we were talking about earlier, whether or not to put in the dollar amount, would it make sense to go to the CPC now, ask for the additional, because I do recall when we gave the presentation,

1027
01:54:56,690 --> 01:55:07,574
around this table to the CPC, a lot of the CPC members were like, we would have funded you more there, you know, $250,000 is not a lot of money for housing.

1028
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:20,259
So I'm just trying to figure out like, how can we be able to really fund a development that may be coming to us sooner rather than later.

1029
01:55:20,619 --> 01:55:22,740
So this is what I see.

1030
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:25,021
It's a complication is that

1031
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:37,548
The trust is trying to announce in advance a commitment to how much funding is going to be available, whereas the CPC typically keeps it as flexible as possible.

1032
01:55:38,288 --> 01:55:43,272
And when they see a large application come in, try to accommodate it.

1033
01:55:43,752 --> 01:55:50,136
So from the CPC's perspective, why not, if you receive two requests for $250,000 each in September,

1034
01:55:53,338 --> 01:56:00,803
why wouldn't you just come to the CPC then and ask, put in an off-cycle application for another $250,000?

1035
01:56:00,843 --> 01:56:11,969
So the CPC would receive an application and immediately make a decision based on its merits.

1036
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:20,915
They don't try to plan in advance who might apply for funding and commit to that application before it comes.

1037
01:56:25,156 --> 01:56:26,797
Can I ask a clarifying question?

1038
01:56:26,817 --> 01:56:29,399
But there is still some CPC funding there.

1039
01:56:29,459 --> 01:56:33,762
But if we requested it for something like expanding our NOFA,

1040
01:56:45,045 --> 01:56:51,950
just kind of spitballing, that we're like, here, we're about to put up this bid, we'd love for it to be a bit higher, like, can we have this money for that purpose?

1041
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:56,253
Like, is that advisable, I guess, or even like the way it works?

1042
01:56:56,913 --> 01:57:02,096
And if so, what do we need to do now to move forward on that?

1043
01:57:05,759 --> 01:57:11,583
Because when you're getting a developer an application, a developer is going to ask for

1044
01:57:12,688 --> 01:57:16,090
whatever it is that they're going to ask for.

1045
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:26,475
If we're putting out on our NOFA that we only have $250,000 available, they're only going to, they should only, they know what they do.

1046
01:57:26,495 --> 01:57:29,016
What they do and what they should do is two different things.

1047
01:57:29,036 --> 01:57:33,058
But if you're saying we've got $250,000 and they're going to come in with only a $250,000 and because you cannot,

1048
01:57:40,809 --> 01:57:49,293
vote to give them more than what they asked for, then we're in a pickle where they're coming in, they're asking for $250,000.

1049
01:57:49,353 --> 01:57:57,736
We might not get any applications because the gap, like I said, I will be flabbergasted if $250,000 is enough to close that gap to be able to develop units

1050
01:58:08,027 --> 01:58:18,714
So if we're going with the knowledge or the assumptions that they're going to need more money, then why not ask?

1051
01:58:19,274 --> 01:58:23,016
Because I heard there was available, I heard people are going there for there.

1052
01:58:23,076 --> 01:58:33,403
We're going in with the intention of being able to say, we fully expect a developer to come in and they will be asking for more than we have.

1053
01:58:33,483 --> 01:58:36,785
So we're requesting, like, is there an appetite for it?

1054
01:58:38,893 --> 01:58:56,743
So this is why I would love for the legal advice to say that yes, we can say we estimate that 250,000 is available right now, but we anticipate that there may be more funding available after the fiscal year than

1055
01:59:05,443 --> 01:59:17,605
we see what applications come in and then we go to the CPC and request the gap in funding to be able to say yes to those applications.

1056
01:59:18,485 --> 01:59:29,227
So that would actually, in the four options, that would be option one, is that we have something specific in mind and we go and ask the CPC to fill that gap.

1057
01:59:29,828 --> 01:59:30,428
So I guess,

1058
01:59:33,133 --> 01:59:38,536
I'm just thinking we're not going to get the legal answer before the next meeting.

1059
01:59:38,556 --> 01:59:40,698
I mean, we're talking in circles.

1060
01:59:41,458 --> 01:59:42,159
I'm sorry.

1061
01:59:42,179 --> 01:59:46,121
Can I, as the chair, can I make a motion?

1062
01:59:51,527 --> 01:59:53,909
As the vice chair, do I need to recognize anything?

1063
01:59:54,009 --> 01:59:54,870
I don't know.

1064
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:59,735
I'm asking for clarification.

1065
01:59:59,895 --> 02:00:03,258
Could I get clarification on what?

1066
02:00:04,339 --> 02:00:05,800
Oh, can you make a motion?

1067
02:00:06,081 --> 02:00:06,721
Oh, OK.

1068
02:00:08,183 --> 02:00:14,769
If I wanted to put something up for a vote instead of a discussion, as a chair, can I

1069
02:00:16,917 --> 02:00:23,683
make that motion or do I need to ask Penny to take the chair while I make the motion?

1070
02:00:26,671 --> 02:00:27,871
I would just to be sure.

1071
02:00:29,151 --> 02:00:29,472
I would.

1072
02:00:29,492 --> 02:00:31,532
All right.

1073
02:00:31,592 --> 02:00:33,592
Penny, will you chair the rest of the meeting for me?

1074
02:00:33,652 --> 02:00:34,332
Yes, I will.

1075
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:35,813
I don't think I need help with the agenda.

1076
02:00:35,893 --> 02:00:36,813
It might not be up.

1077
02:00:36,873 --> 02:00:39,893
But I got myself together.

1078
02:00:40,493 --> 02:00:42,334
Okay, great.

1079
02:00:42,434 --> 02:00:44,634
And I'm sorry, I just have to run.

1080
02:00:44,674 --> 02:00:45,894
But thank you, everybody.

1081
02:00:46,034 --> 02:00:47,995
If you need anything from me, just let me know.

1082
02:00:50,295 --> 02:00:51,315
Thank you, Mayor.

1083
02:00:53,016 --> 02:00:55,096
I would like to make a motion.

1084
02:00:57,613 --> 02:01:13,558
to petition the CPC for a minimum of $50,000 so we can be able to add $50,000 to our bank account.

1085
02:01:13,678 --> 02:01:18,159
So I don't think I did that motion very clearly, but I would like to make a motion to

1086
02:01:19,659 --> 02:01:32,834
go to the CPC and put an application in and or a request on an additional $50,000 for our anticipated developers applications.

1087
02:01:33,314 --> 02:01:36,538
I hear a motion from Lisa D. Do I hear a second?

1088
02:01:38,774 --> 02:01:40,215
All right, great.

1089
02:01:40,255 --> 02:01:41,776
Thank you so much.

1090
02:01:41,796 --> 02:01:43,297
So do I need to roll call?

1091
02:01:43,737 --> 02:01:44,678
All right.

1092
02:01:44,758 --> 02:01:47,080
Okay, great.

1093
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,541
So Kayla?

1094
02:01:49,601 --> 02:01:49,962
Yes.

1095
02:01:50,422 --> 02:01:50,862
Roberta?

1096
02:01:51,062 --> 02:01:52,624
Yes.

1097
02:01:53,024 --> 02:01:53,484
Myself?

1098
02:01:53,604 --> 02:01:53,964
Yes.

1099
02:01:54,705 --> 02:01:55,285
Lisa S.?

1100
02:01:55,786 --> 02:01:56,066
Yes.

1101
02:01:57,287 --> 02:01:58,307
Great.

1102
02:01:58,588 --> 02:01:59,869
The mayor has left the meeting.

1103
02:01:59,889 --> 02:02:02,831
Oh, I should notice the mayor left the meeting at 8 p.m.

1104
02:02:03,689 --> 02:02:09,072
And I don't know if we actually noticed when Roberta came and joined the meeting, which was, you know, at 602.

1105
02:02:09,112 --> 02:02:11,693
Okay, so moving along with the roll call on Lisa D. Yes.

1106
02:02:11,733 --> 02:02:11,813
Yes.

1107
02:02:11,833 --> 02:02:11,993
So, okay.

1108
02:02:12,013 --> 02:02:12,133
So, 5.

1109
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:23,858
Yes to absent, the motion passes.

1110
02:02:24,359 --> 02:02:25,479
Perfect, thank you.

1111
02:02:25,639 --> 02:02:37,904
So we will work together to submit a request to the CPC for $50,000 to add to our bank account for anticipated development.

1112
02:02:38,324 --> 02:02:38,964
Great, thank you.

1113
02:02:38,984 --> 02:02:39,365
Thank you.

1114
02:02:40,707 --> 02:02:43,509
Can you chair the rest of the meeting?

1115
02:02:43,669 --> 02:02:56,679
I just wanted to note, and I'm like texting Teresa right now as we speak as the staff person to the CPC, that their meeting is on Tuesday.

1116
02:02:57,299 --> 02:03:08,687
So if we want to make that request, I'm speaking, I'm making a big ask of Teresa and of Aditi to turn around an application

1117
02:03:10,235 --> 02:03:16,959
very quickly to get onto the agenda for the April meeting, if possible.

1118
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:27,685
If we wait until the May meeting, then that delays are being able to put an additional amount onto the NOFA DT.

1119
02:03:28,245 --> 02:03:37,450
Yeah, unfortunately with my limited hours this week, I'm not able to work on the application.

1120
02:03:40,232 --> 02:04:04,031
As DT, is there a way that we could get the application that was previously submitted to the CPC and all we have to do is tweak that application, reduce the ask, and then add a little bit of advantage saying that we are actually decreasing what we are going to be doing because we fully anticipate the need for the developer application.

1121
02:04:04,512 --> 02:04:06,674
Is that something that you can send to us?

1122
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:17,924
Yes, so I believe the CPC application was in a smart sheet format, but I do have the word format of the same and I can share that with the board.

1123
02:04:19,384 --> 02:04:20,325
Could you do that?

1124
02:04:20,385 --> 02:04:20,825
Thank you.

1125
02:04:20,965 --> 02:04:25,647
And because I'm so adamant of going to the CPC, I will.

1126
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:36,893
Tweak the application, I'll send it to you, and if you could send it to the trustees, and then I'll go to the CPC meeting on the 8th.

1127
02:04:37,593 --> 02:04:38,494
It's the 8th, right?

1128
02:04:38,614 --> 02:04:41,054
Am I getting my dates right?

1129
02:04:42,055 --> 02:04:42,435
Yes.

1130
02:04:42,675 --> 02:04:45,476
And present the ask, if that's okay.

1131
02:04:50,622 --> 02:04:56,307
Okay, I'm glad you talked about that funding.

1132
02:04:56,687 --> 02:05:14,222
And I'm sad the mayor left for this part of the conversation, but I am curious in terms of allocations of something like free cash, if we can get some information on what is available and if that is a request that we as a trust are interested in making.

1133
02:05:16,417 --> 02:05:26,745
So is that a request to staff to see what's available, if there is availability of free cash?

1134
02:05:27,245 --> 02:05:29,727
Will they call it free cash in Medford?

1135
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,209
Yes, I think some of them.

1136
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:40,215
I would love to talk about, yeah, on what's available and what the timeline is, if we know right now and can talk about it, and others will figure out.

1137
02:05:41,135 --> 02:05:41,936
We'll go from here.

1138
02:05:43,661 --> 02:05:52,868
I'm wondering if the board can present this request before the committee of the whole or planning and permitting committee.

1139
02:05:53,308 --> 02:05:58,271
These are two subcommittees of the city council and have a discussion there.

1140
02:05:58,291 --> 02:06:06,937
Okay, so you would advise that bringing this issue to one of those bodies is

1141
02:06:08,596 --> 02:06:09,237
subcommittees.

1142
02:06:09,397 --> 02:06:09,737
OK.

1143
02:06:10,057 --> 02:06:11,979
And that's happening now, right?

1144
02:06:11,999 --> 02:06:16,844
Like this month, it's getting to be about budget time, or do you know when that decision is made?

1145
02:06:18,365 --> 02:06:19,687
I don't know yet.

1146
02:06:25,552 --> 02:06:32,098
I'm thinking if it has to get on one of the committee's agenda, then we'd have to work faster.

1147
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:39,323
have a chance to ask from the mayor?

1148
02:06:40,744 --> 02:06:43,807
See, this is exactly the mechanic I'm not sure about.

1149
02:06:44,287 --> 02:06:50,053
Because there have been projects that got a kind of substantial feed funding from a source like this.

1150
02:06:50,173 --> 02:06:54,477
And just if it is available, and it's our first year, it's exciting.

1151
02:06:54,537 --> 02:06:56,618
It could be a real, I think,

1152
02:06:58,637 --> 02:07:03,460
Show commitment and push us in the right direction really robustly.

1153
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:12,605
But again, it's like, for whatever reason, the appetite is not here that we have a lot on our plates, like, politically figuring out where we're at and what our ask is.

1154
02:07:12,745 --> 02:07:15,807
I totally understand that, but just didn't want to leave it on the table.

1155
02:07:16,665 --> 02:07:17,446
Agreed.

1156
02:07:17,606 --> 02:07:37,580
I think maybe what the path would be and maybe this is an area where you could do some advocacy to talk with the city councilor and the subcommittee and talk with the mayor individually and ask each of them if they would support a request for a substantial

1157
02:07:38,557 --> 02:07:45,799
contribution to the trust to capitalize them initially.

1158
02:07:45,819 --> 02:07:54,962
And I would love a sense from others of what a reasonable ask seems like for that or just like a ballpark.

1159
02:07:56,103 --> 02:08:01,505
And then I can do some research on what we're looking at, but.

1160
02:08:01,925 --> 02:08:03,265
Why don't you say a million dollars?

1161
02:08:03,465 --> 02:08:05,206
Oh my god, you're in my head.

1162
02:08:07,418 --> 02:08:09,479
I like it.

1163
02:08:09,499 --> 02:08:10,419
It's clean.

1164
02:08:10,539 --> 02:08:11,159
Great.

1165
02:08:11,659 --> 02:08:13,299
Okay.

1166
02:08:13,519 --> 02:08:23,762
So, just to affirm this is less an official action and request of this trust than... A sounding.

1167
02:08:23,962 --> 02:08:31,803
Encouraging individual trust members to check in with members of these and plant that idea and encourage it.

1168
02:08:31,823 --> 02:08:32,944
Is that what I'm hearing?

1169
02:08:33,564 --> 02:08:33,724
Yeah.

1170
02:08:36,444 --> 02:08:36,684
Great.

1171
02:08:36,805 --> 02:08:42,181
Does anyone have other funding sources for the trust that we need to discuss at this time?

1172
02:08:47,353 --> 02:08:51,295
I don't have, yeah, I don't have timely ideas.

1173
02:08:51,936 --> 02:09:05,484
For McCormick, I might also, I know we went through that agenda item, but I think the previous advice of just connecting with folks and affirming its importance might be, I just, you know, to get it over that finish line.

1174
02:09:05,564 --> 02:09:12,569
I'm curious if others have ideas of how to best support this ask, seeing as that will be on the meeting next Tuesday.

1175
02:09:13,954 --> 02:09:18,177
Yeah, are they still hung up on the idea that it might be developable?

1176
02:09:18,197 --> 02:09:20,338
Or is it just they're not sure?

1177
02:09:22,499 --> 02:09:35,087
So the PDS evaluation was that if the two sites were merged, then they are developable in terms of the zoning approval.

1178
02:09:36,308 --> 02:09:43,533
And that would change how the land is assessed and if that's in the best interest.

1179
02:09:44,117 --> 02:09:48,138
for the city to transfer or convey the city-owned lots.

1180
02:09:49,239 --> 02:09:58,381
And I think the main concern was that for a one-time nexus study, is the city prepared to sell city-owned lots?

1181
02:09:59,021 --> 02:10:03,003
Or would there be other funding sources to fund a nexus study?

1182
02:10:03,783 --> 02:10:07,364
So the city council was not against supporting a nexus study.

1183
02:10:07,764 --> 02:10:11,065
They still want to do a nexus study, I believe.

1184
02:10:11,441 --> 02:10:15,888
But is that the best funding source is what they are wondering?

1185
02:10:17,170 --> 02:10:21,637
Well, could we ask them for the budget allocation for the next study if they don't want to?

1186
02:10:21,798 --> 02:10:23,741
I mean, I get their point.

1187
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:27,881
but then we can't use the funds that we have currently for the next study.

1188
02:10:27,961 --> 02:10:32,743
So without another source, we're kind of, yeah.

1189
02:10:32,884 --> 02:10:37,365
I'm curious, do you remember what that lot would be zoned for?

1190
02:10:37,385 --> 02:10:38,746
So how many potential housing units?

1191
02:10:38,766 --> 02:10:50,111
Cause I do remember a counselor making the argument that like the potential for any housing is more important than like would be, would warrant holding onto it versus, so can you, do you remember?

1192
02:10:50,231 --> 02:10:50,531
Yes.

1193
02:10:51,131 --> 02:10:54,513
So based on the proposed zoning,

1194
02:10:55,264 --> 02:11:03,607
I think the parcels would be under NR1, which would allow one single family unit and an ADU.

1195
02:11:07,949 --> 02:11:08,449
Thank you.

1196
02:11:08,809 --> 02:11:18,212
And then, you know, I think I've heard these arguments and like, I spend a lot of time in other meetings talking about keeping public land in public hands and the importance of that.

1197
02:11:18,872 --> 02:11:22,514
So I definitely understood those like, concerns from counselors.

1198
02:11:22,774 --> 02:11:23,294
I think

1199
02:11:24,273 --> 02:11:37,252
We personally, I keep thinking about where we're at, 250,000 in the bank, we can't develop that land for affordable housing tomorrow or even in a couple of years.

1200
02:11:37,412 --> 02:11:39,535
And if it takes significant, I don't know.

1201
02:11:41,876 --> 02:11:53,746
That was something turning in my head of making a point around that, of like, this will allow us to do more sooner with other things, but I'm curious of others, like, if you want to think a minute of, like, incurring someone.

1202
02:11:53,766 --> 02:12:06,356
A question would be if instead of selling those lots for development, if they were donated to Habitat for Humanity, could Habitat for Humanity build two affordable units on that lot?

1203
02:12:08,998 --> 02:12:10,940
And would that be a better outcome?

1204
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:17,774
I would imagine the city council would be interested to hear that proposal.

1205
02:12:19,295 --> 02:12:19,555
Yeah.

1206
02:12:21,036 --> 02:12:35,389
So the question is whether it would be better for the city to place the buildable lot in the trust so that the trust could convey it to a nonprofit developer.

1207
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:39,052
Would a nonprofit developer develop one

1208
02:12:39,731 --> 02:12:41,613
unit of housing, plus an ADU.

1209
02:12:41,793 --> 02:12:43,134
It would be two.

1210
02:12:43,154 --> 02:12:46,076
It would be a single ADU.

1211
02:12:46,656 --> 02:12:47,897
But they're not separately owned.

1212
02:12:47,997 --> 02:12:50,579
It could be Habitat for Humanity.

1213
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:53,001
It may be entrusted.

1214
02:12:53,502 --> 02:12:57,285
Again, it goes back to dollars.

1215
02:12:57,685 --> 02:13:02,549
If you're going to put something to a nonprofit for development,

1216
02:13:05,017 --> 02:13:09,579
They may not be able to develop it in a timely manner.

1217
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:16,722
Like, it's not going to it's not going to be instant gratification where if you sold, there'll be instant gratification.

1218
02:13:17,762 --> 02:13:20,303
But I like the, I like the idea of the habitat.

1219
02:13:20,383 --> 02:13:22,564
I guess.

1220
02:13:23,004 --> 02:13:24,325
But you just, you just.

1221
02:13:25,045 --> 02:13:33,090
Are you yourself kind of a working group and there are a lot of city on parcels that we're looking at that are so much more suited and ready for this sort of development.

1222
02:13:33,250 --> 02:13:34,030
And so I think, like.

1223
02:13:44,456 --> 02:13:45,457
We want the money, right?

1224
02:13:45,477 --> 02:13:49,319
That's like, we asked for them to approve it for this reason, for the money.

1225
02:13:49,779 --> 02:13:59,485
And so that's, I'm trying to, I kind of was raising it as like, kind of a temporal outlook of the, like, capacity outlook of, like, practicality, how many actual units would it be.

1226
02:13:59,505 --> 02:14:12,293
I'm trying to have more, like, raw points, but anyway, I'm just, I don't know if it doesn't get approved for that, then how to continue the conversation, but I do just think we should,

1227
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:20,012
you know, connect where we can to emphasize that this will help us get off the ground to achieve these things.

1228
02:14:20,072 --> 02:14:25,974
I'm very happy that we have the confidence of the City Council and us pulling it off, but we can't do tomorrow in our current situation.

1229
02:14:26,874 --> 02:14:27,114
Yeah.

1230
02:14:27,974 --> 02:14:28,914
All right.

1231
02:14:29,675 --> 02:14:31,135
Thank you.

1232
02:14:31,175 --> 02:14:39,217
Does anybody else have any other ideas of other funding sources or advocacy for other funding sources?

1233
02:14:43,333 --> 02:14:47,377
On to item number 6, adjournment.

1234
02:14:48,397 --> 02:14:49,318
Ending the meeting.

1235
02:14:49,839 --> 02:14:52,721
Do I get a motion to adjourn the meeting?

1236
02:14:55,023 --> 02:14:55,443
Nobody?

1237
02:14:55,463 --> 02:14:56,144
I said no.

1238
02:14:56,164 --> 02:14:57,105
So I said no to end the meeting.

1239
02:15:02,527 --> 02:15:03,488
Second.

1240
02:15:04,088 --> 02:15:06,850
Okay, we'll have a vote to adjourn.

1241
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:08,130
Kayla?

1242
02:15:08,471 --> 02:15:08,991
Aye.

1243
02:15:09,091 --> 02:15:09,832
Roberta?

1244
02:15:10,512 --> 02:15:10,652
Aye.

1245
02:15:10,912 --> 02:15:11,392
Penny?

1246
02:15:11,473 --> 02:15:11,693
Yes.

1247
02:15:12,073 --> 02:15:13,054
Lisa Sung?

1248
02:15:13,554 --> 02:15:13,894
Yes.

1249
02:15:15,295 --> 02:15:18,477
And the mayor's left, so me, yes.

1250
02:15:18,717 --> 02:15:21,259
The meeting is adjourned at 8.15.

1251
02:15:22,439 --> 02:15:24,721
Thank you guys for a fantastic meeting.

1252
02:15:24,961 --> 02:15:25,861
Great discussion.

1253
02:15:25,901 --> 02:15:26,222
Thank you.
