    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=11.776s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=14.818s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=15.398s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=15.678s">None</a>  absent this meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=17.299s">There'll</a>  be a meeting in the Medford City Council Committee the whole at 7pm in the city council chamber second floor Medford City Hall 85 George B has to drive Medford, Massachusetts and by zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=26.425s">The</a>  purpose of this meeting is to discuss paper <a href="../resolutions/24-045.pdf"><font color="green">24-045</font></a>, the annual budget process for fiscal 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=32.206s">This</a>  is preliminary budget meeting seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=34.427s">This</a>  is the seventh preliminary budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=36.267s">The</a>  mayor has communicated the following departments will be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=38.788s">The</a>  health department, Medford public schools, and the department of planning development and sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=43.489s">We</a>  will be hearing first from the health department, and then we will go to the schools and planning and development sustainability, unless planning development sustainability makes it in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=53.491s">So</a>  we will go first to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=56.272s">Director</a>  O'Connor, welcome back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=57.992s">You</a>  feel free to sit if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=61.393s">And</a>  what I'm going to do, if you haven't been watching the Barnburner budget meetings we've been having, is I'm going to read the fiscal 24 budget, the fiscal 25 budget, any headcount changes, and then I'll go through the change sheet on the back, and then I'll turn it over to you to fill in anything that I missed, to share your narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=81.136s">And</a>  also, one thing we'd love to hear is if there's stuff that your department would like to be doing, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=85.337s">that</a>  you didn't request in this budget that you are hoping to get in future budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=89.422s">That</a>  is definitely a priority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=91.264s">We</a>  know it's a tough budget year, but we also know there's a lot of needs in the city that need to be met. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=96.83s">So</a>  we'd love to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=98.551s">But</a>  with that, I will start us off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=101.214s">We</a>  have Department 510, 519, that is our Board of Health and Animal Control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=106.007s">Fiscal</a>  24 budget $776,510. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=106.347s">Fiscal</a>  25 proposed budget $806,185.93. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=116.584s">The</a>  fiscal 24 headcount was 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=119.185s">The</a>  proposed fiscal 25 headcount is 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=121.806s">I</a>  believe that's a reduction of one part-time nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=125.247s">And</a>  the entire increase from fiscal 24 to fiscal 25 is a fixed cost growth increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=132.55s">No</a>  new programs are being planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=134.991s">This</a>  is an increase due to 2% non-union pay increases, step increases, and two employees who are fully funded through ARPA <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=143.954s">who</a>  are now going to be funded 50% through ARPA and 50% through the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=148.716s">And</a>  those are offset again by a decrease in the part-time employees and some very minor changes in the ordinary expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=155.84s">And</a>  with that, I will turn it over to you, Director O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=158.762s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=159.462s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=160.983s">Yes,</a>  we've had some vacant positions for a while now, but that's starting to work out and we're <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=166.104s">We're</a>  going to be hiring an additional inspector starting on June 3rd, as well as our manager of prevention and outreach will be starting on June 3rd.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=173.671s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=174.352s">The</a>  microphone may not be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=177.182s">Are</a>  you seeing the light? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=178.083s">It's</a>  green. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=178.443s">It</a>  is on? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=178.903s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=179.423s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=179.683s">Sorry</a>  about that, thank you.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=180.564s">Is</a>  that better? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=182.785s">So</a>  yes, so we've had some vacant positions for a little bit now as far as the inspectors go, but that's looking better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=187.808s">We're</a>  gonna be hiring another inspector coming on on June 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=191.75s">Also</a>  our new prevention and outreach manager will be starting on June 3rd as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=196.233s">So</a>  that's a really big help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=198.134s">But</a>  I'm very grateful that we've added a couple of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=201.816s">Our</a>  community social worker, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=204.017s">and</a>  some additional administrative support who were funded by opera but now we'll be going on to the general fund so I'm very grateful that we're getting to where we need to be and I believe that that's what this budget shows a lot of the work we're able to do though through our prevention and outreach workers is funded through grant work we were lucky enough to get a $500,000 foundation grant <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=227.8s">This</a>  year in addition to MVP grid, which supports our community and climate resilience work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=234.889s">So</a>  we're very grateful about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=236.911s">We</a>  also will be now tapping into our opioid funds going forward to help with our recovery coach, and also our recovery support programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=248.504s">And</a>  then we also are a part of a what's called a regional public health excellence grant with four other communities, which again allows us to supplement a lot of the work that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=261.172s">And</a>  we're going to be getting that for the next five years so we've been lucky to use that to help with additional food inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=269.317s">We're</a>  going to be bringing on an epidemiologist for the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=273.299s">and</a>  also a communications person for the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=275.94s">So</a>  that's all gonna be handled by that grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=277.92s">So</a>  that's all work that I was looking forward to doing, especially the epidemiologists, it's very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=283.782s">But</a>  of course, we're still dealing with our inspectional side of life and trying to address all of the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=291.703s">And</a>  again, that new inspector coming on June 3rd will certainly be helpful in that regards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=299.465s">So</a>  I think that's it, if there's any questions.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=303.337s">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=304.478s">Councilor</a>  Tsengh. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=306.139s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=306.96s">Would</a>  you be able to speak to the community liaison program if we're going to be able to keep that on?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=313.342s">Yes,</a>  so the community liaison program again is going to be funded through, still through APRA, but also now supplemented by that Ba Foundation grant I talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=325.146s">So</a>  we'll be able to keep on the community liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=328.447s">Our</a>  MVP with our community connectors, that grant ends at the end of June, but we have submitted a new grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=335.849s">Unfortunately,</a>  we won't <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=336.809s">probably</a>  hear from that until September. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=339.39s">So</a>  again, we're hoping to use these BAH Foundation funds to tide us over with the connectors for the summer months until we are awarded and I'm being very positive that we will be awarded that next round of funding in September.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=351.837s">I'm</a>  glad to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=352.797s">I</a>  think that was one of the priorities of the council, as well as hiring, making sure we were able to hire a prevention outreach coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=360.359s">I'm</a>  very happy to hear that we've made a lot of progress on that, that we'll have someone starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=365.04s">I'm</a>  excited to welcome them to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=367.58s">I</a>  think that's all I have for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=370.881s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=372.742s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=373.482s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=375.336s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here as always, and for walking us through the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=381.122s">It's</a>  always great to hear about how certain positions and capacity in the city are being funded by grant funding I know that your office always does a really great job of leveraging that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=391.072s">Just</a>  a quick clarification on some of the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=395.737s">You</a>  walked us through the community social worker and the administrative support that's being funded through some of the grants that you just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=402.101s">I</a>  saw that one of the part-time nurses looks like it's coming offline, or maybe that was just reallocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=407.845s">Could</a>  you speak to that?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=408.965s">So</a>  the part-time nurse monies was reallocated to assist with the community social worker position, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=416.31s">But</a>  we have, again, a revolving account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=420.232s">That's</a>  our vaccine account, dispensing account, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=424.995s">We</a>  in need of a part-time nurse, mostly through those flu seasons when we're doing those clinics and such to help Jillian with those clinics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=433.38s">So</a>  we were able to look at that fund that we have and decided we could use that money to assist with any part-time nursing staff that she might need.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=443.899s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=444.8s">And</a>  just to clarify, so is that monies that are available for a seasonal nurse or is that it's it's more appropriate to use that funding for the community social worker at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=452.505s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=454.306s">Just</a>  to make sure I understood you correctly, is it that the being for are being put towards a seasonal nurse like during the like the flu season or is it that it's being reallocated to the social worker?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=463.132s">So</a>  the monies for the seasonal nurse during the flu seasons will be coming from the vaccine account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=467.256s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=468.017s">And</a>  the money that was in the budget for the part time nurse was reallocated to the community social worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=474.824s">So</a>  it makes it.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=475.725s">Yes,</a>  it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=476.246s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=476.526s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=476.826s">I</a>  think the AC makes it even harder to hear the normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=479.509s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=480.83s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=483.683s">President</a>  Piazza, my question might not be for you, Mr. O'Connor, but I'm looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=487.125s">I</a>  know that I might have missed it, but I know that we lost a valuable member of our team here to a new position, but our outreach manager for prevention and outreach, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=504.361s">Do</a>  you know if we're filling that position or if it's been filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=507.362s">Oh,</a>  that's great, okay.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=508.083s">Yeah,</a>  it's been filled, should be beginning on June 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=510.483s">Oh,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=510.844s">Now,</a>  will it be under your department? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=512.904s">Oh,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=513.525s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=514.905s">Obviously,</a>  big shoes to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=516.186s">He</a>  was amazing, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=517.306s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=518.127s">Okay,</a>  that's all I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=518.927s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=520.147s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=520.688s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=523.409s">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=525.029s">As</a>  a newbie councilor, there are a number of canine services, canine workers maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=530.592s">I'm</a>  just curious about this.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=532.461s">So</a>  animal control falls under the health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=535.963s">So</a>  canine services, that's kind of funny, canine services, dog kennel, I guess I should say, is that what it says, dog kennel canine services? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=545.347s">Yeah,</a>  that also includes Eastern Middlesex mosquito control contract, which it's kind of funny that it's under, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=555.051s">canine</a>  services but but that's about $27,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=558.493s">Yeah,</a>  so that actually went up, it goes up every year so this year it's a little over 27,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=564.935s">But</a>  we do also have to pay for dog kennel services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=569.017s">If</a>  we pick up a stray dog if we pick up a dangerous dog if you know so we do have to pay for for boarding for dogs that we pick up.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=584.788s">Very</a>  quickly, because we've already had meetings on this topic, but I know some residents are curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=591.313s">On</a>  the topic of rodent prevention, we're working on ordinances on our front to help with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=597.518s">Your</a>  office has been doing a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=598.919s">Does</a>  this budget allow you to keep doing the work that you need to do to work on education and mitigation when it comes to rodents?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=607.372s">Yes,</a>  in our budget we have some money spread aside for another service and professional services for the education and the outreach, but we are going to be looking to and I'm working with Mike Roberts to come up with a contract and possibly go out to pitch, so that we can come up with a contract that would address professional services through I believe 2026.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=628.744s">Thank</a>  you for saying any further questions by members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=636.328s">So</a>  you know, I have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=639.109s">Number</a>  one, could you say like, and it doesn't have to be exact, but approximately how much of the programming of the health department is grant funded?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=650.551s">I</a>  would say probably equal match. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=654.112s">Yeah,</a>  so this budget really goes to the environmental side of life and the animal control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=661.694s">And</a>  then the grant funding really funds all of our prevention and outreach work.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=667.433s">And</a>  is that grant funding stable and reliable? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=673.515s">And</a>  I guess we love the prevention outreach work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=676.816s">We</a>  want to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=677.877s">So</a>  how reliable and stable is the grant funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=680.217s">And</a>  how much, you know, if you're thinking about if the grants were all gone tomorrow, how much of that would you want to bring on to the general fund so that we could keep doing it?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=689.902s">Well,</a>  grants are pretty hefty right now but one of them is a regional grant which is $250,000 a year but again that's a regional grant for five communities to address use substance use the $500,000 is over the next three years to help with the climate change work and resiliency work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=707.56s">You</a>  know, that won't be sustainable if we don't get the next round of MVP which is would be after this but the state has really touted our program as kind of one of the model programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=717.306s">So</a>  I'd find it highly unlikely that we wouldn't get funding to continue, but again that's $200,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=724.911s">So,</a>  you know, and then the opioid funding, the opioid funding will be coming for the next <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=730.495s">been</a>  over a decade or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=733.682s">And</a>  that if we budgeted out, right, we're looking probably to about 100 to $150,000 a year.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=740.014s">So</a>  the opioid's pretty stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=742.315s">The</a>  state funding for resiliency is, we have it for about three years, but we would need to have that renewed, otherwise that would go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=752.239s">And</a>  then some of the grants are even shorter term than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=755.861s">And</a>  this is probably a leading question, but I'm guessing you'd want to keep doing all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=760.443s">Yes,</a>  of course, yes.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=761.263s">That's</a>  a very important part of public health, yes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=764.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=764.464s">I</a>  appreciate just understanding that and understanding typically half of the work of our health department that we see isn't coming out of the general fund right now, which I think is a testament. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=773.087s">I</a>  think finding those grants is great, but we're not talking about doing something a one-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=778.189s">We're</a>  talking about things we want to keep doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=780.61s">And</a>  sometimes grant funding doesn't always, isn't always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=784.511s">So</a>  any further questions from members of the council for our director of the health department? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=793.698s">Seeing</a>  none, are there any questions or comments by members of the public on the health department budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=802.862s">Seeing</a>  no one in the room and no hands raised on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=808.43s">I</a>  think we're all set, Director O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=810.992s">Civil</a>  defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=812.052s">We</a>  do have to do civil defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=813.853s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=815.334s">The</a>  one thing I want to say also, if we do see a significant difference between what we talked about tonight and what we get in the budget proposal, not that we expect that, but if we do, we may invite you back here in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=826.399s">This</a>  is a new budget process, and we've been really working hard with the administration to do things a bit earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=832.181s">That's</a>  why you're here in May, before we've seen the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=835.936s">You</a>  know, if the administration wants to have you back, or if you want to come back, or if we want you to come back, we could see you again in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=842.7s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=843.44s">Civil</a>  defense, we have fiscal 24 budget, $9,390. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=848.143s">Fiscal</a>  25 budget, $9,840. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=851.205s">And</a>  this looks like it is just an increase in the public safety supplies and the dues, conferences, and travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=863.492s">And</a>  if there's anything else you want to share on that.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=867.087s">No,</a>  the dues, conferences, and travel, we are also part of, even though we're beginning to establish our local emergency planning committee, we've already this year able to start our internal team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=879.954s">The</a>  dues, conferences, and travel goes to the regional emergency planning committee, the Mystic Valley Regional Emergency Planning Committee, so there are membership dues to belong to that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=894.215s">All</a>  right, any questions, Councilor Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=895.876s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=897.318s">So,</a>  Connor, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=898.799s">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=899.44s">I</a>  know I mentioned it to the chief of staff on Saturday, we did the tour of the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=904.884s">Have</a>  we connected with the auxiliary group and told them that we're moving on?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=912.13s">Joe</a>  and I, yes, we have had discussions, but we are meeting with the mayor on May 28th in the afternoon, next Tuesday, I believe.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=919.217s">Okay,</a>  so still might proceed.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=922.499s">We're</a>  looking at and they seem to be very interested in pursuing the Medical Reserve Corps route.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=931.043s">So</a>  they wouldn't need the trucks and all the apparatus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=935.224s">I</a>  know that I know the chief was also reaching out to let them know that they're trying to find there was some equipment that they said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=941.767s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=942.027s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=942.927s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=943.308s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=944.208s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=945.448s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=949.138s">Seeing</a>  none, any questions from members of the public on civil defense? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=953.141s">Seeing</a>  none, I will just say up at the station in the Heights, there's some great civil defense stuff from about 1953. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=958.926s">So</a>  if you want some old blood transfusion kits or 60 year old biscuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=964.711s">Yeah,</a>  that was pretty wild to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=970.055s">That</a>  was just, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=971.076s">So,</a>  you know, didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=974.545s">Hi,</a>  member of the public, do you want to comment on the health department?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=977.126s">I</a>  want to ask a question regarding the health department.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=980.228s">Sure,</a>  you can make a comment to me and it's up to the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=984.35s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=985.911s">If</a>  you could let, yes, you can sit down and give your name and address for the record and happy to hear your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=995.748s">You</a>  can direct your comments to me and then we'll go back to the director.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=999.169s">No,</a>  I'm a nice person.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1000.41s">No,</a>  no, no, no, it's just, it's a formality. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1003.851s">It's</a>  totally just technically all comments have to go through the chair.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1006.732s">All</a>  right, my name is Dana Ralberto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1009.353s">I'm</a>  596 High Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1011.774s">And</a>  the reason why I wanted to ask regarding the health department, does that have to do with the rat situation?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1018.816s">It</a>  does.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1019.256s">Because</a>  I have a bad problem in my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1022.457s">I</a>  practically fist fight them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1025.296s">I've</a>  had the exterminator come out twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1028.178s">I've</a>  called Amelia at City Hall here that works in the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1032.86s">She</a>  had someone come out, but they weren't that helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1036.522s">They</a>  just came and left, looked around and said, oh, everything looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1041.425s">I</a>  set traps left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1043.126s">I</a>  catch them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1044.827s">It's</a>  getting to be like, they're like part of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1048.609s">They're</a>  like residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1049.49s">I'm</a>  gonna have to start naming them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1052.682s">It's</a>  terrible, I know I live in an old home, it's in the 1800s, I go around, I block holes, they just seem to find a way in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1061.384s">But</a>  they are everywhere, it's not just in my house, I'll go walk my dog, they're at Duggar Park, they're everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1069.806s">So</a>  I was wondering, I didn't know what to do or whatever, 596 High Street.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1076.148s">So</a>  I can share a couple things and then the director, however you would like to share, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1081.397s">You</a>  know, we have been working, the director shared a little bit earlier about road and control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1085.538s">Some</a>  things we've done is we've passed an ordinance a couple of years ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1089.42s">We</a>  require any new construction to have a pest management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1094.901s">We've</a>  been trying to build in more and more as much as we can on the road and control with the guidance and advice of the health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1101.984s">Beyond</a>  that, that's really our role in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1104.644s">Definitely</a>  director O'Connor is the person to talk to or the health office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1109.801s">It</a>  may behoove us if you have a minute to talk after the testimony, if that's all right with you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1115.485s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1115.665s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1116.526s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1117.086s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1117.587s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1117.887s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1120.469s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1121.409s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1121.89s">Any</a>  further comments on the health department or civil defense? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1128.034s">Seeing</a>  none, thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1129.175s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1129.735s">Go</a>  Celtics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1133.738s">Celtics</a>  won. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1135.019s">I</a>  would. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1136.44s">Wouldn't</a>  it be nice right here in the big screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1141.203s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1142.184s">Give</a>  me one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1145.127s">I</a>  want to see if we have Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1148.93s">I</a>  think, sadly, we're not going to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1153.459s">PDS</a>  will go after the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1155.74s">So</a>  next we'll hear from Metro Public Schools, our superintendent, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, and our director of finance are here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1165.125s">We</a>  have some school committee members in the chamber and on Zoom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1169.046s">So</a>  excited to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1173.869s">It's</a>  a little different here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1174.929s">So</a>  for every department that we've heard up until this point, the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1181.687s">looks</a>  at line item budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1183.247s">For</a>  the school, Medford Public Schools, there's a different process, obviously, because there is a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1189.169s">So</a>  what happened so far, the school committee has done its process of developing a budget along with the school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1196.351s">Last</a>  night, the school committee made a formal request to the city of Medford for an amount that is budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1205.093s">The</a>  mayor will then allocate an amount for the Medford Public Schools and the City Council only has the authority to approve that amount or to cut that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1214.94s">We</a>  cannot increase it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1216.101s">We</a>  cannot approve the budget that the school committee requested last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1219.923s">All</a>  we can do is approve or cut the mayor's request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1223.205s">So</a>  that's how the process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1225.007s">I</a>  appreciate some of the outreach that we've gotten today asking us to approve the school committee's request that was proposed last night, but that's not how general law process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1233.752s">So</a>  I just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1234.953s">make</a>  that clear before we started. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1236.914s">Um,</a>  that certainly doesn't mean that I think many of the people behind this rail certainly support the request of the school committee and support funding our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1245.577s">So</a>  with that, I will turn it over to you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1249.778s">I</a>  just wanna very quickly, um, I could pull it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1256.087s">Just</a>  note that the school committee requests the municipal government for fiscal 25 was $79,399,774. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1262.249s">That's</a>  an increase from the fiscal 24 general fund request of $71,200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1264.55s">And</a>  with that, Madam Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1277.998s">Good</a>  evening, Council President Bears and distinguished members of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1284.282s">I</a>  am pleased to be here this evening to present our annual budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1290.905s">I</a>  am the proud superintendent of Medford Public Schools, and my name is Dr. Marie Sedgwick-Vinson, and this evening I am here with Mr. Gerald McHugh, affectionately known as Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1301.732s">He</a>  is our finance director, and so he will be going through a slide deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1307.515s">to</a>  present the school committee's recommended number of $79,399,774 to you this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1314.837s">And</a>  at the end of this presentation, we are prepared to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1317.078s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1317.698s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1319.099s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. McHugh.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1343.247s">Yeah,</a>  we we we <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1345.99s">We</a>  had a number of issues we're trying to deal with in the budget this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1350.251s">We</a>  had our collective bargaining agreements, of course, that are legal obligation of the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1360.735s">We</a>  have all these positions that are integral to the operations of the school department on ESSA funding, which has expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1370.818s">We</a>  identified a number of accounts <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1374.319s">for</a>  a variety, I guess for whatever reason, were kind of chronically underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1382.685s">The</a>  budgets were not aligned to the historic spending in these accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1389.95s">And</a>  then we have a new spending request to shore up the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1400.317s">The</a>  increase is significant, but I think it's based on a level service budget to keep the school department going in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1415.864s">So</a>  just a couple of data points that we look at as we try to develop the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1427.033s">The</a>  first one is enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1432.816s">The</a>  school system is showing some growth at the lower grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1438.098s">We</a>  had some high kindergarten this year that were addressed, and our projections will continue to show some growth in the elementary grades, although next year's grade two is somewhat of an outlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1456.579s">I</a>  would, my thinking on that is that those students were just going into kindergarten as school systems were kind of coming out of remote learning and back into classrooms, and that might have affected those kindergartens in that year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1479.893s">But</a>  kindergarten is something that we continue to monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1485.456s">We</a>  note that the registration activity at the Brooks School is high for this time of year, so we're looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1494.342s">The</a>  other three elementary schools, the kindergartens are more or less on track for what we're predicting in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1504.669s">And</a>  we continue to see slight declines in the middle school and high school enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1511.981s">The</a>  other thing, and so these are totals for each grade group. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1518.366s">You</a>  can see that we're expecting, on a total basis, a very slight increase, but you can see in the grades one through five, the growth that I talked about, and then the declines in the upper grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1540.305s">The</a>  next slide is on foundation budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1544.287s">So</a>  we anxiously await the recommendation of the governor in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1551.73s">Unfortunately,</a>  it wasn't great news for MedFed in terms of Chapter 78 and FY 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1560.894s">the</a>  city, I believe the chapter 78, went up about three and a half million dollars, and I was hoping that we'd see a similar bump, but we could see that the foundation enrollment declined from FY24 to FY25, so that caused MedFed to be in kind of a minimum student aid category, where <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1587.683s">your</a>  Chapter 78 is hold harmless, even though it should theoretically go down, because enrollment went down, the state always has a hold harmless clause for Chapter 78, so you'll at least get the amount you got the prior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1604.697s">And</a>  then typically there's a $30 per student minimum aid, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1613.573s">that</a>  school systems qualify for if they're not eligible for Chapter 78. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1622.7s">And</a>  typically what happens is the state calculates a foundation budget, which they use standard per pupil rates for all kinds of spending that school departments engage in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1636.09s">and</a>  they multiply that out across the enrollment and there's different rates for different things in high schools and elementary grades and pre-K. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1646.297s">That</a>  all rolls up to a foundation budget and then the state determines through formulas how much of that foundation budget <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1655.163s">will</a>  the city of Medford be required to contribute to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1659.647s">And</a>  then the difference between the foundation budget and the required contribution is what the foundation aid is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1669.366s">There</a>  was some good news, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1673.027s">The</a>  House budget, when passed, provided an increase in minimum student aid from $30 to $104 per student, and this resulted in an increase of $470,000 in Chapter 70 funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1690.53s">The</a>  Senate Ways and Means Committee released its budget, I think, towards the end of last week, and they're debating it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1699.171s">And</a>  the House Ways and Means budget also includes the $104 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1707.333s">So</a>  we're not gonna know for certain how much we'll get in Chapter 70 until the budget passes and the Governor signs the budget, but this means that it's very likely that that will be the Chapter 70 funding for MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1728.922s">And</a>  this is just a snapshot of our current staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1733.224s">Most</a>  of the staff, as you would imagine, is within the teaching, nursing, and council ranks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1742.108s">And</a>  we have a complement of paraprofessionals that assist in the instruction of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1753.01s">So</a>  when we developed the budget, as I said, we looked at four categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1759.596s">And</a>  the first one was, what are our obligations to our staff in terms of collective bargaining agreements? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1767.984s">We</a>  have a number of our agreements in force right now through FY25 and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1775.691s">And</a>  those agreements we project in FY25 will increase our salary budgets by a little over $3.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1785.435s">And</a>  then we are creating a salary reserve for three contracts that are up at the end of FY24. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1797.18s">So</a>  the total salary increase is just slightly over $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1805.629s">The</a>  next area is these accounts that were historically underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1811.652s">For</a>  instance, homeless transportation, which is hard to predict, and I don't know if the council is aware, but there's a requirement, and I'm in complete support of this, is there's a requirement that if a family becomes homeless, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1831.661s">the</a>  students in the school system can remain in that school system and you're obligated to transport those students from wherever they wind up back to their home school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1845.251s">And</a>  those charges are split between the sending district and the district that was formerly the home of that family. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1863.002s">We</a>  have been running, spending in this account has been running $500,000, $600,000 a year, but yet the budget is $130,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1879.076s">There</a>  was an argument to be made that you don't know really if you're gonna have the same level of transportation need for homeless as you do from one year to the next, but when you start to establish a trend, you have to address that in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1893.019s">And</a>  similar with these other accounts, substitute coverage, these are accounts that typically run over their budgeted amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1904.203s">So</a>  it's really imperative that we try to get these accounts properly funded, because it just starts, you start the school year with a deficit, in the event that all things being equal, you kind of spend your money the way you budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1924.716s">The</a>  next area that we looked at was ESSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1929.079s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1934.147s">You</a>  know, as I stated, we had a number of positions that are integral to the operations of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1942.052s">Of</a>  course, a lot of ESSA funding was spent to support students during COVID and support the re-entry into the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1952.919s">I</a>  mean, it seems it's not that long ago, but there was so many protocols that had to be implemented to ensure that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1961.565s">students</a>  were safe in school and that we could mitigate any contagious students and properly care for them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1976.456s">So</a>  we have a number of positions, several of our new newcomer program positions were funded on ESSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1983.801s">We</a>  have adjustment Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1987.484s">All</a>  our school-based substitute teachers were funded in this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=1999.793s">Grants</a>  manager was funded in this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2004.758s">We</a>  are providing funding for those positions in the general fund this year, as well as some paraprofessional positions that are funded in a revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2017.842s">We're</a>  seeking to move those positions again over to general fund because the current funding is not sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2033.102s">And</a>  then there's a variety of new spending, our special education outplacements are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2040.006s">There's</a>  the state approved tuition increase of 4.7% for our outplacement programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2048.59s">And</a>  then we have some modest growth within those outplacement ranks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2053.673s">So</a>  that's almost $460,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2054.413s">We</a>  have a network equipment budget <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2062.677s">for</a>  a school district that's entire student body and staff have devices now and the budget is $30,000 to maintain the network. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2075.526s">So</a>  we're seeking to increase that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2079.588s">And</a>  also we have a need to refresh our Chromebook inventory and our MacBooks that are allocated to staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2093.997s">Also,</a>  buildings and grounds would benefit from new spending so we can provide for project management. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2106.86s">We</a>  really need to do a space use study in our schools to avoid overcrowding that we're experiencing, particularly in the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2120.023s">and</a>  just kind of get some baseline data so we can start to think about some facilities master planning in the future, possibly redistricting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2130.651s">But</a>  we should make sure that we're using all the classroom space that was built with the intention of being a classroom as a classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2141.38s">And</a>  then we're also asking for two additional school buses, there was a lot of concern at the beginning of the school year about overcrowding on buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2153.156s">We</a>  think that can be solved with the addition of two school bus yellow buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2160.357s">and</a>  some school supply increases and other, also there's a request to add a payroll supervisor and a HR assistant to build capacity in those areas and to provide some management to manage the, to plan out the work of those departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2186.801s">So</a>  that results in an increase of almost $8.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2191.448s">We</a>  identified some opportunities with <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2202.845s">fund</a>  balances in our revolving accounts to charge, at least for this school year, two teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2212.867s">That</a>  constitutes about $200,000 of that 469 number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2218.969s">And</a>  then we will implement a plan to recover some administrative and facilities expenses that we <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2234.132s">that</a>  are being used by programs that charge fees so that we can kind of recover some of those costs through those fee programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2247.603s">And</a>  that when those additional resources are deducted, you come up with a budget of $79.4 million.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2264.397s">Thank</a>  you, Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2266.158s">So</a>  just before we go to questions from Councilors, I'm going to summarize once again the process here and some of the key numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2271.043s">There's</a>  a lot of great information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2274.325s">Really</a>  appreciate your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2277.268s">So,</a>  the request by the school committee as of last night is 79.4 million let's let's round up by a couple hundred bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2287.665s">Now</a>  pursuant to the council's, the new city budget ordinance, I believe that the mayor provided an initial estimated allocation to the school system about in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2300.887s">And</a>  that was 73.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2302.728s">That</a>  was the initial estimate of what they believe the city could provide at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2309.069s">So</a>  that's a pretty big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2310.449s">It's</a>  almost $6 million between what was requested by the school committee and the initial estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2317.179s">I</a>  want to add just a couple more pieces of context. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2320.28s">I</a>  believe the district, as you indicated in your letter, had proposed a $76.7 million budget, which changed the school committee recommended this full budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2330.045s">That</a>  $76.7 million included the variety of potential cuts that you had determined and were discussed at the school committee earlier this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2337.108s">Maybe</a>  it was end of April, but a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2342.051s">And</a>  I also know that the administration has been working to try to increase that 73.5 million through finding other essentially changes on other city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2353.278s">So,</a>  I just wanted to put that context in play, but really. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2357.338s">What</a>  has been going around the community a lot has been a discussion of the initial kind of batch of proposed cuts, which got to that 76.7 million number, the school committee has requested the 79.4 million which would, I don't want to get into specific line items because we don't control that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2374.056s">to</a>  avoid many of those cuts if that $79.4 million was received. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2379.258s">But</a>  the estimate was all the way down at $73.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2382.339s">So</a>  we have essentially a $6 million need to avoid the cuts that have already been discussed, a $3-something million need to pass a budget that includes those cuts that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2395.462s">And</a>  then if it's below that $76.7, we're talking about finding even more cuts beyond what was discussed at the meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2404.386s">earlier</a>  a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2406.007s">So</a>  I just wanted to put that context out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2407.468s">And</a>  then again, procedurally, the school committee has made a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2411.771s">We</a>  are hearing from you a description of that request we will receive in the official budget proposal by the mayor and allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2419.635s">And</a>  at that point, we can just approve or cut that total allocation to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2424.739s">So</a>  that really is the council's role in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2427.6s">And</a>  the mayor is the one who will propose the allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2430.919s">And</a>  it will be somewhere between the $73.5 million, which would require even more cuts that have been already discussed, and the $79.4 million, which would fully fund this request and wouldn't include the cuts you described. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2444.287s">So</a>  if you have anything you want to add to what I just said, I'd appreciate the context. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2447.869s">But</a>  I just wanted to kind of summarize where we're at.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2450.41s">I</a>  know that that's accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2454.71s">The,</a>  we decided that we had to, we had an obligation to see what kind of savings we could generate, knowing that we're not gonna be business as usual, you know, with cuts, given the gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2474.437s">that</a>  we had between the initial allocation that we got from the city and what the actual need for a level services budget is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2483.92s">So</a>  we did go through an exercise of trying to use criteria to make some strategic cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2494.023s">There</a>  was, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2496.753s">significant</a>  feedback from the community during our two budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2502.736s">Of</a>  course, no one and people are advocating, you know, as they should for different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2512.88s">We</a>  did present a package of $2.2 million worth of cuts that was <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2518.442s">almost</a>  exclusively staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2521.484s">We</a>  didn't want to get into a whole host of cuts around programs and curriculum and instructional needs beyond what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2537.053s">So</a>  we did identify another $2.7 million that we had a gap between <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2544.137s">if</a>  you went with the $2.3 million increase plus $2.1 million in cuts, so those... That's the $73.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2552.709s">Right,</a>  and another round of cuts will be significant, but we also recognize that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2563.382s">Council</a>  has a lot of has the whole city and its residents to be thinking about when you put a budget together so we're hoping you can do the best you can with that budget but we will have a balanced budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2581.813s">You</a>  know, with the appropriation that we're provided.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2586.428s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2587.268s">Last</a>  thing I'm going to say before I turn it over to Councilors is just one added piece of context for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2592.451s">This</a>  Council, and I believe the administration, but the Council has persistently identified over multiple fiscal years a need for additional funding for <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2603.215s">all</a>  departments and our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2605.618s">We</a>  have discussed the structural underfunding of the city of Medford, including Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2612.427s">And</a>  last year, myself and former Council President Morell were able to negotiate an agreement that was publicly presented to the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2622.759s">to</a>  create a financial task force to work on creating the budget ordinance which we have passed along with a couple of other items and that financial task force has been meeting for several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2633.882s">There</a>  was a public press release from the office of the mayor March 31st I believe talking about us our discussions to create a framework for a debt exclusion for the fire station and an override to address school funding as well as some street and sidewalk funding <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2650.686s">Those</a>  conversations are ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2652.868s">The</a>  discussions around this budget have laid bare the need, and I am confident that with the additional discussions between myself and Vice President Collins, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Chief of Staff Nazarian, and Vice Chair of the School Committee, Jenny Graham, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2668.484s">that</a>  we can create a proposal and bring it to the voters to address the structural issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2672.968s">One</a>  of our goals with that, as we're still doing research given this discussion, is to see how much of that can address the issues in this year's budget and how that would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2682.676s">So</a>  I personally have been deeply engaged in those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2687.941s">I</a>  have, since the first day I ran for office and before, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2692.847s">been</a>  a strong supporter of the need for additional revenue to provide sufficient funding for not just our schools, but the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2701.355s">So</a>  I just wanted to add that context to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2703.818s">We</a>  are still working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2706.3s">I</a>  wish we had an answer sooner than we have them, but that's where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2710.764s">And</a>  my hope is that the outcome of those negotiations would be <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2713.387s">we're</a>  going to be putting something before the voters that would help address significant portion, if not most of this gap, so it will be up to the voters of the city of Medford, but I personally am confident in the voters that they want to fund our schools, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2726.135s">So</a>  with that, I will go to Vice President Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2730.638s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2731.838s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2733.139s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2734.28s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2735.361s">I</a>  always appreciate the very thorough walkthrough that you give us into the school committee's <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2742.845s">recommendation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2744.426s">Of</a>  course, as has been stated, you know, the City Council has no jurisdiction when it comes to line items, when it comes to how the Schools Department chooses to spend whatever appropriation that's given each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2757.676s">That</a>  is beyond our scope, but still I find it really helpful context for understanding the number that comes before us, so thank you so much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2765.126s">Um,</a>  speaking of individual line items, you know, for myself as an individual Councilor, like anybody else in the city, I hold individual opinions about particular positions or programs that to me seem really vital and important, that seem like they must be protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2779.456s">But</a>  as a Councilor in this role, it is deeply important to me that we advance a budget, advance a budget plan that gives our school's administration the latitude to do right by students, families, educators, all school staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2792.085s">And</a>  it's my understanding that that's the number that was just explained to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2795.906s">This</a>  year, I am optimistically expected to cast a yes vote for a budget that includes this school's appropriation for the 79 million that puts students and families' minds at ease, that's fair to teachers and school workers, and that gives our public schools the ability to start doing more rather than less. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2813.714s">And</a>  that isn't a reflection whatsoever on the district, I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2816.755s">We're</a>  coming off of a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2818.076s">We</a>  know we're in a really difficult fiscal situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2821.577s">But</a>  based on what I hear, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2823.638s">from</a>  the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2824.439s">I</a>  think that there's this widespread consensus that we have to start improving, and we have to be really serious about what that takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2835.309s">Personally,</a>  I think that education is one of the most important services that a city provides, and our budget should reflect that by meeting the school committee request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2845.95s">President</a>  Bears spoke a little bit about the need for additional revenues to make that manifest and about the work that the financial task force has been doing around that question for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2858.524s">That's</a>  still being worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2860.666s">We've</a>  been having some really <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2862.828s">you</a>  know, some tough conversations, some good, some productive conversations, but I believe that this community is ready to do what it takes to say, you know, this is the fiscal year and we're going to pivot towards making public education better in Medford and better for everybody who interacts with that system and competitive with the other options that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2884.638s">You</a>  know, when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2886.826s">talking</a>  about, you know, the prop two and a half override that is probably, well not, I don't think it's probably likely, I think it's definitely needed to maintain level service in the city and start making strides towards not just level service but improved service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2900.516s">This</a>  is something that I have been, you know, publicly advocating for, for, you know, the last two budget cycles, because we need to start preventing exactly the type of <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2913.223s">cuts</a>  that are being talked about that are in the realm of possibility if we don't change course. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2918.544s">And</a>  I think that many people in the community are at the point of saying this chronic underfunding can't go on any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2927.506s">I</a>  don't want to turn this into a conversation about increased revenues, but <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2935.939s">with</a>  the number that's before us and knowing that the, you know, it's not an invisible asterisk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2940.823s">I</a>  think it's a very obvious asterisk next to that number is what will it take to get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2945.027s">I</a>  know that the conversation about that should be comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2948.47s">It</a>  should take as long as it needs to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2950.132s">I</a>  know that something that will come up in that question is what will it cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2953.815s">to</a>  do that, to fulfill this request and all that it will mean for students and teachers and families? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2959.097s">What</a>  will it cost people to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2961.198s">And</a>  what I think about when I think about that question, what I think about with the various versions of the school department budget that have been put before the community is, what does it cost the community when we don't do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2973.204s">What</a>  does it cost in tutoring fees? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2976.465s">What</a>  does it cost in private school tuition? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2978.526s">And</a>  the people who simply can't afford to augment the public school experience, it costs them most of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2984.71s">So</a>  I thank you very much for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2987.071s">As</a>  one Councilor, you know, President Bears has, I was planning to start my spiel with, again, hammering home what role we do have in this process and what role we don't have at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2998.658s">I</a>  think that's already been well taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3001.599s">But</a>  as myself as one Councilor tonight, I'm very supportive of this version of the school's department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3007.843s">I'm</a>  looking forward to continuing to work with <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3011.599s">the</a>  mayor's office with my fellow colleagues, both behind the rail and as a member of the financial task force to come up with a plan to pass a budget that meets this request and maintains level service across all of our critical areas in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3024.952s">Thank</a>  you again.</p>
