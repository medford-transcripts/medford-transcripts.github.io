[SPEAKER_02]: None absent this meeting is called to order.

10
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:25,825
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a meeting in the Medford City Council Committee the whole at 7pm in the city council chamber second floor Medford City Hall 85 George B has to drive Medford, Massachusetts and by zoom.

11
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:31,746
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss paper 24-045, the annual budget process for fiscal 25.

12
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,867
[SPEAKER_02]: This is preliminary budget meeting seven.

13
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:36,047
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the seventh preliminary budget meeting.

14
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,668
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor has communicated the following departments will be present.

15
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:43,409
[SPEAKER_02]: The health department, Medford public schools, and the department of planning development and sustainability.

16
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:53,151
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be hearing first from the health department, and then we will go to the schools and planning and development sustainability, unless planning development sustainability makes it in time.

17
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will go first to you.

18
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:57,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Director O'Connor, welcome back.

19
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel free to sit if you'd like.

20
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:20,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm going to do, if you haven't been watching the Barnburner budget meetings we've been having, is I'm going to read the fiscal 24 budget, the fiscal 25 budget, any headcount changes, and then I'll go through the change sheet on the back, and then I'll turn it over to you to fill in anything that I missed, to share your narrative.

21
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:24,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, one thing we'd love to hear is if there's stuff that your department would like to be doing,

22
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,961
[SPEAKER_02]: that you didn't request in this budget that you are hoping to get in future budgets.

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,224
[SPEAKER_02]: That is definitely a priority of the council.

24
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:36,449
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's a tough budget year, but we also know there's a lot of needs in the city that need to be met.

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd love to hear that.

26
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,114
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that, I will start us off.

27
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:45,319
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Department 510, 519, that is our Board of Health and Animal Control.

28
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:46,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 24 budget $776,510.

29
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 25 proposed budget $806,185.93.

30
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,645
[SPEAKER_02]: The fiscal 24 headcount was 11.

31
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,526
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposed fiscal 25 headcount is 10.

32
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's a reduction of one part-time nurse.

33
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:12,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And the entire increase from fiscal 24 to fiscal 25 is a fixed cost growth increase.

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,931
[SPEAKER_02]: No new programs are being planned.

35
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:23,514
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an increase due to 2% non-union pay increases, step increases, and two employees who are fully funded through ARPA

36
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:28,096
[SPEAKER_02]: who are now going to be funded 50% through ARPA and 50% through the general fund.

37
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:35,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are offset again by a decrease in the part-time employees and some very minor changes in the ordinary expenses.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I will turn it over to you, Director O'Connor.

39
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:39,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

40
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:39,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

41
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:45,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we've had some vacant positions for a while now, but that's starting to work out and we're

42
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:53,591
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be hiring an additional inspector starting on June 3rd, as well as our manager of prevention and outreach will be starting on June 3rd.

43
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,292
[SPEAKER_02]: One second.

44
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:55,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The microphone may not be on.

45
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:57,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing the light?

46
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:58,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's green.

47
00:02:58,443 --> 00:02:58,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It is on?

48
00:02:58,903 --> 00:02:59,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

49
00:02:59,423 --> 00:02:59,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

50
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:00,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that, thank you.

51
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:01,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that better?

52
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:07,788
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, so we've had some vacant positions for a little bit now as far as the inspectors go, but that's looking better.

53
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:10,570
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna be hiring another inspector coming on on June 3rd.

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Also our new prevention and outreach manager will be starting on June 3rd as well.

55
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,453
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a really big help.

56
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:21,396
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm very grateful that we've added a couple of positions.

57
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:23,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Our community social worker,

58
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:45,318
[SPEAKER_13]: and some additional administrative support who were funded by opera but now we'll be going on to the general fund so I'm very grateful that we're getting to where we need to be and I believe that that's what this budget shows a lot of the work we're able to do though through our prevention and outreach workers is funded through grant work we were lucky enough to get a $500,000 foundation grant

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,388
[SPEAKER_13]: This year in addition to MVP grid, which supports our community and climate resilience work.

60
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're very grateful about that.

61
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:07,383
[SPEAKER_13]: We also will be now tapping into our opioid funds going forward to help with our recovery coach, and also our recovery support programming.

62
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:20,632
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we also are a part of a what's called a regional public health excellence grant with four other communities, which again allows us to supplement a lot of the work that we do.

63
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:28,356
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to be getting that for the next five years so we've been lucky to use that to help with additional food inspections.

64
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:32,139
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be bringing on an epidemiologist for the region.

65
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,900
[SPEAKER_13]: and also a communications person for the region.

66
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,880
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all gonna be handled by that grant.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,281
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all work that I was looking forward to doing, especially the epidemiologists, it's very exciting.

68
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:51,283
[SPEAKER_13]: But of course, we're still dealing with our inspectional side of life and trying to address all of the complaints.

69
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:57,385
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, that new inspector coming on June 3rd will certainly be helpful in that regards.

70
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,406
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's it, if there's any questions.

71
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions?

72
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Sangh.

73
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

74
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be able to speak to the community liaison program if we're going to be able to keep that on?

75
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:24,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so the community liaison program again is going to be funded through, still through APRA, but also now supplemented by that Ba Foundation grant I talked about.

76
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:27,426
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be able to keep on the community liaisons.

77
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:35,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Our MVP with our community connectors, that grant ends at the end of June, but we have submitted a new grant.

78
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:36,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, we won't

79
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,950
[SPEAKER_13]: probably hear from that until September.

80
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:51,256
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, we're hoping to use these BAH Foundation funds to tide us over with the connectors for the summer months until we are awarded and I'm being very positive that we will be awarded that next round of funding in September.

81
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:52,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to hear that.

82
00:05:52,797 --> 00:06:00,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was one of the priorities of the council, as well as hiring, making sure we were able to hire a prevention outreach coordinator.

83
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:04,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy to hear that we've made a lot of progress on that, that we'll have someone starting.

84
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to welcome them to Medford.

85
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all I have for now.

86
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

87
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:13,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

88
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins.

89
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:19,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for being here as always, and for walking us through the budget.

90
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:29,270
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always great to hear about how certain positions and capacity in the city are being funded by grant funding I know that your office always does a really great job of leveraging that.

91
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:34,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a quick clarification on some of the personnel.

92
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:41,621
[SPEAKER_11]: You walked us through the community social worker and the administrative support that's being funded through some of the grants that you just mentioned.

93
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:47,784
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw that one of the part-time nurses looks like it's coming offline, or maybe that was just reallocated.

94
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:48,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you speak to that?

95
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:55,809
[SPEAKER_13]: So the part-time nurse monies was reallocated to assist with the community social worker position, I believe.

96
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,192
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have, again, a revolving account.

97
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:04,095
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our vaccine account, dispensing account, and

98
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:12,960
[SPEAKER_13]: We in need of a part-time nurse, mostly through those flu seasons when we're doing those clinics and such to help Jillian with those clinics.

99
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:22,345
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were able to look at that fund that we have and decided we could use that money to assist with any part-time nursing staff that she might need.

100
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:24,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to clarify, so is that monies that are available for a seasonal nurse or is that it's it's more appropriate to use that funding for the community social worker at this time?

102
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:33,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

103
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:42,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to make sure I understood you correctly, is it that the being for are being put towards a seasonal nurse like during the like the flu season or is it that it's being reallocated to the social worker?

104
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:47,236
[SPEAKER_13]: So the monies for the seasonal nurse during the flu seasons will be coming from the vaccine account.

105
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:47,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

106
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:53,903
[SPEAKER_13]: And the money that was in the budget for the part time nurse was reallocated to the community social worker.

107
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:55,265
[SPEAKER_13]: So it makes it.

108
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does.

109
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:56,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

110
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:56,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

111
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the AC makes it even harder to hear the normal.

112
00:07:59,509 --> 00:07:59,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

113
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

114
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,105
[SPEAKER_05]: President Piazza, my question might not be for you, Mr. O'Connor, but I'm looking for.

115
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:22,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I might have missed it, but I know that we lost a valuable member of our team here to a new position, but our outreach manager for prevention and outreach,

116
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know if we're filling that position or if it's been filled?

117
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:28,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's great, okay.

118
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's been filled, should be beginning on June 3rd.

119
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:30,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, great.

120
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, will it be under your department?

121
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:33,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, perfect.

122
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:34,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

123
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, big shoes to fill.

124
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:37,206
[SPEAKER_05]: He was amazing, so.

125
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:37,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

126
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:38,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's all I had.

127
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:39,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

128
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:40,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

129
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

130
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one question.

131
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,532
[SPEAKER_00]: As a newbie councilor, there are a number of canine services, canine workers maintenance.

132
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:51,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious about this.

133
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,642
[SPEAKER_13]: So animal control falls under the health department.

134
00:08:55,963 --> 00:09:04,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So canine services, that's kind of funny, canine services, dog kennel, I guess I should say, is that what it says, dog kennel canine services?

135
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:14,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that also includes Eastern Middlesex mosquito control contract, which it's kind of funny that it's under,

136
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:18,453
[SPEAKER_13]: canine services but but that's about $27,000 a year.

137
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:23,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so that actually went up, it goes up every year so this year it's a little over 27,000.

138
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:28,477
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do also have to pay for dog kennel services.

139
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:38,001
[SPEAKER_13]: If we pick up a stray dog if we pick up a dangerous dog if you know so we do have to pay for for boarding for dogs that we pick up.

140
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:49,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Very quickly, because we've already had meetings on this topic, but I know some residents are curious.

141
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:56,977
[SPEAKER_03]: On the topic of rodent prevention, we're working on ordinances on our front to help with that.

142
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Your office has been doing a lot.

143
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:06,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this budget allow you to keep doing the work that you need to do to work on education and mitigation when it comes to rodents?

144
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:28,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, in our budget we have some money spread aside for another service and professional services for the education and the outreach, but we are going to be looking to and I'm working with Mike Roberts to come up with a contract and possibly go out to pitch, so that we can come up with a contract that would address professional services through I believe 2026.

145
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:34,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for saying any further questions by members of the council.

146
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:37,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, I have two.

147
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:46,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, could you say like, and it doesn't have to be exact, but approximately how much of the programming of the health department is grant funded?

148
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say probably equal match.

149
00:10:54,112 --> 00:11:01,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so this budget really goes to the environmental side of life and the animal control.

150
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,955
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the grant funding really funds all of our prevention and outreach work.

151
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that grant funding stable and reliable?

152
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we love the prevention outreach work.

153
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:17,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to fund it.

154
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So how reliable and stable is the grant funding?

155
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:28,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much, you know, if you're thinking about if the grants were all gone tomorrow, how much of that would you want to bring on to the general fund so that we could keep doing it?

156
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:46,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, grants are pretty hefty right now but one of them is a regional grant which is $250,000 a year but again that's a regional grant for five communities to address use substance use the $500,000 is over the next three years to help with the climate change work and resiliency work.

157
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:56,806
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that won't be sustainable if we don't get the next round of MVP which is would be after this but the state has really touted our program as kind of one of the model programs.

158
00:11:57,306 --> 00:12:03,911
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd find it highly unlikely that we wouldn't get funding to continue, but again that's $200,000 a year.

159
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:10,195
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, and then the opioid funding, the opioid funding will be coming for the next

160
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:11,878
[SPEAKER_13]: been over a decade or so.

161
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:17,450
[SPEAKER_13]: And that if we budgeted out, right, we're looking probably to about 100 to $150,000 a year.

162
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So the opioid's pretty stable.

163
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:31,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The state funding for resiliency is, we have it for about three years, but we would need to have that renewed, otherwise that would go away.

164
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the grants are even shorter term than that.

165
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:40,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is probably a leading question, but I'm guessing you'd want to keep doing all of that.

166
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course, yes.

167
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:43,004
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a very important part of public health, yes.

168
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:44,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

169
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:53,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate just understanding that and understanding typically half of the work of our health department that we see isn't coming out of the general fund right now, which I think is a testament.

170
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:58,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I think finding those grants is great, but we're not talking about doing something a one-off.

171
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,810
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about things we want to keep doing.

172
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes grant funding doesn't always, isn't always there.

173
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:11,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So any further questions from members of the council for our director of the health department?

174
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:18,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, are there any questions or comments by members of the public on the health department budget?

175
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:26,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing no one in the room and no hands raised on Zoom.

176
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all set, Director O'Connor.

177
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:31,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Civil defense.

178
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have to do civil defense.

179
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:34,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

180
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:46,379
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I want to say also, if we do see a significant difference between what we talked about tonight and what we get in the budget proposal, not that we expect that, but if we do, we may invite you back here in June.

181
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,161
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new budget process, and we've been really working hard with the administration to do things a bit earlier.

182
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're here in May, before we've seen the budget.

183
00:13:55,936 --> 00:14:02,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if the administration wants to have you back, or if you want to come back, or if we want you to come back, we could see you again in June.

184
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:02,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

185
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Civil defense, we have fiscal 24 budget, $9,390.

186
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:10,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 25 budget, $9,840.

187
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:19,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And this looks like it is just an increase in the public safety supplies and the dues, conferences, and travel.

188
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's anything else you want to share on that.

189
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:39,714
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the dues, conferences, and travel, we are also part of, even though we're beginning to establish our local emergency planning committee, we've already this year able to start our internal team.

190
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:50,279
[SPEAKER_13]: The dues, conferences, and travel goes to the regional emergency planning committee, the Mystic Valley Regional Emergency Planning Committee, so there are membership dues to belong to that.

191
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:55,836
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, any questions, Councilor Scarpelli?

192
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:56,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

193
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:58,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Connor, thanks.

194
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one question.

195
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I mentioned it to the chief of staff on Saturday, we did the tour of the fire station.

196
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:11,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we connected with the auxiliary group and told them that we're moving on?

197
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Joe and I, yes, we have had discussions, but we are meeting with the mayor on May 28th in the afternoon, next Tuesday, I believe.

198
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so still might proceed.

199
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:30,682
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking at and they seem to be very interested in pursuing the Medical Reserve Corps route.

200
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:35,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So they wouldn't need the trucks and all the apparatus.

201
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:41,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I know the chief was also reaching out to let them know that they're trying to find there was some equipment that they said that.

202
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:42,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

203
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:42,727
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

204
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:43,268
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

205
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:43,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

206
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

207
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:46,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions?

208
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:51,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, any questions from members of the public on civil defense?

209
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:58,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, I will just say up at the station in the Heights, there's some great civil defense stuff from about 1953.

210
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:04,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want some old blood transfusion kits or 60 year old biscuits.

211
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:08,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was pretty wild to see.

212
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:10,856
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just, yeah.

213
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:12,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, didn't know about it.

214
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, member of the public, do you want to comment on the health department?

215
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to ask a question regarding the health department.

216
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:24,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you can make a comment to me and it's up to the director.

217
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

218
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:34,316
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could let, yes, you can sit down and give your name and address for the record and happy to hear your comment.

219
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:39,149
[SPEAKER_02]: You can direct your comments to me and then we'll go back to the director.

220
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,210
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm a nice person.

221
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, it's just, it's a formality.

222
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:46,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally just technically all comments have to go through the chair.

223
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:49,253
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, my name is Dana Ralberto.

224
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:50,473
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm 596 High Street, Medford.

225
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:57,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason why I wanted to ask regarding the health department, does that have to do with the rat situation?

226
00:16:58,816 --> 00:16:59,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

227
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:02,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have a bad problem in my home.

228
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:04,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I practically fist fight them.

229
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had the exterminator come out twice.

230
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:12,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I've called Amelia at City Hall here that works in the department.

231
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,022
[SPEAKER_14]: She had someone come out, but they weren't that helpful.

232
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:20,665
[SPEAKER_14]: They just came and left, looked around and said, oh, everything looks great.

233
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:22,946
[SPEAKER_14]: I set traps left and right.

234
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:23,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I catch them.

235
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:28,349
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting to be like, they're like part of my house.

236
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:29,430
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like residents.

237
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna have to start naming them now.

238
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:40,524
[SPEAKER_14]: It's terrible, I know I live in an old home, it's in the 1800s, I go around, I block holes, they just seem to find a way in.

239
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:49,246
[SPEAKER_14]: But they are everywhere, it's not just in my house, I'll go walk my dog, they're at Duggar Park, they're everywhere.

240
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:55,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was wondering, I didn't know what to do or whatever, 596 High Street.

241
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:59,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can share a couple things and then the director, however you would like to share,

242
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:04,958
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have been working, the director shared a little bit earlier about road and control.

243
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:09,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things we've done is we've passed an ordinance a couple of years ago now.

244
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We require any new construction to have a pest management plan.

245
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:21,383
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trying to build in more and more as much as we can on the road and control with the guidance and advice of the health department.

246
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, that's really our role in it.

247
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:28,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely director O'Connor is the person to talk to or the health office.

248
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:35,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It may behoove us if you have a minute to talk after the testimony, if that's all right with you.

249
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:35,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

250
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:36,246
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

251
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:36,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

252
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:37,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

253
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:37,707
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

254
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:38,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

255
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:40,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

256
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:41,729
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

257
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comments on the health department or civil defense?

258
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:49,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, thank you so much.

259
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:49,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

260
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:50,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Celtics.

261
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:54,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Celtics won.

262
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:55,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I would.

263
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be nice right here in the big screen?

264
00:19:01,203 --> 00:19:01,563
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

265
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one moment.

266
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:08,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see if we have Director Hunt.

267
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, sadly, we're not going to make it.

268
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,680
[SPEAKER_02]: PDS will go after the public schools.

269
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:24,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So next we'll hear from Metro Public Schools, our superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, and our director of finance are here with us.

270
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,206
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some school committee members in the chamber and on Zoom as well.

271
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:33,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So excited to be here.

272
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:34,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different here.

273
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:39,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So for every department that we've heard up until this point, the city council,

274
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:42,927
[SPEAKER_02]: looks at line item budgets.

275
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:48,529
[SPEAKER_02]: For the school, Medford Public Schools, there's a different process, obviously, because there is a school committee.

276
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:56,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened so far, the school committee has done its process of developing a budget along with the school administration.

277
00:19:56,351 --> 00:20:04,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night, the school committee made a formal request to the city of Medford for an amount that is budgeted.

278
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:14,299
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor will then allocate an amount for the Medford Public Schools and the City Council only has the authority to approve that amount or to cut that amount.

279
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot increase it.

280
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:19,423
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot approve the budget that the school committee requested last night.

281
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:23,045
[SPEAKER_02]: All we can do is approve or cut the mayor's request.

282
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how the process works.

283
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:33,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate some of the outreach that we've gotten today asking us to approve the school committee's request that was proposed last night, but that's not how general law process works.

284
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:34,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to

285
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:36,254
[SPEAKER_02]: make that clear before we started.

286
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:45,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that certainly doesn't mean that I think many of the people behind this rail certainly support the request of the school committee and support funding our public schools.

287
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I will turn it over to you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

288
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:54,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna very quickly, um, I could pull it up.

289
00:20:56,087 --> 00:21:02,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Just note that the school committee requests the municipal government for fiscal 25 was $79,399,774.

290
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:04,510
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an increase from the fiscal 24 general fund request of $71,200,000.

291
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, Madam Superintendent.

292
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:23,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Council President Beers and distinguished members of the City Council.

293
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:29,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I am pleased to be here this evening to present our annual budget.

294
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:41,251
[SPEAKER_12]: I am the proud superintendent of Medford Public Schools, and my name is Dr. Marie Sedgwick-Vinson, and this evening I am here with Mr. Gerald McHugh, affectionately known as Jerry.

295
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:46,775
[SPEAKER_12]: He is our finance director, and so he will be going through a slide deck.

296
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:54,717
[SPEAKER_12]: to present the school committee's recommended number of $79,399,774 to you this evening.

297
00:21:54,837 --> 00:21:57,058
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the end of this presentation, we are prepared to answer questions.

298
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:57,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

299
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:58,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

300
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

301
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:24,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we we we

302
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,211
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a number of issues we're trying to deal with in the budget this year.

303
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:40,615
[SPEAKER_16]: We had our collective bargaining agreements, of course, that are legal obligation of the school department.

304
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:49,338
[SPEAKER_16]: We have all these positions that are integral to the operations of the school department on ESSA funding, which has expired.

305
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:53,119
[SPEAKER_16]: We identified a number of accounts

306
00:22:54,319 --> 00:23:01,424
[SPEAKER_16]: for a variety, I guess for whatever reason, were kind of chronically underfunded.

307
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:07,088
[SPEAKER_16]: The budgets were not aligned to the historic spending in these accounts.

308
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:16,995
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have a new spending request to shore up the budget.

309
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:34,723
[SPEAKER_16]: The increase is significant, but I think it's based on a level service budget to keep the school department going in FY25.

310
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:43,607
[SPEAKER_16]: So just a couple of data points that we look at as we try to develop the budget.

311
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:51,795
[SPEAKER_16]: The first one is enrollment.

312
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:57,117
[SPEAKER_16]: The school system is showing some growth at the lower grades.

313
00:23:58,098 --> 00:24:14,444
[SPEAKER_16]: We had some high kindergarten this year that were addressed, and our projections will continue to show some growth in the elementary grades, although next year's grade two is somewhat of an outlier.

314
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:38,092
[SPEAKER_16]: I would, my thinking on that is that those students were just going into kindergarten as school systems were kind of coming out of remote learning and back into classrooms, and that might have affected those kindergartens in that year.

315
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:43,495
[SPEAKER_16]: But kindergarten is something that we continue to monitor.

316
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:53,261
[SPEAKER_16]: We note that the registration activity at the Brooks School is high for this time of year, so we're looking at that.

317
00:24:54,342 --> 00:25:03,328
[SPEAKER_16]: The other three elementary schools, the kindergartens are more or less on track for what we're predicting in 2025.

318
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,712
[SPEAKER_16]: And we continue to see slight declines in the middle school and high school enrollment.

319
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:18,046
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing, and so these are totals for each grade group.

320
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:36,980
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see that we're expecting, on a total basis, a very slight increase, but you can see in the grades one through five, the growth that I talked about, and then the declines in the upper grades.

321
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:44,027
[SPEAKER_16]: The next slide is on foundation budget.

322
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:49,969
[SPEAKER_16]: So we anxiously await the recommendation of the governor in January.

323
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, it wasn't great news for MedFed in terms of Chapter 78 and FY 24.

324
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:26,643
[SPEAKER_16]: the city, I believe the chapter 78, went up about three and a half million dollars, and I was hoping that we'd see a similar bump, but we could see that the foundation enrollment declined from FY24 to FY25, so that caused MedFed to be in kind of a minimum student aid category, where

325
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:43,936
[SPEAKER_16]: your Chapter 78 is hold harmless, even though it should theoretically go down, because enrollment went down, the state always has a hold harmless clause for Chapter 78, so you'll at least get the amount you got the prior year.

326
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:50,442
[SPEAKER_16]: And then typically there's a $30 per student minimum aid,

327
00:26:53,573 --> 00:27:00,238
[SPEAKER_16]: that school systems qualify for if they're not eligible for Chapter 78.

328
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:15,209
[SPEAKER_16]: And typically what happens is the state calculates a foundation budget, which they use standard per pupil rates for all kinds of spending that school departments engage in.

329
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:25,196
[SPEAKER_16]: and they multiply that out across the enrollment and there's different rates for different things in high schools and elementary grades and pre-K.

330
00:27:26,297 --> 00:27:34,383
[SPEAKER_16]: That all rolls up to a foundation budget and then the state determines through formulas how much of that foundation budget

331
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:38,846
[SPEAKER_16]: will the city of Medford be required to contribute to.

332
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:47,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the difference between the foundation budget and the required contribution is what the foundation aid is.

333
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:51,946
[SPEAKER_16]: There was some good news, though.

334
00:27:53,027 --> 00:28:09,469
[SPEAKER_16]: The House budget, when passed, provided an increase in minimum student aid from $30 to $104 per student, and this resulted in an increase of $470,000 in Chapter 70 funding.

335
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:18,191
[SPEAKER_16]: The Senate Ways and Means Committee released its budget, I think, towards the end of last week, and they're debating it now.

336
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:27,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And the House Ways and Means budget also includes the $104 per student.

337
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:45,938
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not gonna know for certain how much we'll get in Chapter 70 until the budget passes and the Governor signs the budget, but this means that it's very likely that that will be the Chapter 70 funding for MedFed.

338
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:51,523
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is just a snapshot of our current staff.

339
00:28:53,224 --> 00:29:00,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of the staff, as you would imagine, is within the teaching, nursing, and council ranks.

340
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:08,971
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have a complement of paraprofessionals that assist in the instruction of our students.

341
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:19,536
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we developed the budget, as I said, we looked at four categories.

342
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:26,403
[SPEAKER_16]: And the first one was, what are our obligations to our staff in terms of collective bargaining agreements?

343
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:32,949
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a number of our agreements in force right now through FY25 and beyond.

344
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:44,615
[SPEAKER_16]: And those agreements we project in FY25 will increase our salary budgets by a little over $3.3 million.

345
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:55,960
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we are creating a salary reserve for three contracts that are up at the end of FY24.

346
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So the total salary increase is just slightly over $4 million.

347
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:11,592
[SPEAKER_16]: The next area is these accounts that were historically underfunded.

348
00:30:11,652 --> 00:30:30,321
[SPEAKER_16]: For instance, homeless transportation, which is hard to predict, and I don't know if the council is aware, but there's a requirement, and I'm in complete support of this, is there's a requirement that if a family becomes homeless,

349
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:44,630
[SPEAKER_16]: the students in the school system can remain in that school system and you're obligated to transport those students from wherever they wind up back to their home school district.

350
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:58,900
[SPEAKER_16]: And those charges are split between the sending district and the district that was formerly the home of that family.

351
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:10,304
[SPEAKER_16]: We have been running, spending in this account has been running $500,000, $600,000 a year, but yet the budget is $130,000.

352
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:32,779
[SPEAKER_16]: There was an argument to be made that you don't know really if you're gonna have the same level of transportation need for homeless as you do from one year to the next, but when you start to establish a trend, you have to address that in the budget.

353
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:42,502
[SPEAKER_16]: And similar with these other accounts, substitute coverage, these are accounts that typically run over their budgeted amounts.

354
00:31:44,203 --> 00:32:01,995
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really imperative that we try to get these accounts properly funded, because it just starts, you start the school year with a deficit, in the event that all things being equal, you kind of spend your money the way you budgeted.

355
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,698
[SPEAKER_16]: The next area that we looked at was ESSA.

356
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:09,199
[SPEAKER_16]: And

357
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:22,032
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, as I stated, we had a number of positions that are integral to the operations of the program.

358
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:32,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, a lot of ESSA funding was spent to support students during COVID and support the re-entry into the school system.

359
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:40,144
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it seems it's not that long ago, but there was so many protocols that had to be implemented to ensure that

360
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:55,756
[SPEAKER_16]: students were safe in school and that we could mitigate any contagious students and properly care for them as well.

361
00:32:56,456 --> 00:33:03,761
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have a number of positions, several of our new newcomer program positions were funded on ESSA.

362
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,703
[SPEAKER_16]: We have adjustment counselors.

363
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:19,233
[SPEAKER_16]: All our school-based substitute teachers were funded in this account.

364
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:21,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Grants manager was funded in this account.

365
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:37,822
[SPEAKER_16]: We are providing funding for those positions in the general fund this year, as well as some paraprofessional positions that are funded in a revolving fund.

366
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:49,786
[SPEAKER_16]: We're seeking to move those positions again over to general fund because the current funding is not sustainable.

367
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:59,966
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there's a variety of new spending, our special education outplacements are going up.

368
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:08,550
[SPEAKER_16]: There's the state approved tuition increase of 4.7% for our outplacement programs.

369
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,052
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have some modest growth within those outplacement ranks.

370
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:14,373
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's almost $460,000.

371
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,533
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a network equipment budget

372
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:35,446
[SPEAKER_16]: for a school district that's entire student body and staff have devices now and the budget is $30,000 to maintain the network.

373
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:39,028
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're seeking to increase that.

374
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:51,096
[SPEAKER_16]: And also we have a need to refresh our Chromebook inventory and our MacBooks that are allocated to staff.

375
00:34:53,997 --> 00:35:05,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, buildings and grounds would benefit from new spending so we can provide for project management.

376
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:18,863
[SPEAKER_16]: We really need to do a space use study in our schools to avoid overcrowding that we're experiencing, particularly in the Roberts.

377
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:29,711
[SPEAKER_16]: and just kind of get some baseline data so we can start to think about some facilities master planning in the future, possibly redistricting.

378
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:40,119
[SPEAKER_16]: But we should make sure that we're using all the classroom space that was built with the intention of being a classroom as a classroom.

379
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:52,495
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we're also asking for two additional school buses, there was a lot of concern at the beginning of the school year about overcrowding on buses.

380
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:58,142
[SPEAKER_16]: We think that can be solved with the addition of two school bus yellow buses.

381
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:23,591
[SPEAKER_16]: and some school supply increases and other, also there's a request to add a payroll supervisor and a HR assistant to build capacity in those areas and to provide some management to manage the, to plan out the work of those departments.

382
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:31,428
[SPEAKER_16]: So that results in an increase of almost $8.7 million.

383
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:33,231
[SPEAKER_16]: We identified some opportunities with

384
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:50,827
[SPEAKER_16]: fund balances in our revolving accounts to charge, at least for this school year, two teachers.

385
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:58,909
[SPEAKER_16]: That constitutes about $200,000 of that 469 number.

386
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:10,672
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we will implement a plan to recover some administrative and facilities expenses that we

387
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:24,921
[SPEAKER_16]: that are being used by programs that charge fees so that we can kind of recover some of those costs through those fee programs.

388
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:33,748
[SPEAKER_16]: And that when those additional resources are deducted, you come up with a budget of $79.4 million.

389
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:45,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jerry.

390
00:37:46,158 --> 00:37:51,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So just before we go to questions from counselors, I'm going to summarize once again the process here and some of the key numbers.

391
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:52,904
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of great information.

392
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:55,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate your presentation.

393
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:05,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the request by the school committee as of last night is 79.4 million let's let's round up by a couple hundred bucks.

394
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:19,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Now pursuant to the council's, the new city budget ordinance, I believe that the mayor provided an initial estimated allocation to the school system about in March.

395
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:22,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was 73.5 million.

396
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:27,688
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the initial estimate of what they believe the city could provide at that time.

397
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:30,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a pretty big difference.

398
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:35,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost $6 million between what was requested by the school committee and the initial estimate.

399
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:39,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to add just a couple more pieces of context.

400
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:49,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the district, as you indicated in your letter, had proposed a $76.7 million budget, which changed the school committee recommended this full budget.

401
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:57,088
[SPEAKER_02]: That $76.7 million included the variety of potential cuts that you had determined and were discussed at the school committee earlier this month.

402
00:38:57,108 --> 00:38:59,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was end of April, but a few weeks ago.

403
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:13,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also know that the administration has been working to try to increase that 73.5 million through finding other essentially changes on other city departments.

404
00:39:13,278 --> 00:39:16,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just wanted to put that context in play, but really.

405
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:32,438
[SPEAKER_02]: What has been going around the community a lot has been a discussion of the initial kind of batch of proposed cuts, which got to that 76.7 million number, the school committee has requested the 79.4 million which would, I don't want to get into specific line items because we don't control that.

406
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:37,597
[SPEAKER_02]: to avoid many of those cuts if that $79.4 million was received.

407
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:42,318
[SPEAKER_02]: But the estimate was all the way down at $73.5 million.

408
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:54,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have essentially a $6 million need to avoid the cuts that have already been discussed, a $3-something million need to pass a budget that includes those cuts that were discussed.

409
00:39:55,462 --> 00:40:02,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it's below that $76.7, we're talking about finding even more cuts beyond what was discussed at the meeting

410
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:05,487
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier a few weeks ago.

411
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:07,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to put that context out there.

412
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:11,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, procedurally, the school committee has made a request.

413
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:19,075
[SPEAKER_02]: We are hearing from you a description of that request we will receive in the official budget proposal by the mayor and allocation.

414
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:24,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, we can just approve or cut that total allocation to the school.

415
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:27,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So that really is the council's role in the process.

416
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mayor is the one who will propose the allocation.

417
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:44,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be somewhere between the $73.5 million, which would require even more cuts that have been already discussed, and the $79.4 million, which would fully fund this request and wouldn't include the cuts you described.

418
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:47,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have anything you want to add to what I just said, I'd appreciate the context.

419
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to kind of summarize where we're at.

420
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,131
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that that's accurate.

421
00:40:54,710 --> 00:41:13,817
[SPEAKER_16]: The, we decided that we had to, we had an obligation to see what kind of savings we could generate, knowing that we're not gonna be business as usual, you know, with cuts, given the gap.

422
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:23,840
[SPEAKER_16]: that we had between the initial allocation that we got from the city and what the actual need for a level services budget is.

423
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:32,562
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did go through an exercise of trying to use criteria to make some strategic cuts.

424
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:35,243
[SPEAKER_16]: There was, you know,

425
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:42,335
[SPEAKER_16]: significant feedback from the community during our two budget meetings.

426
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:51,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, no one and people are advocating, you know, as they should for different programs.

427
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,582
[SPEAKER_16]: We did present a package of $2.2 million worth of cuts that was

428
00:41:58,442 --> 00:42:00,243
[SPEAKER_16]: almost exclusively staffing.

429
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:15,692
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't want to get into a whole host of cuts around programs and curriculum and instructional needs beyond what we did.

430
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:23,377
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did identify another $2.7 million that we had a gap between

431
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:32,668
[SPEAKER_16]: if you went with the $2.3 million increase plus $2.1 million in cuts, so those... That's the $73.5 million.

432
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:41,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, and another round of cuts will be significant, but we also recognize that

433
00:42:43,382 --> 00:43:00,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Council has a lot of has the whole city and its residents to be thinking about when you put a budget together so we're hoping you can do the best you can with that budget but we will have a balanced budget.

434
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:05,275
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, with the appropriation that we're provided.

435
00:43:06,428 --> 00:43:07,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

436
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:12,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Last thing I'm going to say before I turn it over to Councillors is just one added piece of context for the discussion.

437
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:22,195
[SPEAKER_02]: This Council, and I believe the administration, but the Council has persistently identified over multiple fiscal years a need for additional funding for

438
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:24,978
[SPEAKER_02]: all departments and our public school system.

439
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:31,586
[SPEAKER_02]: We have discussed the structural underfunding of the city of Medford, including Medford Public Schools.

440
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:41,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And last year, myself and former Council President Morrell were able to negotiate an agreement that was publicly presented to the Council.

441
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:53,822
[SPEAKER_02]: to create a financial task force to work on creating the budget ordinance which we have passed along with a couple of other items and that financial task force has been meeting for several months.

442
00:43:53,882 --> 00:44:10,126
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a public press release from the office of the mayor March 31st I believe talking about us our discussions to create a framework for a debt exclusion for the fire station and an override to address school funding as well as some street and sidewalk funding

443
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:12,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Those conversations are ongoing.

444
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:27,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The discussions around this budget have laid bare the need, and I am confident that with the additional discussions between myself and Vice President Collins, Mayor Longo Kern, Chief of Staff Nazarian, and Vice Chair of the School Committee, Jenny Graham,

445
00:44:28,484 --> 00:44:32,788
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can create a proposal and bring it to the voters to address the structural issue.

446
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:41,936
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our goals with that, as we're still doing research given this discussion, is to see how much of that can address the issues in this year's budget and how that would work.

447
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:47,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So I personally have been deeply engaged in those discussions.

448
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:50,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, since the first day I ran for office and before,

449
00:44:52,847 --> 00:45:00,595
[SPEAKER_02]: been a strong supporter of the need for additional revenue to provide sufficient funding for not just our schools, but the city as a whole.

450
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:03,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to add that context to the table.

451
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:04,999
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still working on that.

452
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we had an answer sooner than we have them, but that's where we're at.

453
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:13,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hope is that the outcome of those negotiations would be

454
00:45:13,387 --> 00:45:25,835
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to be putting something before the voters that would help address significant portion, if not most of this gap, so it will be up to the voters of the city of Medford, but I personally am confident in the voters that they want to fund our schools, too.

455
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:30,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I will go to Vice President Collins, Councillor Scarpelli, Councillor Lazar.

456
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins.

457
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:32,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

458
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:34,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for being here.

459
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the presentation.

460
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:42,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I always appreciate the very thorough walkthrough that you give us into the school committee's

461
00:45:42,845 --> 00:45:43,506
[SPEAKER_11]: recommendation.

462
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:57,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, as has been stated, you know, the City Council has no jurisdiction when it comes to line items, when it comes to how the Schools Department chooses to spend whatever appropriation that's given each year.

463
00:45:57,676 --> 00:46:03,540
[SPEAKER_11]: That is beyond our scope, but still I find it really helpful context for understanding the number that comes before us, so thank you so much for that.

464
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:18,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, speaking of individual line items, you know, for myself as an individual counselor, like anybody else in the city, I hold individual opinions about particular positions or programs that to me seem really vital and important, that seem like they must be protected.

465
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:31,365
[SPEAKER_11]: But as a counselor in this role, it is deeply important to me that we advance a budget, advance a budget plan that gives our school's administration the latitude to do right by students, families, educators, all school staff.

466
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:34,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's my understanding that that's the number that was just explained to us.

467
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:53,654
[SPEAKER_11]: This year, I am optimistically expected to cast a yes vote for a budget that includes this school's appropriation for the 79 million that puts students and families' minds at ease, that's fair to teachers and school workers, and that gives our public schools the ability to start doing more rather than less.

468
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:56,715
[SPEAKER_11]: And that isn't a reflection whatsoever on the district, I don't think.

469
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:58,016
[SPEAKER_11]: We're coming off of a pandemic.

470
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:00,797
[SPEAKER_11]: We know we're in a really difficult fiscal situation.

471
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:02,758
[SPEAKER_11]: But based on what I hear,

472
00:47:03,638 --> 00:47:04,319
[SPEAKER_11]: from the community.

473
00:47:04,439 --> 00:47:13,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that there's this widespread consensus that we have to start improving, and we have to be really serious about what that takes.

474
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:23,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, I think that education is one of the most important services that a city provides, and our budget should reflect that by meeting the school committee request.

475
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:36,902
[SPEAKER_11]: President Beers spoke a little bit about the need for additional revenues to make that manifest and about the work that the financial task force has been doing around that question for months.

476
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:39,945
[SPEAKER_11]: That's still being worked out.

477
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:41,747
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been having some really

478
00:47:42,828 --> 00:48:02,137
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, some tough conversations, some good, some productive conversations, but I believe that this community is ready to do what it takes to say, you know, this is the fiscal year and we're going to pivot towards making public education better in Medford and better for everybody who interacts with that system and competitive with the other options that are out there.

479
00:48:04,638 --> 00:48:05,639
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when it comes to

480
00:48:06,826 --> 00:48:19,956
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about, you know, the prop two and a half override that is probably, well not, I don't think it's probably likely, I think it's definitely needed to maintain level service in the city and start making strides towards not just level service but improved service.

481
00:48:20,516 --> 00:48:31,925
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that I have been, you know, publicly advocating for, for, you know, the last two budget cycles, because we need to start preventing exactly the type of

482
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:37,044
[SPEAKER_11]: cuts that are being talked about that are in the realm of possibility if we don't change course.

483
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:47,486
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that many people in the community are at the point of saying this chronic underfunding can't go on any longer.

484
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:53,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to turn this into a conversation about increased revenues, but

485
00:48:55,939 --> 00:49:00,783
[SPEAKER_11]: with the number that's before us and knowing that the, you know, it's not an invisible asterisk.

486
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:03,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a very obvious asterisk next to that number is what will it take to get there?

487
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:08,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the conversation about that should be comprehensive.

488
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,711
[SPEAKER_11]: It should take as long as it needs to.

489
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:13,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that something that will come up in that question is what will it cost?

490
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:18,937
[SPEAKER_11]: to do that, to fulfill this request and all that it will mean for students and teachers and families?

491
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:20,278
[SPEAKER_11]: What will it cost people to do that?

492
00:49:21,198 --> 00:49:31,823
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I think about when I think about that question, what I think about with the various versions of the school department budget that have been put before the community is, what does it cost the community when we don't do that?

493
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:36,405
[SPEAKER_11]: What does it cost in tutoring fees?

494
00:49:36,465 --> 00:49:38,026
[SPEAKER_11]: What does it cost in private school tuition?

495
00:49:38,526 --> 00:49:43,068
[SPEAKER_11]: And the people who simply can't afford to augment the public school experience, it costs them most of all.

496
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,051
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you very much for this presentation.

497
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:58,217
[SPEAKER_11]: As one counselor, you know, President Behrs has, I was planning to start my spiel with, again, hammering home what role we do have in this process and what role we don't have at this point.

498
00:49:58,658 --> 00:50:00,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's already been well taken care of.

499
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,822
[SPEAKER_11]: But as myself as one counselor tonight, I'm very supportive of this version of the school's department budget.

500
00:50:07,843 --> 00:50:09,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to continuing to work with

501
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:24,331
[SPEAKER_11]: the mayor's office with my fellow colleagues, both behind the rail and as a member of the financial task force to come up with a plan to pass a budget that meets this request and maintains level service across all of our critical areas in the city.

502
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:25,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you again.

503
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:30,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr President.

504
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:36,354
[SPEAKER_05]: First let me disclose that I do have a family member that is a teacher.

505
00:50:37,055 --> 00:50:44,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I've contacted the Ethics Commission and the protocol is that I can be present because we're not

506
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:50,088
[SPEAKER_05]: discussing any votes, so I will not hide in a side chair or anything like that.

507
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:55,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stand in front, and you can ask any questions if you, you know, and I'll respond.

508
00:50:57,672 --> 00:51:06,057
[SPEAKER_05]: The way the process goes, I was told to inform the public, because it was a little confusing yesterday, that the night of the budget meeting, that when we go to vote,

509
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:14,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I will ask when we get to the school department budget that we sever elementary education piece to be voted separately.

510
00:51:15,196 --> 00:51:21,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll exclude myself, the council will vote on that part, and then I can come back in to be part of the procedure.

511
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:29,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that there was some confusion of what the process is when you have a family member that's in the system.

512
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:31,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I appreciate,

513
00:51:33,922 --> 00:51:34,602
[SPEAKER_05]: your presence.

514
00:51:34,662 --> 00:51:40,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that Councilor Beas made a presentation about where we are right now.

515
00:51:42,806 --> 00:51:47,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I will share the conversation on June 20th of last year.

516
00:51:47,968 --> 00:52:01,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like Nostradamus, Mr. McHugh, because I sat in front of this body and I explained how tragic and how devastating, if we funded the budget the way that we were going last year, where would we be today?

517
00:52:01,814 --> 00:52:02,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's happening.

518
00:52:03,484 --> 00:52:06,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happening, and there's nothing we can do.

519
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:21,530
[SPEAKER_05]: My fellow councilors, like Councilor Behr said, did meet behind closed doors with the mayor and came up with a plan with another member of the council to set up this financial group.

520
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,491
[SPEAKER_05]: This financial group, I guess, has been meeting since April.

521
00:52:25,031 --> 00:52:26,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you part of that financial group?

522
00:52:26,872 --> 00:52:27,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not.

523
00:52:27,713 --> 00:52:27,853
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

524
00:52:28,113 --> 00:52:30,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been meeting since September.

525
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So is Mr. Dickinson part of that group?

526
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:35,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Our city financial director?

527
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:40,062
[SPEAKER_02]: We have requested information from city finance department staff as needed.

528
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:45,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so on a day to day basis during these meetings, I don't I don't I don't see any minutes.

529
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:47,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't know what's going on those meetings.

530
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:49,910
[SPEAKER_05]: What I do know is that they've been meeting.

531
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've come to a conclusion over after knowing for a year over a year now,

532
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,833
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was publicly stated, we're gonna be in drastic, drastic financial need.

533
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:10,418
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've known in a year, and I'm gonna ask some questions about that later, but we've known for years that we are in a devastating situation.

534
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:11,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew we were gonna be here.

535
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:19,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we've heard back was the mayor announced that we're gonna look at debt exclusion and overrides.

536
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:30,761
[SPEAKER_05]: which is very, very irresponsible for the fact that when other communities present overrides or debt exclusions, it's part of a transparent process.

537
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:38,482
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's discussed, it's presented so the community and as a whole understands what this process looks like.

538
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:51,991
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened that evening when the mayor pronounced after you said, I believe that you were talking that we were gonna have a $5.5 million shortfall and the man jumped back and said, it's the first time I heard of that.

539
00:53:52,632 --> 00:53:54,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I only thought it was $500,000.

540
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:59,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, they've had a working groups in September and that's the first time they've heard that.

541
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we move forward with this process,

542
00:54:02,638 --> 00:54:12,821
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing the mayor present that evening that we're now going to focus on this working group that is going to look into an override and debt exclusions to get us to where we need to be.

543
00:54:14,722 --> 00:54:15,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Irresponsible.

544
00:54:16,222 --> 00:54:18,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been saying this for over a year now, more than a year.

545
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:25,125
[SPEAKER_05]: The lack of transparency and the mismanagement of finances in this community is pitiful.

546
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:27,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the reason why we're here today.

547
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:30,185
[SPEAKER_05]: We can look at zero new growth.

548
00:54:30,866 --> 00:54:42,374
[SPEAKER_05]: We can look at confusing payments to law firms that when I did my numbers from the actuals, over $470,000 paid to KP Law.

549
00:54:44,176 --> 00:54:46,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You're seeing lawsuits.

550
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,020
[SPEAKER_05]: You're hearing all these different issues and why we are where we are.

551
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to be honest with you, I don't disagree with my fellow colleagues.

552
00:54:54,031 --> 00:55:02,302
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one priority is to fund the school system where it needs to be so we can do the best we can for the most important people in our community, that's our children.

553
00:55:03,503 --> 00:55:06,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I support it a thousand percent, but it's how we get there.

554
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:08,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what's frightening to me.

555
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now, I don't see a transparent process.

556
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:30,278
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a few counselors and a school kid member working together with the mayor and the chief of staff without any financial professional with them on a day-to-day basis, and the mayor comes out and says, after these cuts, I'm gonna look for a debt exclusion, and I'm gonna look for looking at an override to balance our budget.

557
00:55:30,518 --> 00:55:31,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely not.

558
00:55:31,718 --> 00:55:34,560
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a way to do it, and I'll get to that when I speak, when she comes to this body.

559
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:41,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I understand, so I can understand this transparent process, if you can allow me to expand on this, is that

560
00:55:42,827 --> 00:55:44,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are these questions coming from?

561
00:55:44,228 --> 00:55:53,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I bring up the point that I have some bullets that parents, teachers, administrators, myself come up with.

562
00:55:54,094 --> 00:55:57,556
[SPEAKER_05]: The process that why do we not have faith?

563
00:55:58,336 --> 00:56:04,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was a Monday we got an email saying that there was a shortfall in the FY 24 budget of 2.5 million.

564
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on Friday, hey, we found 2.2 million or so, right?

565
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did that come from?

566
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:15,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So we still, I asked for a report much back in understanding that.

567
00:56:16,576 --> 00:56:19,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can allude to that, that'd be great for the first question.

568
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:33,444
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could just very quickly, in terms of the scope and scale of the involvement of the council leadership and the discussions with the city administration, as I noted, we've been meeting

569
00:56:34,668 --> 00:56:47,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Since September of 2023, I wouldn't say anything otherwise that there have been disagreements in that group about the scope and scale of our medias and what an overrider debt exclusion should look like.

570
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:51,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Through those meetings, we have narrowed that gap significantly.

571
00:56:52,138 --> 00:56:56,761
[SPEAKER_02]: We have worked through the mechanisms available to us and our understanding of the immediate future.

572
00:56:57,441 --> 00:56:59,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we arrived where we are today.

573
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:05,623
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we didn't know was what is new growth and what a local receipt is going to be.

574
00:57:05,643 --> 00:57:07,303
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have that until the spring, right?

575
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:13,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes about the specifics, yeah, we've been working through that.

576
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:15,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hopeful that we're going to get somewhere.

577
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:17,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I have liked to have gotten somewhere earlier?

578
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:18,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I have liked

579
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:21,128
[SPEAKER_02]: information to have been earlier, sure.

580
00:57:22,229 --> 00:57:26,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the council leadership met with the mayor last June.

581
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:29,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We publicly presented everything that was discussed.

582
00:57:29,897 --> 00:57:34,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We made that agreement and the council voted to approve a budget based on those discussions.

583
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:36,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you voted against it and I respect that.

584
00:57:37,364 --> 00:57:41,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all agree, we agreed last year, we knew we were going to be in a very tough place.

585
00:57:42,182 --> 00:57:45,024
[SPEAKER_02]: with one time funding, ARPA and ESSER included.

586
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:49,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I appreciate the Councillor's perspective.

587
00:57:50,507 --> 00:57:57,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that there's always room to do more, to be earlier, to have more information out there.

588
00:57:58,772 --> 00:58:02,795
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to say that Council leadership has been working diligently on that issue.

589
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:14,058
[SPEAKER_02]: the administration and as I said earlier, I'm confident that we will find an answer that this community can rally around and support to make sure that our schools get the funding that they deserve.

590
00:58:14,518 --> 00:58:28,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it can't to that point of information, Mr President, I think we agree that I think that we've talked not getting the information that you need, but what that evening on June 20th of last year, I think the biggest problem was the lack of information given to the

591
00:58:29,775 --> 00:58:30,676
[SPEAKER_05]: the complete council.

592
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:39,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest with you, even with this financial group, you keep saying the leadership, we talked about this last year, the leadership.

593
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:46,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, did you think maybe that getting us just monthly reports on what that leadership was working on?

594
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:47,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we didn't.

595
00:58:48,393 --> 00:58:53,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the things that I'm saying when I say, well, lack of transparency, that brings me to the first question that we talked about.

596
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:57,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can speak to I appreciate I can give a quick recap on that.

597
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:03,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I arrived here in the middle of August and.

598
00:59:04,904 --> 00:59:14,274
[SPEAKER_16]: It took me a while to kind of get my bearings and meet all the staff and get familiar with the accounting systems.

599
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:25,847
[SPEAKER_16]: In November, I believe, I started to put together a projection model to try to figure out where we were gonna land on June 30th.

600
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:53,515
[SPEAKER_16]: in terms of the budget and I was alarmed that we did have a shortfall and I felt without any kind of further investigation that I had an obligation to let senior management know about this possibility and we continue to work on it and I have to thank the city's finance director who agreed to kind of review all my

601
00:59:54,995 --> 01:00:06,094
[SPEAKER_16]: my spreadsheets on this, he discovered an error in the formula that I was using, we corrected it, that accounted for about a million dollars.

602
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:21,186
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, we were able to identify other resources that we could employ if in fact we did finish up the year with a $1.5 million deficit.

603
01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:32,808
[SPEAKER_16]: So for instance, we believe we'll have a balance of about $200,000 in the ESSA fund that we can charge eligible expenses to.

604
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:36,689
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a state reimbursement

605
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:45,053
[SPEAKER_16]: for homeless transportation that's in, sitting in an account in the general fund that we could use for this purpose.

606
01:00:45,634 --> 01:00:59,261
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were, I was satisfied that even if we finished the year in a deficit, that there were a number of resources that we could employ to balance the budget.

607
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:03,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so with that being said,

608
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:14,597
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to understand, I'm not blaming you, I think just understanding it, I think understanding you coming in in August wasn't the best, it's not the best fit, so I understand that.

609
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, you don't work five days a week, right?

610
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:20,023
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a consultant that works.

611
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:22,346
[SPEAKER_16]: I am on the payroll.

612
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:26,547
[SPEAKER_16]: I have other responsibilities.

613
01:01:28,828 --> 01:01:45,851
[SPEAKER_16]: My preference was to just work on the budget for this year, but there was a need, both the CFO and the assistant, by the time I got there, had both left, so there was,

614
01:01:47,694 --> 01:01:49,655
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, a staffing issue.

615
01:01:49,795 --> 01:01:53,278
[SPEAKER_16]: So I agreed to work three days, which is

616
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,533
[SPEAKER_16]: the most I could commit to at that time.

617
01:02:01,553 --> 01:02:07,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I just think that this is working three days with this type of budget and what you had to recover from, it's not fair to you.

618
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,201
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't fair to you at all.

619
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:11,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I knew what I was getting into.

620
01:02:11,664 --> 01:02:19,231
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have a lot of experience in government and I've only worked in the public sector all my life and I worked for

621
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:23,129
[SPEAKER_16]: 26 years for Chelsea Public Schools.

622
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,611
[SPEAKER_16]: So I knew what I was getting into.

623
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:36,038
[SPEAKER_16]: And those three days get stretched out during the last three months too, you know, given the budget.

624
01:02:36,258 --> 01:02:40,181
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think my role was to just come in and kind of

625
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:52,665
[SPEAKER_16]: do the budget analysis that was necessary to, as you say, to be transparent about what the true cost of operating metropolitan schools are.

626
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:59,008
[SPEAKER_16]: I leave it up to the school committee and the council to see how they can fund that.

627
01:03:00,329 --> 01:03:04,911
[SPEAKER_16]: And then my hope is that the school department will

628
01:03:07,012 --> 01:03:12,115
[SPEAKER_16]: soon hire a permanent finance director and I can transition out.

629
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:18,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So you were well aware, Mr. McHugh, that we were in financial disaster ahead of us, correct?

630
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:24,944
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, well, was I aware before I got here?

631
01:03:24,964 --> 01:03:29,007
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm saying when you got here, I'm only saying this because I

632
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:38,005
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a school department that knew and a city mayor that knew last year that we were going to get to this point.

633
01:03:39,266 --> 01:03:52,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can speak firsthand being on the school committee when we had some huge cuts and you had to stand up and be a big boy and big girl and stand in front of everybody and tell them what they don't want to hear.

634
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:53,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

635
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're looking at a situation where

636
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:10,033
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did this year, Madam Superintendent, I think we did a terrible job in making sure that we tightened that belt and made sure that we did everything possible.

637
01:04:10,234 --> 01:04:12,695
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get to this point, we wouldn't be this bad.

638
01:04:14,793 --> 01:04:17,655
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to that point, you know, usually we get a budget.

639
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:21,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I was accustomed to always get the school committee budget, even as a city councilor.

640
01:04:22,818 --> 01:04:29,983
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love the point, but I'd love an actual budget if you can get that to me, because I like to look into the pieces that you don't hear about.

641
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:32,184
[SPEAKER_05]: How much money do we spend on consultants?

642
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:41,671
[SPEAKER_05]: How much money do we spend on people that we could have moved over to other positions and people could have picked up other spots?

643
01:04:42,551 --> 01:04:43,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I work with,

644
01:04:44,224 --> 01:04:53,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Superintendent Belson, I realize he's probably the cream of the crop, but when we had drastic cuts in 08, the first group he went after was his leadership team.

645
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,032
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, well, I'm gonna feel the pain first.

646
01:04:57,813 --> 01:05:06,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad to see that we're gonna move forward with getting to this budget of 79 million, which by the way, does that bring everybody back on?

647
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:13,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that's cut, all the directors, would that $79 million bring all those people back to their positions?

648
01:05:16,863 --> 01:05:38,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's going to be a decision that the school committee will make ultimately, but I would say that it certainly reduces the devastating impact, but I'm not going to commit that we're going to put every single position back because we have

649
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:46,209
[SPEAKER_16]: But by the time we get to that point, there could be other needs that come up as well.

650
01:05:46,229 --> 01:05:48,890
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what the misleading point of last evening and tonight is.

651
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:53,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I got when I got the phone call this morning from parents and people saying, this is great.

652
01:05:54,692 --> 01:05:57,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So Hannah's coming back to the bench, you know, right back to her position.

653
01:05:57,493 --> 01:05:58,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big one, right?

654
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:01,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, our head of physical education is going to come back, right?

655
01:06:02,194 --> 01:06:02,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

656
01:06:02,856 --> 01:06:05,459
[SPEAKER_05]: state mandated position, right?

657
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:14,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about secretaries, where I worked at the McGlynn School, knowing how two secretaries are important, vital to that process.

658
01:06:15,149 --> 01:06:17,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm getting back is saying, this is great.

659
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:18,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's coming back.

660
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not true.

661
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,541
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I didn't say that.

662
01:06:21,901 --> 01:06:25,563
[SPEAKER_16]: I said that I'm not in a position to make that decision.

663
01:06:25,603 --> 01:06:39,090
[SPEAKER_16]: That's very possible that those positions do come back, but that's going to be when we get a final number, then the budget recommendation will be

664
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:43,173
[SPEAKER_16]: reprogrammed with that new number and it would go before the school committee.

665
01:06:43,193 --> 01:06:57,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so in full transparency, the reason why I say this, and I don't want to put you on the spot, I wish the superintendent can help with me, but as we talk about these positions, we have to make sure that the community understands this doesn't make everybody whole again.

666
01:06:57,066 --> 01:07:05,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this is what we may have to make sure that, because people left last evening thinking, oh, this is great, we're going to get everything back.

667
01:07:06,664 --> 01:07:08,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we gotta make sure that's not true.

668
01:07:08,784 --> 01:07:14,045
[SPEAKER_05]: We still, that's still left up until to the school committee and the administration.

669
01:07:14,085 --> 01:07:15,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not be true.

670
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:29,288
[SPEAKER_02]: How the process works, once an allocation is made by the mayor and once a budget is approved by the council, the school committee then has to reconcile the difference between the budget they requested and whatever the allocation is.

671
01:07:29,388 --> 01:07:34,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the budget they requested is not met, then there would still be a need for

672
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely, completely understand.

673
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:48,553
[SPEAKER_05]: But what the school committee said last night is go level funded a $79 million, not for what the mayor's presenting, not as of last night, people left that meeting saying we're whole again.

674
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:57,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't want to be careful, Mr. President, because I don't want to come back to the city council that the city council didn't want wasn't transparent because the questions they asked me and is that

675
01:07:58,649 --> 01:07:59,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know.

676
01:07:59,689 --> 01:08:00,370
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not true.

677
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:06,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though we get $79 million, hey, I support it.

678
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:10,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I want to make sure that we're whole with the school department.

679
01:08:11,614 --> 01:08:18,396
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to make sure that when this happens, and let's say the mayor comes back and says, hey, we're going to go for an override.

680
01:08:18,776 --> 01:08:20,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And that override is going to be passed.

681
01:08:20,817 --> 01:08:21,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to get that $79 million.

682
01:08:23,803 --> 01:08:31,209
[SPEAKER_05]: but understand to the community that this city council made sure that everybody's aware that doesn't mean everybody's whole again.

683
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to make sure that piece was clear.

684
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:36,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, I have a question about this.

685
01:08:36,114 --> 01:08:40,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think we're talking past each other and asking different questions and answering different questions.

686
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:51,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the question is, if the mayor allocated $79 million, could we use that money to bring everyone back on the payroll?

687
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the answer to that, I don't think we're talking about each other.

688
01:08:54,348 --> 01:08:59,309
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is the school committee has to vote on what the final budget is.

689
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:02,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And say, let's say, I think.

690
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're gonna make commitments.

691
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:08,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, we're not gonna make commitments.

692
01:09:08,472 --> 01:09:14,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think Councilor Scarpelli's question is being lost and the response is not helping.

693
01:09:15,173 --> 01:09:15,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah.

694
01:09:15,894 --> 01:09:20,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that if you, did you like to try to answer it a different way, Madam Superintendent?

695
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:34,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I will try to answer it the best way possible so that if in fact we are granted the 79.4 million, I'm sure that there would be certain positions that would definitely be returned.

696
01:09:35,257 --> 01:09:41,464
[SPEAKER_12]: However, that would be something that we would have to bring back to the committee to figure out which positions would come back.

697
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:59,401
[SPEAKER_12]: And of the positions coming back, if we were granted that number, we would definitely look at the other areas as well that the district continues to show need or areas of recommendations or suggestions to improve programming and other buildings.

698
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:01,843
[SPEAKER_12]: We would also take that into consideration.

699
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:05,906
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't want people to think that if we get the exact

700
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:13,231
[SPEAKER_12]: number that everything that was listed as a potential cut is going to automatically come back.

701
01:10:13,771 --> 01:10:28,040
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if I'm answering your question, Councilor Scarpelli, but I want to be clear that if we're granted that amount of money, we would definitely use it to advance and further improve programming for students in the Medford Public Schools.

702
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Secretary.

703
01:10:30,761 --> 01:10:31,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

704
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:37,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's exactly what I was asking, because I think that understanding and make sure we're transparent enough to say what you just said was perfect.

705
01:10:38,603 --> 01:10:39,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, the community is listening.

706
01:10:39,824 --> 01:10:44,905
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they come back and say, we're confused, so that that's a huge piece that I wanted to clarify.

707
01:10:45,165 --> 01:10:46,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate you.

708
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,042
[SPEAKER_05]: you pointing that out for us, okay.

709
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

710
01:10:52,325 --> 01:10:54,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate the budget book, if you can get that for us.

711
01:10:54,728 --> 01:11:01,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that we talked about last year and some things that were talked about were, you know, where were we losing money?

712
01:11:01,877 --> 01:11:05,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we looked at what are these shortfalls?

713
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:09,263
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we really capture, bring those numbers back?

714
01:11:09,403 --> 01:11:15,647
[SPEAKER_05]: One being, you know, we're seeing that we're losing a lot of kids to charter school, or our kids are leaving to private school, and why?

715
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:18,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially at the middle school, high school level, mostly the high school level.

716
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:25,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that, you know, people realize that we do lose a lot of money when we, and then the reimbursement.

717
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:29,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you enlighten us on what we paid the charter schools in reimbursement this year?

718
01:11:37,515 --> 01:11:58,452
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't really gather a lot of data on that because the city handles that account exclusively, but I wanna say that in the Senate budget or the House budget, the reimbursement was about 1.5 million and tuition might be around 8 million, something like that.

719
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:01,894
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we'll ask the mayor.

720
01:12:01,955 --> 01:12:02,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's important.

721
01:12:02,715 --> 01:12:04,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the reason why I bring this up is

722
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:15,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in 2008, we looked at how do we find a way to even try to figure out, because pennies start turning into quarters, quarters into dollars, dollars into hundreds, right?

723
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:20,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So we looked at something like the summer programming.

724
01:12:20,531 --> 01:12:32,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did, I'm proud to say that I was one of the people that brought the summer program to the MISA Tech and brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure we did that.

725
01:12:32,134 --> 01:12:34,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we didn't see is one of the biggest,

726
01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:38,992
[SPEAKER_05]: biggest needs was after-school care, before-school care.

727
01:12:39,012 --> 01:12:43,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've done the best we can without the space.

728
01:12:43,895 --> 01:12:49,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are things that I'm looking for to say, how do we bring more revenue back into the city?

729
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:53,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, providing a need for our students.

730
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:55,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's going to be important as we move forward.

731
01:12:55,962 --> 01:12:57,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's just a comment.

732
01:12:59,195 --> 01:13:02,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, like again, I think that some of the biggest questions are rumors.

733
01:13:02,738 --> 01:13:04,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to make sure we spelled a few rumors.

734
01:13:06,802 --> 01:13:08,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can just enlighten me.

735
01:13:09,633 --> 01:13:14,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I didn't hear this, so that's why I'm trying to just figure this out, to answer this for a constituent.

736
01:13:14,755 --> 01:13:16,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we cutting foreign language at the high school?

737
01:13:17,536 --> 01:13:19,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that a process, is that something that's on the table?

738
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,197
[SPEAKER_12]: No, world language.

739
01:13:21,217 --> 01:13:22,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

740
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:29,160
[SPEAKER_12]: The world language administrator position was one of the slated positions that was going to be cut.

741
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,642
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we are not cutting any of the foreign languages

742
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:38,284
[SPEAKER_12]: world language, we're still going to continue to offer world language.

743
01:13:38,784 --> 01:13:44,647
[SPEAKER_12]: What we have done this year is we have looked at what students have selected class size.

744
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:56,952
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there was a theater class at the high school level, just as an example, 11 students out of 1200 high school students signed up for it in three sections.

745
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:05,440
[SPEAKER_12]: that is not sustainable to maintain a 1.0 FTE for 11 students in three sections.

746
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,163
[SPEAKER_12]: So, like one section only had three students sign up for that.

747
01:14:09,644 --> 01:14:18,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if it's something where there's significantly low enrollment, then that particular course would not be offered.

748
01:14:19,073 --> 01:14:21,955
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and I think specifically just so you, just to be, just to,

749
01:14:22,836 --> 01:14:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: be up front is I think that the commitment with CASIC and bringing Italian to the elementary schools, and the rumor is that maybe Italian might be the language that's being dismissed.

750
01:14:33,143 --> 01:14:34,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was one of the questions.

751
01:14:35,664 --> 01:14:50,353
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the pieces of data we do have, and I can say that in full transparency, is that at this point in time, fewer students are signing up for Italian, more students are signing up for Spanish.

752
01:14:51,474 --> 01:14:58,741
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just, I think, a trend that they're starting to see that students are selecting other languages.

753
01:14:59,282 --> 01:15:07,230
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are monitoring that, but it's not a decision based on saying we don't want one language or another.

754
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:11,674
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually just based on student selection of courses.

755
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,237
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we go from there.

756
01:15:14,577 --> 01:15:22,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's important because I think that, I don't know if the funds have now dried up, that Miss Petrangelo, former Italian teacher, left the school district.

757
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:32,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe she left a million dollars at the time to make sure that foreign language, but mostly Italian, was something that she would leave her legacy.

758
01:15:32,474 --> 01:15:33,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what's important.

759
01:15:33,455 --> 01:15:36,958
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the questions, one of my former teachers, so I think that,

760
01:15:38,559 --> 01:15:47,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to, if we can, maybe not tonight, but just get some information on that, Madam Superintendent, because I think it's important to see if we still have that in the budget, which you donated.

761
01:15:47,307 --> 01:15:48,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that.

762
01:15:48,608 --> 01:15:51,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Council, we will do that.

763
01:15:51,790 --> 01:16:06,323
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a world language position at the high school that became vacant at the beginning of the school year, and it remained vacant for the, through scheduling, they were able to kind of work around it, so that,

764
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,159
[SPEAKER_16]: position was in fact cut.

765
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was at the high school?

766
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:20,769
[SPEAKER_16]: But no, the language program at the middle schools are fully funded.

767
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:22,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.

768
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:27,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I understand- Jerry, when you say cut, you mean it's in that batch of proposed cuts?

769
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:27,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

770
01:16:28,111 --> 01:16:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

771
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:28,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

772
01:16:29,132 --> 01:16:37,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I said, I think that it's important that, you know, as I'm, the questions that I'm reading up, not just from me, they're from former teachers.

773
01:16:37,073 --> 01:16:41,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they hear these things, they want to make sure that the legacy of one of their former colleagues is still carried on.

774
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:45,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know, I, you know,

775
01:16:47,799 --> 01:17:01,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I see so many students, my children included, that the Italian language part of their culture is very deep here in Medford, and I know that I think maybe Italian families really don't feel

776
01:17:02,281 --> 01:17:03,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So they feel a little bit slighted.

777
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:09,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that just for transparency purposes, just to bring forward.

778
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:22,676
[SPEAKER_12]: And I definitely want to just restate and double down that it's not, there is no intention or anything that out of the ordinary that the district is doing.

779
01:17:23,176 --> 01:17:26,659
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the students that select the languages that they

780
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:36,003
[SPEAKER_12]: want to take and I'm looking at it and I'm seeing, you know, 44 students in one section of French to honors.

781
01:17:37,003 --> 01:17:47,667
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, if I look at Spanish to CP 35 students, so the students are selecting the language, and the families are involved in that.

782
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:53,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And so as long as there is interest, and the students continue to select the classes, we will offer it.

783
01:17:55,154 --> 01:18:17,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I just want, just so you know, just with Miss Petrangelo's funding, with what she donated, just to make sure that plays a big factor, because I think that as we move forward with this, when you have a teacher leaving a vote load of money, which is a million dollars, a lot of money, and that was some years ago, so I don't know if there's anything left in that line, but understanding that with her legacy, her former colleagues that I've talked to,

784
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: making sure her legacy is carried on, that we give her the respect, whether there's only 12 kids for Italian, we find a way to fund that class with what she left.

785
01:18:28,895 --> 01:18:29,496
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my point.

786
01:18:29,516 --> 01:18:30,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that.

787
01:18:30,937 --> 01:18:35,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely understand that there's a need base and we can all agree with that.

788
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:44,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I promised Councilor President Baez that I wouldn't go line by line.

789
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:47,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I've taken enough time tonight.

790
01:18:47,740 --> 01:19:02,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the biggest question that will be during the budget presentation with the mayor, and I think that I'll be more vocal when it comes to how I think this budget should be funded, because I think that

791
01:19:03,635 --> 01:19:08,259
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're seeing right now is something the mayor ran on in transparency.

792
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,841
[SPEAKER_05]: This community has yet to see in five years.

793
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:21,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've lost a lot of revenue because of, for what she has decided what's important to this community.

794
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,391
[SPEAKER_05]: We've lost millions of dollars.

795
01:19:23,591 --> 01:19:28,294
[SPEAKER_05]: We wouldn't be in this bar right now if the mayor was more transparent in the process.

796
01:19:28,494 --> 01:19:30,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Just no different than this process we're in right now.

797
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:32,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We found out

798
01:19:33,697 --> 01:19:47,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I was watching the meeting, the five o'clock meeting, and the mayor was stunned when you expressed the number, and she came back right away and said, this working group has been working on a override, Proposition 2 1⁄2.

799
01:19:48,105 --> 01:19:50,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And I only bring this up because Councilor Villes and I talked.

800
01:19:51,307 --> 01:20:00,492
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people I've talked to that you would think that don't want an override have blatantly told me, if we can see the financial picture, and is it true?

801
01:20:00,512 --> 01:20:01,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the data prove that?

802
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:12,773
[SPEAKER_05]: If we had new revenue, if we went with one 40B project, and if that 40B project brought in $3 million in permits, right?

803
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:15,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the new revenue, that's another $3 million.

804
01:20:16,929 --> 01:20:17,750
[SPEAKER_05]: out of that project.

805
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:26,679
[SPEAKER_05]: This $606 million in new growth, that's one project that we fought, which by the way, would be hundreds, hundreds of affordable housing units.

806
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:35,348
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the narrow minded thinking and the mismanagement of finances that we're seeing today in this community that is hurting the bottom line.

807
01:20:35,368 --> 01:20:39,092
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottom line is scary to say it's going to be our children and our seniors.

808
01:20:39,893 --> 01:20:45,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, Mr. McHugh, listen, I appreciate all your hard work.

809
01:20:46,215 --> 01:20:48,255
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the toughest job in this whole city.

810
01:20:48,955 --> 01:20:53,997
[SPEAKER_05]: You were given a pile of junk, and they said, OK, go to work.

811
01:20:54,757 --> 01:21:03,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I do have a lot of support from the staff in the central office and directors as well.

812
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:08,361
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to make one small comment about the budget book.

813
01:21:10,515 --> 01:21:15,636
[SPEAKER_16]: We will publish a budget book and I'm happy to deliver you a copy when it's ready.

814
01:21:15,676 --> 01:21:19,917
[SPEAKER_16]: But the gap, there's such a difference.

815
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:26,899
[SPEAKER_16]: You see the turmoil that was caused, the anxiety with $2.2 million worth of cuts.

816
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:34,901
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was what I would consider just kind of around the edges to go up to five million.

817
01:21:36,081 --> 01:21:45,464
[SPEAKER_16]: to have to disclose huge cuts in staff and programs that wouldn't have been helpful at all.

818
01:21:45,544 --> 01:21:56,907
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's kind of difficult to put a budget book together under those circumstances, but we do want to document what we did to get to the bottom line.

819
01:21:56,947 --> 01:21:59,328
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I will get that to you.

820
01:21:59,688 --> 01:22:02,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And to that point, do you see what I'm saying?

821
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:04,650
[SPEAKER_05]: To that point, Mr. McHugh,

822
01:22:05,904 --> 01:22:12,626
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a community that's looking at a $79 million budget line, and we truly don't understand it yet.

823
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's frightening to me.

824
01:22:15,908 --> 01:22:19,469
[SPEAKER_05]: We left here a year ago at this time knowing we were going to be here.

825
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:26,031
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, another comment people ask, is the school committee still going to accept their raises?

826
01:22:26,111 --> 01:22:27,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sure.

827
01:22:27,912 --> 01:22:33,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend still that we cut our pay to support that so we don't hurt the budget in any way possible.

828
01:22:33,534 --> 01:22:34,634
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's my opinion.

829
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:45,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you as the director of finance or the acting finance guru here see how drastic and how difficult this process is,

830
01:22:46,673 --> 01:22:47,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine what we're thinking.

831
01:22:47,873 --> 01:22:49,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine what the residents are thinking.

832
01:22:49,574 --> 01:23:06,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine the homeowner that's a senior citizen sitting back and someone's whispering in the area saying that if an override goes through and debt exclusions go through and transfer tax goes through, that homeowner is possibly looking at thousands of dollars that are going to change their lives.

833
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the fear right now.

834
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and I appreciate that, I hate to put you on the hot seat because you don't deserve it, but this is exactly how everybody's failing.

835
01:23:16,507 --> 01:23:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is when I say mismanagement of finances in our community, it's not your fault, but it is, we can see it.

836
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:28,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate it, thank you.

837
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:29,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

838
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:32,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to Councillor Zara.

839
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,162
[SPEAKER_08]: just a couple things point of information.

840
01:23:35,222 --> 01:23:43,719
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, our city finance director did talk about the charter reimbursements that's covered in the city budget, one of their line items, but

841
01:23:44,952 --> 01:24:05,453
[SPEAKER_02]: we uh there it's like a graduated uh reimbursement rate so it starts out higher and it gets gradually lower it's 180 60 zero yeah four years and jerry was basically dead on uh it was 8.6 million sending last year and 1.6 million reimbursed so yes seven million of chapters is here tonight so

842
01:24:06,153 --> 01:24:09,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli, I think if you wanted to ask him about that, you could probably show it to him.

843
01:24:09,055 --> 01:24:16,962
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I think the biggest piece, I think, Councilor, is that the understanding of is in trying to recover funding in any way we can is finding a reason why we're losing.

844
01:24:17,242 --> 01:24:18,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I asked him about that.

845
01:24:18,843 --> 01:24:22,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to request my fellow Councilors please not engage in cross-talk.

846
01:24:23,587 --> 01:24:31,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I'd like to add to the meeting record if we could request an update on the Petrangelo fund balance from the Finance Director.

847
01:24:31,173 --> 01:24:33,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazaro.

848
01:24:34,055 --> 01:24:34,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Another

849
01:24:35,786 --> 01:24:43,829
[SPEAKER_08]: thought I had is that I think it's possible that we may be losing students on the higher grades to private and charter because of the historic underfunding of our public schools.

850
01:24:44,389 --> 01:24:54,752
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, I do have a question that is pertinent to the work that our city council can do, which is about the homeless transport in the schools and the fact that it costs so much.

851
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:59,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering if you knew, and you may not, do you know if that

852
01:24:59,873 --> 01:25:03,579
[SPEAKER_08]: is so much higher than it's been budgeted for in the past.

853
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it higher this year than it has been in previous years?

854
01:25:06,483 --> 01:25:09,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it always higher and we just overspend?

855
01:25:10,131 --> 01:25:14,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's been around this level for a couple of years.

856
01:25:14,372 --> 01:25:17,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just something that's overspent from that and maybe pulled from another line.

857
01:25:17,373 --> 01:25:19,754
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's unfortunate, there's just more need.

858
01:25:20,034 --> 01:25:28,456
[SPEAKER_16]: And the lack of housing, so the available housing for these families are further and further out.

859
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:31,397
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just more costly.

860
01:25:31,437 --> 01:25:36,099
[SPEAKER_16]: But we are hoping, through a rigorous bid process, that we could,

861
01:25:38,339 --> 01:25:40,941
[SPEAKER_16]: take the opportunity to kind of reduce some of those costs.

862
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:45,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you explain to me what you mean by rigorous bid process?

863
01:25:47,244 --> 01:25:53,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we have to pay for homeless transportation in two ways.

864
01:25:54,467 --> 01:26:01,631
[SPEAKER_16]: One is for the transportation that MedFed is required to provide.

865
01:26:03,109 --> 01:26:08,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now we're getting quotes from small providers on an as needed basis.

866
01:26:08,278 --> 01:26:09,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Taxi services.

867
01:26:10,438 --> 01:26:14,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, bands and companies have got into this business.

868
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:17,180
[SPEAKER_16]: It's door-to-door.

869
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:33,965
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we're also required to participate in the transportation that other school districts provide when they are the receiving district and we're the home district of that family.

870
01:26:34,365 --> 01:26:37,266
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's just a check we have to cut when we get it.

871
01:26:41,628 --> 01:26:50,274
[SPEAKER_16]: We are working with the city purchasing director right now, and we're preparing a bid for all our transportation.

872
01:26:52,475 --> 01:26:59,740
[SPEAKER_16]: We're hoping that could reduce the cost, but the underlying cost of transportation is also going up.

873
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:04,703
[SPEAKER_16]: The drivers are getting more money, the cost of gas, the cost of maintaining.

874
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:13,859
[SPEAKER_16]: maybe the best we do is level funded, what savings we might achieve might be offset by higher costs.

875
01:27:14,932 --> 01:27:26,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I am curious about the degree to which greater services for homeless families in Medford would allay some of the costs of transporting.

876
01:27:26,722 --> 01:27:39,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're finding that when families do deal with the effects of becoming homeless, if they have to find shelter further away, does it only

877
01:27:41,994 --> 01:27:51,839
[SPEAKER_08]: happen when they are actively living in shelters or does it continue, does the transport continue when they have permanent housing or do they then relocate to a new district?

878
01:27:53,848 --> 01:27:59,790
[SPEAKER_16]: The state has a very broad definition of what constitutes homelessness.

879
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:06,732
[SPEAKER_16]: So you could be homeless in the family car, you know.

880
01:28:07,892 --> 01:28:11,474
[SPEAKER_16]: You could be homeless if, you know,

881
01:28:12,614 --> 01:28:27,841
[SPEAKER_16]: you live in Medford, but you have to move back with your cousin, you know, because you're being evicted, or your rent's just gone up three or $400 a month because the landlord wants to get you out of the house.

882
01:28:30,202 --> 01:28:40,987
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, it's not based on whether you're in a shelter or whether you're not, but you, you know, that's something that the,

883
01:28:42,648 --> 01:28:58,573
[SPEAKER_16]: registration office handles and those are, you know, private conversations with parents, but the benefit of the program, I think, even though there's a significant cost with it, is that it does provide a very

884
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:08,564
[SPEAKER_16]: limited amount of stability for the students involved when everything else is completely unstable.

885
01:29:08,644 --> 01:29:09,824
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called McKinney-Vento?

886
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:09,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

887
01:29:10,004 --> 01:29:11,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, okay.

888
01:29:12,005 --> 01:29:16,607
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very important for stability for students, and it's something that's important to support.

889
01:29:16,647 --> 01:29:19,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unfortunate it's expensive, but I do think it's important.

890
01:29:20,009 --> 01:29:24,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, how do you kind of find a way to balance it so that it doesn't necessarily have to be so expensive?

891
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:26,592
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you for that explanation.

892
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:27,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

893
01:29:27,372 --> 01:29:32,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the state does provide a limited amount of reimbursement for it as well.

894
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:41,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins.

895
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much, President Pierce.

896
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you again for being here and for patiently answering all of our questions.

897
01:29:49,701 --> 01:29:52,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I speak for all my fellow counselors when I say we really appreciate it.

898
01:29:53,542 --> 01:29:58,024
[SPEAKER_11]: And we recognize how hard, how hard this job is on everybody.

899
01:29:59,764 --> 01:30:03,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not a number crunching person so to me it seems even harder.

900
01:30:03,385 --> 01:30:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

901
01:30:07,372 --> 01:30:11,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very true that we went into this fiscal year knowing that it would be really, really difficult.

902
01:30:12,393 --> 01:30:14,974
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's because we knew that one-time funding was coming offline.

903
01:30:15,934 --> 01:30:16,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody knew that.

904
01:30:16,515 --> 01:30:17,155
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about that.

905
01:30:17,175 --> 01:30:17,955
[SPEAKER_11]: That was out in the open.

906
01:30:18,135 --> 01:30:19,535
[SPEAKER_11]: We knew that we were coming into a year.

907
01:30:19,935 --> 01:30:32,079
[SPEAKER_11]: We would have to transition from a lot of really important, often critical positions being funded by this one-time funding, which is now going away because of how this national act, national grant funding worked.

908
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:36,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're doing the work of figuring out how to transition away from that.

909
01:30:37,322 --> 01:31:01,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel really confident that every player in this dynamic shares the same goal of coming out of this budget season with a budget that includes a school department appropriation that gives the school department the latitude, the ability to put that money where it is going to best support students and teachers and all school staff and families.

910
01:31:03,556 --> 01:31:14,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really do think that that is a value that everybody behind this realm, school committee, mayor's office, your team, administration, I think that is really shared.

911
01:31:16,286 --> 01:31:23,471
[SPEAKER_11]: What I get out of that for me is saying, great, I support this $79.4 million recommendation.

912
01:31:24,452 --> 01:31:31,137
[SPEAKER_11]: And that sounds to me like a number that will help us achieve our shared goal of doing right by Medford Public Schools.

913
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:35,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Budget seasons are hard work.

914
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:37,272
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what that hard work looks like.

915
01:31:38,232 --> 01:31:41,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Making recommendations and reconciling them with what's possible.

916
01:31:43,636 --> 01:31:45,377
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't get there by fighting with each other.

917
01:31:45,597 --> 01:31:46,818
[SPEAKER_11]: We get there by working together.

918
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:56,004
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am, I think like everybody in the community, knowing for not just one year, but for several years, that there is going to be an Esser cliff.

919
01:31:57,305 --> 01:31:59,167
[SPEAKER_11]: There being a lot of transparency around that.

920
01:32:00,089 --> 01:32:06,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowing that, coming into this budget season, feeling really anxious, feeling really worried, because this is too important.

921
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:19,014
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think if we continue to collaborate and say, what can we all do so that we get as close to that number as possible, so that we don't have to cut things that we don't want to cut, that's how this should work.

922
01:32:20,665 --> 01:32:35,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I for myself, I don't have any further questions, and I also want to reiterate, I want to leave the discussion of the line item positions and programs to the forum where those questions can be most thoroughly answered.

923
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:36,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's what the school committee.

924
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:39,680
[SPEAKER_11]: So for myself, I don't have any further discussion points.

925
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have any further questions.

926
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:43,863
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a couple other departments to hear from tonight.

927
01:32:45,424 --> 01:32:47,726
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll defer to my other counselors, but I'll prefer that we

928
01:32:48,326 --> 01:32:51,889
[SPEAKER_11]: we move on to our next departments at this point, after this very thorough, very appreciated presentation.

929
01:32:52,549 --> 01:32:53,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

930
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:54,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Lemming.

931
01:32:54,991 --> 01:32:55,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

932
01:32:56,932 --> 01:33:04,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like everybody watching this, to understand just a couple of basic things about the city's financial situation.

933
01:33:04,597 --> 01:33:16,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So first off, this is a very long time coming, and it would be easy to sit here and talk about this or that decision, complain about everything

934
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:21,089
[SPEAKER_04]: under the sun about why we're here right now.

935
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:23,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, the problem is systemic.

936
01:33:23,912 --> 01:33:35,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So Proposition 2.5 prevents the city from increasing its total tax levy, the total amount of money we take in from property taxes, by 2.5% every year.

937
01:33:35,304 --> 01:33:37,747
[SPEAKER_04]: The average inflation from 1980 till today

938
01:33:39,789 --> 01:33:41,271
[SPEAKER_04]: 1980 was when Prop 2.5 was passed.

939
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:42,933
[SPEAKER_04]: That average rate has been 3.08%.

940
01:33:42,973 --> 01:33:52,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means that the value of the budget in 1980 adding up would be about three quarters as

941
01:33:54,385 --> 01:33:57,747
[SPEAKER_04]: The modern budget would be about three quarters as valuable as it was back then.

942
01:33:58,047 --> 01:34:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: This is somewhat offset by growth.

943
01:34:00,908 --> 01:34:13,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Cities that have had a lot of development in the past 44 years, Cambridge over with Kendall Square, Somerville with Assembly Row have not had to pass an override.

944
01:34:14,193 --> 01:34:19,295
[SPEAKER_04]: But Medford hasn't seen that development just in the longer term.

945
01:34:19,335 --> 01:34:20,816
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a variety of reasons for that.

946
01:34:21,776 --> 01:34:29,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I think that this is not a panel of judges criticizing others decisions.

947
01:34:29,642 --> 01:34:31,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It is our job to come up with solutions.

948
01:34:31,804 --> 01:34:36,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to sit here and either be administrators or the school committee.

949
01:34:37,928 --> 01:34:42,531
[SPEAKER_04]: five loaves of bread and two fishes and tell you that you need to feed 5,000 people.

950
01:34:42,591 --> 01:34:43,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not how this works.

951
01:34:45,072 --> 01:35:01,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we need to get real about the budgetary situation and say that we do need an override of some sort just because the system that we're in inherently leaves us with a broken budget.

952
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:02,463
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is that

953
01:35:03,303 --> 01:35:25,674
[SPEAKER_04]: passing it to if we were to pass it to if we were to pass an override that money would not be available from now till the next fiscal year so there's the matter of bridging that gap it is not in the city council's authority to set to raise any of these line items it is

954
01:35:26,414 --> 01:35:39,060
[SPEAKER_04]: not in the authority of the City Council to say, hey, we need to take, you know, $6 million or $2.7 million from free cash and use that to fund the school systems in the interim.

955
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,241
[SPEAKER_04]: That is up to the mayor.

956
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:49,185
[SPEAKER_04]: The City Council is working on a lot of other things, a lot of other initiatives which will address this fiscal shortfall in the long term.

957
01:35:49,525 --> 01:35:51,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of our solutions are perfect.

958
01:35:51,546 --> 01:35:53,847
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got done with a committee meeting where

959
01:35:54,827 --> 01:36:00,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I was proposing a commercial vacancy tax to help to address the vacant storefront problems in Medford.

960
01:36:00,689 --> 01:36:13,252
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a perfect solution, no solution is, but I'm trying to bring solutions forward to help address our problems instead of just complaining about the decisions that are made by other people and acting like I have no power in this situation.

961
01:36:14,093 --> 01:36:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is, so that being said,

962
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:23,432
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what I personally think should be done about this situation.

963
01:36:23,452 --> 01:36:30,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that there are arguments against taking free cash out of reserves.

964
01:36:31,397 --> 01:36:32,957
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking to fund a new high school.

965
01:36:33,017 --> 01:36:38,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Having an amount of free cash is important in order to get a good interest rate for the loan for that new high school.

966
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:44,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that way, spending that money now could end up just affecting the city's bottom line 10 years from now.

967
01:36:45,064 --> 01:36:45,624
[SPEAKER_04]: the mayor's proposal.

968
01:36:45,664 --> 01:36:49,306
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that in this situation it is more necessary.

969
01:36:49,866 --> 01:36:52,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It is necessary to make that that decision.

970
01:36:52,747 --> 01:36:56,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to seeing, um, what the mayor's proposal is.

971
01:36:56,849 --> 01:37:03,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Um if she doesn't if she doesn't want to do that, or if she finds cuts in other areas.

972
01:37:03,872 --> 01:37:10,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I wish that other decisions have been made beforehand.

973
01:37:10,535 --> 01:37:21,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that an override should have been passed a lot earlier so that we wouldn't be dealing with this right at the edge of that fiscal cliff, but it is what it is.

974
01:37:23,407 --> 01:37:34,453
[SPEAKER_04]: People aren't looking for people sitting behind, sitting in these chairs to come up with complaints about a budget situation that obviously nobody likes.

975
01:37:35,073 --> 01:37:40,436
[SPEAKER_04]: People are coming here to find proposed solutions to these problems, even if these are not ideal.

976
01:37:41,137 --> 01:37:51,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you for going through a budget that is just not enough money to go around at the end of the day and coming to us with what you can.

977
01:37:53,644 --> 01:37:57,666
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's all I have to say about that.

978
01:37:58,166 --> 01:38:19,457
[SPEAKER_04]: This council really can't make a whole lot of decisions about this realistically until we get another number from the mayor around what her proposal is, but we'll be able to come up with more definite answers after that, so thank you.

979
01:38:20,277 --> 01:38:20,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

980
01:38:22,942 --> 01:38:37,767
[SPEAKER_02]: As one Councillor, I'd just like to reiterate, Councillor Collins and I proposed an override of $12 million in 2022 because we knew the structural underfunding of our city.

981
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:44,690
[SPEAKER_02]: That was tabled by a rule that then pushed it past the deadline and made it moved by another Councillor at the time.

982
01:38:45,942 --> 01:38:48,724
[SPEAKER_02]: and fiscal 23 and 2023 for fiscal 24.

983
01:38:49,024 --> 01:38:55,369
[SPEAKER_02]: We proposed, uh, to three charter amendments, which would have we felt better address the budget process.

984
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:59,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those were passed by 6 to 1 margin, but we're not submitted to the state House.

985
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:01,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor did not want to move those forward.

986
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:04,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I think

987
01:39:05,257 --> 01:39:14,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of the elected officials in this community were elected because they clearly messaged the reality of structural underfunding of our schools and our city departments.

988
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:17,082
[SPEAKER_02]: We know there is not enough money to do the job.

989
01:39:17,862 --> 01:39:23,024
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason there is not enough money, piece of it, is that we've never done an override in 44 years.

990
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:26,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Piece of it is we don't have as much development as fast as scale as we want, right?

991
01:39:26,945 --> 01:39:30,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that those answers can't both be true at the same time.

992
01:39:32,162 --> 01:39:33,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are where we are.

993
01:39:34,204 --> 01:39:37,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And 1 of those things takes 5 to 10 years.

994
01:39:37,187 --> 01:39:39,769
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 of those things takes much less time.

995
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we believe can actually affect this fiscal year.

996
01:39:44,734 --> 01:39:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in the future, I mean, again, we've been, we've spent what meeting are we on counselor Collins meeting?

997
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:52,782
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, maybe 7 for the budget.

998
01:39:52,822 --> 01:39:53,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But what meeting are we on the zoning?

999
01:39:55,239 --> 01:40:14,033
[SPEAKER_02]: five of this term and we did a whole zoning recodification last term and we've approved multiple plan development district projects that have come before this council because this council has been focused last term with a very different membership this term with a different membership on the idea that this community should grow and that growth needs to be an essential piece of our revenue strategy.

1000
01:40:14,354 --> 01:40:15,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're there.

1001
01:40:16,816 --> 01:40:22,220
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been pushing very hard as a council to have more resources in our finance to budget department so that we have

1002
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:34,265
[SPEAKER_02]: more transparent and open budget planning so that our schools and our city finance departments are not so strapped that they're so worried about the next two weeks that we can't think about the next two and 20 years.

1003
01:40:35,165 --> 01:40:39,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's work that we have been doing, and it's essential work.

1004
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:50,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now at the point I was worried we would be when I saw the fiscal 21 budget in the first six months of COVID, which is a fiscal cliff.

1005
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:56,291
[SPEAKER_02]: That means if we do not find revenue now, jobs lost.

1006
01:40:57,411 --> 01:41:04,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, without that new revenue, we can have a debate, and the council has a role, not on the school side about this, about who we want to fire.

1007
01:41:05,253 --> 01:41:07,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think any of us want to have that discussion.

1008
01:41:09,294 --> 01:41:16,696
[SPEAKER_02]: We could find $5 million in the budget, but it's 50 people in the schools or 50 people somewhere else, basically.

1009
01:41:17,997 --> 01:41:19,117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the position we're in now.

1010
01:41:21,818 --> 01:41:31,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking back at the past is not going to change that, although I do think we should look to the past so that we don't repeat the mistakes in the future.

1011
01:41:31,972 --> 01:41:38,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that we can all at least agree on the fact that we don't want to fire people.

1012
01:41:40,376 --> 01:41:44,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion by members of the council on the mentor public schools budget counselors.

1013
01:41:44,918 --> 01:41:45,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be really quick.

1014
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:59,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think I do agree with everything that's been that the President just said, um, I am very grateful to Superintendent Edward prison and director queue for the hard work that you've been putting into this budget season.

1015
01:42:00,223 --> 01:42:01,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also very grateful to the school community.

1016
01:42:02,024 --> 01:42:07,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have a few members in the audience tonight for the work that they've been doing for the last two budget meetings.

1017
01:42:07,765 --> 01:42:15,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had a lot of constituents write in today saying that the work that you all did to explain the budget last night was very, very helpful.

1018
01:42:16,307 --> 01:42:19,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to make sure that that effort doesn't go unmentioned.

1019
01:42:20,909 --> 01:42:22,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supportive.

1020
01:42:22,489 --> 01:42:27,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I support the $79.4 million that the school committee recommended for the school's budget.

1021
01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:28,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that

1022
01:42:29,631 --> 01:42:39,013
[SPEAKER_03]: The proposed cuts are painful, and I've been a student in many of the programs mentioned, and that's something that I'll fight for.

1023
01:42:39,033 --> 01:42:53,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made it the cornerstone of my campaign to run for city council, and I think I can speak for every city councillor behind the rail that we will do our best to fight for as much money for the schools as we can get.

1024
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:58,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's, you know, we're on record doing it in the last few years.

1025
01:42:58,243 --> 01:43:00,145
[SPEAKER_03]: We've added millions of dollars to the school budget.

1026
01:43:01,147 --> 01:43:07,335
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to keep fighting, and I believe in our council to do our best to try to reconcile everything.

1027
01:43:09,093 --> 01:43:10,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, any further questions by members of the council?

1028
01:43:10,574 --> 01:43:11,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I can.

1029
01:43:11,354 --> 01:43:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpa.

1030
01:43:12,275 --> 01:43:30,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to reiterate, I think that maybe some things are getting confused, some councils in translation, but the understanding, I appreciate you bringing this point up, that understanding to sit here and blame anybody right now doesn't get us anywhere, but to understand the process to make sure the,

1031
01:43:33,266 --> 01:43:37,007
[SPEAKER_05]: the bleeding stops when the same thing's being done over and over again.

1032
01:43:37,487 --> 01:43:47,150
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to identify that and being the fact that this council is in charge of making sure that financially, we're doing the best for every citizen.

1033
01:43:48,491 --> 01:43:51,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to ask us the most important questions.

1034
01:43:52,052 --> 01:44:00,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I bring up the fact of five years of stagnant growth, of course, that's a huge factor where we are today.

1035
01:44:01,295 --> 01:44:01,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it is.

1036
01:44:04,025 --> 01:44:13,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I identified one development that would have brought our community millions of dollars, and that's one.

1037
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:34,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So the key factor and the key process that I'm bringing up right now, and especially that everybody understands this, is not only with the mayor, and I brought up the council respectively, the council president from June 20th, and then even with this financial process that we're talking about with this working group.

1038
01:44:36,594 --> 01:44:42,758
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're doing it in a bubble and we don't know what's going on, it's alarming.

1039
01:44:44,056 --> 01:44:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in big trouble.

1040
01:44:45,897 --> 01:44:50,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And now sure, could we have looked at a debt exclusion or overrides in the past?

1041
01:44:50,679 --> 01:44:50,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1042
01:44:50,879 --> 01:44:57,882
[SPEAKER_05]: This council, by the way, unlike anyone here, presented the debt exclusion for a new fire station years ago.

1043
01:44:59,537 --> 01:45:04,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe one person was here that voted no on that that evening, but it didn't go anywhere.

1044
01:45:05,021 --> 01:45:24,176
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I did was, I met with the financial director, who by the way, as award winning financial director, and Alicia Nunley, and she presented a breakdown of that debt exclusion to educate everybody to understand where it fell, where it fell.

1045
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:26,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time it was $17 per household a month.

1046
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:32,345
[SPEAKER_05]: with excluding senior citizens and veterans.

1047
01:45:33,826 --> 01:45:38,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand completely what this council is looking to do, but it's how are we doing it?

1048
01:45:41,369 --> 01:45:46,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And understanding that maybe pointing the finger has to be done.

1049
01:45:48,713 --> 01:45:50,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe people understanding because you know what?

1050
01:45:51,574 --> 01:45:57,457
[SPEAKER_05]: To get this passed, if we really need it, we need everybody involved.

1051
01:45:58,359 --> 01:45:59,860
[SPEAKER_05]: We need everybody to see the light.

1052
01:46:04,003 --> 01:46:09,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Because all this is doing right now is further dividing this community, this process.

1053
01:46:10,188 --> 01:46:12,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that we don't need it, because I've already addressed that.

1054
01:46:12,349 --> 01:46:26,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if it's done properly and the data proves it, and we can say, well, let's say we have four developments ready to go in the next year and a half.

1055
01:46:28,493 --> 01:46:33,897
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're ready to pull the trigger instead of fighting and going to court and denying and denying.

1056
01:46:34,478 --> 01:46:37,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe that's revenue that we wouldn't be sitting here right now.

1057
01:46:39,382 --> 01:46:43,285
[SPEAKER_05]: So to my colleagues, we have to identify that.

1058
01:46:43,565 --> 01:46:47,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have to look at pointing because that's our job.

1059
01:46:48,629 --> 01:46:50,831
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to figure out where the mistakes have happened.

1060
01:46:51,111 --> 01:46:53,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't happen again, like Councilman said.

1061
01:46:55,131 --> 01:46:56,272
[SPEAKER_05]: So this isn't sour grapes.

1062
01:46:56,872 --> 01:46:57,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in this community.

1063
01:46:58,333 --> 01:46:59,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I taught in this community.

1064
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:01,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I coach in this community.

1065
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I own a home in this community.

1066
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:05,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I raised two kids in this community.

1067
01:47:07,059 --> 01:47:08,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the school committee for eight years.

1068
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been the council now for many years.

1069
01:47:13,283 --> 01:47:15,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the ups and downs.

1070
01:47:15,384 --> 01:47:17,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that things are underfunded.

1071
01:47:20,063 --> 01:47:25,384
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we do it correctly, everybody can get involved in this, and everybody can support it.

1072
01:47:26,604 --> 01:47:35,106
[SPEAKER_05]: But when it's coming the way it's coming out right now, and it's irresponsible, the process was irresponsible to date.

1073
01:47:35,386 --> 01:47:36,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And Council Bears and I have talked about this.

1074
01:47:37,526 --> 01:47:42,007
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't disagree in the sense that he wished things came out differently, too.

1075
01:47:42,047 --> 01:47:42,867
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked about this.

1076
01:47:44,887 --> 01:47:48,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the process that constituents

1077
01:47:49,994 --> 01:47:55,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not some people's, but constituents that reach out to me, make sure I express that.

1078
01:47:55,819 --> 01:47:57,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So we look at every avenue possible.

1079
01:47:59,062 --> 01:48:02,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe talking to mayor and saying, okay, let's look at this.

1080
01:48:02,565 --> 01:48:03,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look at this right now.

1081
01:48:04,366 --> 01:48:09,551
[SPEAKER_05]: What we can do today to fund our schools, to get them level funded, so they're not hurting.

1082
01:48:09,591 --> 01:48:10,612
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time,

1083
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:19,446
[SPEAKER_05]: pause, get the information that we need, the proper information that we need, the data that we need, that everybody can marry and understand.

1084
01:48:19,466 --> 01:48:20,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

1085
01:48:21,068 --> 01:48:22,989
[SPEAKER_05]: We do need a debt exclusion for this.

1086
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,532
[SPEAKER_05]: We do need an override for this amount of money.

1087
01:48:26,813 --> 01:48:27,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying not to do it.

1088
01:48:29,054 --> 01:48:39,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I would firmly believe if the data shows and everybody's part of the process, because I said this at the beginning, the difference that you're seeing in communities that have passed overrides,

1089
01:48:41,161 --> 01:48:43,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Communities were informed, they were part of the process.

1090
01:48:45,764 --> 01:48:55,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good friends with a former mayor that is probably someone that I put on the top of the mountain when it comes to mayors.

1091
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:58,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I explained this to him, he says, well, explain the breakdown.

1092
01:48:59,695 --> 01:49:00,555
[SPEAKER_05]: How was it presented?

1093
01:49:02,377 --> 01:49:05,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I said, well, it wasn't presented, it was just mentioned.

1094
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:07,741
[SPEAKER_05]: How irresponsible?

1095
01:49:08,874 --> 01:49:18,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So fellow consulate might not take what I'm saying as that they take respect toward it or they feel that it's not needed.

1096
01:49:19,187 --> 01:49:19,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it is needed.

1097
01:49:20,849 --> 01:49:22,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's what people put us in for.

1098
01:49:23,692 --> 01:49:27,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would never tell anybody here not to express your thoughts.

1099
01:49:30,111 --> 01:49:35,656
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are the thoughts that we can bring everybody together and find a way to get where we need to go.

1100
01:49:35,676 --> 01:49:40,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, if it's a debt exclusions, if it's overrides, I think there's a way to get there.

1101
01:49:41,621 --> 01:49:42,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1102
01:49:42,682 --> 01:49:44,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for our Jerry.

1103
01:49:44,984 --> 01:49:45,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you.

1104
01:49:46,345 --> 01:49:47,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1105
01:49:50,956 --> 01:50:01,204
[SPEAKER_02]: With all due respect, I believe that we will have something for this council and the people of the city of Medford to consider that will include all the data that you're talking about.

1106
01:50:01,705 --> 01:50:04,287
[SPEAKER_02]: The presentations that you're talking about, that is the intent.

1107
01:50:05,408 --> 01:50:08,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, I was here two years ago, right?

1108
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:12,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should have been having that conversation two years ago.

1109
01:50:12,053 --> 01:50:15,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins and I put something forward to have that conversation.

1110
01:50:16,616 --> 01:50:28,484
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now in dire straits and we are having that conversation, but I believe that what we will present is fully scoped and has that information and everyone can get behind it because that's what we're talking about here.

1111
01:50:28,985 --> 01:50:44,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually seen in the past two and a half weeks incredible unity among people who often disagree about the fact that the impact of the budget allocation versus the need of the schools would be devastating among people who don't often agree.

1112
01:50:46,748 --> 01:50:50,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had conversations, phone calls, emails, social media, all of that.

1113
01:50:52,131 --> 01:50:54,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe we will get there.

1114
01:50:58,013 --> 01:51:02,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I think the facts support both of the cases that have been made here.

1115
01:51:03,535 --> 01:51:06,136
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the new growth numbers, they go on DLS back to 2003.

1116
01:51:06,256 --> 01:51:10,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about five years of lack of growth, we're talking about 40 years of lack of growth.

1117
01:51:11,356 --> 01:51:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: But the last three years since we started our zoning conversation are the three highest in the history of the city.

1118
01:51:16,998 --> 01:51:18,299
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're making that work.

1119
01:51:18,739 --> 01:51:22,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about also on the override side, never done it in 45 years.

1120
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So I agree with you, we need to do differently.

1121
01:51:25,981 --> 01:51:33,604
[SPEAKER_02]: This council, as I believe, including all of us, has been trying to change the tone on development and growth by

1122
01:51:34,384 --> 01:51:40,666
[SPEAKER_02]: updating the zoning recodification and implementing our zoning project, change the tone on budget by passing the city's first ever budget ordinance.

1123
01:51:42,026 --> 01:51:54,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And just speaking from the perspective of the financial task force, sometimes I feel caught in a catch-22 of, do we not say anything until we have everything fully baked so we can answer every question that you just asked, Councillor Scarpelli?

1124
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:58,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we say everything before we have any answers so that everyone sees every question we've had to ask?

1125
01:51:59,132 --> 01:52:02,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, in many cases, an impossible choice.

1126
01:52:03,613 --> 01:52:08,115
[SPEAKER_02]: and also a choice that is not just the choice of myself and Councillor Collins, but of the group.

1127
01:52:08,235 --> 01:52:09,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on it.

1128
01:52:10,556 --> 01:52:28,063
[SPEAKER_02]: What you described is my goal, and I hope that I will be able to present to this Council exactly what you described soon, because I believe that is my responsibility and the faith entrusted in me by the members of the Council and elected me President and by the voters of the City of Bedford by electing me as a Councillor.

1129
01:52:28,523 --> 01:52:29,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is my goal.

1130
01:52:30,564 --> 01:52:33,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I'll go to Vice President Collins, and then we can hopefully go to members of the public.

1131
01:52:35,425 --> 01:52:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins.

1132
01:52:36,245 --> 01:52:36,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1133
01:52:38,105 --> 01:52:45,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say, I think that as representatives, we hear some of what people in the community are feeling.

1134
01:52:47,328 --> 01:52:53,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never purport to hear what everybody is feeling or to know what everybody is feeling, but we all receive different trends and patterns in that.

1135
01:52:53,569 --> 01:52:56,750
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that we can, as representatives, convey

1136
01:52:59,214 --> 01:53:01,696
[SPEAKER_11]: what we're hearing from members of the community, i.e.

1137
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:07,581
[SPEAKER_11]: about an override, without going so far as to say that we know how everybody is feeling.

1138
01:53:08,642 --> 01:53:09,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I know who I've heard from.

1139
01:53:10,523 --> 01:53:17,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that based on who I've heard from, there's strong will to do what's necessary to fully fund the schools and maintain level service.

1140
01:53:17,109 --> 01:53:18,890
[SPEAKER_11]: What we're talking about is level service, not level funding.

1141
01:53:20,745 --> 01:53:25,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that other people have concerns and other counselors have heard those as well, and both things can be true at the same time.

1142
01:53:25,870 --> 01:53:42,266
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also do just want to note, because I know that some of these concepts are new to many residents, because it's true that we haven't done an override in 45 years, that if we do an override and or a debt exclusion for both to what degree, these are questions that will go before

1143
01:53:42,907 --> 01:53:45,468
[SPEAKER_11]: The residents, everybody will be included in this process.

1144
01:53:45,528 --> 01:53:46,689
[SPEAKER_11]: This will go on the ballot.

1145
01:53:47,129 --> 01:53:59,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We will have five months for everybody to be included in this process to learn about an override or debt exclusion if one is proposed and for everybody to form their own opinion about if they're going to vote for it or against it.

1146
01:54:01,216 --> 01:54:05,038
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to make that really clear that this is something that will be decided by popular vote.

1147
01:54:06,758 --> 01:54:06,979
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1148
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:08,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1149
01:54:08,119 --> 01:54:09,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions or comments by members of the Council?

1150
01:54:11,877 --> 01:54:13,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, we'll go to members of the public.

1151
01:54:14,359 --> 01:54:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much Madam Superintendent, Mr. Finance Director, much appreciated.

1152
01:54:19,442 --> 01:54:22,704
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

1153
01:54:22,744 --> 01:54:25,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record please, feel free to sit and use the microphone.

1154
01:54:26,507 --> 01:54:29,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're on Zoom and would like to make a comment, please raise your hand.

1155
01:54:30,996 --> 01:54:31,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going to stand.

1156
01:54:32,477 --> 01:54:34,999
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1157
01:54:35,019 --> 01:54:41,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, 45 M Hill Avenue in Levenster, Massachusetts, and I am the president of the med fatigue Association.

1158
01:54:42,584 --> 01:54:46,386
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to speak tonight to once again as I did last night.

1159
01:54:48,134 --> 01:54:55,097
[SPEAKER_15]: give my full support to this proposed budget, the $79 million budget put forward by the school committee last night.

1160
01:54:55,677 --> 01:55:00,899
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to reiterate, again, what I said, this isn't, I don't consider this a radical budget.

1161
01:55:00,919 --> 01:55:03,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't consider this a terribly progressive budget.

1162
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:06,001
[SPEAKER_15]: What this budget does is it keeps us level.

1163
01:55:06,361 --> 01:55:08,982
[SPEAKER_15]: It keeps us where we are this year.

1164
01:55:11,183 --> 01:55:11,964
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to

1165
01:55:13,129 --> 01:55:15,891
[SPEAKER_15]: One against a few things that I can see on the horizon.

1166
01:55:16,231 --> 01:55:19,873
[SPEAKER_15]: If this budget isn't passed to get my comments public.

1167
01:55:20,853 --> 01:55:35,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Last year, my one of the first things I dealt with as the new president of the teachers Association was a sudden influx of kindergartners who joyful, obviously to get more students into the metropolitan schools but all of a sudden there was a great scramble because we didn't have enough teachers.

1168
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:42,565
[SPEAKER_15]: To cover it, there are teachers moving, there are teachers who had to find empty rooms and had to suddenly fill them.

1169
01:55:42,746 --> 01:55:47,968
[SPEAKER_15]: So the proposed cuts, especially at the elementary level, pose a risk because we don't know what the class is.

1170
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:55,312
[SPEAKER_15]: And as it was mentioned today, that Brooks is seeing an influx of students next year and it's, you know, the end of May.

1171
01:55:58,252 --> 01:56:05,835
[SPEAKER_15]: The last flux came at the end of August, so we don't know who's coming, but I have no reason to think it's a lower population than it was this year.

1172
01:56:07,956 --> 01:56:18,060
[SPEAKER_15]: The idea of when we lose students to charter schools and to private academies, we've got some hope here because we also have a waiting list for our vocational programs.

1173
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:23,403
[SPEAKER_15]: That vocation, those vocational programs are producing award winning machinists.

1174
01:56:25,104 --> 01:56:39,735
[SPEAKER_15]: We have students coming out of there who, you know, the last two times I saw men with public schools in the news now was a pair of young women who are getting into Harvard to two twin sisters who are going to Harvard, I had the pleasure of teaching and award winning robotics team.

1175
01:56:40,495 --> 01:56:43,837
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's what's gonna bring people into the medical schools.

1176
01:56:43,877 --> 01:56:51,422
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what's going to show that there's a very clear path in Medford to get into high institutions to show your abilities now.

1177
01:56:52,422 --> 01:57:02,048
[SPEAKER_15]: And like I said, we did that with the staff we have this year and this proposed budget simply seeks to keep those positions.

1178
01:57:03,929 --> 01:57:05,170
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all I have to say.

1179
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:05,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1180
01:57:06,926 --> 01:57:07,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr Ian.

1181
01:57:08,287 --> 01:57:11,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comments by members of the public on the Metro Public Schools budget.

1182
01:57:14,272 --> 01:57:14,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Chief of Staff.

1183
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:25,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr President and members of the City Council.

1184
01:57:25,561 --> 01:57:25,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

1185
01:57:31,035 --> 01:57:39,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there was a lot that was said here tonight, and I can appreciate the various views that have been stated in the various history and historical perspectives.

1186
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:43,916
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's important for me to represent and state.

1187
01:57:45,345 --> 01:57:50,311
[SPEAKER_09]: some elements that come from, you know, essentially the mayor's office as chief of staff.

1188
01:57:51,692 --> 01:57:58,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been involved in the city budget since 2022, or at least the development of the FY 2022 fiscal budget.

1189
01:57:59,901 --> 01:58:06,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you, and I think we can all kind of, let me start by saying that

1190
01:58:07,645 --> 01:58:20,016
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor's office, as has been stated by President Behrs, has been working very hard to try to find a way to carve funds out of the city side to provide additional funds to the schools.

1191
01:58:20,256 --> 01:58:22,518
[SPEAKER_09]: We are dedicated to doing that.

1192
01:58:22,618 --> 01:58:23,779
[SPEAKER_09]: We are working very hard.

1193
01:58:23,899 --> 01:58:27,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Our department heads have been very supportive in that process.

1194
01:58:27,902 --> 01:58:33,707
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor, myself, our finance director, and our budget manager have met at least weekly

1195
01:58:34,908 --> 01:58:47,095
[SPEAKER_09]: for throughout the budget process, but have been meeting and discussing in particular, additionally, since we heard the level of concern and numbers on the school side.

1196
01:58:48,956 --> 01:58:54,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, we anticipated a level of a budget cliff, and I'll get into that in a bit.

1197
01:58:54,258 --> 01:58:57,240
[SPEAKER_09]: We knew that there was obviously ESSER funds that were coming off.

1198
01:58:58,220 --> 01:59:04,043
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do need to take this council, if I could please, back a while back.

1199
01:59:04,103 --> 01:59:07,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes this isn't a popular subject to discuss or remind.

1200
01:59:09,105 --> 01:59:14,010
[SPEAKER_09]: remind the community of or otherwise because they were difficult budgetary times.

1201
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:27,722
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do feel it's important to take us back to when the pandemic began and some of the levels of uncertainty that existed back then and how that unfolded in our operational realities of the budget process.

1202
01:59:30,259 --> 01:59:36,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure no one will forget the difficulties and the uncertainty that existed in March of 2022.

1203
01:59:37,811 --> 01:59:40,275
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the time in which the city was formulating the 2021 budget.

1204
01:59:42,609 --> 01:59:47,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, in March of 2022, we believed things were going to shut down and things did shut down, right?

1205
01:59:48,011 --> 01:59:49,591
[SPEAKER_09]: We remember when 2020.

1206
01:59:50,832 --> 01:59:51,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, did I say 2022?

1207
01:59:51,892 --> 01:59:53,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1208
01:59:53,233 --> 01:59:53,513
[SPEAKER_09]: March of 2020.

1209
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:55,993
[SPEAKER_09]: We remember things shut down.

1210
01:59:56,193 --> 01:59:58,074
[SPEAKER_09]: We remember that hotels were closed.

1211
01:59:58,114 --> 01:59:59,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We remember restaurants were closed.

1212
01:59:59,735 --> 02:00:01,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything was closed for a period of time.

1213
02:00:01,675 --> 02:00:03,476
[SPEAKER_09]: We remember those impacts.

1214
02:00:04,156 --> 02:00:11,980
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, communities were making very, very conservative estimates in their revenue projections.

1215
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:12,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did no different.

1216
02:00:13,721 --> 02:00:24,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Our former finance director, Alicia Nunley Benjamin, made some very, very conservative financial projections, which has been very consistent with how our current finance director does that very same thing.

1217
02:00:24,746 --> 02:00:29,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Conservative at that time as the unpredictability of the pandemic had loomed.

1218
02:00:31,747 --> 02:00:40,954
[SPEAKER_09]: A year later, and that year, because of that uncertainty and a number of different factors that came in, the city had to use one-time funds.

1219
02:00:42,135 --> 02:00:44,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And those one-time funds ultimately became ARPA funds.

1220
02:00:45,097 --> 02:00:52,222
[SPEAKER_09]: The city used over, if I have my numbers correct, over $13 million in ARPA funds to balance the revenue side of the city budget.

1221
02:00:52,683 --> 02:00:53,984
[SPEAKER_02]: We used free cash the year before, too.

1222
02:00:55,114 --> 02:00:55,756
[SPEAKER_02]: The year before, too?

1223
02:00:55,796 --> 02:00:55,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1224
02:00:55,996 --> 02:00:56,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1225
02:00:56,538 --> 02:01:02,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I recall it, looking through financial reports, that number was $5 million, but it was a much lower magnitude.

1226
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:13,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And so then you fast forward to the following fiscal year, and we're still we're still very much in the middle of the pandemic, there hasn't been significant relief.

1227
02:01:13,126 --> 02:01:21,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you know, people are starting to travel, people are starting to go out, people are starting to spend money, people are starting to feel a little bit safer, but by and large, people are not feeling very safe.

1228
02:01:22,574 --> 02:01:27,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we had a situation where we were expecting conservatively budgeting, as always,

1229
02:01:28,299 --> 02:01:30,785
[SPEAKER_09]: we were expecting revenue shortfalls to continue.

1230
02:01:31,206 --> 02:01:35,839
[SPEAKER_09]: We utilized on the order of magnitude of $7 million to balance the revenue side of the budget.

1231
02:01:36,770 --> 02:01:51,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and since that time all throughout, we have been working very hard on the city side to in the mayor's office and working with all departments from city hall departments to other facilities to school department.

1232
02:01:51,565 --> 02:01:59,593
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been working very, very hard to try to tighten that belt to get to a place where we are, you know, obviously not utilizing one time funds.

1233
02:02:00,154 --> 02:02:06,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the first time in fiscal 24, we did not utilize one-time funds for the stabilization of the budget.

1234
02:02:07,098 --> 02:02:12,341
[SPEAKER_09]: We did use one-time funds to deal with a lot of backlogged capital work.

1235
02:02:12,361 --> 02:02:17,364
[SPEAKER_09]: We've used a lot of ARPA funds to do a lot of work that had been backlogged for decades, probably.

1236
02:02:20,286 --> 02:02:27,530
[SPEAKER_09]: We also used some small order of magnitude, obviously, for staffing positions when compared to those capital costs.

1237
02:02:28,986 --> 02:02:32,948
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really think it's important to tell the historical picture of how we got here.

1238
02:02:33,529 --> 02:02:47,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time in which the mayor was at the last budget hearing of the school committee meeting, yes, at the time, all she had known was a $500,000 budget gap in the FY24 budget.

1239
02:02:47,516 --> 02:02:48,777
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yes, she was surprised.

1240
02:02:49,617 --> 02:02:50,278
[SPEAKER_09]: But this isn't...

1241
02:02:51,098 --> 02:02:53,739
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't something that's just happening to Medford.

1242
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:56,221
[SPEAKER_09]: This is happening all across the Commonwealth.

1243
02:02:56,401 --> 02:03:01,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you ask your school, the city school administration team, you'll hear that same information.

1244
02:03:01,684 --> 02:03:04,645
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have data points to provide some of that information for you today.

1245
02:03:05,526 --> 02:03:15,031
[SPEAKER_09]: GBH published an article in May of this year, identifying that with the header being school districts across Massachusetts, way teacher staff cuts and staff cuts.

1246
02:03:15,771 --> 02:03:19,752
[SPEAKER_09]: They covered communities ranging from Boston to Pittsfield in that article.

1247
02:03:20,152 --> 02:03:21,693
[SPEAKER_09]: They talked about Andover.

1248
02:03:21,733 --> 02:03:22,893
[SPEAKER_09]: They talked about Braintree.

1249
02:03:23,333 --> 02:03:43,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also looked on the state's website for the Division of Local Services, that the Division of Local Services, as obviously the council knows, but members of the public may not know, is an entity that actually helps, essentially regulates the work of cities and towns as it relates to revenue and budgets.

1250
02:03:44,346 --> 02:03:53,915
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a sheet that shows that there are communities across the Commonwealth that are going through budget overrides, and I'll just touch on a few.

1251
02:03:53,975 --> 02:03:56,838
[SPEAKER_09]: This can be searched on their page, DLSgateway.com.

1252
02:03:57,539 --> 02:04:01,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Arlington, fiscal 2025, override, general operating.

1253
02:04:01,963 --> 02:04:02,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Athol.

1254
02:04:03,044 --> 02:04:04,644
[SPEAKER_09]: public safety overrides.

1255
02:04:04,804 --> 02:04:07,105
[SPEAKER_09]: These are proposed, not necessarily the wins or losses.

1256
02:04:07,225 --> 02:04:14,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Belmont, general government override with a note that says supplement cap budget and town school operating budgets.

1257
02:04:14,766 --> 02:04:17,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Oxford, two overrides for schools.

1258
02:04:17,647 --> 02:04:21,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Brewster, two overrides for schools in FY24.

1259
02:04:21,487 --> 02:04:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Brookline, 24, two-way question operating override.

1260
02:04:25,748 --> 02:04:30,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that stands for, but we know Brookline a little bit from some of the work we've been looking at.

1261
02:04:32,634 --> 02:04:33,816
[SPEAKER_09]: There are many other communities.

1262
02:04:33,956 --> 02:04:35,999
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see, I'm naming them in alphabetical order.

1263
02:04:36,019 --> 02:04:37,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That was how many through the Bs, five?

1264
02:04:37,941 --> 02:04:38,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize?

1265
02:04:38,502 --> 02:04:39,824
[SPEAKER_02]: We got through the Bs and that was five?

1266
02:04:39,864 --> 02:04:40,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

1267
02:04:41,286 --> 02:04:42,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Braintree's another one.

1268
02:04:42,348 --> 02:04:43,169
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even get through the Bs.

1269
02:04:43,389 --> 02:04:43,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1270
02:04:43,950 --> 02:04:47,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and you know, I...

1271
02:04:50,359 --> 02:05:00,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know that this needs to be said, but I just can't help but dispute information that is just clearly and evidently wrong as to transparency.

1272
02:05:01,121 --> 02:05:06,322
[SPEAKER_09]: The council had asked for the mayor to provide certain information as it related to KP law bills.

1273
02:05:06,622 --> 02:05:09,543
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been back over this numerous times.

1274
02:05:10,183 --> 02:05:15,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Through you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. President, to Councilor Scarapelli,

1275
02:05:16,164 --> 02:05:23,035
[SPEAKER_09]: the you made statements relative to KP law bills and not having information and how you're adding it up to be $300,000.

1276
02:05:23,075 --> 02:05:28,965
[SPEAKER_09]: But 476, Mr. Chairman, I, I don't believe anyone else was interrupted.

1277
02:05:29,005 --> 02:05:30,267
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could just thank you.

1278
02:05:30,548 --> 02:05:30,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

1279
02:05:32,361 --> 02:05:36,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So those things, we transparently provided the information.

1280
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:42,363
[SPEAKER_09]: We provided a warrant from 2020 to April of 2023, identifying all KP law payments.

1281
02:05:42,743 --> 02:05:54,686
[SPEAKER_09]: We also provided information relative to a survey that we did of 16 of 16 communities and Medford ranked third lowest in terms of per capita spending for legal service costs.

1282
02:05:55,166 --> 02:05:58,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And we disclosed at that time that our estimated per year was $450,000.

1283
02:05:59,088 --> 02:06:08,174
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is no surprises here that is contained in, through you, Mr. President, to Councilor Scarapelli's email inbox.

1284
02:06:09,054 --> 02:06:11,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, I think it's important to touch on development.

1285
02:06:12,657 --> 02:06:17,900
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, frankly, this is an area of the organization I don't work very closely in because the mayor works very closely in.

1286
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:21,162
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor hired the city's first ever economic development director.

1287
02:06:21,542 --> 02:06:28,932
[SPEAKER_09]: We are working with our, with Sal, and of course I'm forgetting Sal's last name right now.

1288
02:06:29,052 --> 02:06:29,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1289
02:06:29,493 --> 02:06:31,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously he was with the council this evening.

1290
02:06:31,355 --> 02:06:32,917
[SPEAKER_09]: He was talking with the council this evening.

1291
02:06:32,977 --> 02:06:38,725
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding that he was going to announce grant application that was submitted on vacant storefronts.

1292
02:06:38,845 --> 02:06:39,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

1293
02:06:40,567 --> 02:06:41,388
[SPEAKER_09]: that's been going on.

1294
02:06:41,428 --> 02:06:51,996
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a press release that was issued by the mayor as to development and over 500 units that had been done, and there were issues as to prior 40 B projects again.

1295
02:06:52,036 --> 02:07:02,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't necessarily speak to those things, but I know that our planning, development and sustainability director Alicia Hunt is here this evening for her budget presentation and may be able to touch on some of those things if there are questions.

1296
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:09,648
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think I just felt the need that I had to address a number of issues that were stated here tonight as to the perspectives from the mayor's office.

1297
02:07:09,688 --> 02:07:09,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1298
02:07:10,248 --> 02:07:11,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1299
02:07:11,389 --> 02:07:15,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Scarpelli, I was going to recognize you already as you had a point directed through me.

1300
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:15,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Scarpelli.

1301
02:07:16,131 --> 02:07:17,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1302
02:07:18,592 --> 02:07:21,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to see that our Chief of Staff has

1303
02:07:22,947 --> 02:07:23,768
[SPEAKER_05]: like commender.

1304
02:07:23,828 --> 02:07:33,274
[SPEAKER_05]: She's coming here as she usually does and stands up and defends the mayor because that seems like that's been common practice with our chief of staff.

1305
02:07:33,975 --> 02:07:44,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you the numbers that I shared a numbers that were given to us by her office and

1306
02:07:45,754 --> 02:07:50,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe there was a comment a few weeks ago that the law line item was $50,000.

1307
02:07:51,335 --> 02:07:52,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't true.

1308
02:07:53,656 --> 02:08:08,540
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do the actuals and you count it up at the time for that one year that we did have, which we expressed is a question because we're seeing the mismanagement of financial process here in the city.

1309
02:08:11,633 --> 02:08:18,799
[SPEAKER_05]: You can blame COVID again, but that's getting old because as Medford's fighting about COVID, I could talk about communities too.

1310
02:08:19,700 --> 02:08:23,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And I won't talk about, I won't give you numbers from Athol, Massachusetts.

1311
02:08:24,524 --> 02:08:26,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna talk about our neighboring communities.

1312
02:08:27,767 --> 02:08:29,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Malden, flourishing.

1313
02:08:29,548 --> 02:08:30,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Everett, flourishing.

1314
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:32,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Somerville, flourishing.

1315
02:08:33,232 --> 02:08:34,433
[SPEAKER_05]: New growth everywhere.

1316
02:08:36,034 --> 02:08:38,256
[SPEAKER_05]: We're touting a beer hall on Mystic Ave.

1317
02:08:42,426 --> 02:08:50,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we talk about transparency, there has been huge lack of transparency from that office.

1318
02:08:51,253 --> 02:08:58,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the fact that what I heard the other night, looking back at the meeting, that a city solicitor is not important.

1319
02:09:00,179 --> 02:09:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a disgrace.

1320
02:09:01,801 --> 02:09:04,663
[SPEAKER_05]: The city solicitor works for the community.

1321
02:09:08,939 --> 02:09:13,042
[SPEAKER_05]: He's that check and balance, that person's that checks and balance for the city, for this body.

1322
02:09:15,623 --> 02:09:37,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot to be said in what's going on, because when it's time, everything will come out when the mayor is here, because I think that that's one thing people are missing, is that when things are tough, I believe she said that to Councilor Carviello when he ran against her for mayor, saying that Mr. Carviello doesn't want to make tough decisions, he wants to say yes.

1323
02:09:39,377 --> 02:09:39,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1324
02:09:42,238 --> 02:09:44,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been tough for the last five years.

1325
02:09:45,178 --> 02:09:46,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And we haven't seen much happening.

1326
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:54,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can blame the pandemic, you can blame whatever you want to say, you can look at whatever numbers you want to look at.

1327
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But the truth is in what we live in every single day.

1328
02:09:58,961 --> 02:10:01,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You might not understand that because you don't live in metric.

1329
02:10:03,001 --> 02:10:04,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but no, no, no, no, no.

1330
02:10:04,322 --> 02:10:06,464
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a valid point.

1331
02:10:06,604 --> 02:10:14,451
[SPEAKER_05]: You're touting something that and not understanding what the community has expressed to us.

1332
02:10:14,531 --> 02:10:16,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't be a little bad, to me at least.

1333
02:10:16,894 --> 02:10:28,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the understanding that when the mayor gets here at budget evening, we'll go over it, we'll discuss it, we'll debate it.

1334
02:10:29,721 --> 02:10:44,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're here for, we're here, like we said, in a more mutual understanding process, is that we understand that there's a process that we might need a form of overrides or debt exclusions.

1335
02:10:47,048 --> 02:10:51,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think it's done in a transparent manner, I've mentioned it, I'll say it over again, and I'll stand by that.

1336
02:10:53,971 --> 02:10:54,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I sat with this mayor.

1337
02:10:58,908 --> 02:11:09,272
[SPEAKER_05]: and what she worked with sitting next to me for years isn't the person that's trying to run the city right now.

1338
02:11:10,892 --> 02:11:11,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1339
02:11:11,673 --> 02:11:12,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

1340
02:11:12,693 --> 02:11:18,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take the spirit of compromise and just say a little bit about what I disagree with both of you about.

1341
02:11:19,716 --> 02:11:28,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And first thing I want to say here is I appreciate, but there are many staff in the city who do not live here

1342
02:11:29,195 --> 02:11:34,276
[SPEAKER_02]: the chief of staff was with us for four hours at fire stations on Saturday, came here.

1343
02:11:34,296 --> 02:11:43,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't question her devotion to serving the city, even though I may disagree sometimes.

1344
02:11:43,838 --> 02:11:44,719
[SPEAKER_02]: We have disagreements.

1345
02:11:44,739 --> 02:11:45,499
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have disagreements.

1346
02:11:47,459 --> 02:11:52,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go first with just some additional context on the budget.

1347
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:53,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you adding that.

1348
02:11:55,034 --> 02:12:06,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Chief of Staff, I just want to also add when you mentioned the $7 million FY23 gap of the one-time funds we used that year, that was a major driver of Councillor Collins's and my proposal for the override at that time.

1349
02:12:06,746 --> 02:12:16,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I do respect that we were able to not use one-time funds in future years, but also there were things cut between the initial FY23 proposal and then the final budget.

1350
02:12:17,162 --> 02:12:35,592
[SPEAKER_02]: That was presented to us because of that use of one time fund so that means that there were things that the city was doing and probably the schools, maybe as well, depending on the process a little different that we weren't able to do, because we were trying to reduce that reduction on one time fund so that's really where I think many of us are coming from on the structural underfunding.

1351
02:12:36,252 --> 02:12:50,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other piece is I really appreciated you starting to list the overrides that all these communities are doing across the state because we do have a common financial fiscal issue across the Commonwealth and across the country with the ARPA expiration.

1352
02:12:51,567 --> 02:12:54,528
[SPEAKER_02]: We did use some one-time funds for FY 24 on the school side with ESSER.

1353
02:12:54,748 --> 02:13:05,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we are all aware of that, but that, you know, it wasn't a structural gap in the general fund, but it was a structural gap in a sense that we, you know, I remember June 21st, Councilor Scarpa was talking about the 20th.

1354
02:13:06,012 --> 02:13:12,714
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 21st, I had an event and I said, we need to work together to keep as many of the ARPA and ESSER positions as we can on the budget.

1355
02:13:13,254 --> 02:13:14,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor was present there as well.

1356
02:13:14,415 --> 02:13:15,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And work has been done.

1357
02:13:16,095 --> 02:13:18,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I am impressed, especially on the ARPA side,

1358
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:20,177
[SPEAKER_02]: how much we're able to keep on.

1359
02:13:20,297 --> 02:13:21,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do want to acknowledge that.

1360
02:13:22,157 --> 02:13:30,901
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the other piece of it, and it's not really a disagreement with anyone here, I think the other piece of this part of the fiscal issue that we are all seeing in commonality is cost growth.

1361
02:13:32,301 --> 02:13:38,884
[SPEAKER_02]: We are seeing huge over the last two years, a huge increase in costs that is devaluing the amount of revenue we have.

1362
02:13:38,924 --> 02:13:40,385
[SPEAKER_02]: When Councillor Lemming talks about

1363
02:13:41,499 --> 02:13:45,922
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the last 45 years, because two and a half hasn't kept up with inflation, we have less money.

1364
02:13:46,362 --> 02:13:49,384
[SPEAKER_02]: That has accelerated over the last two years significantly.

1365
02:13:50,124 --> 02:13:52,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilman was using a CPI price deflator.

1366
02:13:52,485 --> 02:13:58,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't actually reflect government purchasing their price deflators for government because government purchases very specific things.

1367
02:13:58,789 --> 02:14:05,793
[SPEAKER_02]: not the things that a person, you know, we're not buying a lot of bread every day, necessarily, as a percentage of our budget or food.

1368
02:14:06,174 --> 02:14:13,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We're buying concrete, we're buying health care, we're buying, you know, pensions, and we're paying salaries, right?

1369
02:14:13,638 --> 02:14:15,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And those things have been going up really significantly.

1370
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just the other piece of context that I really think is important to add

1371
02:14:19,922 --> 02:14:32,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about the fiscal picture of all these communities, and especially the reason why the override and the need for additional immediate revenue is so much more dire today than it was even two years ago, is that the costs are just out of control.

1372
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:38,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And when costs are going up like that, government, we can't keep doing more with less.

1373
02:14:38,193 --> 02:14:38,953
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're seeing.

1374
02:14:39,013 --> 02:14:43,256
[SPEAKER_02]: If we want to, quote unquote, keep it tight in the belt more,

1375
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:48,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're not talking about, I believe Sherry said, working around the edges.

1376
02:14:48,082 --> 02:14:51,704
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about core programs of the city and schools.

1377
02:14:52,564 --> 02:14:53,144
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we're at.

1378
02:14:54,005 --> 02:14:57,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Now where I just want to point to Councilor Scarbelli, we bring up Malden a lot.

1379
02:14:58,607 --> 02:15:02,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden gets $65 million a year in net revenue from the Commonwealth.

1380
02:15:03,169 --> 02:15:07,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Their Chapter 70 allocation is tens of million dollars more than us.

1381
02:15:07,331 --> 02:15:08,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They get $65 million, we get $20.

1382
02:15:10,362 --> 02:15:14,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Their new growth the last four fiscal years has been almost a million dollars less than the city of Medford.

1383
02:15:16,607 --> 02:15:18,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a comparable community.

1384
02:15:18,628 --> 02:15:23,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden is treated very differently by the state and isn't growing as much as we are on the new growth numbers.

1385
02:15:23,449 --> 02:15:28,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just wanna bring those facts to the table, that context to the table.

1386
02:15:28,651 --> 02:15:45,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, say that I really understand the frustration everyone has with the uncertainty, understand the frustration of the public, of our educators, of fellow members of this council, of members of the school committee who are not part of the financial task force, where we have not said this is our plan yet.

1387
02:15:46,516 --> 02:15:48,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have not presented a plan and had that debate yet.

1388
02:15:50,097 --> 02:15:51,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It is coming very soon.

1389
02:15:51,238 --> 02:15:52,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We are at the zero hour.

1390
02:15:53,038 --> 02:15:54,259
[SPEAKER_02]: We are at the decision point.

1391
02:15:54,839 --> 02:16:12,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that we will present something that we can all see the details of, have those details discussed and debated, and then bring this community together to vote for in the fall to say that we're gonna address these serious financial challenges that we face.

1392
02:16:14,035 --> 02:16:15,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate the perspectives of everyone.

1393
02:16:15,937 --> 02:16:18,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've had a healthy discussion generally.

1394
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:23,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, Mr. President, I just have one new piece of information.

1395
02:16:23,626 --> 02:16:33,276
[SPEAKER_09]: The only one piece of information that I meant to include in my statements is just it kind of dovetails from some of the things you you just said, and some of the things Councilor Lemming stated in terms of

1396
02:16:33,997 --> 02:16:35,017
[SPEAKER_09]: costs outpacing.

1397
02:16:36,819 --> 02:16:46,848
[SPEAKER_09]: When we have a 10% increase in health insurance, which is $3 million, that is 1.5% of our budget increased right there off the top.

1398
02:16:48,405 --> 02:16:54,130
[SPEAKER_09]: That dramatically affects our position as it comes within the constraints of Proposition 2.5.

1399
02:16:54,351 --> 02:16:56,513
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's just no two ways about that.

1400
02:16:57,313 --> 02:17:09,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the only other thing I should probably say and address is that we've been working very diligently, the mayor, the finance team, have been working very diligently to come off these funds because we are trying to

1401
02:17:10,205 --> 02:17:13,848
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to, and the mayor is against the use of one-time funds.

1402
02:17:13,908 --> 02:17:15,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to say that transparently to this body.

1403
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:19,113
[SPEAKER_09]: If you haven't heard it, the mayor is against the use of one-time funds.

1404
02:17:20,634 --> 02:17:37,149
[SPEAKER_09]: The analogy she uses to express that is if your, let's say 16, 17-year-old teenager came to you tomorrow and they said that they got $500 worth of gifts for their birthday and that they wanted to lease a car, would you let them lease a car from that?

1405
02:17:38,427 --> 02:17:39,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll leave you all with that.

1406
02:17:40,088 --> 02:17:41,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I do appreciate the discussion.

1407
02:17:41,349 --> 02:17:43,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the time that was afforded to me to speak.

1408
02:17:43,770 --> 02:17:44,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1409
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:44,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1410
02:17:45,511 --> 02:17:47,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions or comments from members of the public?

1411
02:17:48,252 --> 02:17:53,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none in the chamber, I do see one hand on Zoom, Jess H. Jess, name and address for the record, please.

1412
02:17:53,575 --> 02:17:54,355
[SPEAKER_02]: You have three minutes.

1413
02:17:57,217 --> 02:17:58,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessica Healy, Four Lock Road.

1414
02:17:58,997 --> 02:18:01,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a question.

1415
02:18:02,312 --> 02:18:05,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I keep I always hear from the chief of staff.

1416
02:18:05,314 --> 02:18:14,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe she is but not the mayor and not to you know downheart all but We did not vote in the chief of staff.

1417
02:18:14,261 --> 02:18:17,723
[SPEAKER_07]: We voted in the mayor Is there going to be a time that?

1418
02:18:18,384 --> 02:18:26,189
[SPEAKER_07]: We're able to ask her questions regarding everything that's going on There will be a time when if

1419
02:18:27,944 --> 02:18:30,065
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you will not be able to ask her questions directly.

1420
02:18:30,145 --> 02:18:31,125
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make comments.

1421
02:18:32,546 --> 02:18:36,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, the mayor presents the budget at the budget meeting when the comprehensive budget proposal is submitted.

1422
02:18:37,868 --> 02:18:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1423
02:18:38,668 --> 02:18:42,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And now what happens if everyone's talking about the override?

1424
02:18:43,450 --> 02:18:45,131
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens if it doesn't go through?

1425
02:18:45,331 --> 02:18:46,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Have we thought of that?

1426
02:18:47,232 --> 02:18:50,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there would be drastic cuts that would be devastating to our community.

1427
02:18:51,733 --> 02:18:55,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm understanding but have we figured out if it does not go through?

1428
02:18:59,552 --> 02:19:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We would not have the funds to fund our schools.

1429
02:19:04,796 --> 02:19:07,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we used to have the funds, but we don't anymore.

1430
02:19:11,621 --> 02:19:18,807
[SPEAKER_02]: We've discussed extensively how Proposition 2.5 and cost growth has reduced what those funds can buy.

1431
02:19:20,688 --> 02:19:24,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the 2.5 override will go directly to our schools?

1432
02:19:26,232 --> 02:19:30,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's the mayor and the financial task force have announced a proposal to do so.

1433
02:19:30,916 --> 02:19:33,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and we plan to put out the details as soon as possible.

1434
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:35,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1435
02:19:36,582 --> 02:19:36,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1436
02:19:38,363 --> 02:19:40,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comments from members of the public in the chamber?

1437
02:19:40,545 --> 02:19:42,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, I will go to Charlene Douglas.

1438
02:19:42,927 --> 02:19:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

1439
02:19:45,965 --> 02:19:48,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford, Mass.

1440
02:19:49,407 --> 02:19:54,971
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to state something that occurred at last night's school committee meeting.

1441
02:19:56,012 --> 02:20:09,101
[SPEAKER_10]: The student reps on the school council wrote a proposal about the use of the free cash money to alleviate the deficit to the school budget.

1442
02:20:09,521 --> 02:20:13,724
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ask you to look at that and support that as a council.

1443
02:20:14,384 --> 02:20:23,810
[SPEAKER_10]: That being said, I also understand and hear both sides to this argument about overrides and what should we do as a city of Bethlehem.

1444
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:30,613
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a resident of this city and, you know, a taxpayer, I truly understand about the taxes and everything.

1445
02:20:30,934 --> 02:20:35,776
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I must say this, if we do not do this properly, there is

1446
02:20:37,265 --> 02:20:38,825
[SPEAKER_10]: no way that this will pass.

1447
02:20:39,506 --> 02:20:51,909
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we need to truly have an override, we need to make sure that there is a proper information out to the public and that must be done and that is extremely important.

1448
02:20:52,629 --> 02:21:06,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last thing I wanna say in relationship to the opera funds, when we use those funds to support the schools such as newcomers, teachers and things like that, things we knew,

1449
02:21:07,247 --> 02:21:16,175
[SPEAKER_10]: the union stated, we knew that we would need there was no way we can have a newcomer teacher and some of the other programs that were funded by opera funds.

1450
02:21:16,736 --> 02:21:21,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So that to me was poor judgment and poor use of opera funds.

1451
02:21:21,981 --> 02:21:24,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to state that, because I think that's very important.

1452
02:21:25,564 --> 02:21:25,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1453
02:21:27,261 --> 02:21:27,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

1454
02:21:27,641 --> 02:21:28,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Douglas.

1455
02:21:29,423 --> 02:21:46,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say that it is my highest priority as council president that any proposal for an override or a debt exclusion has all the information needed and that there is the, obviously there is the public process to propose one, there is the public vote, but that is the work that we are doing and I intend to continue doing.

1456
02:21:48,358 --> 02:21:50,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll leave it at that.

1457
02:21:52,341 --> 02:21:56,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion on the Medford Public Schools budget by members of the council or members of the public?

1458
02:21:59,130 --> 02:22:03,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, Planning Development Sustainability, Director Alicia Hunt.

1459
02:22:05,725 --> 02:22:15,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've been watching our previous six meetings, and thank you, Madam Superintendent, Mr. McHugh, once again, and all the residents watching, we are working on this.

1460
02:22:16,712 --> 02:22:34,983
[SPEAKER_02]: We have basically our processes that I'm going to read the top lines for the overall budgeted amount and the headcount, and then read through the change sheet, and then we would love for you to share, fill in any gaps, share your budget narrative, and also we would love to hear about

1461
02:22:35,763 --> 02:22:40,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Items you did not request are not included in this year's budget request that you plan or would like to see in the future.

1462
02:22:40,888 --> 02:22:46,954
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand it's a difficult budget year, but we do want to hear about what we are not doing right now that we would like to be doing.

1463
02:22:47,114 --> 02:22:50,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I will go through quickly.

1464
02:22:50,197 --> 02:22:53,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Planning and Development Sustainability Fiscal 24 Budget $779,084.

1465
02:22:59,414 --> 02:23:03,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 25, $812,897.91 for an increase of $33,813.91.

1466
02:23:04,197 --> 02:23:09,720
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a change in head count from eight to 11.

1467
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:17,864
[SPEAKER_02]: That is two part-time interns and that part of the full-time climate planner is moving from a grant to the general fund.

1468
02:23:18,505 --> 02:23:28,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically all of that is fixed cost increase with the COLA for non-union positions, moving over that climate planner position and some increase for

1469
02:23:28,916 --> 02:23:31,101
[SPEAKER_02]: maintenance and dues and subscriptions.

1470
02:23:31,523 --> 02:23:36,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'll turn it over to you, Director Hunt, for the Planning Development and Sustainability Budget.

1471
02:23:37,551 --> 02:23:38,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

1472
02:23:38,952 --> 02:23:39,553
[SPEAKER_01]: It is late.

1473
02:23:40,874 --> 02:23:50,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not really prepare remarks for this evening because I have been working extensively with the council on a lot of different initiatives, and I did realize that it was going to be late at this point.

1474
02:23:52,024 --> 02:23:57,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's most useful for me to just briefly address headcount.

1475
02:24:00,291 --> 02:24:02,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the changes a little bit.

1476
02:24:02,652 --> 02:24:04,993
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're very much correct.

1477
02:24:05,273 --> 02:24:09,554
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of positions of full time increases by one.

1478
02:24:09,674 --> 02:24:14,836
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the climate planner, which is frankly what I said at this meeting last year I was coming back for.

1479
02:24:15,736 --> 02:24:18,117
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got the grant that has been funding it this year.

1480
02:24:18,837 --> 02:24:23,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually have obtained a grant that will fund her position for two more years for

1481
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:25,080
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% of her position.

1482
02:24:25,741 --> 02:24:36,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we are looking at doing this coming year is actually just, and I'll be very specific, putting 31% of her salary on the general fund.

1483
02:24:37,571 --> 02:24:42,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the funding will be from ARPA for the first half of the year.

1484
02:24:43,076 --> 02:24:47,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other percentage, I'm not doing math at this hour, I apologize.

1485
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:50,843
[SPEAKER_01]: The other percentage is coming from a mass clean energy center

1486
02:24:51,503 --> 02:25:16,287
[SPEAKER_01]: grant that will pay her to do outreach among the Medford community, run the Electrify Medford program, which we have just started running, which is to help Medford residents electrify their homes, offer coaching and advice through us training and paying some coaches as well as volunteer coaches around solar, heat pumps, electric vehicles,

1487
02:25:16,907 --> 02:25:23,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some funding in there for some consultants to back up all of our consultants or all of our coaches.

1488
02:25:24,232 --> 02:25:27,775
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this will pay for Brenda to manage that program.

1489
02:25:28,235 --> 02:25:32,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the money that's in the general fund in ARPA is for her to do all the other energy things.

1490
02:25:33,139 --> 02:25:43,586
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this is backfilling work that I have been doing myself since I became the director of planning, but has been traditionally done energy efficiency work, solar,

1491
02:25:43,986 --> 02:25:45,927
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of working on our climate plan.

1492
02:25:47,828 --> 02:25:57,154
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason the number looks a little big is that we had been carrying the number two for interns, which is just seems to me to be arbitrary.

1493
02:25:57,194 --> 02:26:02,737
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been for the last several years running with four interns in our office at any given time.

1494
02:26:03,578 --> 02:26:06,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do fund it through various ways.

1495
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:09,081
[SPEAKER_01]: The increase in salary

1496
02:26:09,648 --> 02:26:18,554
[SPEAKER_01]: for part time employees is in fact going from 20 to $30,000 is to reflect the intern budgets and to help pay for them.

1497
02:26:18,574 --> 02:26:22,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also hoping to pay for them off of other places.

1498
02:26:22,396 --> 02:26:25,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we get grants to fund them, some CDBG, etc.

1499
02:26:26,439 --> 02:26:33,684
[SPEAKER_01]: The actuals for this year in part time is pretty high, and that, I just wanted to be clear, is not what we've been paying interns.

1500
02:26:34,505 --> 02:26:41,730
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're aware that our economic development director and our economic development planner both left early in the year.

1501
02:26:42,150 --> 02:26:50,118
[SPEAKER_01]: But they both actually agreed to stay on part-time and help and work with our office to support us while we searched to fill those positions.

1502
02:26:50,158 --> 02:26:51,720
[SPEAKER_01]: They were extremely hard to fill.

1503
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:56,124
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thrilled with Sal DiStefano, who's our new economic development director.

1504
02:26:56,164 --> 02:26:57,265
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a new planner.

1505
02:26:58,146 --> 02:27:05,654
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did pay Vic and Yvette part-time during the year, and their money was basically moved into that line.

1506
02:27:06,034 --> 02:27:10,178
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why our permanent employees was so low and part-time was so high.

1507
02:27:10,758 --> 02:27:19,245
[SPEAKER_01]: It's artificially high, but we were also using money from vacant positions to pay for interns.

1508
02:27:20,066 --> 02:27:21,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt very confident.

1509
02:27:21,347 --> 02:27:26,311
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going into this calendar year with a full slate of staff, there are no vacancies.

1510
02:27:26,371 --> 02:27:35,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I really would like to see some money in the part-time intern budget because I can't dip into my full-time salary budget just to cover those interns this year.

1511
02:27:37,163 --> 02:27:47,109
[SPEAKER_01]: The other changes are mostly structural around shifting things around so that we're paying for them where they should actually be paid out of.

1512
02:27:47,570 --> 02:28:00,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And my goal is actually when we all see the actuals for this year, we'll see that some of my line items were overspent and others were underspent, and that is because we needed to pay them out of the right places.

1513
02:28:01,059 --> 02:28:05,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Repairs and maintenance machinery, my office has been actually paying for and managing

1514
02:28:06,423 --> 02:28:06,703
[SPEAKER_01]: solar panels.

1515
02:28:06,723 --> 02:28:14,308
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing wind turbine annual maintenance for 14 years now, and this year we have started with solar.

1516
02:28:14,408 --> 02:28:21,972
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three solar race to that are owned by the city, and we're hoping our plan is to install another one this coming year.

1517
02:28:22,553 --> 02:28:25,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have added a solar panel maintenance contract as well.

1518
02:28:26,335 --> 02:28:29,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is to reflect the costs of the wind

1519
02:28:35,578 --> 02:28:38,200
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, I think.

1520
02:28:39,673 --> 02:28:42,274
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the main shift from last year, right?

1521
02:28:42,314 --> 02:28:54,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I shifted some money into dues and subscriptions to more accurately reflect things like we belong to the Mystic River Watershed Association Stormwater Outreach, and that's a dues that the city pays for outreach.

1522
02:28:54,838 --> 02:28:56,398
[SPEAKER_01]: We belong to power options.

1523
02:28:56,838 --> 02:29:08,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are various membership organizations around economic development and community development and planning that we as a city belong to, and we pay for out of that line.

1524
02:29:09,142 --> 02:29:12,263
[SPEAKER_01]: move the money there to more accurately reflect.

1525
02:29:12,723 --> 02:29:28,527
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we have actually been paying for many of those just out of professional technical services, we lowered the professional technical services to reflect that we were shifting the money to where it was actually being spent out of, rather than me saying, oh, I need new money for this.

1526
02:29:29,207 --> 02:29:32,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because the budget cuts were so difficult this year,

1527
02:29:33,012 --> 02:29:36,716
[SPEAKER_01]: that is the line that made the most sense for us to cut a little.

1528
02:29:37,176 --> 02:29:38,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So you shifted 10 and cut 20?

1529
02:29:39,238 --> 02:29:43,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we shifted 10 and cut 20 from professional technical.

1530
02:29:44,463 --> 02:29:50,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the big picture way, that is the bucket that we pay for consultants out of and we

1531
02:29:52,691 --> 02:29:54,011
[SPEAKER_01]: pay for grant matches.

1532
02:29:54,351 --> 02:29:58,833
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have applied to a municipal vulnerability preparedness grant.

1533
02:29:59,953 --> 02:30:15,256
[SPEAKER_01]: This year I'm doing it jointly with DPW and it is a forestry vulnerability assessment but it is also to update the city's municipal vulnerability assessment because our vulnerability assessment was last done in 2019 with 2017 data.

1534
02:30:18,077 --> 02:30:27,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this would update that with current 2024 data and give us actually an interactive website on our climate vulnerabilities.

1535
02:30:27,679 --> 02:30:32,440
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to get that grant, I believe I should have written it down, but I think the match is like $30,000.

1536
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:38,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So rather than going to the mayor or this body for that, we would just have that money in my budget.

1537
02:30:39,441 --> 02:30:41,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have some funds there for

1538
02:30:42,382 --> 02:30:54,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Brownfield Consulting or Climate Consulting or grants that we would get where the matches are of a reasonably small number, that it's just easier to pay for it out of our budget.

1539
02:30:56,272 --> 02:30:58,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that generally covers it.

1540
02:30:58,494 --> 02:31:00,455
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted me to go into more detail, we can.

1541
02:31:00,695 --> 02:31:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything new you'd like to do that's not in here in future fiscal years?

1542
02:31:05,069 --> 02:31:12,580
[SPEAKER_01]: When I want to do new things, they're really big and really expensive and wouldn't be covered in a budget like this.

1543
02:31:12,860 --> 02:31:15,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be large capital expenditures.

1544
02:31:15,945 --> 02:31:21,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on the electrification, the partial electrification of the McGlynn and Andrews school.

1545
02:31:21,618 --> 02:31:23,720
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna be a multi-million dollar project.

1546
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:32,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Our parks projects are very large multi-million dollar projects that we have to go out and get grants for and other funds for.

1547
02:31:33,127 --> 02:31:35,108
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gonna be in this.

1548
02:31:35,709 --> 02:31:38,931
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do like to use this money for is sort of the starter.

1549
02:31:39,331 --> 02:31:41,413
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a certain level of design.

1550
02:31:41,513 --> 02:31:46,677
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had just applied to a green communities grant that we may not get because we don't have it

1551
02:31:47,208 --> 02:32:02,378
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced far enough in design in order for them to feel comfortable funding it, they may actually want us to pay for a $30,000 to $50,000 design step before they'll award us the $500,000 grant.

1552
02:32:02,718 --> 02:32:10,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another example of something that if we get turned down for that grant, it's probably going to be in our best interest for us to just touch my budget.

1553
02:32:11,184 --> 02:32:15,368
[SPEAKER_01]: go get that design work done, and then apply again to green communities.

1554
02:32:15,669 --> 02:32:20,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So seed money for grant funded projects would be a key priority additional.

1555
02:32:20,554 --> 02:32:21,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

1556
02:32:21,134 --> 02:32:22,356
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had more, you could get more grants.

1557
02:32:22,556 --> 02:32:23,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

1558
02:32:23,777 --> 02:32:30,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, a lot of it is, I feel like we have just become fully staffed in January.

1559
02:32:30,504 --> 02:32:35,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to run with this staff for the next several months to see how are we doing?

1560
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:37,972
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the workload sometimes?

1561
02:32:38,473 --> 02:32:46,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of years ago, when I came at this meeting, I said, I didn't want any more staff to the finance office had more staff because they were our bottleneck.

1562
02:32:46,491 --> 02:32:50,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Now things are moving through finance because they did get the extra position a year or two ago.

1563
02:32:51,255 --> 02:32:56,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to run with the staff, see how much work we can get done.

1564
02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:02,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the bottlenecks at that point are our staff or somewhere else in the operations.

1565
02:33:03,367 --> 02:33:04,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1566
02:33:04,087 --> 02:33:04,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob has left.

1567
02:33:04,708 --> 02:33:07,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna make my one comment, then I'll go to, does anyone want to have a question?

1568
02:33:10,632 --> 02:33:12,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then I'll just make my comment anyway.

1569
02:33:13,956 --> 02:33:17,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob's not here, but this is really a message for Bob.

1570
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can include it in the report.

1571
02:33:18,962 --> 02:33:21,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love how few line items are in your budget.

1572
02:33:24,258 --> 02:33:26,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're at like 12 or 13.

1573
02:33:27,121 --> 02:33:27,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

1574
02:33:28,342 --> 02:33:29,203
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes it easier.

1575
02:33:29,303 --> 02:33:36,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything has a name that I can kind of at least understand and I don't have to ask for an extra explanation.

1576
02:33:36,530 --> 02:33:40,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand some of that is gap and some of that is state determined and whatever, but.

1577
02:33:41,654 --> 02:33:55,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's a really clean budget where I understand what everything means and that doesn't mean that the information isn't there for every other department, but to me it is a model of naming conventions for ordinary expense line items.

1578
02:33:55,380 --> 02:33:59,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So as an extreme nerd, I will close there.

1579
02:34:01,223 --> 02:34:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions on the planning development sustainability budget for the director?

1580
02:34:11,147 --> 02:34:13,231
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll go through the boards.

1581
02:34:13,772 --> 02:34:15,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Rapid lightning speed.

1582
02:34:15,835 --> 02:34:16,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the boards.

1583
02:34:17,197 --> 02:34:18,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Board of Appeals.

1584
02:34:20,924 --> 02:34:22,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's looking like that's going up 1350.

1585
02:34:25,069 --> 02:34:30,431
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of the positions increases, the number of positions on the board.

1586
02:34:30,451 --> 02:34:33,972
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of positions for those stipends.

1587
02:34:34,372 --> 02:34:43,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going from 11,150 last year to 12,500 this year because we increased the size of the board of appeals to avoid any quorum issues, I believe was the main reason.

1588
02:34:44,075 --> 02:34:44,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1589
02:34:45,175 --> 02:34:47,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Community development board, no change.

1590
02:34:50,737 --> 02:34:53,958
[SPEAKER_02]: On board of appeals or community development board?

1591
02:35:06,136 --> 02:35:11,320
[SPEAKER_01]: There are all of the boards and commissions that my office is currently staffing.

1592
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:14,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just slowly making sure that I'm not missing anything.

1593
02:35:15,543 --> 02:35:16,964
[SPEAKER_01]: All the positions are residents.

1594
02:35:19,426 --> 02:35:19,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had

1595
02:35:21,192 --> 02:35:29,738
[SPEAKER_01]: The Energy and Environment Committee, one of our members moved out of Medford and asked if they could continue to participate with the board.

1596
02:35:30,338 --> 02:35:32,020
[SPEAKER_01]: They get no stipend.

1597
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:35,222
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make decisions on anything.

1598
02:35:35,642 --> 02:35:38,584
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mostly a volunteer, like organizing.

1599
02:35:38,884 --> 02:35:40,806
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't actually asked her to step down.

1600
02:35:41,266 --> 02:35:44,908
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of these that are funded boards are 100%.

1601
02:35:46,349 --> 02:35:48,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Decision-making boards are all Medford residents.

1602
02:35:48,731 --> 02:35:50,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do respect to that.

1603
02:35:50,092 --> 02:36:02,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the hard work people are doing, and I understand keeping them on right now, but I think as we move forward, I think it's important that we give the opportunities for Medford residents to take those positions, so I appreciate it.

1604
02:36:02,079 --> 02:36:04,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Energy and environment is an unlimited number of people, right?

1605
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:08,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy and environment and the bike commission both have an open number of membership.

1606
02:36:08,801 --> 02:36:10,621
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no rules.

1607
02:36:10,821 --> 02:36:16,383
[SPEAKER_01]: So we generally will add people in a group as we feel like we've lost a critical mass.

1608
02:36:16,403 --> 02:36:17,243
[SPEAKER_05]: They're advisory committees.

1609
02:36:17,603 --> 02:36:18,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1610
02:36:18,623 --> 02:36:19,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it all back then.

1611
02:36:19,444 --> 02:36:20,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

1612
02:36:20,164 --> 02:36:21,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's great.

1613
02:36:22,844 --> 02:36:24,925
[SPEAKER_02]: We will take someone else's free labor for our...

1614
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:31,767
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an expertise and you want to work, let's do it.

1615
02:36:31,967 --> 02:36:32,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1616
02:36:32,428 --> 02:36:32,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1617
02:36:32,889 --> 02:36:33,230
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1618
02:36:33,330 --> 02:36:37,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So if those questions are answered, I saw no change for Community Development Board.

1619
02:36:38,431 --> 02:36:41,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a small stipend reduction on the conservation commission.

1620
02:36:41,813 --> 02:36:52,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So my notes are that we can't figure out why the number was what it was last year we think that at some point there was a miscalculation and what either the rate was or the number of members.

1621
02:36:53,698 --> 02:36:58,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went through this several times because it's, this is accurate.

1622
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going from 8200 to 7500.

1623
02:37:00,581 --> 02:37:02,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, got it.

1624
02:37:03,482 --> 02:37:05,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Historic District Commission, it looks like

1625
02:37:06,061 --> 02:37:11,603
[SPEAKER_02]: A stipend is proposed and there's been a shift from special projects to the stipend and to professional fees?

1626
02:37:12,163 --> 02:37:20,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so all the boards that are staffed by city staff, some of them get stipends.

1627
02:37:22,086 --> 02:37:29,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one where the Historic District Commission said to me, we would really like to be asking more of the staff person who's helping us.

1628
02:37:29,808 --> 02:37:32,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to the pandemic, they and the Historic Commission

1629
02:37:33,149 --> 02:37:37,051
[SPEAKER_01]: and the bike commission actually had no city staff support at all.

1630
02:37:37,991 --> 02:37:43,133
[SPEAKER_01]: We manage their budgets now and we manage their zooms and we post their agendas.

1631
02:37:43,473 --> 02:37:48,736
[SPEAKER_01]: The historic district commission said they would like more robust support on more of the things that they're doing.

1632
02:37:49,416 --> 02:37:53,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, and they said, could we get a stipend to justify that?

1633
02:37:54,178 --> 02:37:59,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were willing to shift the money from within their other things they spend money on too.

1634
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:00,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Who in your office is going to take that on?

1635
02:38:01,132 --> 02:38:08,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had asked Jessica Martinez, the new economic development planner, if she would work with that.

1636
02:38:08,781 --> 02:38:13,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will just say for transparency that not all the boards and commissions have stipends with them.

1637
02:38:14,199 --> 02:38:17,021
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are several that people are staffing with no stipend.

1638
02:38:18,061 --> 02:38:24,364
[SPEAKER_01]: But in some the affordable housing trust comes to mind, it is part of the role of the housing planner to support that.

1639
02:38:24,484 --> 02:38:29,987
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have said since that job was created, that that part of that job is supporting that commission.

1640
02:38:30,007 --> 02:38:35,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, at the point that they have a lot of money, and it takes a lot of time, we may want to reconsider that.

1641
02:38:36,290 --> 02:38:37,171
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a startup,

1642
02:38:37,711 --> 02:38:43,195
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just thought it was fair to say, for example, the historic commission, there's no stipend associated with that.

1643
02:38:43,255 --> 02:38:44,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's significant.

1644
02:38:44,996 --> 02:38:45,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1645
02:38:45,657 --> 02:38:54,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that this council has discussed prior sessions, prior years, try to get some uniformity, some equity across all the boards and commissions.

1646
02:38:55,123 --> 02:38:58,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at all of them because it seems like it's just we make one and we set this.

1647
02:38:59,266 --> 02:39:01,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 20 years later, we make this and we set this.

1648
02:39:01,148 --> 02:39:07,332
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think when we're not triaging the budget, that is something this council is interested in if we have the time to get there.

1649
02:39:07,924 --> 02:39:17,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and the stipends across the board for the different boards and commissions, there doesn't seem to be, I don't understand where those numbers come from, and they are not, you know, they're on the city's webpage, you can see them all.

1650
02:39:18,109 --> 02:39:18,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1651
02:39:18,850 --> 02:39:33,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Historical commission, we have, it was FY 24, $38,050, FY 25, $35,000, it looks like just a reduction in professional fees and a reduction in the unclassified line item, which I believe was a grant match of some kind.

1652
02:39:33,362 --> 02:39:42,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So right, so their money is to pay a consultant to do the historic, the studies of different buildings that come in front of them to say whether or not they're actually historic.

1653
02:39:42,965 --> 02:39:44,845
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be preferably preserved.

1654
02:39:44,865 --> 02:39:47,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get to grants and their grant matches.

1655
02:39:48,486 --> 02:40:02,650
[SPEAKER_01]: When the mayor was asking people to please cut budgets to help with the budget, they said that they would figure this out and they would be okay with a $3,000 cut in the spirit of helping the city with its budget struggles.

1656
02:40:03,373 --> 02:40:03,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1657
02:40:04,274 --> 02:40:07,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bicycle Commission, $1,500 last year, $1,500 this year, no change.

1658
02:40:07,756 --> 02:40:08,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's for supplies and stuff.

1659
02:40:08,997 --> 02:40:09,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1660
02:40:10,458 --> 02:40:10,659
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1661
02:40:10,699 --> 02:40:17,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions on the Planning Development Sustainability Department or the boards and commissions which it helps to coordinate?

1662
02:40:20,066 --> 02:40:21,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, thank you, Director Hunt.

1663
02:40:22,887 --> 02:40:28,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions or motions in this committee of the whole meeting, which is our final budget preliminary meeting number seven.

1664
02:40:28,888 --> 02:40:30,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have led with that last one.

1665
02:40:31,769 --> 02:40:34,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Budget seven on the motion to adjourn.

1666
02:40:38,151 --> 02:40:43,452
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not, we have, we believe that on this timeline, the 31st was the deadline.

1667
02:40:43,472 --> 02:40:46,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe we've met that by getting us with this being the last meeting.

1668
02:40:46,593 --> 02:40:47,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing a nod, yes.

1669
02:40:49,153 --> 02:40:50,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should be our goal, which is great.

1670
02:40:52,096 --> 02:40:54,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last thing I'll say is Celtics 92, Pacers 88.

1671
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:59,346
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion to adjourn of Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1672
02:40:59,486 --> 02:41:00,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they got back pretty fast.

1673
02:41:01,709 --> 02:41:02,330
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1674
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:03,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

1675
02:41:03,351 --> 02:41:03,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.
