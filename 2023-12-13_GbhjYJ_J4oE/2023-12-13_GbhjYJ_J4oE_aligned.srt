Antoinette, the city says school committee members have not had a pay increase in 24 years, even though city council members have received increases in that time period.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,387
The proposal would raise pay for school committee members from $12,000 a year to more than $29,000 a year, a nearly 145% increase.

3
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:24,675
The committee chair, vice chair and secretary would also see similar pay increases.

4
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,516
There are seven people on that committee in total.

5
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:34,600
The Medford City Council says the last pay raise for the school committee was in 2000 when the $12,000 rate was set.

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,281
Council President Nicole Morrell proposed this plan.

7
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:45,065
She says historically women have filled the school committee seats and it's time to close what she calls a gender pay gap.

8
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:47,726
However, not everyone agrees with her.

9
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:55,107
When we undervalue work for a long time, changing the financials and the mindset around it becomes hard.

10
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,690
Simply reaching for equity of pay seems like an overreach.

11
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:04,176
I would make the motion that we bring the city council pay down so we don't have restrictions.

12
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:13,136
No last night was the first time the City Council took up this proposal and many parents and teachers were there to speak out against it.

13
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:19,463
If proposed from if approved, the Medford public school budget would pay for those wage increases.

14
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:24,649
The Medford Teachers Association issued a statement last week calling the proposal troubling.

15
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:32,578
It says schools are already strapped for cash and paying the committee from the school budget would make it even harder to hire Antoinette.
