[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Abbasi, I have one question for you.

150
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:38,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a little bit concerned where I think this council just approved

151
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:42,375
[SPEAKER_06]: This license, I think, I think it's been maybe less than a year.

152
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:48,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I see there's another one going in here and that gives me a little bit of a red flag for me.

153
00:08:49,360 --> 00:09:00,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see where we have a potential brewery going next door and I hate to see changes keep on happening in that neighborhood.

154
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,992
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened is the partnership and didn't work out.

155
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:11,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to take this on my own because this is something I've been doing for the last year.

156
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:16,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was running the place last year.

157
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing great business.

158
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:19,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get enough help.

159
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:22,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to do this for myself where I got to do it for other people.

160
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,172
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I say doing it just so I have a little bit of a flag when we keep seeing when something changes on this short of a period.

161
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:37,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions for the gentleman?

162
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, Chair awaits a motion.

163
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I do have a quick question.

164
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:54,940
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the proposed use that's warranting the council to review for special permit?

165
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,601
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my question.

166
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:05,142
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason I ask is because if you look at our zoning ordinance, it says if we get an application for certain uses,

167
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:18,179
[SPEAKER_04]: uses 12, 22, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 33, 34, and 49A, those matters should go to the community development board before the council takes a vote on them.

168
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:27,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of just compliance with the law, I was just wondering where we were on that, if this in fact was an application for one of those items.

169
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:38,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have an answer for the council?

170
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be more of a question for the building commissioner or the city solicitor than this gentleman.

171
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:54,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's just an applicant and the use is really not something that he'd be classifying his facility within a table of use chart.

172
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:59,147
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a determination that would be made by the building commissioner.

173
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:05,858
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Mr. President, I agree with constant I that's my.

174
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:15,062
[SPEAKER_14]: This didn't come in for the license of petition so I was a little confused with this also, not to say that.

175
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:20,647
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the petitioner, Mr Bazzi that I'm against it.

176
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:26,333
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that, like Council night said, I don't know if we should move forward with this until we get again.

177
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:33,360
[SPEAKER_14]: This is where having legal representation here, um, you know, for the council would help move this along.

178
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we're looking at

179
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:47,001
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to recommend that we table this to next week, date certain till we get the answer from either the building commissioner or the city solicitor, making sure that we're voting on

180
00:11:48,135 --> 00:12:01,002
[SPEAKER_14]: on something that we're apprised of, because like Councilor Knight says, I don't see a distinguished item that tells us why we need the special permit.

181
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:06,425
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would look to table for one week and just to get this answer.

182
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,787
[SPEAKER_14]: This could be just a simple question, simple answer.

183
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:14,030
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, to the petitioner, Mr. Abbasi, this isn't,

184
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:24,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Any affirmation of that, I don't wanna support this because if it's just straight what it is, I see it's in order.

185
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:32,349
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, I don't know what the underlying reason for it hasn't been defined yet to this body.

186
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,911
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would recommend that we table this for one week.

187
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:40,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Paziev, do you plan on selling used cars there?

188
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:43,015
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, yes, I will apply for that too.

189
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:47,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just be advised that you will need to get a license for that also.

190
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:54,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion, Councilor Scott Pele to table this for one week to get an opinion from the building department.

191
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,560
[SPEAKER_14]: City solicitor, please.

192
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And the solicitor.

193
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:57,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

194
00:12:58,642 --> 00:12:59,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

195
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:03,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

196
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:03,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

197
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I just want to be clear.

198
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:18,253
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're going to ask the question to the city solicitor, I think we better put it in appropriate terms.

199
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:34,704
[SPEAKER_04]: The question to the solicitor would be, does this application fall within the scope of section 94-81 subsection B of the Medford zoning ordinance?

200
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:45,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

201
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:52,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Scott Felder, seconded by Councilor Ntuk and amended by Councilor Ntuk.

202
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:53,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

203
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmative, motion passes.

204
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:22,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to revert back to regular business by- So if we can, Mr. President, just let the petitioner know, I know that before we rush off, I know he's still on, just that we're just asking for the question to be answered, and then we'll bring this up again next week.

205
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:24,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

206
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:25,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Abbasi, did you get that?

207
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:26,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

208
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir, see you next week.

209
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:29,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

210
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:30,983
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a good night.

211
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Counselor saying we've heard back to regular business second by Counselor is the clerk please call the roll.

212
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:40,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

213
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:40,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

214
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:40,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

215
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:40,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

216
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:41,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

217
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:42,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

218
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven affirmative and a negative motion.

219
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:58,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Passes.

220
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:00,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

221
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:12,217
[SPEAKER_06]: 22057, offered by Councilor Scott Kelly and Councilor Kerrio, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its condolences to the family of Brian Branson on his recent passing.

222
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:17,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian was the true definition of a Metro Mustang, and we have lost a true champion for the blue light.

223
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

224
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

225
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:27,182
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a sad, it's a sad day with the passing of Brian.

226
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:35,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Brian is what Medford Mustang pride and heart is all about.

227
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:40,336
[SPEAKER_14]: He fought a courageous battle with cancer, and anybody who

228
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:48,581
[SPEAKER_14]: who came across Brian in the middle of his darkest days, you would never know that he was battling this illness.

229
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:50,542
[SPEAKER_14]: He had a smile on his face.

230
00:15:51,283 --> 00:16:00,451
[SPEAKER_14]: He always, first person to volunteer, donate whenever, especially when it came to kids, he was always there.

231
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,155
[SPEAKER_14]: I still remember it was maybe 94 degrees.

232
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:05,696
[SPEAKER_14]: We were having a,

233
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:16,436
[SPEAKER_14]: a wiffle ball tournament in the name of Jimmy Maturana who passed recently for raising money for his scholarship fund.

234
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:23,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after that, they were going to play the first baseball game at the new Jimmy Maturana Field.

235
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:28,704
[SPEAKER_14]: And Brian plays in the tournament.

236
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:30,185
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 97 degrees.

237
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:44,650
[SPEAKER_14]: He goes through the whole celebration and then he ducks out and comes back wearing about 40 pounds of umpire equipment because he's now going to umpire for the kids so they can play the baseball game.

238
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,895
[SPEAKER_14]: In the middle of all this, he's battling this horrible disease.

239
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:53,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's exactly who Brian was.

240
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:58,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, when you talk to people tonight at his wake, when I talked to his family,

241
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:06,249
[SPEAKER_14]: He is what makes Medford a great community.

242
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,573
[SPEAKER_14]: He was there to help anybody who needed help.

243
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:16,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And he always did it with a smile on his face.

244
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:26,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And to his children, to his sisters, to his friends, we are going to miss his physical being

245
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:32,624
[SPEAKER_14]: in our community forever.

246
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:43,090
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will tell you for one person, Brian's memory will never be forgotten because he left that impression on everybody that crossed his path.

247
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:56,157
[SPEAKER_14]: So those who didn't know him, talk to me if you see me, we'll talk about a few stories and just a great man.

248
00:17:56,337 --> 00:18:00,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I think in the last couple of years, I've said this too often,

249
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:10,113
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're saying goodbye to another Mefford icon, someone who left a mark in this community and never asked for anything in return.

250
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:18,159
[SPEAKER_14]: So to his family, we send our condolences, our prayers, our memories.

251
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:22,962
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could dedicate this meeting, Mr. Clerk, in his honor, I would love to do that.

252
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,905
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for allowing me to speak.

253
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:27,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

254
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:29,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scapi.

255
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:30,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anyone else like to speak?

256
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:33,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to say a few words.

257
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:37,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Councilor Scott Pelley put it quite eloquently.

258
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:45,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian always had a smile on his face, no matter when you see him and everybody knew how he was suffering with that deadly disease.

259
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:53,648
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, not an old man, but a young man who taken too soon from us.

260
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:59,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, like Councilor Scott Pelley says, this is a man who bled to blue and white all the time.

261
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,554
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, his family, uh, you know, anything for the community.

262
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:05,095
[SPEAKER_06]: He was there.

263
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:10,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, uh, shame and another icon in our community passes.

264
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:17,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately we don't have people stepping up to fill the shoes of, of, of a Brian Branson.

265
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:28,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope people start stepping up and take the place of men like him that did things, that put the volunteers in this community that people like him did.

266
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:32,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, to his family, our condolences.

267
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:36,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else wanna speak?

268
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion by Councilor Scott Felly, seconded by Councilor Sang.

269
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Moment of silence, Mr. President.

270
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:45,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Moment of silence.

271
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:47,628
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could have a moment of silence.

272
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:03,145
[SPEAKER_05]: like please call the roll.

273
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:07,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President bears.

274
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:08,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

275
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Council calls.

276
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:12,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

277
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:14,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor night.

278
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:14,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

279
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:16,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kelly.

280
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:17,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

281
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:19,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor saying yes.

282
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,277
[SPEAKER_02]: President Morrell.

283
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:23,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kerrio.

284
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

285
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,480
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 affirmative.

286
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:28,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Another negative motion passes to two zero five nine offered by Councilor Collins.

287
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:43,952
[SPEAKER_06]: We have resolved that Memphis City Council expresses support the Senate bill one five seven nine and accompanying the house bill two four one eight and act to protect the civil rights and safety of all Massachusetts residents also known as Safe Communities Act.

288
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:49,055
[SPEAKER_02]: If I first, I'm sorry, I'm gonna do five eight zero five eight.

289
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm reading that.

290
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:58,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, I read it wrong.

291
00:20:58,497 --> 00:20:59,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

292
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:01,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

293
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:13,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Bez and Councilor Collins, being resolved at Memphis City Council that a community control over public surveillance ordinance be considered by Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee.

294
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Bez.

295
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:17,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

296
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:22,135
[SPEAKER_09]: The resolution is relatively self-explanatory, but just to

297
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:42,017
[SPEAKER_09]: to explain what a community control over public surveillance ordinance is, that ordinance would create a public process where if any part of the city wanted to implement surveillance technologies, that they would just have to be approved through a public process approved by this city council.

298
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:52,925
[SPEAKER_09]: So the motion is to consider such an ordinance in the public health and community safety subcommittee, and I defer to my co-sponsor, Councilor Collins.

299
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:01,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, and thank you, Vice President bears for introducing this resolution.

300
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:03,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Just want a second.

301
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:05,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

302
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:14,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, just a second everything that Vice President bears already said this resolution is to create a public process.

303
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:42,550
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so to create, you know, a routinized way to have a clear routine process for any agency that wishes to deploy a public surveillance technology to outline why they would like to use it, for what purpose, how this information will be collected and used to make sure that we have a very clear and structured process to bring the public into that deliberation and decision process when surveillance technologies are proposed for use in our community.

304
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:49,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a great transparency measure, and I'd like for it to be taken up by the Public Safety and Community Health Subcommittee.

305
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:50,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

306
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:51,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

307
00:22:52,574 --> 00:22:53,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Zang.

308
00:22:54,735 --> 00:23:01,478
[SPEAKER_08]: On this issue, particularly, I think it's important to realize the role that power imbalances play.

309
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:15,412
[SPEAKER_08]: in in surveillance and how it affects how you surveillance data, you know, I am a strong believer that whoever has power should should also get some oversight, and that applies to us as as city counselors as well.

310
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:25,562
[SPEAKER_08]: But in this case, I think, you know, those people with people who are using public surveillance have this access to power and I think it's fair for

311
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:32,386
[SPEAKER_08]: members of our community to ask for some transparency, to ask for some oversight as well.

312
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:34,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

313
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:35,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

314
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:42,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion by Vice President Beas, seconded by Councilor Collins.

315
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:44,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

316
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:51,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Refer to the Subcommittee on Public Health and Community Safety.

317
00:23:58,293 --> 00:23:58,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President bears.

318
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:00,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

319
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:02,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

320
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:02,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

321
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

322
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:03,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

323
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:05,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

324
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:05,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

325
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:05,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

326
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:06,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

327
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:08,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

328
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:08,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

329
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:08,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

330
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:08,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

331
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

332
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:35,437
[SPEAKER_06]: 2418, an act to protect civil rights and safety of all Massachusetts residents, also known as the Safe Communities Act.

333
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:48,464
[SPEAKER_06]: We are afraid to resolve that the city clerk forwarded a copy of this resolution to the legislative delegation, as well as chairs of the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security, Timothy and Gonzales.

334
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:49,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

335
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:52,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

336
00:24:52,913 --> 00:25:03,677
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a bill that I've heard about from many Medford residents, and I see it as being very in line with our community's values so I'm glad for the opportunity to request my fellow counselors support in endorsing it.

337
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:13,641
[SPEAKER_10]: For a little bit of background, this act would shore up basic civil rights protections for undocumented people throughout the state, and of course, by inclusion, our community as well.

338
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:25,059
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, currently, insecurity about immigration status and the specter of deportation keeps many people from seeking the help and support that they need from police, from medical providers, and in other settings.

339
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:32,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So this act would restrict the circumstances during which law enforcement is allowed to inquire about a person's immigration status.

340
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:43,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, essentially the act would make it so people less feel like they have to, uh, you know, avoid calling for help when they're in crisis because of what that call could result in in terms of an arrest or deportation.

341
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:57,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I see the measures of this act as being very aligned with our community's existing goals of making sure that our public safety and health resources can actually reach every and any person in Medford who needs it regardless of their background.

342
00:25:57,642 --> 00:26:01,665
[SPEAKER_10]: And I respectfully, uh, ask for my fellow counselors approval.

343
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:03,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

344
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:05,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, thank you, Mr President.

345
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:08,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, how's the constant to bring this forward?

346
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:17,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, um, I've seen how terrible this affects immigrant communities.

347
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:30,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that I've had the privilege of working with a lot of great families and great individuals that, um, just even recently with the elimination of the Dream Act and, um,

348
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:40,991
[SPEAKER_14]: these young men and women that came to this country when they were infants, and find themselves now without a home.

349
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:56,424
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not familiar with their parents' home country, and they're being told that they're not citizens of the country they were raised and grew up with and pay taxes in, and they find themselves left in limbo.

350
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:02,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything we can do to support that, I would champion that as well.

351
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:08,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate bringing this forward and I would move, second the resolution.

352
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:09,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

353
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang?

354
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:11,706
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

355
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:13,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

356
00:27:14,643 --> 00:27:16,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I also support this resolution.

357
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:18,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank my fellow councillor for bringing this forward.

358
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:36,571
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've, like Councillor Scarpelli, I've worked with and grew up with a lot of, you know, friends who are undocumented and I know how difficult it is for them to, you know, just live as normal human beings in our society.

359
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:41,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, especially as we've all, as I've kind of

360
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:52,388
[SPEAKER_08]: become more of a leader in the community, a lot of people ask me, can I use this resource without being told that I might be deported one day?

361
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I turn to the police?

362
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:55,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I turn to fire?

363
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:56,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I turn to a medical resource?

364
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I turn to a state resource?

365
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,710
[SPEAKER_08]: What can I apply for?

366
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And it becomes confusing.

367
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of this stuff affects all of us, right?

368
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:06,732
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're thinking about public health,

369
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:10,555
[SPEAKER_08]: We are all healthier if all of us have access to services.

370
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:15,700
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all safer if all of us feel comfortable reporting, you know, reporting incidents.

371
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think it's very important that we support this.

372
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:20,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

373
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:21,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Biss.

374
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Biss.

375
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:25,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

376
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:26,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be brief.

377
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:29,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to add that I think it's important to add our voice to this chorus.

378
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:32,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone familiar with the State House knows that it is

379
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:43,612
[SPEAKER_09]: joint rule 10 week, which means it's the last week, unless extensions are requested for bills to be reported out of their committees to be considered this session.

380
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:48,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And as everyone has said, all the reasons that this is incredibly important.

381
00:28:48,440 --> 00:29:02,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a really broad coalition of folks from, you know, progressive legislators and I believe all four of our legislative delegation to the police chiefs who would find this to be incredibly valuable as well.

382
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:05,950
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm glad we're taking this up.

383
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:08,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

384
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:11,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

385
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly have no problem supporting this measure this evening.

386
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:19,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to remind everybody that no piece of legislation comes out the way it goes in.

387
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:26,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look at what's going on at the State House, we'll see that there are thousands and thousands of bills that are filed every year.

388
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:32,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this council is going to be focused on our goals and priorities, I think our goals and priorities should be that that fall within our purview.

389
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:37,358
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this is a meritorious resolution that I will have no problem supporting this evening.

390
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:48,588
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want us to earn the side of caution and to move forward in a fashion where we're not taking up items that we are dealing with the deal with the state legislature when we elected a state legislature to do that for us.

391
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:52,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a very capable representation up on Beacon Hill.

392
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:59,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're going to be taking up state items and state bills every week, it's going to make for very long and unproductive sessions.

393
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly will support this this evening.

394
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:13,190
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'd hate to see this become a trend of every week that we're sitting here, voicing support for this piece of legislation and that piece of legislation that's outside of scope and purview of authority.

395
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the discussion.

396
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:26,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion by Council Collins, seconded by second.

397
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:34,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President bears.

398
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:35,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

399
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Collins.

400
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:38,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

401
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:39,078
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a night.

402
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:40,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

403
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

404
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

405
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:44,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor saying, Yes.

406
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:46,342
[SPEAKER_02]: President Morrell.

407
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:46,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

408
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:49,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

409
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I mean the primitive, none of the negative on passes to 2060 offered by Councilor

410
00:30:56,368 --> 00:31:05,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Paula Keefe, Linda Pittorino, and Patty Wright on their retirement from the Consumer Advisory Commission.

411
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:13,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Through their efforts, Memphis consumers have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years through the work of these people.

412
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:21,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that the administration provide the council with a plan on how this office will be kept open going forward.

413
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:23,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

414
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:29,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna thank the three women who've been there 30 plus years.

415
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:38,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Paul has been there maybe close to 40 for the hard work that they've done that have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars to consumers in our community.

416
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:48,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a little concerned that all three women decided to retire at the same time, which for me sends up a little bit of a red flag.

417
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:51,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And now the office is closed.

418
00:31:52,900 --> 00:32:00,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hope that the mayor work with the Attorney General's office to get that office open again as soon as possible.

419
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:10,328
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I wanna thank the woman for the years of service to our community, but I also wanna ask the mayor to please get that office open.

420
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:17,111
[SPEAKER_06]: They do great work for the consumers of Medfin and some of the surrounding communities.

421
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

422
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:20,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President.

423
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morocco.

424
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President, I want to thank you for putting this down.

425
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,301
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is a lesser known office.

426
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:31,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we've seen the budget, you know, it's funded at a pretty minimum level.

427
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,264
[SPEAKER_12]: But the work they do is very important.

428
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:42,168
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had residents that I've been able to send their way resident had a really big issue with the contractor, and they were able to get it resolved through this office.

429
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:49,111
[SPEAKER_12]: So I echo your thanks for the women staffing this office for so long and share your concern and

430
00:32:49,531 --> 00:33:02,697
[SPEAKER_12]: and push to make sure we get this office staff because the what is offered at the state level doesn't compare to what is offered at the city level and the speed at which they can turn things around and work with local folks for residents in need.

431
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:04,978
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thank you for bringing this forward.

432
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:06,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

433
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

434
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

435
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:16,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President and through you to Linda, Paula and Patty.

436
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:21,120
[SPEAKER_04]: who I've been fortunate enough to develop a great friendship with over the years.

437
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the work that you've done.

438
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:31,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a strong advocate for the Consumer Office since my election to the City Council, and I've always felt that they were the unsung heroes in City Hall.

439
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:38,508
[SPEAKER_04]: These individuals are trained by the Attorney General to handle consumer complaints and disputes.

440
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:43,351
[SPEAKER_04]: They do an excellent job in resolving matters of

441
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:53,322
[SPEAKER_04]: anything from scams to the cold cut machine, not being accurate at the supermarket and you overpaying, um, they've done an excellent job.

442
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:57,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, one thing I know about the three of these women is that they really loved what they did.

443
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:10,695
[SPEAKER_04]: They really loved their job so much so that, um, when the state grant was cut, um, the ladies worked out a job sharing schedule so that nobody would lose their job.

444
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:15,078
[SPEAKER_04]: They were truly a group of people that cared about each other and worked together as a family.

445
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:17,859
[SPEAKER_04]: This office was created in 1978.

446
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:27,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It was created as the benefit consumer commission and its first commissioner was the late great Michael Callahan, our governor's counselor.

447
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:30,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And Michael took great pride in this office.

448
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was one of his greatest accomplishments in his 50 years of government service.

449
00:34:34,828 --> 00:34:41,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you look at what's going on from a human resource standpoint in city hall,

450
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:50,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it, three individuals with 90 years of combined service don't just walk out the door on the same day because they're happy.

451
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:51,875
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?

452
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:59,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish them the best of luck in their retirement, but we need to get to the bottom of what's going on in Medford City Hall, because it's getting to be embarrassing.

453
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:06,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard this morning another employee was escorted off the premises and told that they need to submit to a psychological evaluation.

454
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:13,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told that these three individuals were told that they need to be replaced with younger and more energetic employees, which led

455
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:16,427
[SPEAKER_04]: to really a retirement in duress.

456
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:32,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So while I don't want to rain on the parade of the great work that these three individuals have done in the community, I also think that we as a council owe it to them to investigate as to what's going on and to why the three of them would have left on the same day so abruptly.

457
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:36,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.

458
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:42,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank them for their service and I congratulate them on their retirement, wish them the best and let them know that they always have a friend in me.

459
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:44,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

460
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:44,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

461
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:46,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

462
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:49,019
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

463
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we had three dedicated people in a very important office.

464
00:35:52,980 --> 00:36:07,602
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that when you talk about our senior citizens, the most vulnerable members of our community, they were the ones that really needed this office more than anyone, because they are the ones that were being manipulated.

465
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:10,323
[SPEAKER_14]: And having this office in place really put

466
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:16,727
[SPEAKER_14]: someone that they could reach out to at any time to make sure that they're protected.

467
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:21,217
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I, if I'm not mistaken, I believe the Attorney General has

468
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:30,677
[SPEAKER_14]: has acknowledged their office many times on the job well done because of their excellence.

469
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:38,283
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, it's gonna be sad losing them, but thanking them for everything they've done for our community.

470
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:50,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you can do something, when you walk out the door, knowing that you left a positive mark, I think that you should keep your head high and really applaud what you've done for this community.

471
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:55,994
[SPEAKER_14]: As one counselor, I applaud them and thank them for everything they've done.

472
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the discussion.

473
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, on the motion by Councilor Kerrio-Viello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

474
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:04,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

475
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:09,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Behrs.

476
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:10,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

477
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:13,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

478
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:14,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

479
00:37:15,177 --> 00:37:15,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

480
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:16,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

481
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:18,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

482
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:19,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

483
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:21,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Hussain.

484
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:21,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

485
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:22,787
[SPEAKER_02]: President Morrell.

486
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:23,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

487
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:26,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Kerrio.

488
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:27,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

489
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:27,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Negative.

490
00:37:27,422 --> 00:37:31,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes to 2061 offered by Councilor saying it comes to call him.

491
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:42,107
[SPEAKER_06]: We resolve that the Memphis City Council expresses support for House Bill 3559 and actual neck relative to public transit, transit electrification.

492
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:46,409
[SPEAKER_06]: We have further resolved that city clerk forward copy of this resolution for the method.

493
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:50,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say of delegation as well as House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka.

494
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:51,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor saying

495
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:52,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

496
00:37:52,832 --> 00:38:17,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to first note my colleagues' concerns about us introducing these resolutions in support of state legislation, but I wanted to say, just in full transparency, that on my end, I had a conversation with Representative Christine Barber about this, and she asked me to come to the council to ask for our support on this specific bill.

497
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:25,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a good bill because I think it would, or let me just lay it out very, very clearly.

498
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:33,978
[SPEAKER_08]: This bill would electrify MBTA and RTA, commuter rail service, and the bus fleet by the year 2035.

499
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Studies have shown that this bill would reduce the CO2 emissions by millions of pounds.

500
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:48,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And this bill would also create a standardized assessment system to measure air quality in our communities.

501
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:58,573
[SPEAKER_08]: This bill would benefit Medford because we have, we have bus service in the city, we have a commuter rail station that goes through West Medford.

502
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:07,622
[SPEAKER_08]: And air quality is all has always been an issue when it comes to transit when it comes to bus and commuter rail service.

503
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:19,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is, you know, this aligns with our communities values aligns with addressing our communities concerns and aligns with our communities already stated goals.

504
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:41,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, counselor saying for putting this forward and just want to echo all of that and also add that I think one of the reasons this is you know important and relevant to our community here in Medford is, as counselor saying mentioned this bill would require that electric bus fleet to be expedited for routes that go through environmental justice communities.

505
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:55,715
[SPEAKER_10]: including some of our neighbors in Somerville and Everett, and so adjacent communities close to those cities in Medford or those that share bus routes through those neighborhoods would also reap the benefits of this priority electrification for those transit routes.

506
00:39:55,775 --> 00:40:06,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So respectfully ask for our fellow councilors support for this bill, especially as Vice President Beers mentioned during this final week of pushing bills out of subcommittee.

507
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:07,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

508
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:08,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

509
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:09,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President?

510
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:16,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw actually I'll defer to President Morrell.

511
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:31,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you vice president bears Thank you, Mr. President, I just wanted to know, and add on to what Councillor Collins and Councillor saying said you know, this goes beyond the actual buses traveling and our fleets traveling because we have things like the fellows way bus garage where I've been talking with, you know,

512
00:40:32,335 --> 00:40:36,577
[SPEAKER_12]: one resident and many residents are impacted by the diesel exhaust that goes on there.

513
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,798
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are residents that are very close to the space.

514
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:44,760
[SPEAKER_12]: They're affected by the emissions that happen in that space frequently and go right into their homes.

515
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,121
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the councilors for bringing this forward, I fully support it.

516
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:51,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think this is something that impacts Medford in a number of ways.

517
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:54,223
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope it's something that the state actually advances on.

518
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

519
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:56,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

520
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:58,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Bizz.

521
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:00,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr President.

522
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:03,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and that's exactly what I was going to say.

523
00:41:03,268 --> 00:41:17,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to add, um, that while some of the efforts of by the council and our legislators were for a time effective at making sure that idling and bright lights and loud noises were not occurring late night.

524
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:20,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Over at the Felsway bus yard in Haines Square.

525
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,080
[SPEAKER_09]: That problem has recurred.

526
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:27,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been working with the city clerk to contact representatives at the MBTA

527
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:41,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also know that Representative Paul Donato and Mayor Lugo-Kern have also been trying to work with the MBTA to make it so that we don't have 75 diesel buses idling at 11pm with bright floodlights.

528
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:48,064
[SPEAKER_09]: It's creating pretty serious impacts on the surrounding community in Haines Square.

529
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:53,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully, obviously this would address it in the long term, also hoping that we can address it in the short term.

530
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:54,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

531
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:05,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the sponsor of this resolution have any idea if this will impact the MBTA assessment on the city of medicine.

532
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:16,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know it sounds like it's going to cost about a billion bucks and pretty sure we're going to be caught paying for it.

533
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:29,076
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of method is one of the hot one, I think it's number four or five and assessment by the T in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts so we pay a pretty, pretty steep price to have to see running through our community.

534
00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:38,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not aware that it is the assessment for any of the impacted communities at all I think that this is a statewide plan for procuring and implementing in a staggered way the electrification.

535
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:41,544
[SPEAKER_10]: of the buses, the bus charging stations.

536
00:42:42,304 --> 00:42:50,788
[SPEAKER_10]: To my knowledge from reading the text of the bill, didn't mention anything about the assessment of the community's fees to the MBTA.

537
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:56,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That would probably come from the MBTA advisory board if the measure passed and was ever ended up funded.

538
00:42:58,572 --> 00:42:59,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one.

539
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:02,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, the governor's budget has come out.

540
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:05,115
[SPEAKER_04]: The governor's budget is not that pretty.

541
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:15,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, again, if we're going to be sending letters up to the state house, I think the letters that we should be sending up to the state house, they give us more chapter 90 money, give us more local aid money, give us more money for our schools.

542
00:43:17,065 --> 00:43:25,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you know, when you give everybody a, when you ask, when you ask for two slices and you get a half a slice, you can't complain.

543
00:43:25,988 --> 00:43:33,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but if he asked for one slice and you only, you know, you only give them an option to give you one slice, then, um, you gotta, you're in a better position of power from negotiation.

544
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:36,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'd hate to see us be in a situation where we're.

545
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:40,610
[SPEAKER_04]: sending letters up to every single chairman up in the state house, asking for this and asking for that.

546
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:48,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, we're passing a ceremonious legislation and we're not cashing in on our ability to get the big bucks.

547
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:50,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it's a great, great idea.

548
00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:58,017
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, something that certainly, uh, uh, sounds like a pie in the sky, um, possibility.

549
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:00,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, it's going to have to be funded.

550
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:04,780
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be funded, um, through the forward funding mechanism that they have right now.

551
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:08,290
[SPEAKER_04]: through the sales tax because it's going to cost way too much to do that.

552
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to come down to an assessment on our community as well.

553
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:12,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be a financial impact there.

554
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:19,696
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Caviello did say, our community is super assessed when it comes to the MBTA and our services are lacking.

555
00:44:19,816 --> 00:44:24,939
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen service cuts across the board from bus service to commuter rail service to express bus service.

556
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:30,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's something to think about, you know, are we going to ask for more, pay for more and get less.

557
00:44:30,743 --> 00:44:31,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something we want?

558
00:44:32,345 --> 00:44:42,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also has environmental and economical impacts that will, you know, make a difference here in our community from a public health standpoint.

559
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:43,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something we need to think about in a way.

560
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:45,917
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we have a state legislature.

561
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:48,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion.

562
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Just Mr. President, if I may.

563
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to counselor nice point.

564
00:44:55,831 --> 00:45:04,196
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I was looking at the fiscal 23 cherry sheet, which is the basically proposed inflows and outflows of state money into the city.

565
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:07,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And our MBTA assessment was just over $4 million.

566
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:16,864
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are sending over $9 million a year out of this community to fund private charter schools, you know, and only getting $1 million back.

567
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:26,851
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely also agree about the issues with chapter 90 being level funded and local aid being, you know, two and a half percent again.

568
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:41,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of things that need to be fixed, but certainly I think we can all on this council agree that addressing the charter school funding formula, which is draining, you know, a huge chunk of our city revenue would be a priority as well.

569
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:43,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice presidents.

570
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:44,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:18,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Sang.

582
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:21,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:23,174
[SPEAKER_02]: President Morrell.

584
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:23,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

585
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:26,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kerrio.

586
00:46:26,336 --> 00:46:43,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, when you primitive three negative motion passes to 2006 to offer my council saying be resolved that the Memphis City Council so celebrate Black History Month and support episode community city government schools to combat racism and white supremacy and teach black history.

587
00:46:45,121 --> 00:47:01,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, um, many members of our community every shot to me over the course of campaign but also as a counselor, asking to see our city, you know, even showed the symbolic steps to toward towards supporting diversity and equity in our city.

588
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is one of those.

589
00:47:05,028 --> 00:47:09,711
[SPEAKER_08]: those pieces, those resolutions that reflect what constituents have been telling me.

590
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:12,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, this aligns with our community's values.

591
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:15,394
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we are an anti-racist community.

592
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:16,815
[SPEAKER_08]: We are a diverse community.

593
00:47:17,575 --> 00:47:27,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think our community has been making a lot of steps forward in terms of talking about Black history, addressing racism in our community.

594
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:31,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I think we've made strides

595
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:45,038
[SPEAKER_08]: together and talking earnestly and honestly about the two ideologies, racism and white supremacy, whose historical and sociological effects seep into the structures that shape our society.

596
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:49,163
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, these aren't things that are, you know, these

597
00:47:50,144 --> 00:48:01,113
[SPEAKER_08]: are targeted at any community in particular, you know, it's not just it's not just you know it's not a white person issue this is something that you know happens in the Asian community as well that I know very well of.

598
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:05,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is about all of us kind of coming together saying.

599
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:22,810
[SPEAKER_08]: telling history as it is because it's important to learn from our past, it's important to celebrate our past as well, because that's where we find unity is in telling the truth about about our city and about our history and, you know, looking positively towards the future to see how we move on.

600
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:24,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

601
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'd like to thank Councilor Singh for bringing this forward.

602
00:48:37,102 --> 00:48:39,384
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think you said it very well.

603
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:42,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Black history and Medford's history are inextricably woven.

604
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:57,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd be proud to see Black History Month be celebrated even more loudly in our community and to have this be a moment for recommitting to investing in black voices, black futures, standing together against bigotry and systemic injustice.

605
00:48:57,316 --> 00:48:58,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd move for approval.

606
00:48:59,138 --> 00:48:59,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

607
00:48:59,658 --> 00:49:00,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Biz.

608
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:02,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

609
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:10,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, uh, in a moment, if my fellow counselor would be so amenable to an amendment, I will propose one.

610
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:19,763
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, you know, I think especially at this moment in time, as we're seeing the banning of books, the banning of thought, the banning of debate,

611
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:32,224
[SPEAKER_09]: intentionally put forward across this country and in media to constrict and define our history in a way that is untruthful.

612
00:49:32,284 --> 00:49:38,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important for us, as a place that doesn't do that, to make it very loud and clear why we don't do that.

613
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:47,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's a very dangerous and corrosive ideology that's

614
00:49:48,396 --> 00:49:51,979
[SPEAKER_09]: spreading and moving through our society.

615
00:49:52,480 --> 00:50:08,475
[SPEAKER_09]: So just to be more specific in this resolution, I'd like to amend the resolution to put a comma after the phrase to combat racism and then replace the words and white supremacy with the following phrase.

616
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:10,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, let me know when you're ready.

617
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:18,681
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a ready.

618
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:37,230
[SPEAKER_09]: And the phrase is to address the growing danger of white supremacy and white supremacist ideology as well publicized by the United States Department of Justice, Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and other leading watchdogs, comma.

619
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:44,033
[SPEAKER_09]: And I put forward that amendment hopefully with the support of the sponsor.

620
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:57,799
[SPEAKER_09]: just to be specific about what's happening right now and why it's important for us to speak out about the true reality of what's happened and also where we need to go.

621
00:51:00,163 --> 00:51:01,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

622
00:51:01,883 --> 00:51:04,404
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Councilor Scott-Bell.

623
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:05,964
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can, thank you very much.

624
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:28,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a nice discussion with Councilor Sangin in support of this resolution, but I will also share some comments that were shared with me from residents that were a little concerned that the understanding of white supremacy

625
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:41,209
[SPEAKER_14]: in the inference that there are running rampant of white members of our community in white supremacy.

626
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:45,351
[SPEAKER_14]: And it really paints a picture

627
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:48,250
[SPEAKER_14]: negative tone of unity in that light.

628
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:55,074
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that I support totally support the celebrating a black history month.

629
00:51:55,654 --> 00:52:02,057
[SPEAKER_14]: I support that the city is city government, the schools, we combat racism and teach black history.

630
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:04,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that in my conversations with different

631
00:52:04,899 --> 00:52:27,095
[SPEAKER_14]: different educators and as we talk moving this topic forward and not just being just talk like it was mentioned with some members of the community that I had discussions with and putting our money where our mouth is and asking the city to ask the school committee to look at bringing back civics.

632
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:33,840
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody understands where we are and a quarter of that civics lesson

633
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:35,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Bing!

634
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:39,324
[SPEAKER_14]: the focal point to black history in Medford and black history.

635
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:44,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's something that I've mentioned in the past in moving steps forward.

636
00:52:44,367 --> 00:53:05,702
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not just talk, it's not just rhetoric, but I know that I asked council's saying to see if we could find other wording when it came to white supremacy, because unfortunately in some people in this community that it doesn't unify, it's really dividing our community in the sense that

637
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:15,752
[SPEAKER_14]: people don't look at it the way that it's addressed, because they think that every white person is being dressed as a white supremacist.

638
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,416
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's not the message you're trying to send in our conversation.

639
00:53:20,017 --> 00:53:27,145
[SPEAKER_14]: And I like what Councilor Beas, Vice President Beas mentioned that the intent

640
00:53:28,426 --> 00:53:40,578
[SPEAKER_14]: might be more defined so our residents can understand that this isn't something that you put through to divide or made it so that it's one person against another.

641
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:47,465
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a unified feeling that we want Medford to be exactly what we've been trying to work for, and that's a community of one.

642
00:53:49,287 --> 00:54:03,777
[SPEAKER_14]: again if we could in and changing that I would support it if not unfortunately I would just vote present on this because I do other pieces in this this resolution I support a thousand percent and I would I would also make it uh

643
00:54:04,391 --> 00:54:18,138
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, asked to amend it and to reach out to the school committee and asked to bring back civics and adding a whole block in method black history because we have plenty of it here.

644
00:54:18,178 --> 00:54:22,500
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that this is how we're going to start the change

645
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:39,542
[SPEAKER_14]: at the younger level where people understand where the black history method was I mean that I've talked to one of my closest friends who is educated man of color and said that with the with he would love to be.

646
00:54:40,818 --> 00:54:48,742
[SPEAKER_14]: given the opportunity to go to the post office when the concern was with the mural, with our slaves being in shackles.

647
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:52,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is what everybody sees when they go to the post office.

648
00:54:52,924 --> 00:54:55,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And he made it a point to me and said, George, you know what?

649
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,666
[SPEAKER_14]: We would love to see that.

650
00:54:57,106 --> 00:54:57,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Leave it there.

651
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:04,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Let our kids see what this history was about and how devastating it was.

652
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:05,671
[SPEAKER_14]: And

653
00:55:08,383 --> 00:55:29,850
[SPEAKER_14]: using that type of philosophy, where you look at the Royal House and the slave wall, and we'll talk about so many benefits and so many educational points we can use in this community, that bringing that class back and use that as a jumping off point to really educate our community, I would support it a thousand percent.

654
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

655
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

656
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

657
00:55:35,831 --> 00:55:37,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important when we look at this,

658
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:39,248
[SPEAKER_04]: resolution what it says.

659
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:41,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It says celebrate and support.

660
00:55:42,029 --> 00:55:56,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when we talk about the debate and discussion that we've had over a resolution that's asked for us to celebrate and support something versus what we did in our first four meetings, I think we spent 3 million bucks in our first four meetings and we've talked less about it than we've talked about this topic right here.

661
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:04,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it's a resolution that's symbolic in nature that says let's celebrate and support this unity.

662
00:56:05,184 --> 00:56:06,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And I certainly don't have a problem with that.

663
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:17,787
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I do have a problem with is that the budget has been passed now for quite a bit of time and we still don't have a director of diversity in the school department or on the city side.

664
00:56:18,648 --> 00:56:22,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, when we talk about things, let's really talk about them.

665
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, let's, let's, let's put the issues out there.

666
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:25,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's lay it out there.

667
00:56:26,692 --> 00:56:28,293
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we still don't have a diversity director.

668
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:30,774
[SPEAKER_04]: We still don't have a diversity director.

669
00:56:31,135 --> 00:56:33,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been three years, no diversity director.

670
00:56:36,742 --> 00:56:39,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're going to make the commitment, let's really make the commitment.

671
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:41,684
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're going to talk about it, let's walk about it too.

672
00:56:42,464 --> 00:56:43,764
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I'm coming from, Mr. President.

673
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:45,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So I certainly support this resolution.

674
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:45,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem with it.

675
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:49,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it's a resolution that asks us to support something.

676
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem doing that.

677
00:56:51,987 --> 00:56:54,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so for that reason, I'll be voting for that this evening.

678
00:56:57,089 --> 00:57:05,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and if I can make a, um, I agree with council Scott, I think, uh, um, I think the languages, uh, could be, uh,

679
00:57:06,371 --> 00:57:11,552
[SPEAKER_06]: change a little bit, and I would support it with the white supremacy.

680
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:15,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that might be good, might be taking a little time.

681
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:16,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Layton is right.

682
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:31,117
[SPEAKER_06]: We're three years without a diversity director in the city, and that's something that we've asked for, both in the budget and I think last year that was part of our council priorities was the diversity director.

683
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:34,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing has happened, we don't have a diversity director.

684
00:57:35,053 --> 00:57:36,554
[SPEAKER_06]: on the high schools, on the school side either.

685
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:43,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, you know, we, you know, we want to talk, but you know, we can talk all we want, but if we, if we don't have anyone to enact these things, we go nowhere.

686
00:57:44,036 --> 00:57:46,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, again, I'm with council Scott Pelley.

687
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I, if, you know, if you could change that language a little bit, I would be, I would have, I would support it also.

688
00:57:52,779 --> 00:57:53,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

689
00:57:53,839 --> 00:58:01,402
[SPEAKER_04]: On that point, Mr. President, I think, you know, when we look at traditionally this administration's personnel functions and the way that they go about it,

690
00:58:02,096 --> 00:58:07,378
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't had any problem bringing back all three employees, retired employees, to perform these functions.

691
00:58:07,418 --> 00:58:08,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at what went on in the treasurer's office.

692
00:58:09,339 --> 00:58:11,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at what's going on in the CFO's office.

693
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:15,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're bringing back part-time retirees to fill these positions.

694
00:58:15,901 --> 00:58:18,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't we doing that in the diversity office too?

695
00:58:18,602 --> 00:58:21,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that office less important than these other offices?

696
00:58:24,225 --> 00:58:37,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that that was something we fought for to make that two separate positions of last year, not one position so constant saying, I'll defer to President Merrill first.

697
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:49,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr President, I just want to thank Councilor saying for bringing this forward, and I appreciate the language as well as the amendment by counselor bears I just want to note that the I believe the West better Community Center is putting together a full month of programming.

698
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:51,113
[SPEAKER_12]: for Black History Month this month.

699
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:59,678
[SPEAKER_12]: So if people just wanna keep their eyes out for that, and that is a great way to engage as a community and learn about our history and our future.

700
00:58:59,738 --> 00:59:00,919
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanna put that out there.

701
00:59:01,259 --> 00:59:01,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

702
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:03,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

703
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:12,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to say that I'm happy to accept the amendments as proposed by Councilor Behrs and the one on civics as proposed by Councilor Spadafore.

704
00:59:12,926 --> 00:59:14,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, any further discussion?

705
00:59:15,308 --> 00:59:18,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I may just add to Councilor Knight's point,

706
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:24,034
[SPEAKER_09]: that there is a job posting for that position.

707
00:59:24,954 --> 00:59:32,539
[SPEAKER_09]: So to anyone here or anyone watching tonight, please spread that job posting for the diversity director far and wide.

708
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:37,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think it is urgent that we get someone hired and I'm hopeful that that will happen quickly.

709
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:40,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight months.

710
00:59:42,384 --> 00:59:44,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight months, we're gonna be on the next fiscal year's budget pretty soon.

711
00:59:47,895 --> 00:59:56,122
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Sang as amended by Councilor Baez and amended by Councilor Scott Kelly seconded by.

712
00:59:56,142 --> 01:00:03,469
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can just if the city clerk can read Councilor Baez's amendment over.

713
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:10,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate Councilor Sang for entertaining that for the other residents that reached out.

714
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:39,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Council business amendment inserts a comma after the word to combat racism, and then adds in the words to address the growing danger of white supremacy and white supremacist ideology as well publicized by the US Department of Justice, Southern Poverty Law Center anti defamation league, and other leading watchdogs, and then as a comma and it and then it reverts to, and to teach black history.

715
01:00:43,658 --> 01:00:45,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, man.

716
01:00:47,620 --> 01:01:02,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to copy down the counselor Scarpelli wants wants to reach out to the school committee to ask them to teach civics, but there was something at the end that I didn't pick up on the microphone to bring to bring civics back to the public schools, again at the high school level, and part of their curriculum

717
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:10,536
[SPEAKER_14]: be a quarter that teaches the methods black history and black history.

718
01:01:10,756 --> 01:01:13,056
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's important that we see that.

719
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:26,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion by councilor saying as amended by councilor bears and amended by councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by seconded by councilor Collins.

720
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:27,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

721
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:35,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

722
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:35,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

723
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:36,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

724
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kerrio.

725
01:01:46,900 --> 01:02:03,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I mean affirmative negative motion passes to 2064 offered by council saying we resolve the Memphis City Council celebrate Lunar New Year and reaffirm our solidarity with Asians Americans and method given an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, bigotry and violence.

726
01:02:03,149 --> 01:02:09,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And given that what may be a difficult holiday season for those unable to visit a relative.

727
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:10,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I could say to our

728
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:13,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang, happy new year.

729
01:02:13,726 --> 01:02:17,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And to all the Asian families in the city of Memphis, happy new year.

730
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:19,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry if I said it right.

731
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope my English is okay.

732
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:24,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

733
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:33,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is in line with residents who want to see our city more openly embracing our diversity and our different communities here.

734
01:02:33,759 --> 01:02:38,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Lunar New Year is the most important holiday for many Asian communities here in Medford.

735
01:02:39,242 --> 01:02:53,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's not, not just the Chinese holiday, it's one that's celebrated by many other communities as well by Koreans, by Vietnamese Americans, by Tibetan Americans, by Taiwanese Americans, and the list goes on and on.

736
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:58,085
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I wanted to note that this, this New Year's might be

737
01:02:59,126 --> 01:03:07,572
[SPEAKER_08]: particularly difficult, you know, we're still dealing with the pandemic, and it's traditional, it's kind of like an Asian Thanksgiving where you go into your family.

738
01:03:08,813 --> 01:03:13,737
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, for a lot of families are not able to make it back for, you know, be it.

739
01:03:14,297 --> 01:03:22,564
[SPEAKER_08]: they're sick, it's difficult to, the difficult situations to leave the country or the difficult situations to get into another country.

740
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:30,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, I think it's especially important for us to kind of lift each other up in this moment and to celebrate with each other.

741
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:38,838
[SPEAKER_08]: A holiday which, you know, a holiday season which might be a little bit tougher for folks now.

742
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

743
01:03:41,056 --> 01:03:48,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you counseling bringing this forward and know that I did, I did have some alarming questions.

744
01:03:48,723 --> 01:03:59,674
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a Asian American family reach out to me later earlier today and asked if if method is dealing with recently increase anti a crimes.

745
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,631
[SPEAKER_14]: as they read the resolution.

746
01:04:01,691 --> 01:04:14,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So I did call, try to reach out to the chiefs and are you familiar, has something happened that we don't know because I think it's important that if it is, we make that public and that's something that we have to reaffirm publicly, so.

747
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:21,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that last year there were there were reported incidents of this city council in the last session.

748
01:04:21,805 --> 01:04:22,125
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that.

749
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:22,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

750
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:31,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you know this is a general rise, that's consistent with that trend that we saw last year, you know.

751
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:48,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford is a safe community, we are safe for Asian Americans but there are moments where it might be difficult and I think it's important for our city council to, to note that there are definitely, you know, anti Asian incidents that are often gone on reported.

752
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:58,299
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of people don't know about our city's reporting resources, be it with the police or with our city departments.

753
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:09,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I also want to make that clear just for all of our residents here that there are different ways to report hate crimes or hate incidents if that happens to you, God forbid.

754
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:15,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I would say that

755
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:20,718
[SPEAKER_08]: My short answer is that there's a general increase in the Boston metro area.

756
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, yeah.

757
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:30,686
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate bringing that clarity because I think that, again, this is an Asian family that I'm very close with and said, George, have you heard something?

758
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:38,111
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was trying to get the answer to that, but reflecting back to last year's resolution, I appreciate that clarity.

759
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:41,053
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're not alarmed.

760
01:05:41,594 --> 01:05:43,635
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I support this a thousand percent.

761
01:05:43,715 --> 01:05:44,876
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's very important that

762
01:05:46,107 --> 01:05:58,233
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, as we talked to this constituent, that's one of the things they talked about is the Asian community finds it very difficult sometimes to stand up and call someone.

763
01:05:58,493 --> 01:06:01,955
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of times it's something that they've taken and we won't take that in this community.

764
01:06:01,995 --> 01:06:05,196
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and that's what I shared with them.

765
01:06:05,276 --> 01:06:06,557
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate it.

766
01:06:06,637 --> 01:06:07,757
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, happy new year.

767
01:06:08,258 --> 01:06:09,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

768
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:10,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, if I could.

769
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, President.

770
01:06:17,509 --> 01:06:17,830
[SPEAKER_06]: President.

771
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:20,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

772
01:06:20,888 --> 01:06:22,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Councilor Seng for bringing this forward.

773
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:34,333
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have all of the history of minutes in front of me, so I don't know if celebrating Chinese New Year has ever been introduced before, but I know it has not been introduced by an Asian American councilor, as Councilor Seng is our first.

774
01:06:34,413 --> 01:06:42,256
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to note that it's great to have this celebratory measure on our agenda and that representation matters.

775
01:06:42,316 --> 01:06:47,197
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the kind of stuff that people can see when they see themselves represented on the council.

776
01:06:47,357 --> 01:06:49,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Councilor Seng, for bringing this forward.

777
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:58,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, what Councilor Morrell, Villes, and Knight don't see is the amazing jacket that Justin's wearing right now.

778
01:06:58,865 --> 01:07:00,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually can see it.

779
01:07:00,285 --> 01:07:01,226
[SPEAKER_12]: It took me a little bit.

780
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't see his necktie, but I can see his jacket.

781
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Next year, the whole council wears it.

782
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:07,972
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not fit me, but I have one at home.

783
01:07:08,352 --> 01:07:09,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Rick has one, but it's a shoe.

784
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:10,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have one at home.

785
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:11,975
[SPEAKER_15]: So, thank you again.

786
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:15,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Councilor Tang.

787
01:07:15,537 --> 01:07:21,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I've grown up with the Asian community many, many years, and something that I've gotten very fond of them.

788
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:28,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And my father and uncle sponsored many Chinese families to come here in the 60s and 70s.

789
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:31,527
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I want to thank you for bringing it up.

790
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:33,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I will support this.

791
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:38,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So, on the motion by Councilor saying, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

792
01:07:39,732 --> 01:07:40,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

793
01:07:44,575 --> 01:07:45,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President bears.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's our columns.

796
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:48,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

797
01:07:49,218 --> 01:07:49,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

798
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:49,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

799
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:49,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

800
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:50,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

801
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:52,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

802
01:07:59,191 --> 01:07:59,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Keohokalole.

803
01:08:00,091 --> 01:08:04,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

804
01:08:04,054 --> 01:08:05,354
[SPEAKER_06]: 2-2-0-6-5, offered by Councilor Zang.

805
01:08:06,175 --> 01:08:08,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I can offer a summary.

806
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:10,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Councilor?

807
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:11,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I can offer a summary.

808
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:13,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we have quite a few.

809
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:15,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna hear this summary.

810
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite lengthy, so- Rick, it might be easier if you read it.

811
01:08:19,902 --> 01:08:22,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it to Councilor Zang.

812
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:34,385
[SPEAKER_06]: can give us his description of the 18 paragraphs here in a shorter version.

813
01:08:35,453 --> 01:08:42,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so essentially this, this resolution is about the practice of data disaggregation.

814
01:08:43,315 --> 01:08:58,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'll give a little bit of history on it, explain the policy, explain the policy and why I've written it this way, and explain why I'm doing it now and then explain why, where where we should go as a city with it with the resolution part.

815
01:08:59,400 --> 01:08:59,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

816
01:09:02,357 --> 01:09:13,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Going about the history, the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, in 1997 created five racial categories for government agencies to report.

817
01:09:13,882 --> 01:09:19,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this is a standard that different government agencies in our country are expected to follow.

818
01:09:19,865 --> 01:09:33,248
[SPEAKER_08]: But they did allow this guidance, give states and municipalities the prerogative to break our data down even further and to be more specific in the way that we report our data.

819
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:49,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is something that, particularly in civil rights circles, in Asian American activist circles, and activist circles for different racial groups, this is something that's particularly important because

820
01:09:50,712 --> 01:10:04,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Racial data informs how we make policy decisions, it informs how we use funds, how we target communities in pandemic outreach and kind of different government city services as well.

821
01:10:05,396 --> 01:10:12,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know for certain that our city has been working, has been using racial data to help

822
01:10:13,818 --> 01:10:20,225
[SPEAKER_08]: help solve the vaccine gap issue to help address disparities in the pandemic response.

823
01:10:22,007 --> 01:10:24,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, so basically what this policy is, is that

824
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:43,534
[SPEAKER_08]: We would, instead of, for example, take Asian Americans, instead of reporting it as solely Asian Americans, we will break that down into different communities, different racial and ethnic groups that the census has come up with to better help us identify trends within different racial groups.

825
01:10:44,514 --> 01:10:53,519
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that we currently report data actually covers up and papers over a lot of inequities within communities as well.

826
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:09,368
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at the poverty rate for Asian Americans in this country, I don't think you would expect that the poverty rate for Vietnamese Americans is 2.5 times the national average, that the rate of poverty for Hmong Americans is three times the national average.

827
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:19,899
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at English proficiency rates, you'll find that while English proficiency rates for Vietnamese Americans is low, those for Indian Americans are high.

828
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:26,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these are things that just don't come out of the research that our city is doing, that cities generally in our country are doing.

829
01:11:29,088 --> 01:11:39,094
[SPEAKER_08]: They affect the city services right because if you have, if our city's targeting, you know, we need to provide city services in this language or publish this brochure in another language.

830
01:11:39,535 --> 01:11:46,459
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not thinking about fiscally is it actually does it actually make fiscal sense to spend that money on that translation not on another translation.

831
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:51,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it, does it, you know, our is our targeting of one community.

832
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that actually make sense fiscally and in terms of where we're spending our money.

833
01:11:56,502 --> 01:12:06,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, this, I'm this resolution calls for city administration to cause for us to ask our city ministrations to disaggregate data.

834
01:12:07,946 --> 01:12:14,969
[SPEAKER_08]: because I know this will take a while, I know it will take planning and it'll take resources over a few years.

835
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I've asked our cities to submit a report looking at long-term, what are the costs?

836
01:12:21,492 --> 01:12:23,894
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the benefits?

837
01:12:24,034 --> 01:12:30,657
[SPEAKER_08]: How else can we kind of affect change in data collection and data analysis?

838
01:12:30,757 --> 01:12:32,638
[SPEAKER_08]: How can we make it fairer and more transparent?

839
01:12:33,138 --> 01:12:35,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think this revolution starts the conversation.

840
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:48,570
[SPEAKER_08]: that will help us plan over a long term, what, you know, what, what our city needs to do to what does our city need to do in order to

841
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:53,893
[SPEAKER_08]: disaggregate our data?

842
01:12:54,814 --> 01:12:56,814
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we get the community involved in this?

843
01:12:57,074 --> 01:12:59,175
[SPEAKER_08]: How can we get different departments involved in this?

844
01:12:59,295 --> 01:13:01,335
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really about starting that conversation.

845
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:09,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, given our conversations about Asian American activism, I think that it is our Asian American issues in town.

846
01:13:10,537 --> 01:13:14,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is a good time to also back that up with some action.

847
01:13:14,798 --> 01:13:18,959
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is, this is the resolution, essentially.

848
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm happy to answer questions.

849
01:13:22,059 --> 01:13:22,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

850
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:23,980
Councilor Palacio.

851
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:26,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

852
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:29,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Sang for putting this forward.

853
01:13:29,024 --> 01:13:35,288
[SPEAKER_10]: This was very interesting to read through and learn about, and I appreciate your rundown of the resolution.

854
01:13:36,149 --> 01:13:39,271
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something I'd very much like to see our administration work towards.

855
01:13:39,752 --> 01:13:44,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's very aligned with our social justice roadmap, our goals of becoming an ever more equitable community.

856
01:13:45,536 --> 01:13:49,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you very helpfully described, disaggregating data into more specific

857
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:52,020
[SPEAKER_10]: national, racial, ethnic groups.

858
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:56,342
[SPEAKER_10]: This arms us with better data to act upon through policy, through planning.

859
01:13:56,943 --> 01:14:09,229
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, essentially the point of having all of this demographic information is so we can look beyond the line of best fit and see what's underneath it for really specific populations, you know, and respond appropriately through our governance and our program.

860
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:15,153
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd love to see a response from the administration about what it would take to adopt this improved data, improved reporting.

861
01:14:15,373 --> 01:14:15,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

862
01:14:15,693 --> 01:14:15,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

863
01:14:18,189 --> 01:14:31,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I should also note, I forgot to mention that the reason why this is worded the way it is, is because this is taking from city council resolutions bits and pieces that apply to us, our community.

864
01:14:31,892 --> 01:14:46,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I've taken from different communities across the country and from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as well, because there is a piece of legislation in the state legislature that is talking about this issue as well, which will affect

865
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:52,900
[SPEAKER_08]: which would help if passed, which would help our city's data collection system.

866
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:53,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

867
01:14:53,761 --> 01:14:58,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion by Councilor Sang, seconded by Vice President Bez.

868
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:00,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to second the motion.

869
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:13,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And just one small amendment, if the city administration could also consider disaggregation of Middle Eastern and North African identities.

870
01:15:14,178 --> 01:15:16,600
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one, basically,

871
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:23,013
[SPEAKER_09]: several censuses ago, the census decided that if you're from North Africa or the Middle East, you're white.

872
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:29,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And that has presented a huge issue in terms of data collection and disaggregation.

873
01:15:29,536 --> 01:15:32,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So just if I could add that small friendly amendment to this.

874
01:15:35,538 --> 01:15:36,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a member?

875
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:37,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm a member.

876
01:15:37,879 --> 01:15:44,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion by Councilor Saint, as amended by Councilor Beas, seconded by Councilor Beas.

877
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:47,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna come back to Councilor.

885
01:16:17,045 --> 01:16:17,745

886
01:16:17,905 --> 01:16:18,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

887
01:16:20,146 --> 01:16:20,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Stang?

888
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

889
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:22,286
[SPEAKER_02]: President Morrell?

890
01:16:22,826 --> 01:16:23,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

891
01:16:25,687 --> 01:16:26,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Kerrio?

892
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:26,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

893
01:16:27,787 --> 01:16:29,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

894
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just, let me go back to Councilor Naito.

895
01:16:30,527 --> 01:16:31,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going back to Councilor Naito.

896
01:16:31,768 --> 01:16:32,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Naito, you avail?

897
01:16:38,869 --> 01:16:41,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so six in the affirmative, one absent.

898
01:16:41,629 --> 01:16:42,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

899
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:44,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, zero.

900
01:16:46,115 --> 01:17:02,448
[SPEAKER_06]: 22066 offered by Council saying be resolved, Memphis City Council expresses its support of House Bill 3155, an act ensuring equitable representation of the commonwealth be approved, resolved, the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to Memphis Legislative Delegation as well as chairs of

901
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,462
[SPEAKER_06]: the Joint Committee on State Administration Regulatory Oversight, Pacheco and Cabral.

902
01:17:07,562 --> 01:17:08,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang.

903
01:17:08,743 --> 01:17:09,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

904
01:17:09,984 --> 01:17:16,747
[SPEAKER_08]: This state bill, this state house bill, is very similar to what we just passed.

905
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:23,511
[SPEAKER_08]: It essentially is also about data desegregation for different communities at the state level.

906
01:17:24,551 --> 01:17:26,372
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been something that people have been fighting for.

907
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:33,356
[SPEAKER_08]: As Councilor Behrs did mention before, you know, the deadline week is this week.

908
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:43,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's important if we are moving forward as a city, we ask the state to move forward as well, because that will also help us cut down on our resources if we choose to move forward with such a policy.

909
01:17:44,165 --> 01:17:45,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't think I'm saying.

910
01:17:45,406 --> 01:17:46,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

911
01:17:48,189 --> 01:17:49,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion- Second.

01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:43,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually my error, that's the Veterans and Military Affairs.

[SPEAKER_06]: Veterans and Military Affairs.

925

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, if you can just give me a brief, which one is this?

974
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:08,790
631.

975
01:21:09,391 --> 01:21:10,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you taking both?

976
01:21:10,052 --> 01:21:12,414
[SPEAKER_14]: 631 and 023 to take them off the table.

977
01:21:19,206 --> 01:21:21,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Six, but 631, I don't see it.

978
01:21:21,787 --> 01:21:25,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 21631 on page seven and eight.

979
01:21:25,769 --> 01:21:32,351
[SPEAKER_06]: On page seven and eight.

01:21:32,391 --> 01:21:34,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Third reading for the personnel ordinances.

981
01:21:37,373 --> 01:21:39,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's two because they were severed.

982
01:21:39,974 --> 01:21:42,335
[SPEAKER_12]: They were voted on separately.

983
01:21:43,095 --> 01:21:44,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the first paper's positions?

984
01:21:47,982 --> 01:21:53,965
[SPEAKER_09]: The first paper is the positions including the federal funds manager that we approved under the prior council in December.

985
01:21:57,506 --> 01:21:57,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

986
01:21:57,706 --> 01:21:58,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I voted no on that.

987
01:21:58,787 --> 01:21:59,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

988
01:21:59,227 --> 01:22:03,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So what else was on that?

989
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:07,070
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

990
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:11,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mr. Clerk, we're going to take those off the table first.

991
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

992
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:22,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, can I request that we keep these on the table for one more week, just so I can have an opportunity to review the paperwork again.

993
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:30,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little confused as to what's before us this evening and where we're taking it off the table without the papers in front of us and just like for the professional courtesy to have one more week to take a review.

994
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:37,857
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion by Vice President Mike to table this.

995
01:22:38,478 --> 01:22:40,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of a request, I guess.

996
01:22:40,558 --> 01:22:41,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of a request.

997
01:22:44,786 --> 01:22:45,886
[SPEAKER_06]: able this to do.

998
01:22:45,906 --> 01:22:46,486
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the paper.

999
01:22:46,506 --> 01:22:47,707
[SPEAKER_06]: The first council calls.

1000
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:53,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to, of course, if any counselors need another week to review it, I don't want to rush the decision.

1001
01:22:53,789 --> 01:23:03,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But being as a lot of the positions under these ordinances are related to public health, the public health nurse, food security specialist positions are included in these amendments.

1002
01:23:04,553 --> 01:23:08,316
[SPEAKER_10]: These are positions that I've heard that the community is really clamoring to be filled.

1003
01:23:08,336 --> 01:23:13,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's really urgent that we get these processed, be able to hire for them really as quickly as possible.

1004
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:16,241
[SPEAKER_10]: These are some positions that are really addressing urgent needs in Medford.

1005
01:23:16,921 --> 01:23:29,990
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's possible even to, you know, maybe review the documents in this meeting and then move forward, you know, I don't want to be ham-fisted about this, but if there's any way to move forward with a measure of urgency, I'd really, you know, appreciate it.

1006
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:30,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Just say no and push the vote.

1007
01:23:30,991 --> 01:23:32,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll vote against it and you guys can get what you want.

1008
01:23:33,847 --> 01:23:41,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at the end of the day, when we're talking about urgency, we've had the diversity director's position that's been vacant friggin' for 36 months.

1009
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:51,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think that, you know, when we're gonna sit here and we're gonna worry about urgency, I don't think that that urgency is shared all the time with colleagues in government across the hallway.

1010
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:53,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1011
01:23:55,419 --> 01:23:56,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Biss.

1012
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm of the opinion that waiting one additional week would not be

1013
01:24:02,675 --> 01:24:05,357
[SPEAKER_09]: the city and moving these forward.

1014
01:24:05,898 --> 01:24:09,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm happy to wait one more week and take these off the table at that time.

1015
01:24:09,981 --> 01:24:11,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only reason I ask is because I voted.

1016
01:24:12,884 --> 01:24:19,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Differently on both papers, so I just want to be sure that I can have the opportunity again to review them and be consistent in my efforts as I go forward in the

1017
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,961
[SPEAKER_06]: a motion by Councilor Collins to take these two papers off the table.

1018
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:37,963
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a request by Councilor Knight that was seconded by Councilor Baez to hold these for one week.

1019
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:40,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So Councilor Collins, you wanna rescind your order?

1020
01:24:40,704 --> 01:24:42,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Just withdraw the motion and we're done.

1021
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:42,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1022
01:24:47,566 --> 01:24:48,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a question?

1023
01:24:49,447 --> 01:24:51,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a way to motion for these to put on next week?

1024
01:24:51,507 --> 01:24:52,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Just withdraw the motion.

1025
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:53,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1026
01:24:53,968 --> 01:24:55,369
[SPEAKER_10]: If you withdraw,

1027
01:24:57,668 --> 01:24:59,330
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just withdraw the motion doesn't go anywhere.

1028
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:03,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to bring it back up next week.

1029
01:25:04,274 --> 01:25:04,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring it back next week.

1030
01:25:05,255 --> 01:25:07,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So Council Collins has withdrawn our motion.

1031
01:25:09,579 --> 01:25:13,623
[SPEAKER_06]: So public participation, anybody want to speak on public participation?

1032
01:25:15,425 --> 01:25:18,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, anybody speaking on public participation?

1033
01:25:19,129 --> 01:25:19,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1034
01:25:20,803 --> 01:25:32,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we leave, before we do the records, I received a bunch of calls today from people at the high school complaining about no heat.

1035
01:25:32,387 --> 01:25:41,270
[SPEAKER_06]: If the administration could send us something in the next day or so telling us what's being done to address the heat issues at the high school.

1036
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:47,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Students are being told to wear jackets because there's no heat in certain rooms.

1037
01:25:49,548 --> 01:25:54,952
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can get some kind of report in the next day or so, what the problem is and if it's being addressed.

1038
01:25:56,774 --> 01:25:58,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus.

1039
01:25:58,756 --> 01:26:00,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is a difficult issue.

1040
01:26:00,457 --> 01:26:07,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it takes resources, but I was just at the high school last week for a meeting and many students and teachers did bring that up to me as well.

1041
01:26:08,273 --> 01:26:13,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the administration could get us, send us an email the next day, so it'd be greatly appreciated.

1042
01:26:13,817 --> 01:26:20,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So, records of January 25th, 2020, do it, pass the council, Councilor Sang.

1043
01:26:20,962 --> 01:26:22,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang, how did you find those records?

1044
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:24,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I find the records in order and I move to approve.

1045
01:26:25,165 --> 01:26:26,305
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor- Second.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:49,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1072
01:27:09,486 --> 01:27:14,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we can find out why the heat's been diminished in this room.

1073
01:27:14,649 --> 01:27:15,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1074
01:27:15,269 --> 01:27:16,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take care of it.

1075
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:18,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Clark said he'll make the call.

1076
01:27:18,211 --> 01:27:20,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can refer that to the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment.

1077
01:27:21,894 --> 01:27:23,955
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why Councilor May call him, but he was a little chilly.

1078
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:28,098
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be the Subcommittee on Climate, Sustainability, and Transportation.

1079
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:33,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's still the Office of Community Development to me, whatever they want to call it.
