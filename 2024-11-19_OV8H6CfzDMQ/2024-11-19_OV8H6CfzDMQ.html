    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=543.75s">What</a>  happened is the partnership and didn't work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=547.484s">And</a>  I had to take this on my own because this is something I've been doing for the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=551.585s">That's</a>  why I was running the place last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=556.047s">We're</a>  doing great business. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=559.007s">I</a>  didn't get enough help. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=559.948s">So</a>  I got to do this for myself where I got to do it for other people.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=566.11s">That's</a>  all I say doing it just so I have a little bit of a flag when we keep seeing when something changes on this short of a period. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=575.897s">Any</a>  other questions for the gentleman? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=580.998s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, Chair awaits a motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=584.619s">Mr.</a>  President, I do have a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=589.219s">What</a>  is the proposed use that's warranting the council to review for special permit?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=595.78s">That</a>  was my question.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=600.021s">The</a>  reason I ask is because if you look at our zoning ordinance, it says if we get an application for certain uses, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=606.469s">uses</a>  12, 22, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 33, 34, and 49A, those matters should go to the community development board before the council takes a vote on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=618.22s">So</a>  in terms of just compliance with the law, I was just wondering where we were on that, if this in fact was an application for one of those items.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=636.696s">Do</a>  you have an answer for the council?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=639.958s">I</a>  think that would be more of a question for the building commissioner or the city solicitor than this gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=644.92s">I</a>  think he's just an applicant and the use is really not something that he'd be classifying his facility within a table of use chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=655.045s">That</a>  would be a determination that would be made by the building commissioner.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=661.236s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I agree with constant I that's my. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=667.599s">This</a>  didn't come in for the license of petition so I was a little confused with this also, not to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=676.323s">you</a>  know, the petitioner, Mr. Bazzi that I'm against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=680.828s">But</a>  I think that, like Council night said, I don't know if we should move forward with this until we get again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=686.353s">This</a>  is where having legal representation here, um, you know, for the council would help move this along. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=693.421s">Now</a>  we're looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=695.062s">And</a>  I'm going to recommend that we table this to next week, date certain till we get the answer from either the building commissioner or the city solicitor, making sure that we're voting on <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=708.135s">on</a>  something that we're apprised of, because like Councilor Knight says, I don't see a distinguished item that tells us why we need the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=721.022s">So</a>  I would look to table for one week and just to get this answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=726.445s">This</a>  could be just a simple question, simple answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=728.807s">And</a>  again, to the petitioner, Mr. Abbasi, this isn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=735.02s">Any</a>  affirmation of that, I don't wanna support this because if it's just straight what it is, I see it's in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=745.546s">But</a>  again, I don't know what the underlying reason for it hasn't been defined yet to this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=752.429s">So</a>  I would recommend that we table this for one week.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=756.852s">Mr.</a>  Paziev, do you plan on selling used cars there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=761.154s">At</a>  some point, yes, I will apply for that too.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=764.134s">Yeah,</a>  just be advised that you will need to get a license for that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=767.736s">So</a>  on the motion, Councilor Scarpelli to table this for one week to get an opinion from the building department.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=774.259s">City</a>  solicitor, please.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=775.64s">And</a>  the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=776.761s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=778.642s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=793.37s">Mr.</a>  President, I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=794.511s">If</a>  we're going to ask the question to the city solicitor, I think we better put it in appropriate terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=801.355s">The</a>  question to the solicitor would be, does this application fall within the scope of section 94-81 subsection B of the Medford zoning ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=823.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=919.883s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=922.537s">It's</a>  a sad, it's a sad day with the passing of Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=927.803s">Brian</a>  is what Medford Mustang pride and heart is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=935.911s">He</a>  fought a courageous battle with cancer, and anybody who <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=941.254s">who</a>  came across Brian in the middle of his darkest days, you would never know that he was battling this illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=949.261s">He</a>  had a smile on his face. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=951.283s">He</a>  always, first person to volunteer, donate whenever, especially when it came to kids, he was always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=961.512s">I</a>  still remember it was maybe 94 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=964.955s">We</a>  were having a, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=968.51s">a</a>  wiffle ball tournament in the name of Jimmy Maturana who passed recently for raising money for his scholarship fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=976.956s">And</a>  then after that, they were going to play the first baseball game at the new Jimmy Maturana Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=984.421s">And</a>  Brian plays in the tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=989.745s">It's</a>  97 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=991.98s">He</a>  goes through the whole celebration and then he ducks out and comes back wearing about 40 pounds of umpire equipment because he's now going to umpire for the kids so they can play the baseball game. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1005.671s">In</a>  the middle of all this, he's battling this horrible disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1011.976s">And</a>  that's exactly who Brian was. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1014.378s">I</a>  mean, when you talk to people tonight at his wake, when I talked to his family, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1021.906s">He</a>  is what makes Medford a great community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1027.77s">He</a>  was there to help anybody who needed help. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1033.674s">And</a>  he always did it with a smile on his face. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1037.156s">And</a>  to his children, to his sisters, to his friends, we are going to miss his physical being <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1051.403s">in</a>  our community forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1053.364s">But</a>  I will tell you for one person, Brian's memory will never be forgotten because he left that impression on everybody that crossed his path. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1064.01s">So</a>  those who didn't know him, talk to me if you see me, we'll talk about a few stories and just a great man. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1076.337s">And</a>  again, I think in the last couple of years, I've said this too often, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1081.907s">But</a>  we're saying goodbye to another Mefford icon, someone who left a mark in this community and never asked for anything in return. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1091.294s">So</a>  to his family, we send our condolences, our prayers, our memories. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1098.899s">If</a>  we could dedicate this meeting, Mr. Clerk, in his honor, I would love to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1103.803s">And</a>  thank you for allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1107.265s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1276.831s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1278.973s">The</a>  resolution is relatively self-explanatory, but just to <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1283.783s">to</a>  explain what a community control over public surveillance ordinance is, that ordinance would create a public process where if any part of the city wanted to implement surveillance technologies, that they would just have to be approved through a public process approved by this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1302.797s">So</a>  the motion is to consider such an ordinance in the public health and community safety subcommittee, and I defer to my co-sponsor, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1318.251s">Thank</a>  you, and thank you, Vice President Bears for introducing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1322.616s">Just</a>  want a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1325.619s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1326.54s">Yes,</a>  just a second everything that Vice President Bears already said this resolution is to create a public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1336.111s">You</a>  know, so to create, you know, a routinized way to have a clear routine process for any agency that wishes to deploy a public surveillance technology to outline why they would like to use it, for what purpose, how this information will be collected and used to make sure that we have a very clear and structured process to bring the public into that deliberation and decision process when surveillance technologies are proposed for use in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1363.63s">I</a>  think it's a great transparency measure, and I'd like for it to be taken up by the Public Safety and Community Health Subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1374.735s">On</a>  this issue, particularly, I think it's important to realize the role that power imbalances play. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1382.22s">in</a>  in surveillance and how it affects how you surveillance data, you know, I am a strong believer that whoever has power should should also get some oversight, and that applies to us as as city Councilors as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1396.514s">But</a>  in this case, I think, you know, those people with people who are using public surveillance have this access to power and I think it's fair for <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1406.803s">members</a>  of our community to ask for some transparency, to ask for some oversight as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1468.092s">2418,</a>  an act to protect civil rights and safety of all Massachusetts residents, also known as the Safe Communities Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1475.457s">We</a>  are afraid to resolve that the city clerk forwarded a copy of this resolution to the legislative delegation, as well as chairs of the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security, Timothy and Gonzales. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1489.044s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1491.312s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1492.913s">This</a>  is a bill that I've heard about from many Medford residents, and I see it as being very in line with our community's values so I'm glad for the opportunity to request my fellow Councilors support in endorsing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1504.517s">For</a>  a little bit of background, this act would shore up basic civil rights protections for undocumented people throughout the state, and of course, by inclusion, our community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1514.295s">You</a>  know, currently, insecurity about immigration status and the specter of deportation keeps many people from seeking the help and support that they need from police, from medical providers, and in other settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1525.479s">So</a>  this act would restrict the circumstances during which law enforcement is allowed to inquire about a person's immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1533.142s">Um,</a>  you know, essentially the act would make it so people less feel like they have to, uh, you know, avoid calling for help when they're in crisis because of what that call could result in in terms of an arrest or deportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1544.832s">Um,</a>  so I see the measures of this act as being very aligned with our community's existing goals of making sure that our public safety and health resources can actually reach every and any person in Medford who needs it regardless of their background. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1557.642s">And</a>  I respectfully, uh, ask for my fellow Councilors approval.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1562.253s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1563.914s">Um,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1565.874s">Uh,</a>  how's the constant to bring this forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1568.896s">I</a>  think that, um, I've seen how terrible this affects immigrant communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1577.279s">I</a>  think that I've had the privilege of working with a lot of great families and great individuals that, um, just even recently with the elimination of the Dream Act and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1592.224s">these</a>  young men and women that came to this country when they were infants, and find themselves now without a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1602.132s">They're</a>  not familiar with their parents' home country, and they're being told that they're not citizens of the country they were raised and grew up with and pay taxes in, and they find themselves left in limbo. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1618.407s">Anything</a>  we can do to support that, I would champion that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1622.293s">So</a>  I appreciate bringing this forward and I would move, second the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1630.224s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1632.948s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1634.643s">I</a>  also support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1636.364s">I</a>  thank my fellow councillor for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1639.945s">You</a>  know, I've, like Councilor Scarpelli, I've worked with and grew up with a lot of, you know, friends who are undocumented and I know how difficult it is for them to, you know, just live as normal human beings in our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1657.271s">And,</a>  you know, especially as we've all, as I've kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1663.305s">become</a>  more of a leader in the community, a lot of people ask me, can I use this resource without being told that I might be deported one day? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1673.048s">Can</a>  I turn to the police? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1674.348s">Can</a>  I turn to fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1675.228s">Can</a>  I turn to a medical resource? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1677.409s">Can</a>  I turn to a state resource? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1678.89s">What</a>  can I apply for? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1679.77s">And</a>  it becomes confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1681.95s">And</a>  a lot of this stuff affects all of us, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1685.431s">If</a>  we're thinking about public health, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1687.432s">We</a>  are all healthier if all of us have access to services. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1690.955s">We're</a>  all safer if all of us feel comfortable reporting, you know, reporting incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1696.66s">And</a>  so I think it's very important that we support this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1700.004s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1700.604s">Councilor</a>  Biss. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1702.105s">Vice</a>  President Biss.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1704.087s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1705.488s">I'll</a>  be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1706.469s">I</a>  just wanted to add that I think it's important to add our voice to this chorus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1710.573s">Anyone</a>  familiar with the State House knows that it is <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1713.008s">joint</a>  rule 10 week, which means it's the last week, unless extensions are requested for bills to be reported out of their committees to be considered this session. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1724.857s">And</a>  as everyone has said, all the reasons that this is incredibly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1728.44s">And</a>  there's a really broad coalition of folks from, you know, progressive legislators and I believe all four of our legislative delegation to the police chiefs who would find this to be incredibly valuable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1743.388s">So</a>  I'm glad we're taking this up.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1747.591s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1750.618s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1751.959s">I</a>  certainly have no problem supporting this measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1754.861s">I</a>  would like to remind everybody that no piece of legislation comes out the way it goes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1760.225s">And</a>  when we look at what's going on at the State House, we'll see that there are thousands and thousands of bills that are filed every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1766.15s">And</a>  if this council is going to be focused on our goals and priorities, I think our goals and priorities should be that that fall within our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1773.095s">However,</a>  this is a meritorious resolution that I will have no problem supporting this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1777.838s">However,</a>  I do want us to earn the side of caution and to move forward in a fashion where we're not taking up items that we are dealing with the deal with the state legislature when we elected a state legislature to do that for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1788.648s">I</a>  think we have a very capable representation up on Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1792.511s">And</a>  if we're going to be taking up state items and state bills every week, it's going to make for very long and unproductive sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1800.539s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly will support this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1804.583s">However,</a>  I'd hate to see this become a trend of every week that we're sitting here, voicing support for this piece of legislation and that piece of legislation that's outside of scope and purview of authority.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1849.344s">Yes,</a>  I mean the primitive, none of the negative on passes to 2060 offered by Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1856.368s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Paula Keefe, Linda Pittorino, and Patty Wright on their retirement from the Consumer Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1866.417s">Through</a>  their efforts, Medford consumers have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years through the work of these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1874.264s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the administration provide the council with a plan on how this office will be kept open going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1883.232s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1884.708s">I</a>  wanna thank the three women who've been there 30 plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1889.149s">I</a>  think Paul has been there maybe close to 40 for the hard work that they've done that have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars to consumers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1898.791s">I</a>  am a little concerned that all three women decided to retire at the same time, which for me sends up a little bit of a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1910.133s">And</a>  now the office is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1912.9s">I</a>  would hope that the mayor work with the Attorney General's office to get that office open again as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1920.484s">So</a>  again, I wanna thank the woman for the years of service to our community, but I also wanna ask the mayor to please get that office open. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1931.389s">They</a>  do great work for the consumers of Medford and some of the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1938.312s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1992.021s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President and through you to Linda, Paula and Patty. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1997.538s">who</a>  I've been fortunate enough to develop a great friendship with over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2001.76s">Thank</a>  you for the work that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2004.381s">I've</a>  been a strong advocate for the Consumer Office since my election to the City Council, and I've always felt that they were the unsung heroes in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2012.806s">These</a>  individuals are trained by the Attorney General to handle consumer complaints and disputes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2019.109s">They</a>  do an excellent job in resolving matters of <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2025.195s">anything</a>  from scams to the cold cut machine, not being accurate at the supermarket and you overpaying, um, they've done an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2033.882s">And,</a>  um, one thing I know about the three of these women is that they really loved what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2038.345s">They</a>  really loved their job so much so that, um, when the state grant was cut, um, the ladies worked out a job sharing schedule so that nobody would lose their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2051.676s">They</a>  were truly a group of people that cared about each other and worked together as a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2056.238s">This</a>  office was created in 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2058.64s">It</a>  was created as the benefit consumer commission and its first commissioner was the late great Michael Callahan, our governor's Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2067.764s">And</a>  Michael took great pride in this office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2070.746s">And</a>  he was one of his greatest accomplishments in his 50 years of government service. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2074.828s">And</a>  when you look at what's going on from a human resource standpoint in city hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2084.032s">Look</a>  it, three individuals with 90 years of combined service don't just walk out the door on the same day because they're happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2091.575s">All</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2092.536s">I</a>  wish them the best of luck in their retirement, but we need to get to the bottom of what's going on in Medford City Hall, because it's getting to be embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2099.899s">I</a>  heard this morning another employee was escorted off the premises and told that they need to submit to a psychological evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2107.562s">I've</a>  been told that these three individuals were told that they need to be replaced with younger and more energetic employees, which led <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2113.985s">to</a>  really a retirement in duress. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2117.848s">So</a>  while I don't want to rain on the parade of the great work that these three individuals have done in the community, I also think that we as a council owe it to them to investigate as to what's going on and to why the three of them would have left on the same day so abruptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2133.861s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2136.503s">I</a>  thank them for their service and I congratulate them on their retirement, wish them the best and let them know that they always have a friend in me.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2143.598s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2144.198s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2145.298s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2146.378s">And</a>  again, I echo the sentiments of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2149.079s">I</a>  think that we had three dedicated people in a very important office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2152.98s">And</a>  I think that when you talk about our senior citizens, the most vulnerable members of our community, they were the ones that really needed this office more than anyone, because they are the ones that were being manipulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2167.862s">And</a>  having this office in place really put <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2172.797s">someone</a>  that they could reach out to at any time to make sure that they're protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2177.007s">And</a>  if I, if I'm not mistaken, I believe the Attorney General has <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2182.731s">has</a>  acknowledged their office many times on the job well done because of their excellence. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2190.697s">So</a>  again, it's gonna be sad losing them, but thanking them for everything they've done for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2198.863s">And</a>  when you can do something, when you walk out the door, knowing that you left a positive mark, I think that you should keep your head high and really applaud what you've done for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2211.433s">As</a>  one Councilor, I applaud them and thank them for everything they've done.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2216.714s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2219.915s">Oh,</a>  on the motion by Councilor Caraviello-Viello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2223.475s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2271.851s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2272.832s">I</a>  wanted to first note my colleagues' concerns about us introducing these resolutions in support of state legislation, but I wanted to say, just in full transparency, that on my end, I had a conversation with Representative Christine Barber about this, and she asked me to come to the council to ask for our support on this specific bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2299.008s">And</a>  this is a good bill because I think it would, or let me just lay it out very, very clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2306.593s">This</a>  bill would electrify MBTA and RTA, commuter rail service, and the bus fleet by the year 2035. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2317.86s">Studies</a>  have shown that this bill would reduce the CO2 emissions by millions of pounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2323.003s">And</a>  this bill would also create a standardized assessment system to measure air quality in our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2329.487s">This</a>  bill would benefit Medford because we have, we have bus service in the city, we have a commuter rail station that goes through West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2340.054s">And</a>  air quality is all has always been an issue when it comes to transit when it comes to bus and commuter rail service. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2348.242s">And</a>  so this is, you know, this aligns with our communities values aligns with addressing our communities concerns and aligns with our communities already stated goals.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2363.817s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, thank you, Councilor Tseng for putting this forward and just want to echo all of that and also add that I think one of the reasons this is you know important and relevant to our community here in Medford is, as Councilor Tseng mentioned this bill would require that electric bus fleet to be expedited for routes that go through environmental justice communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2381.665s">including</a>  some of our neighbors in Somerville and Everett, and so adjacent communities close to those cities in Medford or those that share bus routes through those neighborhoods would also reap the benefits of this priority electrification for those transit routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2395.775s">So</a>  respectfully ask for our fellow councilors support for this bill, especially as Vice President Bears mentioned during this final week of pushing bills out of subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2407.323s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2407.703s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2416.229s">Thank</a>  you vice president bears Thank you, Mr. President, I just wanted to know, and add on to what Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng said you know, this goes beyond the actual buses traveling and our fleets traveling because we have things like the fellows way bus garage where I've been talking with, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2432.335s">one</a>  resident and many residents are impacted by the diesel exhaust that goes on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2436.657s">So</a>  these are residents that are very close to the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2439.178s">They're</a>  affected by the emissions that happen in that space frequently and go right into their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2444.84s">So</a>  I think the councilors for bringing this forward, I fully support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2448.161s">And</a>  I think this is something that impacts Medford in a number of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2451.742s">And</a>  I hope it's something that the state actually advances on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2454.743s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2455.084s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2457.304s">Vice</a>  President Bizz.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2459.585s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2460.606s">Um,</a>  and that's exactly what I was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2463.268s">I</a>  just want to add, um, that while some of the efforts of by the council and our legislators were for a time effective at making sure that idling and bright lights and loud noises were not occurring late night. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2477.897s">Over</a>  at the Fellsway bus yard in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2480.879s">That</a>  problem has recurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2482.521s">I</a>  have been working with the city clerk to contact representatives at the MBTA <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2487.914s">And</a>  I also know that Representative Paul Donato and Mayor Lungo-Koehn have also been trying to work with the MBTA to make it so that we don't have 75 diesel buses idling at 11pm with bright floodlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2502.121s">It's</a>  creating pretty serious impacts on the surrounding community in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2508.264s">So</a>  hopefully, obviously this would address it in the long term, also hoping that we can address it in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2514.226s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2520.069s">Does</a>  the sponsor of this resolution have any idea if this will impact the MBTA assessment on the city of medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2530.034s">I</a>  don't know it sounds like it's going to cost about a billion bucks and pretty sure we're going to be caught paying for it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2538.368s">The</a>  city of method is one of the hot one, I think it's number four or five and assessment by the T in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts so we pay a pretty, pretty steep price to have to see running through our community.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2549.496s">I'm</a>  not aware that it is the assessment for any of the impacted communities at all I think that this is a statewide plan for procuring and implementing in a staggered way the electrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2559.443s">of</a>  the buses, the bus charging stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2562.304s">To</a>  my knowledge from reading the text of the bill, didn't mention anything about the assessment of the community's fees to the MBTA.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2571.068s">That</a>  would probably come from the MBTA advisory board if the measure passed and was ever ended up funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2578.572s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2579.632s">Number</a>  two, the governor's budget has come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2583.334s">The</a>  governor's budget is not that pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2586.8s">Um,</a>  again, if we're going to be sending letters up to the state house, I think the letters that we should be sending up to the state house, they give us more chapter 90 money, give us more local aid money, give us more money for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2597.065s">Um,</a>  and you know, when you give everybody a, when you ask, when you ask for two slices and you get a half a slice, you can't complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2605.988s">Um,</a>  but if he asked for one slice and you only, you know, you only give them an option to give you one slice, then, um, you gotta, you're in a better position of power from negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2614.032s">Um,</a>  so I'd hate to see us be in a situation where we're. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2616.948s">sending</a>  letters up to every single chairman up in the state house, asking for this and asking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2620.97s">And</a>  at the end of the day, we're passing a ceremonious legislation and we're not cashing in on our ability to get the big bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2628.913s">Um,</a>  you know, it's a great, great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2631.074s">You</a>  know, something that certainly, uh, uh, sounds like a pie in the sky, um, possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2638.397s">Um,</a>  but you know, it's going to have to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2640.718s">It's</a>  not going to be funded, um, through the forward funding mechanism that they have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2645.588s">through</a>  the sales tax because it's going to cost way too much to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2648.67s">So</a>  it's going to come down to an assessment on our community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2651.251s">So</a>  there will be a financial impact there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2653.132s">As</a>  Councilor Caraviello did say, our community is super assessed when it comes to the MBTA and our services are lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2659.816s">We've</a>  seen service cuts across the board from bus service to commuter rail service to express bus service. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2665.379s">So,</a>  you know, that's something to think about, you know, are we going to ask for more, pay for more and get less. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2670.743s">Is</a>  that something we want? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2672.345s">But</a>  it also has environmental and economical impacts that will, you know, make a difference here in our community from a public health standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2682.034s">So</a>  it's something we need to think about in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2684.456s">That's</a>  why we have a state legislature.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2689.62s">Just</a>  Mr. President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2694.01s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor nice point. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2695.831s">You</a>  know, I was looking at the fiscal 23 cherry sheet, which is the basically proposed inflows and outflows of state money into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2704.776s">And</a>  our MBTA assessment was just over $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2708.339s">But</a>  we are sending over $9 million a year out of this community to fund private charter schools, you know, and only getting $1 million back. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2717.884s">definitely</a>  also agree about the issues with chapter 90 being level funded and local aid being, you know, two and a half percent again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2727.392s">So</a>  there's a lot of things that need to be fixed, but certainly I think we can all on this council agree that addressing the charter school funding formula, which is draining, you know, a huge chunk of our city revenue would be a priority as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2742.924s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice presidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2744.725s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2745.566s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2747.622s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Tseng Councilor Collins, seconded by second, seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2756.949s">Mr.</a>  Clerk please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2764.455s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2765.856s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2767.638s">Council</a>  calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2768.579s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2769.419s">Council</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2777.51s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2778.631s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2780.512s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2781.313s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2782.594s">President</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[NqJnNNyD4Uw_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2783.634s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2785.556s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2786.336s">Well,</a>  when you primitive three negative motion passes to 2006 to offer my council saying be resolved that the Medford City Council so celebrate Black History Month and support episode community city government schools to combat racism and white supremacy and teach black history.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2805.121s">Yeah,</a>  um, many members of our community every shot to me over the course of campaign but also as a Councilor, asking to see our city, you know, even showed the symbolic steps to toward towards supporting diversity and equity in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2821.987s">And</a>  so this is one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2825.028s">those</a>  pieces, those resolutions that reflect what constituents have been telling me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2830.571s">I</a>  think, you know, this aligns with our community's values. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2833.093s">You</a>  know, we are an anti-racist community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2835.474s">We</a>  are a diverse community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2837.575s">And</a>  I think our community has been making a lot of steps forward in terms of talking about Black history, addressing racism in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2848.921s">And,</a>  you know, I think we've made strides <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2851.883s">together</a>  and talking earnestly and honestly about the two ideologies, racism and white supremacy, whose historical and sociological effects seep into the structures that shape our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2865.058s">You</a>  know, these aren't things that are, you know, these <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2870.144s">are</a>  targeted at any community in particular, you know, it's not just it's not just you know it's not a white person issue this is something that you know happens in the Asian community as well that I know very well of. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2882.214s">And</a>  so this is about all of us kind of coming together saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2886.837s">telling</a>  history as it is because it's important to learn from our past, it's important to celebrate our past as well, because that's where we find unity is in telling the truth about about our city and about our history and, you know, looking positively towards the future to see how we move on.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2904.492s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2913.54s">Yes,</a>  I'd like to thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2917.102s">You</a>  know, I think you said it very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2919.444s">Black</a>  history and Medford's history are inextricably woven. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2922.586s">So</a>  I'd be proud to see Black History Month be celebrated even more loudly in our community and to have this be a moment for recommitting to investing in black voices, black futures, standing together against bigotry and systemic injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2937.316s">And</a>  I'd move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2939.138s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2939.658s">Vice</a>  President Biz.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2941.659s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2943.245s">Um,</a>  and, uh, in a moment, if my fellow Councilor would be so amenable to an amendment, I will propose one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2950.093s">But,</a>  um, you know, I think especially at this moment in time, as we're seeing the banning of books, the banning of thought, the banning of debate, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2961.338s">intentionally</a>  put forward across this country and in media to constrict and define our history in a way that is untruthful. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2972.284s">I</a>  think it's important for us, as a place that doesn't do that, to make it very loud and clear why we don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2979.688s">Because</a>  that's a very dangerous and corrosive ideology that's <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2988.396s">spreading</a>  and moving through our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2992.48s">So</a>  just to be more specific in this resolution, I'd like to amend the resolution to put a comma after the phrase to combat racism and then replace the words and white supremacy with the following phrase. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3009.175s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, let me know when you're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3017.841s">It</a>  looks like a ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3019.422s">And</a>  the phrase is to address the growing danger of white supremacy and white supremacist ideology as well publicized by the United States Department of Justice, Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and other leading watchdogs, comma. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3040.051s">And</a>  I put forward that amendment hopefully with the support of the sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3044.875s">just</a>  to be specific about what's happening right now and why it's important for us to speak out about the true reality of what's happened and also where we need to go.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3060.163s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3061.883s">So,</a>  Councilor Scott-Bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3064.744s">If</a>  I can, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3066.264s">I</a>  had a nice discussion with Councilor Tsengin in support of this resolution, but I will also share some comments that were shared with me from residents that were a little concerned that the understanding of white supremacy <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3089.285s">in</a>  the inference that there are running rampant of white members of our community in white supremacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3101.83s">And</a>  it really paints a picture <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3106.409s">negative</a>  tone of unity in that light. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3108.53s">I</a>  think that I support totally support the celebrating a black history month. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3115.654s">I</a>  support that the city is city government, the schools, we combat racism and teach black history. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3122.098s">I</a>  know that in my conversations with different <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3124.899s">different</a>  educators and as we talk moving this topic forward and not just being just talk like it was mentioned with some members of the community that I had discussions with and putting our money where our mouth is and asking the city to ask the school committee to look at bringing back civics. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3147.575s">So</a>  everybody understands where we are and a quarter of that civics lesson <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3155.616s">Bing!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3156.742s">the</a>  focal point to black history in Medford and black history. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3159.824s">I</a>  think that's something that I've mentioned in the past in moving steps forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3164.367s">So</a>  it's not just talk, it's not just rhetoric, but I know that I asked council's saying to see if we could find other wording when it came to white supremacy, because unfortunately in some people in this community that it doesn't unify, it's really dividing our community in the sense that <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3186.502s">people</a>  don't look at it the way that it's addressed, because they think that every white person is being dressed as a white supremacist. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3196.193s">And</a>  I think that's not the message you're trying to send in our conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3200.017s">And</a>  I like what Councilor Bears, Vice President Beas mentioned that the intent <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3208.426s">might</a>  be more defined so our residents can understand that this isn't something that you put through to divide or made it so that it's one person against another. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3220.999s">It's</a>  a unified feeling that we want Medford to be exactly what we've been trying to work for, and that's a community of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3229.287s">again</a>  if we could in and changing that I would support it if not unfortunately I would just vote present on this because I do other pieces in this this resolution I support a thousand percent and I would I would also make it uh <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3244.391s">you</a>  know, asked to amend it and to reach out to the school committee and asked to bring back civics and adding a whole block in method black history because we have plenty of it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3258.178s">And</a>  I think that this is how we're going to start the change <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3263.469s">at</a>  the younger level where people understand where the black history method was I mean that I've talked to one of my closest friends who is educated man of color and said that with the with he would love to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3280.818s">given</a>  the opportunity to go to the post office when the concern was with the mural, with our slaves being in shackles. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3289.062s">And</a>  this is what everybody sees when they go to the post office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3292.924s">And</a>  he made it a point to me and said, George, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3295.626s">We</a>  would love to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3297.106s">Leave</a>  it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3298.087s">Let</a>  our kids see what this history was about and how devastating it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3305.551s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3308.383s">using</a>  that type of philosophy, where you look at the Royal House and the slave wall, and we'll talk about so many benefits and so many educational points we can use in this community, that bringing that class back and use that as a jumping off point to really educate our community, I would support it a thousand percent.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3330.49s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3332.05s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3334.431s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3335.831s">I</a>  think it's important when we look at this, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3338.267s">resolution</a>  what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3339.988s">It</a>  says celebrate and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3342.029s">Now,</a>  when we talk about the debate and discussion that we've had over a resolution that's asked for us to celebrate and support something versus what we did in our first four meetings, I think we spent 3 million bucks in our first four meetings and we've talked less about it than we've talked about this topic right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3356.819s">Okay,</a>  so it's a resolution that's symbolic in nature that says let's celebrate and support this unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3365.184s">And</a>  I certainly don't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3367.542s">But</a>  what I do have a problem with is that the budget has been passed now for quite a bit of time and we still don't have a director of diversity in the school department or on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3378.648s">So,</a>  you know, when we talk about things, let's really talk about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3382.77s">Let's,</a>  let's, let's, let's put the issues out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3385.151s">Let's</a>  lay it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3386.692s">You</a>  know, we still don't have a diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3389.394s">We</a>  still don't have a diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3391.135s">It's</a>  been three years, no diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3396.742s">So</a>  if we're going to make the commitment, let's really make the commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3399.083s">If</a>  we're going to talk about it, let's walk about it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3402.464s">That's</a>  where I'm coming from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3403.784s">So</a>  I certainly support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3405.145s">I</a>  have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3405.945s">Like</a>  I said, it's a resolution that asks us to support something. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3410.327s">I</a>  have no problem doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3411.987s">Um,</a>  so for that reason, I'll be voting for that this evening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3417.089s">Uh,</a>  and if I can make a, um, I agree with council Scott, I think, uh, um, I think the languages, uh, could be, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3426.371s">change</a>  a little bit, and I would support it with the white supremacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3431.732s">I</a>  think that might be good, might be taking a little time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3435.433s">Councilor</a>  Layton is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3436.634s">We're</a>  three years without a diversity director in the city, and that's something that we've asked for, both in the budget and I think last year that was part of our council priorities was the diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3451.757s">And</a>  nothing has happened, we don't have a diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3455.053s">on</a>  the high schools, on the school side either. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3457.054s">So</a>  again, you know, we, you know, we want to talk, but you know, we can talk all we want, but if we, if we don't have anyone to enact these things, we go nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3464.036s">So</a>  again, again, I'm with council Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3467.337s">I,</a>  if, you know, if you could change that language a little bit, I would be, I would have, I would support it also.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3472.779s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3473.839s">On</a>  that point, Mr. President, I think, you know, when we look at traditionally this administration's personnel functions and the way that they go about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3482.096s">They</a>  haven't had any problem bringing back all three employees, retired employees, to perform these functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3487.418s">We</a>  looked at what went on in the treasurer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3489.339s">We're</a>  looking at what's going on in the CFO's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3491.859s">I</a>  mean, we're bringing back part-time retirees to fill these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3495.901s">Why</a>  aren't we doing that in the diversity office too? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3498.602s">Why</a>  is that office less important than these other offices?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3504.225s">I</a>  would say that that was something we fought for to make that two separate positions of last year, not one position so constant saying, I'll defer to President Morell first.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3517.889s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, I just want to thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward, and I appreciate the language as well as the amendment by Councilor bears I just want to note that the I believe the West better Community Center is putting together a full month of programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3529.792s">for</a>  Black History Month this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3531.153s">So</a>  if people just wanna keep their eyes out for that, and that is a great way to engage as a community and learn about our history and our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3539.738s">So</a>  I just wanna put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3541.259s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3543.12s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3544.221s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I'm happy to accept the amendments as proposed by Councilor Bears and the one on civics as proposed by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3552.926s">Okay,</a>  any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3555.308s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may just add to Councilor Knight's point, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3560.792s">that</a>  there is a job posting for that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3564.954s">So</a>  to anyone here or anyone watching tonight, please spread that job posting for the diversity director far and wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3572.599s">I</a>  do think it is urgent that we get someone hired and I'm hopeful that that will happen quickly.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3577.922s">Eight</a>  months. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3582.384s">Eight</a>  months, we're gonna be on the next fiscal year's budget pretty soon.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3587.895s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Tseng as amended by Councilor Bears and amended by Councilor Scarpelli seconded by.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3596.142s">If</a>  we can just if the city clerk can read Councilor Bears's amendment over. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3605.39s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Tseng for entertaining that for the other residents that reached out.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3615.503s">Council</a>  business amendment inserts a comma after the word to combat racism, and then adds in the words to address the growing danger of white supremacy and white supremacist ideology as well publicized by the US Department of Justice, Southern Poverty Law Center anti defamation league, and other leading watchdogs, and then as a comma and it and then it reverts to, and to teach black history.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3643.658s">Okay,</a>  man.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3647.62s">I</a>  was able to copy down the Councilor Scarpelli wants wants to reach out to the school committee to ask them to teach civics, but there was something at the end that I didn't pick up on the microphone to bring to bring civics back to the public schools, again at the high school level, and part of their curriculum</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3663.434s">be</a>  a quarter that teaches the methods black history and black history. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3670.756s">So</a>  I think it's important that we see that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3677.377s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Tseng as amended by councilor bears and amended by councilor Scarpelli, seconded by seconded by councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3686.799s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3694.829s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3695.13s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3695.832s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3706.02s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3706.9s">Yes,</a>  I mean affirmative negative motion passes to 2064 offered by council saying we resolve the Medford City Council celebrate Lunar New Year and reaffirm our solidarity with Asians Americans and method given an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, bigotry and violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3723.149s">And</a>  given that what may be a difficult holiday season for those unable to visit a relative. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3729.532s">And</a>  if I could say to our <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3732.025s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, happy new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3733.726s">And</a>  to all the Asian families in the city of Medford, happy new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3737.829s">I'm</a>  sorry if I said it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3739.21s">I</a>  hope my English is okay.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3744.173s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3745.333s">Again,</a>  this is in line with residents who want to see our city more openly embracing our diversity and our different communities here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3753.759s">Lunar</a>  New Year is the most important holiday for many Asian communities here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3759.242s">And,</a>  you know, it's not, not just the Chinese holiday, it's one that's celebrated by many other communities as well by Koreans, by Vietnamese Americans, by Tibetan Americans, by Taiwanese Americans, and the list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3774.922s">You</a>  know, I wanted to note that this, this New Year's might be <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3779.126s">particularly</a>  difficult, you know, we're still dealing with the pandemic, and it's traditional, it's kind of like an Asian Thanksgiving where you go into your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3788.813s">And,</a>  you know, for a lot of families are not able to make it back for, you know, be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3794.297s">they're</a>  sick, it's difficult to, the difficult situations to leave the country or the difficult situations to get into another country. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3803.765s">And</a>  so, you know, I think it's especially important for us to kind of lift each other up in this moment and to celebrate with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3810.471s">A</a>  holiday which, you know, a holiday season which might be a little bit tougher for folks now.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3819.775s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3821.056s">Thank</a>  you counseling bringing this forward and know that I did, I did have some alarming questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3828.723s">I</a>  had a Asian American family reach out to me later earlier today and asked if if method is dealing with recently increase anti a crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3840.57s">as</a>  they read the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3841.691s">So</a>  I did call, try to reach out to the chiefs and are you familiar, has something happened that we don't know because I think it's important that if it is, we make that public and that's something that we have to reaffirm publicly, so.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3854.9s">I</a>  believe that last year there were there were reported incidents of this city council in the last session.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3861.805s">We</a>  know that.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3862.465s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3863.326s">I</a>  think you know this is a general rise, that's consistent with that trend that we saw last year, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3873.372s">Medford</a>  is a safe community, we are safe for Asian Americans but there are moments where it might be difficult and I think it's important for our city council to, to note that there are definitely, you know, anti Asian incidents that are often gone on reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3890.635s">a</a>  lot of people don't know about our city's reporting resources, be it with the police or with our city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3899.4s">And</a>  so I also want to make that clear just for all of our residents here that there are different ways to report hate crimes or hate incidents if that happens to you, God forbid. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3911.427s">And</a>  yeah, I would say that <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3916.495s">My</a>  short answer is that there's a general increase in the Boston metro area.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3922.76s">And</a>  yes, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3923.921s">I</a>  appreciate bringing that clarity because I think that, again, this is an Asian family that I'm very close with and said, George, have you heard something? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3931.206s">And</a>  I was trying to get the answer to that, but reflecting back to last year's resolution, I appreciate that clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3938.151s">So</a>  they're not alarmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3941.594s">And</a>  again, I support this a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3943.715s">I</a>  think it's very important that <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3946.107s">And</a>  again, as we talked to this constituent, that's one of the things they talked about is the Asian community finds it very difficult sometimes to stand up and call someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3958.493s">And</a>  a lot of times it's something that they've taken and we won't take that in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3961.995s">So,</a>  and that's what I shared with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3965.276s">So</a>  I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3966.637s">And</a>  again, happy new year.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3968.258s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3970.079s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4010.361s">Mr.</a>  President, what Councilor Morell, Villes, and Knight don't see is the amazing jacket that Justin's wearing right now.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4018.865s">I</a>  actually can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4020.285s">It</a>  took me a little bit.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4086.175s">Mr.</a>  President, I can offer a summary.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4088.396s">I'm</a>  sorry, Councilor?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4090.257s">I</a>  can offer a summary.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4091.277s">Okay,</a>  we have quite a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4093.979s">I</a>  wanna hear this summary.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4095.72s">It's</a>  quite lengthy, so- Rick, it might be easier if you read it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4099.902s">I'll</a>  give it to Councilor Zang. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4106.852s">can</a>  give us his description of the 18 paragraphs here in a shorter version.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4115.453s">Well,</a>  so essentially this, this resolution is about the practice of data disaggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4123.315s">And</a>  so I'll give a little bit of history on it, explain the policy, explain the policy and why I've written it this way, and explain why I'm doing it now and then explain why, where where we should go as a city with it with the resolution part. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4139.4s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4142.357s">Going</a>  about the history, the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, in 1997 created five racial categories for government agencies to report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4153.882s">Now</a>  this is a standard that different government agencies in our country are expected to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4159.865s">But</a>  they did allow this guidance, give states and municipalities the prerogative to break our data down even further and to be more specific in the way that we report our data. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4173.668s">And</a>  so this is something that, particularly in civil rights circles, in Asian American activist circles, and activist circles for different racial groups, this is something that's particularly important because <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4190.712s">Racial</a>  data informs how we make policy decisions, it informs how we use funds, how we target communities in pandemic outreach and kind of different government city services as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4205.396s">And</a>  I know for certain that our city has been working, has been using racial data to help <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4213.818s">help</a>  solve the vaccine gap issue to help address disparities in the pandemic response. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4222.007s">Now,</a>  so basically what this policy is, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4227.09s">We</a>  would, instead of, for example, take Asian Americans, instead of reporting it as solely Asian Americans, we will break that down into different communities, different racial and ethnic groups that the census has come up with to better help us identify trends within different racial groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4244.514s">The</a>  way that we currently report data actually covers up and papers over a lot of inequities within communities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4254.24s">When</a>  you look at the poverty rate for Asian Americans in this country, I don't think you would expect that the poverty rate for Vietnamese Americans is 2.5 times the national average, that the rate of poverty for Hmong Americans is three times the national average. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4269.848s">When</a>  you look at English proficiency rates, you'll find that while English proficiency rates for Vietnamese Americans is low, those for Indian Americans are high. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4280.019s">And</a>  so these are things that just don't come out of the research that our city is doing, that cities generally in our country are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4289.088s">They</a>  affect the city services right because if you have, if our city's targeting, you know, we need to provide city services in this language or publish this brochure in another language. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4299.535s">We're</a>  not thinking about fiscally is it actually does it actually make fiscal sense to spend that money on that translation not on another translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4307.319s">Does</a>  it, does it, you know, our is our targeting of one community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4312.141s">Does</a>  that actually make sense fiscally and in terms of where we're spending our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4316.502s">And</a>  so, this, I'm this resolution calls for city administration to cause for us to ask our city ministrations to disaggregate data. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4327.946s">because</a>  I know this will take a while, I know it will take planning and it'll take resources over a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4335.91s">That's</a>  why I've asked our cities to submit a report looking at long-term, what are the costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4341.492s">What</a>  are the benefits? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4344.034s">How</a>  else can we kind of affect change in data collection and data analysis? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4350.757s">How</a>  can we make it fairer and more transparent? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4353.138s">And</a>  so I think this revolution starts the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4357.64s">that</a>  will help us plan over a long term, what, you know, what, what our city needs to do to what does our city need to do in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4372.833s">disaggregate</a>  our data? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4374.814s">How</a>  do we get the community involved in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4377.074s">How</a>  can we get different departments involved in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4379.295s">This</a>  is really about starting that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4382.615s">And,</a>  you know, given our conversations about Asian American activism, I think that it is our Asian American issues in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4390.537s">I</a>  think it is a good time to also back that up with some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4394.798s">And</a>  so this is, this is the resolution, essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4399.94s">And</a>  I'm happy to answer questions.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4402.059s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4406.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4407.183s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4409.024s">This</a>  was very interesting to read through and learn about, and I appreciate your rundown of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4416.149s">This</a>  is something I'd very much like to see our administration work towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4419.752s">I</a>  think it's very aligned with our social justice roadmap, our goals of becoming an ever more equitable community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4425.536s">And</a>  as you very helpfully described, disaggregating data into more specific <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4430.199s">national,</a>  racial, ethnic groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4432.46s">This</a>  arms us with better data to act upon through policy, through planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4436.943s">You</a>  know, essentially the point of having all of this demographic information is so we can look beyond the line of best fit and see what's underneath it for really specific populations, you know, and respond appropriately through our governance and our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4449.329s">So</a>  I'd love to see a response from the administration about what it would take to adopt this improved data, improved reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4455.373s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4455.693s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4458.189s">I</a>  should also note, I forgot to mention that the reason why this is worded the way it is, is because this is taking from city council resolutions bits and pieces that apply to us, our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4471.892s">I've</a>  taken from different communities across the country and from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as well, because there is a piece of legislation in the state legislature that is talking about this issue as well, which will affect <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4488.216s">which</a>  would help if passed, which would help our city's data collection system.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4493.08s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4493.761s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Bez.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4499.666s">Happy</a>  to second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4500.647s">And</a>  just one small amendment, if the city administration could also consider disaggregation of Middle Eastern and North African identities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4514.178s">That's</a>  one, basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4517.251s">several</a>  censuses ago, the census decided that if you're from North Africa or the Middle East, you're white. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4523.574s">And</a>  that has presented a huge issue in terms of data collection and disaggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4529.536s">So</a>  just if I could add that small friendly amendment to this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4535.538s">Are</a>  you a member? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4536.659s">Yes,</a>  I'm a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4537.879s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Saint, as amended by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4545.79s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4903.095s">Which</a>  is the first paper's positions?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4907.982s">The</a>  first paper is the positions including the federal funds manager that we approved under the prior council in December.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4917.506s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4917.706s">I</a>  voted no on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4918.787s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4919.227s">So</a>  what else was on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4923.168s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4927.81s">So</a>  Mr. Clerk, we're going to take those off the table first.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4934.028s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4935.629s">Mr.</a>  President, can I request that we keep these on the table for one more week, just so I can have an opportunity to review the paperwork again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4942.331s">I'm</a>  a little confused as to what's before us this evening and where we're taking it off the table without the papers in front of us and just like for the professional courtesy to have one more week to take a review.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4953.316s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Mike to table this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4958.478s">It's</a>  more of a request, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4960.558s">It's</a>  more of a request.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4964.786s">able</a>  this to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4965.906s">We</a>  have the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4966.506s">The</a>  first council calls.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4968.247s">I</a>  just want to, of course, if any Councilors need another week to review it, I don't want to rush the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4973.789s">But</a>  being as a lot of the positions under these ordinances are related to public health, the public health nurse, food security specialist positions are included in these amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4984.553s">These</a>  are positions that I've heard that the community is really clamoring to be filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4988.336s">I</a>  think it's really urgent that we get these processed, be able to hire for them really as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4993.159s">These</a>  are some positions that are really addressing urgent needs in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4996.921s">If</a>  it's possible even to, you know, maybe review the documents in this meeting and then move forward, you know, I don't want to be ham-fisted about this, but if there's any way to move forward with a measure of urgency, I'd really, you know, appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5010.01s">Just</a>  say no and push the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5010.991s">I'll</a>  vote against it and you guys can get what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5013.847s">I</a>  mean, at the end of the day, when we're talking about urgency, we've had the diversity director's position that's been vacant friggin' for 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5021.491s">So,</a>  you know, I think that, you know, when we're gonna sit here and we're gonna worry about urgency, I don't think that that urgency is shared all the time with colleagues in government across the hallway.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5033.338s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5035.419s">Vice</a>  President Biss.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5037.14s">I'm</a>  of the opinion that waiting one additional week would not be <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5042.675s">the</a>  city and moving these forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5045.898s">So</a>  I'm happy to wait one more week and take these off the table at that time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5049.981s">And</a>  the only reason I ask is because I voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5052.884s">Differently</a>  on both papers, so I just want to be sure that I can have the opportunity again to review them and be consistent in my efforts as I go forward in the</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5066.84s">a</a>  motion by Councilor Collins to take these two papers off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5071.301s">We</a>  have a request by Councilor Knight that was seconded by Councilor Bears to hold these for one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5078.824s">So</a>  Councilor Collins, you wanna rescind your order?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5080.704s">Just</a>  withdraw the motion and we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5082.645s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5087.566s">Is</a>  there a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5089.447s">Is</a>  there a way to motion for these to put on next week?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5091.507s">Just</a>  withdraw the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5093.548s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5093.968s">If</a>  you withdraw,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5097.668s">If</a>  you just withdraw the motion doesn't go anywhere.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5100.391s">So</a>  you want to bring it back up next week.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5104.274s">Bring</a>  it back next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5105.255s">So</a>  Council Collins has withdrawn our motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5109.579s">So</a>  public participation, anybody want to speak on public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5115.425s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, anybody speaking on public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5119.129s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5120.803s">Before</a>  we leave, before we do the records, I received a bunch of calls today from people at the high school complaining about no heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5132.387s">If</a>  the administration could send us something in the next day or so telling us what's being done to address the heat issues at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5142.51s">Students</a>  are being told to wear jackets because there's no heat in certain rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5149.548s">If</a>  we can get some kind of report in the next day or so, what the problem is and if it's being addressed.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5156.774s">I</a>  just wanted to add my voice to the chorus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5158.756s">I</a>  know this is a difficult issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5160.457s">I</a>  know it takes resources, but I was just at the high school last week for a meeting and many students and teachers did bring that up to me as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5168.273s">So</a>  if the administration could get us, send us an email the next day, so it'd be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5173.817s">So,</a>  records of January 25th, 2020, do it, pass the council, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5180.962s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, how did you find those records?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5182.743s">I</a>  find the records in order and I move to approve.</p>
