1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:07,056
capacity in constituencies for sustainable cities, neighborhoods, and initiatives.

2
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:14,441
Most recently, Dave served as a deputy of Echo Innovation for the Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation.

3
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,803
That's in Dorchester, for those of you that are new to the program.

4
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:24,608
My wife and I lived in that area for a number of years, not too far from the Dorchester Courthouse.

5
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:29,251
He currently serves as an associate park commissioner for the city of Boston.

6
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:33,734
and served on the mayor's Go Boston 2030 task force.

7
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:45,223
Dave received Clean Water Action's 2014 John O'Connor Award for grassroots leadership and Walk Boston's 2016 Golden Shoe Award.

8
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:49,148
So thank you all for coming.

9
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:49,929
Thank you, Dave.

10
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,371
Thank you, Daria.

11
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,512
Thank you, Mariangeli.

12
00:00:53,534 --> 00:01:00,343
So as we're still in the waning days of Poetry Month for 2023, I have to at least go there one time.

13
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:06,760
Now, you all know me, and I've written a lot of poetry that speaks to the legacy of the Mystic River in greater Medford.

14
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:15,024
One particular piece was, in many ways, inspired by my friendship with Patrick Heron and the folks at MIRA.

15
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,085
It takes a little time to unfold, so bear with me.

16
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,946
This piece is called, A River Runs Through It.

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,830
Our valley is a place of legacy.

18
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:28,813
Monuments of wood and bronze and stone.

19
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:31,276
Stories we tell and make our own.

20
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:34,379
Colonial towns that stand the test of time.

21
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:37,783
Old graveyards that reckon our lost prime.

22
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,686
Thoughts that bring a poet to a rhyme.

23
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,608
And a river runs through it.

24
00:01:43,598 --> 00:02:01,193
Our valley is a place of history, heroes that fought in foreign wars, Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Corps, pride and service that extends their tours, courage seeping, sweating through their pores, death and loss that bravery ignores, and a river runs through it.

25
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,430
Our valley is a place of misery.

26
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,773
Native kindness lost in exploitation.

27
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:12,597
Liberties for some through subjugation.

28
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:15,539
Faith distortions used to build a nation.

29
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,901
Confinement to the distant reservation.

30
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,704
Hopeful spirits lost at every station.

31
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:23,886
Museum cases filled with infiltration.

32
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:25,748
And a river runs through it.

33
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:43,753
Our valley is a place of shame, treaties that were violated, tribes that were decimated, disease that was initiated, environment that was devastated, trust that was annihilated, greed that is still celebrated, and a river runs through it.

34
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,135
Our valley is a place of industry.

35
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:51,417
Iron was smelted, tallow was melted, ships were built, frames were gilt.

36
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,144
Leather was tanned.

37
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:55,305
Bridges were spanned.

38
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:56,407
Fabric was dyed.

39
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,448
Fish was fried.

40
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:58,589
Rum was distilled.

41
00:02:58,669 --> 00:02:59,790
Barrels were filled.

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,871
Glass was blown.

43
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,933
Crops were grown.

44
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:03,394
Meadows were stamped.

45
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:04,515
Soldiers encamped.

46
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:08,720
Milk was homogenized, pasteurized, and fortified.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,442
And a river runs through it.

48
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:13,326
Our valley is a place of industry.

49
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,409
Lies were told as papers passed.

50
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,711
Covenants never intended to last.

51
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,854
Stolen lands, great wealth amassed.

52
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,377
Rampant corruption now put on blast.

53
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:24,599
How did it get so bad so fast?

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,202
This silent guilt that sanitizes.

55
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,265
Race unrest that paralyzes.

56
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:31,266
Black lives trying to matter.

57
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:32,948
Brown skin made to scatter.

58
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,529
Red blood spilt and splattered.

59
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,551
Homes that only sell to some.

60
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,592
Banks don't lend to everyone.

61
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:40,894
Police don't look to serve and protect.

62
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:45,738
Fear and loathing breed disrespect and a river runs through it.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:04:12,832
Our valley is still a place of denial, for graves undug to drive a pile, for landed gentry remains on trial, for sins committed in the church's aisle and failure to turn equality's dial, for actions thought both vain and vile, no small amount of desecration where progress interred the bones of First Nation, with never a notion to a real preservation and a headlong rush toward contamination.

64
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:15,637
Where is Missituck's compensation?

65
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,663
Are bluebacks and herring a standing ovation?

66
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:23,492
The watchers gather around the formation and a river runs through it.

67
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:34,433
Our valley is a place of nativity, indigenous braves or slaves in captivity, immigrant enclaves in exclusivity, a treacherous path to beloved community.

68
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:50,325
Each clan wears a kindred face, covets a homeland's warm embrace, coveting gospels of time and space, every religion and every race, tribal spirits of fire and ice, a thousand types of beans and rice, and a river runs through it.

69
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:55,618
Our valley is a place of fertility, verdant shores by the sandy beaches.

70
00:04:56,078 --> 00:05:07,866
Nature grows what the soul beseeches, ash and elm and maple preaches from the silent spring to the epic speeches, yet poisoned into the soil leeches, open wounds and ugly breaches.

71
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:12,429
We've yet to learn what nature teaches and a river runs through it.

72
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,436
Our valley is a tapestry.

73
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:17,977
Threads for every color and shade.

74
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,098
Stripes for every soul displayed.

75
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:21,498
Winter and spring.

76
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:22,678
Summer and fall.

77
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:26,059
Translucent rain that showers all.

78
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,680
Rainbows await the heart's desire.

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,280
Together we face the cleansing fire.

80
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,321
Families grow strong with true resilience.

81
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,602
Schools invest in each child's brilliance.

82
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:40,823
Each one brings their gifts and talents.

83
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,633
God's design puts the scales in balance.

84
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:49,539
Neighbors embrace a common will despite the screaming fool on the hill.

85
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,925
Poems are written that resonate still and a river runs through it.

86
00:05:56,085 --> 00:06:07,168
Our valley is a place of revolution, where new voices seek a new solution that doesn't begin with a cash contribution, that doesn't end with filth and pollution.

87
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:20,992
Voices that hush when justice calls and push when progress slowly calls, presenting new and clear demands with concrete 10-year master plans and a river runs through it.

88
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:47,344
Our valley is a place of revelation where cooperative efforts rebuild and the local folk join the highly skilled to reclaim, rebrand, and re-engineer with the local folk who volunteer to pluck the refuge from marsh and shore with only the thought to refresh and restore so future folks embrace and explore and the river runs through it.

89
00:06:48,347 --> 00:07:07,597
Our valley is a place of vibrancy that takes great pride in its energy, that seeks out moments of synergy, that wraps its models in honesty, that guards its resources zealously, that seeks its level with urgency, and a river runs through it.

90
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:27,745
Our valley is a place of true rebirth, as we try to protect our precious earth, where good people meet to set things right, and the cleanup ensues through the waning light, and then the party takes over the night, and the food and the music is out of sight.

91
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:37,292
We gather our kin at the father's shore, and labor together to open the door, and a river runs through it.

92
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:44,075
Okay.

93
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:47,716
Okay, so I know it was a lot.

94
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:49,216
I know it was a lot.

95
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:55,537
You know, I'm still teaching myself to write shorter poems, but I'm not a very good teacher, so.

96
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:00,658
Okay, so I want to start with Beyond the Bend of the Stream.

97
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:03,479
Let's have a friendly chat with our folks.

98
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:10,040
Dari, can you talk a bit about the work, your work, and

99
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,139
how it engages and impacts young people in the MIRA service communities.

100
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,581
Yeah, definitely.

101
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,583
Young people specifically or everybody?

102
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,826
We're all young at heart, I guess, right?

103
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:27,747
Definitely.

104
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:35,175
So a large part of my work is working with volunteers, which there's a few awesome volunteers in the audience today.

105
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:43,704
It's always great to see your faces and hear your stories and how you connect with the mystic and what working with the mystic with your hands means to you.

106
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:49,766
We do a lot of activities and a lot of the work is powered by volunteers.

107
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:58,989
We started off our organization fully volunteer with people who just noticed that the river was polluted.

108
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:09,453
It had endured, you know, a lot of history of damage, which you just spoke to in your poem, and it was just these concerned residents who just decided

109
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:11,856
We can't change what we don't know.

110
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,019
And so they started collecting data.

111
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,225
And that's kind of where our community science programs were born.

112
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:26,156
It's people who care and people who say, I need to get more information so I can make this change that I want to see.

113
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:30,359
So that's kind of where we started and we've just added more and more onto that.

114
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:44,448
We collect data around the herring migration, the river herring migration, which you mentioned alewives and blueback herring, our favorite fish, unapologetically, which have just started their migration.

115
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,269
Just this past week we saw our first ones.

116
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:50,892
And it used to signal the new year for the indigenous people who lived here.

117
00:09:52,794 --> 00:10:03,467
kind of bringing in the new year with this amazing migration of animals and so we have volunteers going out every hour from 7 a.m.

118
00:10:03,507 --> 00:10:04,308
to 7 p.m.

119
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,512
seven days a week which is just a huge amount of dedication and love and

120
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:13,155
for the species that we know supports such a diverse and vibrant ecosystem here.

121
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,696
So those are a couple of things that are happening right now.

122
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:21,018
We also, of course, clean up trash where we can.

123
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,920
We remove invasive species.

124
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:35,125
We're doing more and more planting, trying to establish healthy meadows, healthy trees for shade and for habitat and for so many other things.

125
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:47,755
So, yeah, I guess all I do is help send emails so that everyone gets to the same place at the same time, but it's really the volunteers that are doing amazing, amazing work with us.

126
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:56,683
Just, just, just, can you give folks a sense of, in the typical herring run, how many fish we're talking about?

127
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:58,324
Oh, yeah, definitely.

128
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:07,911
So way back when, they used to say that the herring were so plentiful that you could walk across the river on the backs of herring, which, can you just picture that?

129
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:08,712
That would be amazing.

130
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:14,096
So definitely overfishing was a huge issue, habitat loss because of dams.

131
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:19,561
And so at the lowest, they really dipped down to around 200,000 coming through our river.

132
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:24,285
And with the establishment of fish ladders, our highest number was around 700,000.

133
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,347
which is huge, they've tripled in population.

134
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:36,849
Last year we had the largest river herring run in Massachusetts, which is remarkable because we're the most urbanized watershed.

135
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:44,351
Our river runs right through the middle of a city and a ton of impervious surfaces and yet these river herring are still coming in big numbers.

136
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:58,938
And we're hoping that with a fish ladder or a fish passage installed at the next big obstacle, which is Scally Dam at Horn Ponds, that the Mystic River herring migration might reach over a million fish, which would be huge.

137
00:11:59,278 --> 00:11:59,498
Yeah.

138
00:11:59,558 --> 00:11:59,799
Wow.

139
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:00,139
Wow.

140
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,023
So it's, it's, it's not a small thing, and I know they have an army of volunteers.

141
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:11,627
I've, I've received some of the solicitations myself, I just haven't been out to get out there and count some fish.

142
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:17,371
But you know, that's, that's one of my future ambitions, is to get out there and count some fish.

143
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,574
So Dave, I'm gonna switch it over to you for a second.

144
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:25,317
So professionally, you're kind of a Boston guy.

145
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:33,834
And yet, you know, you kind of, you made your way north and got involved with the work of the association.

146
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:37,181
What, what kind of, you know, prompted you to make that decision?

147
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,138
Good question.

148
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:46,382
I just saw an opportunity to work with an organization that was doing comprehensive work.

149
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:54,167
You know, the work that I was doing in Dorchester was at an affordable housing organization, and I was kind of the outlier, if you will.

150
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,489
I was like the green nag, I'll call myself.

151
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:04,333
I was the guy that was always poking and prodding us to do more around sustainability, but the chance to come here was a chance to really

152
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:13,002
do what I cared about, which was working at that intersection of science and climate and people, and do it in a place that really needed it.

153
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:17,728
You know, do this work in an urban area really is where my heart is.

154
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:20,230
I've always liked working in urban circumstances.

155
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,771
Always have.

156
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,552
Well, not always, but...

157
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,635
for a long time now, several years.

158
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:29,663
So it just feels like something I wanted to do and have a great team that I get to work with every day.

159
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:30,965
They inspire me.

160
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:39,076
So it's just wonderful to be around younger people who are actually doing this work, but also bring some knowledge and bring some awareness to the organization.

161
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:47,108
Okay, so, so, not that there are any for anybody, you know, in these professional environments, but kind of a typical day.

162
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,409
What does it look like for you?

163
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,031
I don't know if there is a typical day.

164
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:52,652
That's a good question.

165
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:59,698
You know, a typical day could mean anything from working on a grant proposal,

166
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:06,543
to working within municipality and people who care about trees in a particular city or municipality.

167
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:12,307
A lot of my work right now centers on dealing with heat, urban heat.

168
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:17,531
In 2020, we did a big study called Wicked Hot Mystic.

169
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,133
We looked at all 21 municipalities

170
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,414
in the watershed on a really hot day.

171
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:25,396
It was a 90 degree plus day in the middle of a heat wave.

172
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:35,481
So we figured out, and that was done with a lot of volunteers, figured out where the hot spots were through the whole watershed, and then we said, how do we begin to cool that, those places off?

173
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,842
So that's now called Wicked Cool Mystic.

174
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:39,743
Very Bostonian.

175
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:42,084
Wicked Cool Mystic.

176
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:45,166
So now we're trying to figure out, as Daria related to, trees.

177
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:46,046
Where can we put trees?

178
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,187
Where can we put cooling centers?

179
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:47,747
What can we do?

180
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,648
splash pads, playgrounds.

181
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:56,193
So a lot of my work is grant writing, some of it's kind of figuring out the policy and where we're going around tree policy and planning.

182
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:59,795
It's managing a few staff in the organization.

183
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:07,321
You know, Myra's grown from five to sixteen staff now in about three years, and we're about to jump again, so.

184
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:13,546
Some of my work just involves day-to-day management of the organization, along with Patrick and Shelley, the other deputy director.

185
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:15,327
Wonderful, fantastic.

186
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:23,412
So you set me up perfectly for the question that I have for Mariangeli, because I wanted to ask you, Mariangeli, is that not reaching?

187
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:24,112
No.

188
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,113
Okay.

189
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:26,814
I can use this one.

190
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:27,894
Okay, very good.

191
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:28,935
Sorry about that.

192
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:33,898
Okay, so most recently, what has made you say,

193
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:43,426
What the heck are we gonna do about how hot the weather is getting and how it's changing the river ecology?

194
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:44,548
Okay.

195
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:54,462
So I will say that what has made me think, what the heck are we gonna do with climate change and heat, is a personal experience.

196
00:15:54,502 --> 00:16:03,190
Last summer, I had the greatest idea to drive my bike and go to a friend's house and do it in the middle of a heat wave.

197
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,295
Because in the Caribbean, I'm from Puerto Rico, you are used to going outside when it's very hot.

198
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,998
and you just do activities, go to the beach and spend time with friends.

199
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,020
But here the heat is a little bit different.

200
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,001
It's more like sticky, more humid.

201
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,584
So I decided to go to my friend's house and driving my bike.

202
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:26,950
And then in the middle of the way, I just had to step on the side and drink a bunch of water because I felt like I was going to die.

203
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,796
So I was like, OK, there's a lot of things that need to be done about this.

204
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:35,981
And that's by personal experiences, but also by listening to people.

205
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,624
I was like, OK, there is stuff that needs to be done.

206
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:46,234
And that's one of the things that actually inspired me to study public health and then also to start engaging in work with Mayra.

207
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:51,899
And also finding ways of how not just people can be protected, but also the environment.

208
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,844
Because at the end of the day, when we think about healthy communities, it's one health.

209
00:16:56,984 --> 00:17:02,530
It's the health of the people, but also the health of the environment, because it's everything interconnected.

210
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:04,883
Fantastic.

211
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:13,231
So that's like a significant crossover between what you do and what you do, Dave, in terms of addressing that concern.

212
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:17,496
Yeah, in fact, we're starting to talk internally about how we begin to

213
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:20,126
cross-fertilize across teams.

214
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:26,512
A lot of the work that Mariangeli is doing is around health equity.

215
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:31,055
A lot of my work is around tree equity, but how do we begin to kind of combine those?

216
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,897
We're looking at a big air quality grant, for example, right now.

217
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:38,900
How does that intersect with her work and my work and the rest of the work in the organization?

218
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,441
That's amazing.

219
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:47,686
We have one of our particular members that comes here on a regular basis, and trees is her, that's her big thing.

220
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:53,209
So I'm surprised she's not here this evening because she would have lit right into that part of the discussion.

221
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:57,832
But good, I'll tell her that there's folks out there that are working on tree equity.

222
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,112
Absolutely.

223
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:01,013
Yeah, and that will be very exciting to her.

224
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,995
I'm telling you, you might get a volunteer out of it.

225
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:16,847
Okay, so, Daria, I want you, if you will, to talk a little bit about... Dave's talking about equity, but, you know, in a little different way.

226
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:24,995
Can you talk about, kind of, the people equity side, diversity and inclusion in presenting the river's resources to the local community?

227
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,482
Yeah, definitely.

228
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:35,088
I think it's pretty blatant in this watershed that certain communities are facing environmental burdens more than others.

229
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,072
And I think certain communities have access to nature much more easily than others.

230
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:51,461
Our watershed is, it's amazing in that it's 21 different municipalities, but it's also, you know, 21 different areas experiencing very different environments and different realities.

231
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:58,603
So I think a lot of what we're trying to do is figure out, by asking community members who live there, kind of, what do you need?

232
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:00,284
What do you want to see in your environment?

233
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:06,086
And seeing where we can kind of plug in and help with that in any way we can, yeah.

234
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:06,826
So in

235
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:19,308
in terms of some of the things that you're hearing with regard to, particularly, you know, folks, you know, who may be considered, you know, kind of underserved or underrepresented, what kinds of things are they asking for?

236
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,189
If you can, you know.

237
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,069
Yeah, definitely.

238
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:30,873
I think Maria Angelou hosted a really great series of workshops asking communities just that question, so I might pass it to Maria Angelou if you don't mind to answer that one.

239
00:19:34,173 --> 00:20:01,288
I will say that one of the first things that people are asking, and this project was hosted in Everett, so a lot of the things that people are asking first is to be heard and to be included in the process of like planning for initiatives that are related to environmental justice or related to climate change, because at the end of the day, the people that should be also expressing their concerns are the ones that are experiencing, for example, extreme weather conditions, the heat waves,

240
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:09,152
flooding because you have the stories and it's your live experiences and that should be informing the policies and the programs that are created.

241
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:27,043
But then in terms of on the ground work, people are asking for a lot of trees to be planted, public spaces where you can have fun with your family and your friends, but at the same time they can serve as spaces that you can not only socialize but also get cool during the summer.

242
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:31,628
like having more water parks, water amenities.

243
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:38,837
So yeah, a lot of green spaces, places to hang out, but at the same time get protected.

244
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:44,224
I had done some poultry work with the group over in Malden, Malden River Works.

245
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:51,448
And that's really an amazing project that they're kind of more in the development stages of.

246
00:20:52,728 --> 00:21:05,673
I don't know all of the nuts and bolts of it in terms of where they are now, but I know they had a big series of public meetings and, you know, different gatherings where they elicited a lot of public testimony.

247
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:14,524
And there's so much of what everybody was asking for woven into the rubric of the program that they're developing.

248
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:15,966
So, you know, so it works.

249
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:16,887
It really does.

250
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:17,948
It really does.

251
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:18,789
Yeah, please, Dave.

252
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,975
I just wanted to add, so we're really using the approach that Mayor Angelou mentioned.

253
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:24,636
throughout all of our work now.

254
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,438
So we center with the community.

255
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:27,759
We talk to community.

256
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,301
We say, what is it that you want?

257
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,342
We try to figure out ways to do that.

258
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:38,587
So our Wicked Hot Mystic work, when we looked at all the hot spots in all the communities, that's just one layer.

259
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,529
We go back to those communities and say, okay, this is where we think it's hot.

260
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,951
Where do you think it's hot?

261
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:50,476
Where, when you're walking on your street, would you say you wanted shade, or do you want a splash pad, or something, or a cool block?

262
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:50,757
So,

263
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:55,324
We circle back to the community a few times now, as a matter of course, in all of our work.

264
00:21:56,384 --> 00:22:01,565
And it's really critically important to center those communities that have been left out for so long.

265
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:05,426
A lot of the neighborhoods we work in were places that were redlined, historically.

266
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,367
So they never got parks.

267
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:08,787
They never got trees.

268
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,267
They got a lot of asphalt.

269
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:14,488
They got a lot of driveways, but they didn't have a place to go cool off.

270
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,669
And so, we're trying to begin to rectify those situations.

271
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,049
And then,

272
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:25,501
Throughout all of this, we have 25 miles of greenway we're trying to complete that connects all these communities in different ways.

273
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:28,343
And we want to make sure that those greenways are also cooled off as well.

274
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:29,944
Absolutely.

275
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:38,090
So, you know, and you spoke about, you know, a lot of the neighborhoods being redlined, and that's really how West Medford began.

276
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,112
I mean, a lot of people don't realize it, but at the outset of

277
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:51,404
probably the late 1880s, 1890s, there were only three streets in all of West Medford where people of color could live.

278
00:22:51,424 --> 00:23:00,035
There was this street, Arlington Street, the next street over Lincoln Street, and then the third street over was Jerome Street, and for many years it was like that.

279
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:15,472
And then eventually a couple more streets got added, and we moved a little bit closer to the railroad tracks, but generally speaking, after you cross the railroad tracks, Medford was primarily a white city, and this was the African-American neighborhood.

280
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:38,763
Medford's a lot more diverse now, but in ways that diversity has impacted neighborhoods of color in a negative way because all of the development has pushed people out from places that used to be the only place where you saw black and brown people.

281
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:43,505
So it's a thorny but interesting problem.

282
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:45,887
Very good, very good.

283
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:52,132
So, Mariangeli, what do you, what do you say, I mean, because you've got to meet them sometimes.

284
00:23:52,232 --> 00:24:03,801
What do you say to the climate change deniers and folks that don't believe that global warming and heat spots and all this good stuff that Dave is talking about are real things?

285
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,462
What do you, what do you tell them?

286
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,121
That's a very good question.

287
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:14,245
I will say that it's something that we're already experiencing.

288
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:28,736
I know there's a lot of people that are in denial of what is happening, but if we look back last summer, we had like three back-to-back heat waves, and then just like last week, it's April, and it was like already 88 degrees, which was a record.

289
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:40,751
So I feel like pulling on a lot of data, which is something that also our organization based on, we do a lot of research because it's very important to have data to show out there.

290
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:45,578
But at the same time, just like also sharing the stories that we hear through the watershed.

291
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:54,520
Because for the people that still have trouble thinking that this is real, sharing what people in the watershed has said that they have experienced.

292
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:13,805
For example, being in a heat wave and having a person that has a disability at home that maybe is one of like on the second floor of the house and it's difficult for them to have an AC there, just sharing what people live in their daily basis and mixing that with data is a very impactful way of like giving a message.

293
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,605
But as we have been saying,

294
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:21,328
We have some experiences, but people in the community are the ones that have more of the experiences.

295
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:36,355
Also providing forums and spaces where people can share those stories by themselves, because we're just here as an organization that is trying to do work, but at the end of the day, this is something that is part of the community, and we are just helping on the way.

296
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:37,705
Very good.

297
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:38,546
Very good.

298
00:25:38,826 --> 00:25:47,830
And what we've done here at the community centers is, you know, we've become part of Medford's network of cooling centers.

299
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:57,955
So, you know, in the heat of the summer, you know, if people need to, if they don't have air conditioning, or if they find they're living in a, you know, in a hot zone, in a hot house,

300
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,217
they can make their way down to the community center.

301
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:08,361
They can sit in 68 degrees comfort and not get heat stroke.

302
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:10,022
So it's real.

303
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:10,742
It's real.

304
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:21,729
And I'm just happy that there are folks out there that are collecting the kinds of data that can be impactful as people make decisions about whether or not they want to believe this thing.

305
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:23,110
Because it's real.

306
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,211
It's very real.

307
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:30,934
Okay, Dave, what, what, what MIRA projects and programs are you most excited about right now?

308
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:32,775
Everything?

309
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:33,996
Mm-hmm.

310
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:35,377
Um...

311
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:42,895
Well, I'd say our education programs have really expanded exponentially.

312
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:56,157
Natalia, who's not here tonight, has just become a really great educator, and she gets help from Daria, and Mariangeli, and Marissa, and my team, and so we've kind of expanded our outreach to more schools, which is great.

313
00:26:57,258 --> 00:27:01,038
The stuff that I'm working on in trees is really pretty exciting.

314
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:03,419
We've been able to get some funding for trees.

315
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,259
We were able to get

316
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,760
an earmark from Senator Presley's office.

317
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,823
And we're actually, I think some of that money's actually gonna come to Medford.

318
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:21,186
We've been talking to Trees Medford about planting trees here, both public and private property.

319
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:25,388
So that will probably happen this fall.

320
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,930
We also have gone after two very large pots of money.

321
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,413
about $2.5 million and $4 million in earmarks for next year.

322
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:41,077
So, you know, Congress is kind of, despite what you hear in the press, Congress is somewhat in our favor right now.

323
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:47,041
So, we hope to kind of be able to move some money our way and be able to do some more tree planting.

324
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:56,290
I'd say the air quality study, which I'm not totally involved with, but the air quality work again is, it kind of speaks to what Mariangeli was saying.

325
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,876
It gives us a backdrop in terms of data, and allows us to say, look, this is the reality on the ground.

326
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,157
This is the reality in the air.

327
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:04,959
What do you want to do about it?

328
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,481
What do you want to change in terms of policy?

329
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:11,886
And that policy piece is something I think that's important for everyone to think about is,

330
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:14,999
What do you want to say to your municipality around policy?

331
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,220
You know, should you have more cooling centers?

332
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,181
Should you have more trees?

333
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:22,263
What's your policy around seniors and emergencies?

334
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:26,146
How are health centers involved in emergency management?

335
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:30,649
So you all as residents get to make the difference around that stuff.

336
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:35,852
And I encourage you to kind of work through your politicians and make things happen that you want to see happen.

337
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:37,694
A lot of important stuff, really.

338
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:38,255
Very good.

339
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:49,650
Daria, can, can you, can you talk a little bit about, you know, your favorite moment or few moments of being part of the organization so far?

340
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,020
Oh my gosh.

341
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:52,401
That's a big question.

342
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:54,883
I think there's been a lot of them.

343
00:28:55,243 --> 00:29:03,928
I think that whenever we do these really fun community events that really have no goal except for people just having fun by the river, that's, those are my favorite.

344
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:06,909
For example, we did a Project Misik.

345
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:12,753
It's a drumming workshop next to the river and just seeing different ways those spaces can be used and enjoyed by the community.

346
00:29:14,873 --> 00:29:24,096
I was working with a youth, a collection of youth groups, and I first came to them with the idea of like, what if we had a forum and you could all talk to each other?

347
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:26,176
And they all said, what's a forum?

348
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:28,577
We don't really want to do that.

349
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:42,580
So they said, let's call it a celebration instead, and let's just bring soccer balls and volleyballs and big drawing pads, and just seeing that come to life from their vision, those are some of my favorite, absolute favorite moments.

350
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,180
Yeah.

351
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:58,666
Well, you know, one of the things that, you know, it's been kind of my aim to do is to, is to incorporate some of the work that you do with youth into some of the youth initiatives that we have here at the community center.

352
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:04,568
So, like this summer, for instance, we do a program called Hoops and Hope.

353
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:08,050
which is, revolves around basketball.

354
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:21,978
But, you know, having a table and having materials to be able to give out to the young people and talk about climate resiliency and talk about, you know, school education programs, and that would be a good opportunity.

355
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:32,764
And I know we've already talked with Michelle Lieberthal about Juneteenth and, you know, having you be a part of the Juneteenth celebration that we're going to do here at the community center.

356
00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:46,227
So there are lots of opportunities for kind of a cross-pollination of what MIRA does and what the community center is doing, particularly as a resiliency hub in the city of Medford.

357
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:49,587
So we can definitely talk some more about that.

358
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,128
Yeah, that sounds amazing.

359
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,108
Very good.

360
00:30:53,308 --> 00:31:01,290
So Mariangeli, what new climate resiliency initiatives are you excited about in this particular program year?

361
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:26,222
One of the initiatives that I get very excited about every summer is that we have a partnership with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, where we partner to provide funds to community-based organizations and municipalities in the watershed to create projects in their communities that are addressing extreme heat.

362
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:33,989
And this is something that is very exciting because it varies greatly of the different projects that are created through this program.

363
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:44,880
For example, planting more trees or doing a community party where people can go cool down, but also build a network with your neighbors and with your family.

364
00:31:45,680 --> 00:32:00,398
But at the same time, it gives money to community-based organizations to provide social services, like utility bill assistance, because we know if you have an AC and have access to one, turning on the AC during the summer can be also stressful.

365
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:11,263
So it provides some extra funding for people to give that to the community and also just programs to actually access an air conditioner.

366
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:20,845
So it's a great initiative that we have and we're trying to also figure out how this can become a long-term program because it started during COVID-19 as emergency funding.

367
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:27,607
But we're trying to make this program longer so it can actually keep serving community-based organizations and municipalities.

368
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:35,450
Okay, last time I checked, West Memphis Community Center was considered a community-based organization.

369
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:43,272
So if you want to hang out with us and some of that funding that comes through you comes through you and comes to us, that wouldn't be a problem for us, okay?

370
00:32:43,553 --> 00:32:45,073
I just thought I'd say that, you know?

371
00:32:45,493 --> 00:32:46,514
Seemed to make sense to me.

372
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:53,136
So, David, as you think about collaborations and youth development and community building,

373
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:57,840
How do you think Myra's, you're gonna have to dance the next time that happens.

374
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,806
How will Myra build on the successes of the past year?

375
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:11,060
Well, we'll continue expanding our outreach.

376
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:27,853
We've kind of, like I said, my work has been focused on some of the communities like Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Somerville, Medford, so how do we begin to expand outwards to other communities that are facing these same issues, facing the same issues around heat?

377
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,434
that have the need for trees or some other cooling amenities.

378
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:35,157
So I think that's one thing I'm thinking that we're gonna do.

379
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,720
What else?

380
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:41,104
The greenways are starting to really take off.

381
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:44,107
Now, does that include the Clippership Connector?

382
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,232
Is that part of the... Clippership Connector is part of our, part of the network we're trying to complete.

383
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:49,953
So there's a bunch of things coming.

384
00:33:49,973 --> 00:34:02,697
There's a bridge that's going to be built, not this year obviously, but in the next few years, over the Mystic, along the Orange Line connection, between the casino and what's called Draw Assembly Square.

385
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:05,958
So that's gonna, that's got funding, that's gonna happen.

386
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,339
So if someone has to jump off the,

387
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,042
a bridge, it'll be a little bit lower than the Orange Line bridge.

388
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:16,185
I guess that's one way of looking at it, yeah.

389
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:16,845
Yeah.

390
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:28,654
But just the notion of taking these disparate locations and figuring out ways to connect them along the river, it's pretty exciting.

391
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:32,857
And I've been, you know, to various places, you know, along the river.

392
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:33,737
As a matter of fact,

393
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:39,160
with a landscape architect by the name of Carolyn Lewenberg.

394
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:43,102
We just developed, well, we didn't develop the space.

395
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:48,265
The space is already there, but it was capped because there was some environmental damage.

396
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:54,568
It's behind the Andrews School, and it's a new, it hasn't been dedicated yet.

397
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:56,409
It's a new meditation space.

398
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:59,070
It was very exciting, and she did

399
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:03,534
low landscape sculpture with stones in a maze.

400
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:09,440
And then at three positions in the maze, there's a post and tablet with poetry.

401
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,082
And I, that's where I come in.

402
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,985
So, you know, I did the poetry.

403
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:20,711
I think the dedication is on April 26th, whatever that Saturday is.

404
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:24,193
and it's called Mystic Meditation.

405
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:43,002
So you can walk around in the maze, and you can read the poetry, and you can, it's very, very peaceful, and it's right along the river, so you can hear the river kind of talking in the background, and you can, it's part of the Clippership Connection, so you can continue to walk that path for miles and miles and miles, so.

406
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:44,303
That sounds like a great project.

407
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,063
It's gonna be a great thing.

408
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,024
It's gonna be a great thing.

409
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:50,186
That makes me think we should be doing a little bit more with connecting people to art.

410
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:54,748
and the river, just somehow thinking about ways to incorporate art more into our work.

411
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:55,589
I'm your guy.

412
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:57,149
Yeah, I'm your guy.

413
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,191
Okay, all right, very good.

414
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:06,834
So, and I want you all to, you know, take a crack at these last couple of questions that I have.

415
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:14,438
What do you absolutely, Dave, you go first, what do you absolutely want the people to know about Myra tonight?

416
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:20,630
We're really focused on equity and engagement of community.

417
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,691
That's at the core of our work now.

418
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:28,174
I think when we started, we were focused primarily on the river, but the river isn't just the river.

419
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:32,316
The river is the river, it's the communities around it, it's the people in those communities.

420
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:44,483
So, how do we help you get what you want, connect you to the river in stronger ways, and really try to create a more vibrant environment for everybody who lives

421
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:48,884
in cities in particular, in this city, in these neighborhoods, in your neighborhood.

422
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,044
How do we work with you to do that?

423
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:58,186
I think that's the one thing that I really wanna accomplish by the time I leave MIRA, which won't be for a long time.

424
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:07,448
And you know, follow up on that, I didn't know that there were actually 21 municipalities that were in your catchment area.

425
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:14,570
You know, Malden, Everett, Medford, and Somerville, and Arlington, Winchester, but that's probably where I stopped.

426
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,290
Yeah.

427
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,271
What else is in there?

428
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:22,076
All the way out to, there's a little bit of a sliver in Reading, I think, actually, Daria's got the map, so.

429
00:37:22,496 --> 00:37:23,137
Okay.

430
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:30,143
There are these maps back there on the table with other resource materials that Daria and Mariangeli brought with them.

431
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:44,947
So please avail yourself so you can kind of familiarize, if you're not already, familiarize yourself with all of the geography that Myra has in its catchment, because it's very significant, again, more significant than I even knew about.

432
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,487
Okay, thank you.

433
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:54,969
Okay, so, Daria, one thing you absolutely want the people to know about Myra.

434
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,194
That's so hard of a question.

435
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:09,841
I think, kind of building off of what you just said, we are a municipality of, or we're a watershed association, and in our watershed, there's 21 different municipalities.

436
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:12,904
So you might be wondering, you know, first, what is a watershed?

437
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,264
I would love to talk about that.

438
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:19,468
It's just an area of land where if a drop of water lands in that area, it drains to the same place.

439
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:25,312
So with that definition, you might be wondering, why is a watershed association doing this kind of work?

440
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:30,315
I think that it's just a great kind of regional unit where we can all think together.

441
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:34,138
You know, the water that affects you affects me, affects our neighbors.

442
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:49,108
So I feel like just that the Watershed Association is here to be kind of a facilitator for collaborating across these boundaries where, you know, flooding doesn't stop at Arlington and not go into Medford.

443
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:49,869
It's all together.

444
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:56,040
Um, so just as a resource and as like a, you know, a place to build collaboration.

445
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:57,032
Absolutely.

446
00:38:57,332 --> 00:39:25,721
I remember when there was a gasoline or oil spill down here by the rotary, and it had, you know, a damaging effect on, particularly on that part of the river, and I remember how active Myra was in talking to folks about that and getting folks' opinions and disseminating information, getting that information back to the state and federal agencies that were dealing with the cleanup and everything, so

447
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:27,222
So it's important.

448
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:37,127
It's important to have an advocate and to know that, you know, that's a primary resource that MIRA provides can be pretty comforting to folks.

449
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:38,968
Mariangeli?

450
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:57,480
So one takeaway from Mara, I will say that we care about climate change, but even though climate change can be this scary term, or we are not really sure what's happening and what's gonna happen in the future, we approach this with a very positive lens.

451
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,183
Initiatives that are addressing extreme heat, flooding, they don't need to be boring or scary.

452
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:10,707
They can be fun, they can be beautiful, they can be places that community can come together and we can become stronger.

453
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:22,695
So, having in mind that this is a work that, as Dave was mentioning, can have art involved, we can have festivals, we can just make it beautiful and fun, and that's a takeaway that I will say.

454
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:25,417
We're trying to do this work in a very positive mindset.

455
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:36,605
And I've been to a couple of the celebrations that you have, and, you know, they are fun, they are very engaging, so, yeah, you're doing a good job in that regard.

456
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:52,297
So I always, you know, well, more recently than before, but I kind of like to flip the script and, you know, we're sitting here as, you know, an organization of record for the, you know, the historic African-American community of West Medford.

457
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:55,660
So, do you have any questions for us?

458
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,067
I'd like to hear more of that history.

459
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,309
I don't really know it very well.

460
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:11,936
One of our staff actually used to live a couple blocks away, so that's how I first heard about West Medford Community Center.

461
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:20,685
I've always wanted to learn more, so I'm grateful to be here tonight, but I'd like to hear more of the history from folks who've lived here a long time.

462
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:31,074
Well, we got that, so you can come to any one of the senior lunches that I host Tuesday through Thursday, from 12 to 1.30, say.

463
00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:36,478
And, you know, if you sit down and talk to anyone there, they'll regale you.

464
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,161
They might give you more than you bargained for.

465
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:43,466
The other thing is that the building itself will tell you a lot of the story.

466
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:44,567
We have two exhibits.

467
00:41:45,107 --> 00:41:54,115
One is the Afro-American Remembrance Project, and those are the plexiglass-covered exhibits all the way around and upstairs as well.

468
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:57,338
And they really tell the more contemporary history of West Medford.

469
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:02,603
I'd be certainly, well, I'm happy to, you know, have lunch with you, right?

470
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:03,704
I won't make you pay.

471
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:04,785
But anyways.

472
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:29,503
And then the upper, on the upper, those are, that's the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and there are 28 portraits of folks who have made a significant impact in the latter-day history of West Medford, a number of whom are still with us, still doing great things, and then many of them, you know, who are deceased, who have passed by.

473
00:42:30,143 --> 00:42:35,271
but all of them represent significant history of this community.

474
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:38,195
So yeah, we can, we can, we can, we can help you with that.

475
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,358
I will come back and I'd love to hear some of those stories.

476
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:41,881
Absolutely, absolutely.

477
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:44,044
Daria.

478
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:47,735
You got a question for me?

479
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:48,915
Yeah, definitely.

480
00:42:49,115 --> 00:43:03,383
I think one of the things that we're acutely aware of is this idea of green gentrification, which is, you know, we make the environments, you know, we build these beautiful parks, we bring in more trees, does it just displace the people who are currently living here?

481
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:12,628
And it's, you know, a conversation at every conference we're going to, and people are still trying to figure out the best ways to improve the health of environment without

482
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:18,712
you know, displacing the people that live here, and especially the West Medford community, which has been here for generations and generations.

483
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:27,538
Yeah, just kind of, what would be your take on that, and what would you want to see that would, you know, make you feel good about it?

484
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:29,680
It's, you know, it's interesting because, you know, in,

485
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:54,222
It's not so much green gentrification here, it's bricks and mortar, much more so, and it's development gentrification, because, you know, there are a number of very, very aggressive developers that have come into this community and really, really targeted it as a place where they can buy houses on the cheap,

486
00:43:55,103 --> 00:44:00,785
renovate them, and then sell them for, in all honesty, ridiculous amounts of money.

487
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:21,452
And so, again, we're retaining a good number of our trees and green spaces, and we're even having them, you know, be, you know, spruced up to a certain extent, but we're losing a lot of the history of the community because of the, you know, really rapturous development that's been taking place.

488
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:38,640
And there's, you know, there's a couple people, I'm not gonna name any names or, you know, try and shame anybody, but everybody knows, you know, who's in the neighborhood buying up all the houses and turning them into, you know, million-dollar condos that don't look like million-dollar condos, but that's another story for another day.

489
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,343
Yeah, so I think we're doing pretty well with regard to the green spaces.

490
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:50,327
But West Medford is a very desirable neighborhood.

491
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:54,048
It has access to public transportation.

492
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:58,691
It has access to all of the major roadways in the state.

493
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:03,073
It's a place where a lot of people wanna live.

494
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:10,737
A lot of people who are moving from those high-rise towers that want a little bit of green space where they can barbecue and drink Zinfandel with their friends.

495
00:45:11,537 --> 00:45:14,779
They're coming to buy places in West Medford.

496
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:19,243
and a lot of the families that I grew up with are long gone and hard to find, so.

497
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:23,647
But, um, but yeah, so, so, green's good.

498
00:45:24,427 --> 00:45:25,688
Brick and mortar, not so much.

499
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:26,869
Okay.

500
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,491
Mariangeli, what about you?

501
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:49,589
My question is kind of related to what Dario was mentioning, but also, Myra, I joined Myra, and I have a public health background, and we're really trying to incorporate that aspect, because as I was mentioning before, everything is related, the health of the people, the health of the environment,

502
00:45:50,149 --> 00:46:08,127
So I would like to know what are the concerns of the community, what are the concerns in terms of health, because we know climate change, extreme heat affects the health of people, and especially people that are older adults, children, people with disabilities are especially vulnerable.

503
00:46:08,828 --> 00:46:11,631
So I would like to know what are the concerns of the community in that.

504
00:46:11,951 --> 00:46:15,555
but also what other social issues are of concern.

505
00:46:15,795 --> 00:46:17,957
For example, housing also plays a big role.

506
00:46:19,018 --> 00:46:26,425
As I was mentioning before, utility assistance, conditions in your house, all of those social factors also influence your well-being.

507
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:48,364
I think for a lot of folks, you know, and I've, you know, seen, have had, you know, various conversations about it, but I think mental health is always an issue, particularly with aging populations where you get into, you know, the spectrum, Alzheimer's and dementia and so on and so forth, memory loss, so I think that that's always a concern.

508
00:46:49,105 --> 00:47:03,506
I think that one of the other concerns folks have, you know, the heat zones and global warming and creating uncomfortable situations for people, and how do they keep themselves cool, how do they ward off heat stroke and things of that nature.

509
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:27,963
And then, you know, the other area of public health that's a concern is, you know, kind of the changing nature of the healthcare industry, consolidations in big hospitals and the loss of, you know, local health centers where folks, you know, with Medicare and various different types of health plans,

510
00:47:28,323 --> 00:47:38,325
can feel as comfortable going and getting quality services as they might get at Mass General Brigham or, you know, one of the larger hospitals.

511
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:46,167
Because we, the principal hospital in Medford for many, many years was Lawrence Memorial.

512
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:52,588
And, you know, in the consolidation, the nature of what takes place at Lawrence Memorial is very different these days.

513
00:47:53,368 --> 00:48:03,344
And so, you know, so that, that kind of loss, the changes at Melrose-Wakefield, changes at, you know, various hospitals in the area, you know, that, that's, that's been concerning.

514
00:48:03,905 --> 00:48:05,928
So, I think those would be some of the things.

515
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:13,367
I want to add that I brought some resources for what to do when it's very hot outside, and they're in the table.

516
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:20,109
So if you're wondering how you can keep yourself cool and protect yourself, your family, and your community, they're in the table at the back.

517
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:21,890
Fantastic, fantastic.

518
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:28,892
Well, we've run a little bit over what we scheduled to do, but it's an important conversation, and I'm really so thankful

519
00:48:29,412 --> 00:48:31,853
that you guys came here to have it with us.

520
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:41,178
And, you know, sometime in the future, we hope to have you back again, and we'll take up a little bit more of what we talked about tonight, and I'm sure there'll be new things to talk about as well.

521
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:45,941
So, folks, could you show some love to Daria and Mariangeli and Dave?

522
00:48:47,322 --> 00:48:48,302
Thank you very much.

523
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:51,365
OK, so we're going to take a pause.

524
00:48:51,405 --> 00:48:56,010
We're going to break the set down so that we can get ready for the musical entertainment.

525
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:59,054
And then I'll be back to do some promotional stuff.

526
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,496
And then we'll keep it rolling.

527
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:01,657
OK, thank you.

528
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:04,520
All right.

529
00:49:05,802 --> 00:49:06,062
Thank you.

530
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,501
Hello hello hello.

531
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:15,183
All right.

532
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:19,066
If I can get everybody to take their seats so we can keep it rolling.

533
00:54:34,076 --> 00:54:34,637
All right.

534
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:37,659
Very good.

535
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:38,440
Very good.

536
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:43,102
Okay, all right, so I do wanna just...

537
00:54:45,288 --> 00:55:10,958

Wednesday, April 26th, we'll host our monthly senior movie at 1 p.m.

539
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,321
The movie is to be determined.

540
00:55:20,422 --> 00:55:26,924
Friday, May 5th, we'll be back on our normal first Friday to do words and music.

541
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:41,070
Friday through Sunday, and I forgot to write the dates down, but I believe it's May 26th through May 29th, the West Medford Family Reunion is taking place.

542
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:46,582
and you can contact the WMCC office for tickets and additional details.

543
00:55:46,642 --> 00:56:07,140
This used to be a function that was separate and distinct of the West Medford Community Center that biannually brought together folks from the historic neighborhood of West Medford, African American community, and it was always a great convening of

544
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:15,224
Folks who come from across the country and in some cases from the Caribbean and from Africa who have resettled.

545
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:23,708
They get together here in West Medford for a weekend of enjoying company and reconnecting with friends and family.

546
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:32,340
So, Saturday, June 3rd, Medford PorchFest, okay, will have a site here at the community center.

547
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:40,605
And if you don't know what PorchFest is, basically what it is is musical entertainment all around the city.

548
00:56:40,645 --> 00:56:48,770
It's almost like open studios used to be where the homes of local families was where you would find the artwork.

549
00:56:49,478 --> 00:57:10,895
uh... in this case the homes of local families in different venues will be where you'll find the music so there'll be music here uh... we're still working on exactly who the bands will be but there'll be a couple bands here playing at at uh... right out on our back porch the patio out back so june third save the date for medford porch fest

June 11th is the annual Hoops and Hope basketball fundraiser and silent auction taking place right back there at Duncan Park.

551
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:27,016
Also featuring the Brandon Bolden tournament basketball tournament and boys and girls are participating.

00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:32,881

553
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:39,186
This time out back and at the park, it's going to be a nice event, a bigger event.

554
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:45,611
And, you know, on down the road, just something to kind of keep in your mind will be the annual on August 26th.

555
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:51,776
the annual Labor Day block party, and the Lobster Fest, so another combination event.

556
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:55,579
Okay, so just one Poet Laureate plug.

557
00:57:55,979 --> 00:58:05,506
You can join me and a few other great adult poets at the Medford Public Library for the final night of my three-part Poetry Month series at 7 p.m.

568
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:51,401
The Ledger.

569
00:58:52,122 --> 00:59:03,487
So tonight we go to a well-established and highly professional performer that has gained a huge following and that has become a favorite daughter of Medford, Boston, and New England.

570
00:59:03,547 --> 00:59:10,951
She frequently does her thing with an a cappella flair, and she's graced our makeshift stage several times before.

571
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:18,954
It gives me great pleasure to introduce my friend and Fisk University sister Donna McElroy.

572
00:59:19,635 --> 00:59:28,626

Old friends, huh?

I missed you guys.

584
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,713
You know, I don't plan what I'm going to sing.

585
01:01:06,773 --> 01:01:09,256
I just write down a bunch of ideas and songs.

586
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:14,567
things that I want to talk about in my life and experiences that I've had.

587
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:22,691
So I wrote down a bunch of hymns and church and fellowship and spirituals.

588
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:29,013
And then I thought, good morning or evening, friends.

589
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:33,395
Here's your friendly announcer.

590
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:39,597
I've got serious news to pass on to you.

591
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:52,551
What I'm about to say could mean the world's disaster.

592
01:01:54,998 --> 01:02:03,583
could fill your joy and laughter into tears and pain.

593
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:11,767
It's that love's in need of love today.

594
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:12,688
Can I get an amen?

595
01:02:12,808 --> 01:02:12,948
Amen.

596
01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:18,051
Don't delay.

597
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:21,333
Send yours in right away.

598
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:33,023
And I say, hey, it's going around breaking many hearts.

599
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:40,148
Stop it, please, before it's gone too far.

600
01:02:44,307 --> 01:03:03,070
And then he said, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

601
01:03:12,598 --> 01:03:14,279
19, let me see.

602
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:19,903
Oh, I'm older than most people in here, okay.

603
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:25,307
Let's see, no, 19, I think this might have been 1962, 63.

604
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:34,174
This was during the pre, this was on the way to being Civil Rights era.

605
01:03:34,574 --> 01:03:36,876
There was a young girl in Louisville, Kentucky,

606
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:49,366
who was eight, nine, 10 years old, who was building the library of sounds in her mind, who had two parents who were diametrically opposed stylistically.

607
01:03:50,186 --> 01:04:06,334
My father was Johnny Hartman, John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Johnny Hartman, oh my God, Johnny Hartman, Billy Eckstine, you know, he was the jazz head.

608
01:04:06,764 --> 01:04:15,347
My mother was Tennessee Ernie Ford, Mahalia Jackson, George Beverly Shea, you know.

609
01:04:15,607 --> 01:04:19,909
And then in between, somewhere in between there, Leontyne Price sprung up.

610
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:26,451
And then, you know, all of a sudden I'm eight, nine, and I'm starting to listen to

611
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:28,936
It's your thing.

612
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,238
Do what you want to do.

613
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:35,402
And my mother came to the room and she said, girl, what are you listening to?

614
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:36,763
You better turn that mess off.

615
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:37,683
I don't want that.

616
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:39,805
That's not going to be in my house.

617
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,547
You're not going to play that kind of music in my house.

618
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,448
So I'd be in the back.

619
01:04:43,953 --> 01:04:49,517
bedroom with my little turntable and I'd have no such thing as earphones back then.

620
01:04:49,817 --> 01:04:54,821
You just had to play it real soft so that she couldn't hear it because she wasn't having it.

621
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:56,802
It's your thing, do what you want to do.

622
01:04:56,902 --> 01:04:58,343
I can't tell you who to sock it to.

623
01:04:58,444 --> 01:04:59,825
She was not having that.

624
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:03,147
Now this is 1963-64, so this was the birthing of soul music, of

625
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:16,877
pop music, of R&B, of the Beatles crossing the road, of crossing the river, of all of the bluesy related stuff.

626
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:20,079
And it started to infiltrate my mind.

627
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:34,370
And then all of a sudden, ain't no way for me to love you if you don't let me.

628
01:05:38,828 --> 01:05:46,808
And she said, and it ain't no way for me to give you all that you need.

629
01:05:46,828 --> 01:05:48,091
You know who I'm talking about, don't you?

630
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:53,382
Aretha, and once, and I, what you want, baby, all right.

631
01:05:53,602 --> 01:06:00,924
And once she's without respect, and she started spelling stuff out, my mother said, ooh, that has an educational slant to it.

632
01:06:02,524 --> 01:06:05,244
She said, and her dad's a preacher too?

633
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:08,405
Ooh, I wonder how he feels about her leaving the church.

634
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:16,647
And then, you know, she started to warm to the style of music other than her favorite style.

635
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:25,168
My biggest inspiration during that time was a woman who sang a song that went like this.

636
01:06:25,188 --> 01:06:41,833
♪ Who made the mountains ♪ ♪ Who made the trees ♪ ♪ Who made the rivers ♪

637
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:47,541
flow to the sea.

638
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:57,605
And who's in the rain when the earth seems dry?

639
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:04,168
Somebody bigger than you and I.

640
01:07:08,265 --> 01:07:16,429
Who made the flowers bloom in the spring?

641
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:24,173
Who writes the song for the robin to sing?

642
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:34,397
And who hung the moon in the starry sky?

643
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:59,128
Somebody bigger than you and I. He lights the way when the road is long, and he'll keep you company.

644
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:24,099
With loves to guide you, he'll walk beside you just like he walks with me.

645
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:24,199
Yeah.

646
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,121
When I'm weary.

647
01:08:28,653 --> 01:08:32,316
And I'm filled with despair.

648
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:41,463
Who gives me courage to go on from there?

649
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:50,170
And who gives me faith that will never, never die?

650
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:28,563
Somebody bigger than you and I. Thank you so much.

651
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:35,614
Yes, and I tell Terry, we talk about growing up black.

652
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:42,137
How many had a grandmother that they stayed with?

653
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:51,943
Anybody that they got exposed to the grandmother's way of thinking, singing, cooking, working, dealing with life?

654
01:09:53,724 --> 01:09:57,766
I had a grandmother who was amazing.

655
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:00,388
She taught my mother everything she knew.

656
01:10:01,902 --> 01:10:15,465
And my grandmother would get up and walk from Lower West End, Louisville, Kentucky, all the way up to Second and Broadway, which was about, I would say, three and a half miles.

657
01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:31,028
And she would drag a basket behind her because she was going to the houses of white people whose laundry that she had washed, dried, ironed, creased,

658
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:39,733
folded and packaged to come up to their house and carefully place them on their beds.

659
01:10:41,994 --> 01:10:44,895
And she took no extra money.

660
01:10:45,295 --> 01:10:55,498
She got paid a very menial salary, and she fed four children, working with different Caucasian families in the Louisville area.

661
01:10:56,238 --> 01:10:57,779
But you know what kept my mother going?

662
01:10:58,879 --> 01:10:59,799
My grandmother going?

663
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,780
Every Sunday morning,

664
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:12,650
she'd be in that church, and she'd be taking them notes, and she'd be writing those scriptures, and she'd have her red marker pencil, and she'd be in there marking those scriptures.

665
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:18,113
She needed help in navigating how hard this life was gonna be.

666
01:11:19,774 --> 01:11:23,556
It already was hard, but she saw nothing but hardship coming.

667
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:26,678
My grandfather had a,

668
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:30,525
he was a porter, a porter?

669
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:32,186
A porter.

670
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:48,561
And his maybe first month on the job, he inadvertently hit something which fell off the train and rolled over in front of somebody that caused him to fall.

671
01:11:49,421 --> 01:11:54,586
And because he was black, and I'm talking really, really black,

672
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:58,209
they fired him.

673
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,751
And he also was injured in the accident.

674
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:04,694
And this was maybe 1930, 1932.

675
01:12:09,197 --> 01:12:10,278
He never worked again.

676
01:12:12,219 --> 01:12:16,823
And my grandmother had four children to raise and my grandfather.

677
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,785
So, you know, it was a lot of hauling of laundry.

678
01:12:20,415 --> 01:12:23,677
up and down Broadway to get to white folks' houses.

679
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:37,706
But one thing that she did, what she'd get paid extra if she could bring a couple of peach pies, a couple of cobblers, a couple of chess pies, some of those smothered pork chops.

680
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:47,152
Show me how you do the, show me how to cook those mashed potatoes because I tried, Ada, I cannot do it like you do it.

681
01:12:48,218 --> 01:12:56,883
So her secrets she kept close to the chest because she knew that was something of value that she could market and live off of.

682
01:12:57,263 --> 01:12:57,803
And she did.

683
01:12:57,823 --> 01:13:00,004
Oh, I forgot to take my glasses off.

684
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:04,147
You told me you were going to say something.

685
01:13:05,788 --> 01:13:08,069
But this was, I would stay with her sometimes.

686
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:12,231
She would be in the kitchen snapping beans on say a Sunday morning.

687
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:17,634
I'd go over on Saturday night and I'd be upstairs when she finally got a house that had a second floor.

688
01:13:19,304 --> 01:13:24,748
Or, you know, even before then, I'd stay with my grandmother, and we called her mom.

689
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:31,613
And it would be like 8.30 in the morning, just really an hour before church is supposed to start.

690
01:13:33,154 --> 01:13:47,205
And I'd wake up and I'd hear, ♪ Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

691
01:13:58,923 --> 01:13:59,684
Anybody know this?

692
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:10,910
Free to all the healing stream.

693
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:21,593
flows from Calvary's mountain.

694
01:14:21,633 --> 01:14:22,453
And here's the chorus.

695
01:14:23,013 --> 01:14:38,039
It says, in the cross, in the cross, be my glory.

696
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,041
Where is that coming from?

697
01:14:50,223 --> 01:14:52,145
What is that that's happening?

698
01:14:53,646 --> 01:15:08,659
Till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.

699
01:15:14,724 --> 01:15:16,045
She snapped them green beans.

700
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,510
And she put that pasta on, the macaronis.

701
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:21,851
She let them boil.

702
01:15:21,871 --> 01:15:23,993
She put the beans on low.

703
01:15:24,906 --> 01:15:30,650
She'd have a hen or a ham or some kind of beef roast or something.

704
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:37,395
Maybe she'd have her chicken cut up and ready to fry when she got back from church, which was right across the alley.

705
01:15:37,415 --> 01:15:38,616
That was an advantage.

706
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:40,978
And then she'd put on her clothes.

707
01:15:41,018 --> 01:15:42,539
She'd roll up her stockings.

708
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:44,766
she'd still be humming.

709
01:15:45,967 --> 01:15:49,371
I will trust in the law.

710
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:53,595
I will trust in the law.

711
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:59,381
I will trust in the law until I die.

712
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:07,066
I will trust in the Lord.

713
01:16:07,086 --> 01:16:11,788
I will trust in the Lord.

714
01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:19,072
I will trust in the Lord till I die.

715
01:16:19,092 --> 01:16:25,876
When she got through humming and singing and chirping through all of those songs, we were ready to go across the alley and go to church.

716
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:29,538
And she'd sit there with her red marker pen, and she'd mark up all the scriptures.

717
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:31,980
She was a church secretary.

718
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,120
She'd take notes.

719
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:36,621
This was an amazing, phenomenal woman.

720
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:41,623
Meanwhile, she bore these four children who were all part of the church as well.

721
01:16:42,084 --> 01:16:43,024
All of them sang.

722
01:16:43,504 --> 01:16:44,965
My mother was a soprano.

723
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:46,645
My auntie was an alto.

724
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:57,744
younger uncle was a tenor and my older uncle was a bass and they'd get up and they'd sing as a, as a quartet and it was amazing.

725
01:16:58,265 --> 01:17:02,230
It was amazing watching that growing up and I didn't realize how important it was.

726
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:05,695
I never realized it until I start talking about it.

727
01:17:06,825 --> 01:17:10,587
Because then I realized, this is why you are who you are.

728
01:17:10,607 --> 01:17:13,209
Because this is not just you, Donna.

729
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:18,292
This is John, and Larry, and Gene, and Imagine, and my sister's name.

730
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:20,133
She changed her name to Falasha Day.

731
01:17:20,693 --> 01:17:24,035
It's Falasha Day, and Felix, and Fred.

732
01:17:24,135 --> 01:17:26,357
And this is all your family members.

733
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:29,279
This is Ada and John.

734
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:33,481
And did I mention my father's mother and father were church people too?

735
01:17:34,202 --> 01:17:35,122
Pentecostal.

736
01:17:35,522 --> 01:17:36,283
Hallelujah.

737
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:37,482
Yeah.

738
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:43,585
Yeah, so it was kind of like, what are you going to do, Donna?

739
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:44,265
Well, I don't know.

740
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:46,846
I think I want to sing blues and jazz.

741
01:17:48,427 --> 01:17:57,511
And my grandmother would look at me like, mm, mm, mm, just snap them, snap them beans, snap them beans, snap them beans.

742
01:17:57,591 --> 01:17:58,431
And she'd go into it.

743
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:04,174
There's a sweet, sweet spirit.

744
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:10,640
in this place.

745
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:21,365
And I know it is the spirit of the Lord.

746
01:18:21,465 --> 01:18:23,086
Now, I'm going to imitate my grandmother.

747
01:18:25,006 --> 01:18:32,910
There are sweet expressions on each face.

748
01:18:36,188 --> 01:18:43,532
And I know that it's the presence of the Lord.

749
01:18:44,893 --> 01:18:58,700
Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly joy, stay right here with me, filling me with your love.

750
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:03,585
And for these blessings, Donna, get up, girl.

751
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,346
You're supposed to be in the bathtub now.

752
01:19:05,846 --> 01:19:07,407
We lift our voice.

753
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:12,090
You better be ready by the time I finish singing this song.

754
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:14,152
And she'd just sing and sing and sing.

755
01:19:14,192 --> 01:19:17,194
And then by the time I was ready, she was ready to leave.

756
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:21,137
She'd pull my hair up, tie it up into the little ponytail.

757
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:22,978
That's why I got this ponytail thing.

758
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:25,660
It's an old tradition in my family.

759
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,422
And we'd walk across the alley to the church.

760
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:38,362
and come back after that, and my mother and my father and my sisters and my brothers and whoever else from the church was hungry, they would come and have dinner with my grandmother.

761
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,183
And it was always enough to go around.

762
01:19:45,485 --> 01:19:46,006
You hear me?

763
01:19:46,026 --> 01:19:47,686
Uh-oh.

764
01:19:48,607 --> 01:19:51,228
That's my grandmother telling me, girl, you lying.

765
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:55,109
Why are you lying on me like that?

766
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,429
Why?

767
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,692
It's a meaning to everything.

768
01:19:59,732 --> 01:20:03,435
The prophecy is timed exactly right.

769
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:08,078
Yeah, and so that was my upbringing.

770
01:20:09,058 --> 01:20:11,620
I grew up a Christian girl.

771
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:19,645
I had no doubt in my mind I was gonna make it.

772
01:20:22,746 --> 01:20:31,711
When I decided I wanted to be an entertainer, I just knew once they decided, once they heard me and they discovered me, that I was gonna be a star.

773
01:20:33,152 --> 01:20:33,892
A star.

774
01:20:35,073 --> 01:20:37,734
I had no idea what a star was.

775
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:39,135
I had no idea.

776
01:20:40,016 --> 01:20:49,121
And I think many of the people that I was emulating, that I was admiring, that I was wanting to become like, many of them didn't know what that meant either.

777
01:20:50,965 --> 01:20:55,169
especially the African-American artists and entertainers.

778
01:20:55,650 --> 01:21:07,741
They did not know the industry, the business, the money, the exploitation that was behind the joy that they brought to the stage with them.

779
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:09,183
I'm just up here singing.

780
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:16,607
I'm singing because I love music and I love God and I love life and I love my woman and I love, I wanna tell y'all about it.

781
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:25,253
And somebody was recording them and made billions of dollars that are still flowing today off that joy.

782
01:21:27,014 --> 01:21:28,776
Now, do you say there's something wrong with that?

783
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:34,280
Is it like, what are you gonna do though?

784
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,562
You gonna allow it to steal your joy?

785
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:39,404
What joy you have left over?

786
01:21:40,483 --> 01:21:42,004
And what did their money do for them?

787
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,864
Look over there and see that man.

788
01:21:44,004 --> 01:21:47,086
He's still got scoliosis.

789
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:53,188
He's still recovering alcoholic, drug addict, gambling addict.

790
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:57,410
He's still got a wife who is divorcing him.

791
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:04,093
His life is no better off than anybody else's who are going through stuff.

792
01:22:06,244 --> 01:22:10,586
I can't feel bad about him, because I see what having the money did for him.

793
01:22:10,986 --> 01:22:12,467
Absolutely nothing.

794
01:22:13,488 --> 01:22:14,468
And I say, well, OK.

795
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:15,088
Go ahead.

796
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:16,989
Go ahead.

797
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:19,010
Be rich, baby.

798
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:20,311
Be wealthy.

799
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:21,312
I'm rich.

800
01:22:21,752 --> 01:22:22,452
That's what I say.

801
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:24,513
Be wealthy.

802
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:25,554
I'm rich.

803
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:26,554
All right?

804
01:22:26,774 --> 01:22:28,395
You can clap for that if you want to.

805
01:22:28,975 --> 01:22:31,037
If you feel me, clap it.

806
01:22:31,317 --> 01:22:31,817
That's right.

807
01:22:33,798 --> 01:22:40,003
So I decided at an early, early age, songs like this would help me through.

808
01:22:40,464 --> 01:22:43,566
And this song is called, If I Can Help Somebody.

809
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:45,428
Does anybody know this?

810
01:22:47,202 --> 01:23:02,833
If I can help somebody as I pass alone.

811
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:14,721
If I can cheer somebody with a word or a song.

812
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:41,280
If I can show somebody that they're traveling wrong, then my living shall not be in vain.

813
01:23:43,855 --> 01:23:51,827
If I can do my duty as a Christian heart.

814
01:23:53,177 --> 01:24:20,758
If I can bring back beauty to a world uproot, if I can spread love's message as the master taught, then my living shall not

815
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:38,134
Then my living shall not be in vain.

816
01:24:38,214 --> 01:24:51,380
No, my living shall not be in vain.

817
01:24:54,675 --> 01:25:09,380
I can help somebody as I pass along.

818
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:22,805
Then my living, then my living, I don't know about your living, but my living,

819
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:34,628
shall not be in vain.

820
01:25:36,109 --> 01:25:36,689
Amen.

821
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:45,995
I'm so inspired.

822
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:49,317
I'm going to go home and write a tune tonight.

823
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:55,873
Yeah, well I do have a tune, it's called Dear Heavenly Father, I'm gonna sing it for you.

824
01:25:56,314 --> 01:26:04,138
It really goes better with piano, but everything else is going better with piano too, so I'm gonna let my pretty songs hang out here by itself.

825
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:12,463
And it's called Dear Heavenly Father, and I wrote it back when I had been derelict in my faith.

826
01:26:13,844 --> 01:26:20,728
Right after Fisk, I kind of went like left field and started hanging out, getting high, getting whatever, whatever, whatever.

827
01:26:21,299 --> 01:26:21,639
Okay?

828
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,241
And it was the day.

829
01:26:23,861 --> 01:26:35,831
It was back in the day when I came just after the Afro scene and the Black Power and the, you know what I'm talking about.

830
01:26:35,851 --> 01:26:38,773
I, I came just after that movement.

831
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:45,269
And that meant all the drugs were around, all the craziness.

832
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:47,430
And I was 16, 17, 18.

833
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:51,433
I had never been exposed to any of that kind of stuff before.

834
01:26:52,033 --> 01:26:55,035
And I just thought, well, if you're going to be gone, you're going to grow up.

835
01:26:55,075 --> 01:26:55,676
You're going to have to use.

836
01:26:55,696 --> 01:26:57,817
You're going to have to do all of this stuff.

837
01:26:57,857 --> 01:27:04,882
You're going to have to see what it's like to be so absolutely incapacitated that you wake up somewhere and you don't even know where you are.

838
01:27:05,342 --> 01:27:05,943
How about that?

839
01:27:06,823 --> 01:27:07,544
See how that feels?

840
01:27:07,564 --> 01:27:07,604
OK.

841
01:27:10,413 --> 01:27:11,154
But I did it.

842
01:27:11,474 --> 01:27:11,894
I did it.

843
01:27:11,974 --> 01:27:13,235
I put myself through that.

844
01:27:14,656 --> 01:27:25,103
And when I decided that I wanted to somehow, if God would allow me back in the greats, I would let him bless me.

845
01:27:25,363 --> 01:27:27,885
And I would work in his favor.

846
01:27:28,065 --> 01:27:30,107
And I would talk about him with people.

847
01:27:30,847 --> 01:27:35,590
Even though I have, Terry can tell you, I have a little bit of slippage from here.

848
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:37,812
No, I have a curse in front of you.

849
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:43,173
Now, he said not lately, because he was on campus.

850
01:27:43,613 --> 01:27:45,634
No, I'm just kidding.

851
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:47,575
That's more information than you need to know.

852
01:27:49,475 --> 01:27:50,556
But the song goes like this.

853
01:27:50,656 --> 01:28:05,281
It says, dear heavenly father, I want to say something to you.

854
01:28:06,021 --> 01:28:07,002
I know.

855
01:28:08,389 --> 01:28:12,793
You're looking down on us.

856
01:28:13,534 --> 01:28:22,182
And you see what we're going through.

857
01:28:22,643 --> 01:28:28,728
So while you're looking down on your children,

858
01:28:30,431 --> 01:28:37,274
Won't you please bless the ones who choose to ignore you?

859
01:28:37,954 --> 01:28:39,655
And just remember us.

860
01:28:42,196 --> 01:28:43,336
Deliver us.

861
01:28:45,797 --> 01:28:55,101
Remember us in your blessings.

862
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:59,523
Ooh, dear.

863
01:29:00,682 --> 01:29:22,393
dear heavenly father i don't know if you're listening to me you see it's been a long time since i last talked with you for too long

864
01:29:27,009 --> 01:29:49,995
haven't seen so while you're looking down on your children won't you please bless the ones who choose to ignore you and just remember us deliver us

865
01:29:52,798 --> 01:30:09,897
please remember us in your blessings dear heavenly father

866
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,021
OK, I'm going to get you to join in with me.

867
01:30:29,081 --> 01:30:31,141
This is a congregational song.

868
01:30:35,002 --> 01:30:36,703
And it says, I will trust in the Lord.

869
01:30:38,223 --> 01:30:39,344
I will trust in the Lord.

870
01:30:39,364 --> 01:30:40,204
You know that song?

871
01:30:41,684 --> 01:30:43,525
I will trust in the Lord till I die.

872
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:44,725
And then it does that again.

873
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:48,706
And it says, then the second verse says, I will watch, fight, and pray.

874
01:30:48,726 --> 01:30:48,766
OK?

875
01:30:52,387 --> 01:30:54,829
And it does all of that the same way, the first verse.

876
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:55,850
I'll lead you through it.

877
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:59,012
And then it says, I'm going to treat everybody right.

878
01:31:01,554 --> 01:31:02,495
Very hard today.

879
01:31:03,475 --> 01:31:05,357
So hard to remember what you said.

880
01:31:05,617 --> 01:31:06,558
You said that, didn't you?

881
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:09,040
You said you're going to treat me right, right?

882
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,841
Mm-hmm, yeah.

883
01:31:12,322 --> 01:31:31,963
I'm gonna stay on my bended knees okay here we go I will trust in the lord I will trust in the lord I will trust in the lord till I die

884
01:31:33,724 --> 01:31:54,492
i will trust in the lord i will trust in the lord i will trust in the lord till i die i'm gonna watch fight and pray i'm gonna watch

885
01:31:55,292 --> 01:32:07,110
fight and pray I'm gonna watch fight and pray I'm gonna watch fight and pray until I die

886
01:32:11,115 --> 01:32:15,678
I'm going to watch, fight, and pray.

887
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:20,442
I'm going to watch, fight, and pray.

888
01:32:20,462 --> 01:32:27,527
I'm going to watch, fight, and pray till I die.

889
01:32:27,547 --> 01:32:28,768
I'm going to skip to the fourth verse.

890
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:34,052
I'm going to stay on my bended knees.

891
01:32:35,053 --> 01:32:38,776
I'm going to stay on my bended knees.

892
01:32:39,736 --> 01:32:48,260
I'm gonna stay on my bended knees until I die.

893
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:52,682
I'm gonna stay on my bended knees.

894
01:32:53,743 --> 01:32:57,485
I'm gonna stay on my bended knees.

895
01:32:58,425 --> 01:33:05,549
I'm gonna stay on my bended knees till I die.

896
01:33:05,629 --> 01:33:08,350
Now hum with me, because you know what they say about humming, don't you?

897
01:33:09,436 --> 01:33:12,738
They say if you hum, the devil can't tell what you're talking to God about.

898
01:33:13,778 --> 01:33:15,139
So you just hum through them.

899
01:33:38,224 --> 01:34:01,142
♪ I'm gonna trust in the Lord till I die ♪

900
01:34:06,982 --> 01:34:07,422
Amen.

901
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:15,728
Well, now, I have to check with, I have to check.

902
01:34:16,508 --> 01:34:17,409
Is it time?

903
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:19,851
Do some jazz?

904
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:20,771
Do some jazz?

905
01:34:21,832 --> 01:34:22,833
Okay, let me see.

906
01:34:24,354 --> 01:34:29,717
Well, there's one that's, you know, I did this the last time I was here, the Come Sunday one by Duke Ellington, right?

907
01:34:29,737 --> 01:34:31,058
Remember, y'all remember Duke Ellington?

908
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:32,940
Okay, so I won't do that this time.

909
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,901
I'll do something that really, really, really is a,

910
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:37,973
very, very lovely jazz ballad.

911
01:34:38,313 --> 01:34:45,420
And it's written by a classic jazz composer and keyboard player named Bill Evans.

912
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:46,981
Anybody hear of Bill Evans?

913
01:34:49,023 --> 01:34:52,646
And this song was made famous or beloved

914
01:34:53,354 --> 01:35:12,839
revered by his duet with Tony Bennett and that's how I learned the song was listening to Tony with the purest of dulcet sounds just really rush into my soul with this lovely melody and it says now she said she started saying no I'm kidding

915
01:35:19,903 --> 01:35:34,437
When lonely feelings chill the meadows of your mind, just think if winter comes, can spring be far behind?

916
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:44,766
Within the deepest snows, the secret of a rose,

917
01:35:46,517 --> 01:35:53,907
is merely that it knows you must believe in spring.

918
01:35:55,709 --> 01:36:01,036
Just as the tree is sure its leaves will reappear.

919
01:36:03,229 --> 01:36:11,173
It knows its emptiness is just the time of year.

920
01:36:11,674 --> 01:36:19,098
The frozen mountain dreams of April's melting streams.

921
01:36:19,598 --> 01:36:27,002
How crystal clear it seems you must believe in spring.

922
01:36:29,012 --> 01:36:37,656
You must believe in love and trust it's on its way.

923
01:36:38,976 --> 01:36:45,979
Just as the sleeping rose awaits the kiss of May.

924
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:54,383
So in a world of woe, of things that come and go,

925
01:36:56,113 --> 01:37:04,659
Where would you think you know you can't be certain of?

926
01:37:05,539 --> 01:37:13,064
You must believe in spring and love.

927
01:37:29,503 --> 01:37:30,984
And I am finished for tonight.

928
01:37:33,326 --> 01:37:33,646
Uh-huh.

929
01:37:33,766 --> 01:37:34,546
You think that's enough?

930
01:37:35,787 --> 01:37:37,088
Unless I want to do one more.

931
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:40,350
What you want?

932
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:40,830
No, I'm kidding.

933
01:37:41,851 --> 01:37:43,652
I'm kidding.

934
01:37:46,554 --> 01:37:46,874
OK.

935
01:37:47,014 --> 01:37:47,154
OK.

936
01:37:47,815 --> 01:37:48,275
OK.

937
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:48,635
OK.

938
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:48,976
OK.

939
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:49,256
OK.

940
01:37:49,276 --> 01:37:49,396
OK.

941
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:49,476
OK.

942
01:37:55,529 --> 01:38:01,934
I am weak, but thou art strong.

943
01:38:03,395 --> 01:38:08,979
Jesus, keep me from all wrong.

944
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:21,996
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk.

945
01:38:22,776 --> 01:38:28,099
Let me walk close to thee.

946
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:29,420
If you know it, you can join me.

947
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,983
Just a closer walk with thee.

948
01:38:39,264 --> 01:38:47,746
Granted, Jesus is my plea.

949
01:38:48,486 --> 01:38:56,128
Daily walk with close to thee.

950
01:38:56,889 --> 01:39:00,710
Let it be, dear Lord.

951
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:05,451
Let it be.

952
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:06,171
One more verse.

953
01:39:08,289 --> 01:39:24,358
When my feeble life is o'er, time for me will be no more.

954
01:39:25,879 --> 01:39:32,843
Guide me safely, gently o'er,

955
01:39:35,562 --> 01:40:01,612
♪ To thy kingdom's shore ♪ To thy shore ♪ Just a closer walk with thee ♪ Granted Jesus is my plea

956
01:40:06,568 --> 01:40:14,834
daily walking close to thee.

957
01:40:15,714 --> 01:40:20,638
Let it be, dear Lord.

958
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:25,901
Let it be, dear Lord.

959
01:40:26,682 --> 01:40:31,085
Let it be, dear Lord.

960
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:39,393
in the church today, amen.

961
01:40:44,736 --> 01:40:46,196
Thank you so much for listening.

962
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,140
Thank you so much.

963
01:40:55,181 --> 01:40:57,343
Oh, a standing ovation, Lord have mercy.

964
01:40:57,963 --> 01:40:59,344
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

965
01:41:00,244 --> 01:41:01,425
Okay, now here's what I'm gonna do.

966
01:41:01,505 --> 01:41:03,286
I'll move all my stuff out of the way.

967
01:41:03,426 --> 01:41:05,047
Get all my house.

968
01:41:06,925 --> 01:41:18,087
So I don't know if Donna realizes this but that that particular hymn the last hymn that she sung was really a signal hymn at Shiloh Baptist Church.

969
01:41:19,888 --> 01:41:31,550
Conrad Sharpton and Levi Adams man they used to sing that song and light the church up you know so so you you bring in that particular song.

970
01:41:32,115 --> 01:41:35,917
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

971
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:39,119
I mean, yeah, Billy Thompson, absolutely.

972
01:41:39,299 --> 01:41:40,019
Thank you, Rachel.

973
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:52,606
And so that really kind of brought home what this community has always represented in terms of the spiritual life of a neighborhood, you know.

974
01:41:52,626 --> 01:41:53,006
Come on with it.

975
01:41:53,927 --> 01:42:01,371
When I talked to her about maybe, what was it, January, February?

976
01:42:01,922 --> 01:42:02,582
February, yeah.

977
01:42:02,602 --> 01:42:09,844
When I think about the soul that I've seen on the wall, I'm gonna start crying and I'm sorry.

978
01:42:09,884 --> 01:42:14,885
And I think about the people who have made this community the strongest that it is.

979
01:42:14,905 --> 01:42:22,646
I think about the commitment, the love, the need, the dedication, the eye contact.

980
01:42:23,607 --> 01:42:27,928
I start thinking about what am I going to say to these people?

981
01:42:28,428 --> 01:42:29,708
What am I going to share?

982
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,048
Am I going to write a poem, or will I write a prayer?

983
01:42:35,108 --> 01:42:39,469
I didn't mean to rhyme.

984
01:42:39,529 --> 01:42:49,032
But I start thinking about you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, even though I don't know you yet.

985
01:42:49,452 --> 01:42:56,975
Because I know that there's going to be somebody who's never heard this, felt this kind of joy, commitment.

986
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:02,014
total consumption of the belief in the Holy Spirit.

987
01:43:02,394 --> 01:43:04,235
I know that there's people that don't know that.

988
01:43:05,276 --> 01:43:06,417
And they need to see it.

989
01:43:06,737 --> 01:43:11,801
And so it's my job to find songs that will cultivate at least a curiosity.

990
01:43:11,821 --> 01:43:14,183
I don't want you to be here going, oh, I really like this.

991
01:43:21,285 --> 01:43:24,446
a little bit into some of these tunes.

992
01:43:24,506 --> 01:43:25,326
The old church.

993
01:43:25,447 --> 01:43:26,207
The old church.

994
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:27,567
It's just good for the soul.

995
01:43:28,047 --> 01:43:29,428
That's all it is.

996
01:43:30,468 --> 01:43:31,849
I mean, I love praise and worship.

997
01:43:31,889 --> 01:43:32,549
Don't get me wrong.

998
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:34,090
I was part of it for many years.

999
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:37,491
But it doesn't touch the soul like the hymns.

1000
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:40,112
The hymn writers, they knew.

1001
01:43:40,272 --> 01:43:40,772
They knew.

1002
01:43:40,792 --> 01:43:42,693
They knew exactly.

1003
01:43:42,793 --> 01:43:48,535
I didn't mention any of the composers, but I had their names here because I really respect

1004
01:43:49,538 --> 01:43:56,705
When I make a copy of something and get lyrics, I put the composer down there because right now, you won't see who wrote the song.

1005
01:43:56,745 --> 01:43:58,107
You'll see who recorded it.

1006
01:43:59,228 --> 01:44:01,050
Don't be dismisled.

1007
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:10,279
A lot of times you'll type up a song and you'll see this was blah, blah, blah's version of whatever.

1008
01:44:11,266 --> 01:44:16,127
Don't look further than that, because blah, blah, blah did not write that song.

1009
01:44:16,227 --> 01:44:24,490
Find out who wrote that song, and how many other great songs that person has written, and what other artists that he's made a star through his songwriting.

1010
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:28,991
Because there's a lot of back information that we're never going to be able to get again.

1011
01:44:29,131 --> 01:44:29,591
That's right.

1012
01:44:29,751 --> 01:44:31,812
They want to keep us in the dark.

1013
01:44:32,312 --> 01:44:33,312
Oh, excuse me.

1014
01:44:33,412 --> 01:44:34,612
I'm sorry.

1015
01:44:34,813 --> 01:44:37,013
So let me say this.

1016
01:44:37,053 --> 01:44:39,854
Imagine you're a sophomore.

1017
01:44:41,077 --> 01:44:41,878
at Berkeley.

1018
01:44:42,758 --> 01:44:46,641
You just know that, like Donna said earlier, you's going to be a star eventually.

1019
01:44:47,341 --> 01:44:54,486
And you sit in this woman's class and she tells you that your A's are too sharp and your B's are too flat.

1020
01:44:56,788 --> 01:45:02,292
You know, so just sitting under a legendary singer

1021
01:45:03,855 --> 01:45:11,177
how it has molded so many of those young people as they go out into the world and try and become, quote unquote, famous.

1022
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:16,539
So Donna, I don't have the right words to say thank you.

1023
01:45:16,959 --> 01:45:21,020
Whenever you come to our little community, you bless us beyond belief.

1024
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:27,762
So I really, really appreciate you being my friend and coming to our little home in West Medford.

1025
01:45:28,642 --> 01:45:32,643
And giving some folks who haven't been here a chance to see what you do and how you do it.

1026
01:45:34,308 --> 01:45:34,688
Thank you.

1027
01:45:35,029 --> 01:45:35,849
Thank you very much.

1028
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:37,670
Thank you very much.

1029
01:45:39,512 --> 01:45:47,817
So that's a wrap for this new live edition of WMCC's Words and Music program.

1030
01:45:47,858 --> 01:45:56,624
We're so happy to have you all back here at the center and visiting with you all in your living rooms and other household spaces, those of you who are listening on the interweb.

1031
01:45:57,304 --> 01:46:04,307
I want to thank all of our guests for allowing us to invade their spaces, showing their faces, and sharing their graces.

1032
01:46:05,328 --> 01:46:21,235
A few of our guests have left, but I do want to extend special thanks to Mystic River Watershed Associates, Daria Clark, Mariangeli Echevarria-Ramos, and Dave Quilley for their time and expertise.

1033
01:46:22,759 --> 01:46:28,342
And the grand diva, of course, Donna McElroy for singing Spring Seed Into the Ground.

1034
01:46:29,322 --> 01:46:34,285
