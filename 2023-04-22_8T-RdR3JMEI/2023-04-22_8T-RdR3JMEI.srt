1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:07,056
[SPEAKER_10]: capacity in constituencies for sustainable cities, neighborhoods, and initiatives.

2
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:14,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Most recently, Dave served as a deputy of Echo Innovation for the Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation.

3
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,803
[SPEAKER_10]: That's in Dorchester, for those of you that are new to the program.

4
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:24,608
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife and I lived in that area for a number of years, not too far from the Dorchester Courthouse.

5
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:29,251
[SPEAKER_10]: He currently serves as an associate park commissioner for the city of Boston.

6
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:33,734
[SPEAKER_10]: and served on the mayor's Go Boston 2030 task force.

7
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:45,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Dave received Clean Water Action's 2014 John O'Connor Award for grassroots leadership and Walk Boston's 2016 Golden Shoe Award.

8
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:49,148
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you all for coming.

9
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:49,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dave.

10
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Daria.

11
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mariangeli.

12
00:00:53,534 --> 00:01:00,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we're still in the waning days of Poetry Month for 2023, I have to at least go there one time.

13
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:06,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you all know me, and I've written a lot of poetry that speaks to the legacy of the Mystic River in greater Medford.

14
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:15,024
[SPEAKER_10]: One particular piece was, in many ways, inspired by my friendship with Patrick Heron and the folks at MIRA.

15
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,085
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a little time to unfold, so bear with me.

16
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,946
[SPEAKER_10]: This piece is called, A River Runs Through It.

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of legacy.

18
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:28,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Monuments of wood and bronze and stone.

19
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:31,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Stories we tell and make our own.

20
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:34,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Colonial towns that stand the test of time.

21
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:37,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Old graveyards that reckon our lost prime.

22
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Thoughts that bring a poet to a rhyme.

23
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And a river runs through it.

24
00:01:43,598 --> 00:02:01,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of history, heroes that fought in foreign wars, Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Corps, pride and service that extends their tours, courage seeping, sweating through their pores, death and loss that bravery ignores, and a river runs through it.

25
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of misery.

26
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Native kindness lost in exploitation.

27
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:12,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Liberties for some through subjugation.

28
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:15,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Faith distortions used to build a nation.

29
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Confinement to the distant reservation.

30
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopeful spirits lost at every station.

31
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:23,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Museum cases filled with infiltration.

32
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:25,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And a river runs through it.

33
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:43,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of shame, treaties that were violated, tribes that were decimated, disease that was initiated, environment that was devastated, trust that was annihilated, greed that is still celebrated, and a river runs through it.

34
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of industry.

35
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:51,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Iron was smelted, tallow was melted, ships were built, frames were gilt.

36
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Leather was tanned.

37
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:55,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Bridges were spanned.

38
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:56,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Fabric was dyed.

39
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Fish was fried.

40
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:58,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Rum was distilled.

41
00:02:58,669 --> 00:02:59,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Barrels were filled.

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Glass was blown.

43
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Crops were grown.

44
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:03,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Meadows were stamped.

45
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:04,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Soldiers encamped.

46
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:08,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Milk was homogenized, pasteurized, and fortified.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,442
[SPEAKER_10]: And a river runs through it.

48
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:13,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of industry.

49
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Lies were told as papers passed.

50
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Covenants never intended to last.

51
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Stolen lands, great wealth amassed.

52
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Rampant corruption now put on blast.

53
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:24,599
[SPEAKER_10]: How did it get so bad so fast?

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,202
[SPEAKER_10]: This silent guilt that sanitizes.

55
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Race unrest that paralyzes.

56
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:31,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Black lives trying to matter.

57
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:32,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Brown skin made to scatter.

58
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Red blood spilt and splattered.

59
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Homes that only sell to some.

60
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Banks don't lend to everyone.

61
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:40,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Police don't look to serve and protect.

62
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:45,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Fear and loathing breed disrespect and a river runs through it.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:04:12,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is still a place of denial, for graves undug to drive a pile, for landed gentry remains on trial, for sins committed in the church's aisle and failure to turn equality's dial, for actions thought both vain and vile, no small amount of desecration where progress interred the bones of First Nation, with never a notion to a real preservation and a headlong rush toward contamination.

64
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:15,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is Missituk's compensation?

65
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Are bluebacks and herring a standing ovation?

66
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:23,492
[SPEAKER_10]: The watchers gather around the formation and a river runs through it.

67
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:34,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of nativity, indigenous braves or slaves in captivity, immigrant enclaves in exclusivity, a treacherous path to beloved community.

68
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:50,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Each clan wears a kindred face, covets a homeland's warm embrace, coveting gospels of time and space, every religion and every race, tribal spirits of fire and ice, a thousand types of beans and rice, and a river runs through it.

69
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:55,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of fertility, verdant shores by the sandy beaches.

70
00:04:56,078 --> 00:05:07,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Nature grows what the soul beseeches, ash and elm and maple preaches from the silent spring to the epic speeches, yet poisoned into the soil leeches, open wounds and ugly breaches.

71
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:12,429
[SPEAKER_10]: We've yet to learn what nature teaches and a river runs through it.

72
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a tapestry.

73
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:17,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Threads for every color and shade.

74
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Stripes for every soul displayed.

75
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:21,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Winter and spring.

76
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:22,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Summer and fall.

77
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:26,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Translucent rain that showers all.

78
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Rainbows await the heart's desire.

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Together we face the cleansing fire.

80
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Families grow strong with true resilience.

81
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Schools invest in each child's brilliance.

82
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:40,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Each one brings their gifts and talents.

83
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,633
[SPEAKER_10]: God's design puts the scales in balance.

84
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:49,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighbors embrace a common will despite the screaming fool on the hill.

85
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Poems are written that resonate still and a river runs through it.

86
00:05:56,085 --> 00:06:07,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of revolution, where new voices seek a new solution that doesn't begin with a cash contribution, that doesn't end with filth and pollution.

87
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:20,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Voices that hush when justice calls and push when progress slowly calls, presenting new and clear demands with concrete 10-year master plans and a river runs through it.

88
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:47,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of revelation where cooperative efforts rebuild and the local folk join the highly skilled to reclaim, rebrand, and re-engineer with the local folk who volunteer to pluck the refuge from marsh and shore with only the thought to refresh and restore so future folks embrace and explore and the river runs through it.

89
00:06:48,347 --> 00:07:07,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of vibrancy that takes great pride in its energy, that seeks out moments of synergy, that wraps its models in honesty, that guards its resources zealously, that seeks its level with urgency, and a river runs through it.

90
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:27,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Our valley is a place of true rebirth, as we try to protect our precious earth, where good people meet to set things right, and the cleanup ensues through the waning light, and then the party takes over the night, and the food and the music is out of sight.

91
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:37,292
[SPEAKER_10]: We gather our kin at the father's shore, and labor together to open the door, and a river runs through it.

92
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:44,075
Okay.

93
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:47,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I know it was a lot.

94
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:49,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it was a lot.

95
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:55,537
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm still teaching myself to write shorter poems, but I'm not a very good teacher, so.

96
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:00,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I want to start with Beyond the Bend of the Stream.

97
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:03,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's have a friendly chat with our folks.

98
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:10,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Dari, can you talk a bit about the work, your work, and

99
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,139
[SPEAKER_10]: how it engages and impacts young people in the MIRA service communities.

100
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

101
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Young people specifically or everybody?

102
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all young at heart, I guess, right?

103
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:27,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

104
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:35,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So a large part of my work is working with volunteers, which there's a few awesome volunteers in the audience today.

105
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:43,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always great to see your faces and hear your stories and how you connect with the mystic and what working with the mystic with your hands means to you.

106
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:49,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of activities and a lot of the work is powered by volunteers.

107
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:58,989
[SPEAKER_02]: We started off our organization fully volunteer with people who just noticed that the river was polluted.

108
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:09,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It had endured, you know, a lot of history of damage, which you just spoke to in your poem, and it was just these concerned residents who just decided

109
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:11,856
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't change what we don't know.

110
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they started collecting data.

111
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where our community science programs were born.

112
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:26,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people who care and people who say, I need to get more information so I can make this change that I want to see.

113
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:30,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where we started and we've just added more and more onto that.

114
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:44,448
[SPEAKER_02]: We collect data around the herring migration, the river herring migration, which you mentioned alewives and blueback herring, our favorite fish, unapologetically, which have just started their migration.

115
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this past week we saw our first ones.

116
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:50,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And it used to signal the new year for the indigenous people who lived here.

117
00:09:52,794 --> 00:10:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of bringing in the new year with this amazing migration of animals and so we have volunteers going out every hour from 7 a.m.

118
00:10:03,507 --> 00:10:04,308
[SPEAKER_02]: to 7 p.m.

119
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,512
[SPEAKER_02]: seven days a week which is just a huge amount of dedication and love and

120
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:13,155
[SPEAKER_02]: for the species that we know supports such a diverse and vibrant ecosystem here.

121
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are a couple of things that are happening right now.

122
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:21,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, of course, clean up trash where we can.

123
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,920
[SPEAKER_02]: We remove invasive species.

124
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:35,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing more and more planting, trying to establish healthy meadows, healthy trees for shade and for habitat and for so many other things.

125
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:47,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I guess all I do is help send emails so that everyone gets to the same place at the same time, but it's really the volunteers that are doing amazing, amazing work with us.

126
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:56,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, just, just, can you give folks a sense of, in the typical herring run, how many fish we're talking about?

127
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:58,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

128
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:07,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So way back when, they used to say that the herring were so plentiful that you could walk across the river on the backs of herring, which, can you just picture that?

129
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:08,712
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be amazing.

130
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:14,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely overfishing was a huge issue, habitat loss because of dams.

131
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:19,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the lowest, they really dipped down to around 200,000 coming through our river.

132
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:24,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the establishment of fish ladders, our highest number was around 700,000.

133
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,347
[SPEAKER_02]: which is huge, they've tripled in population.

134
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:36,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year we had the largest river herring run in Massachusetts, which is remarkable because we're the most urbanized watershed.

135
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:44,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Our river runs right through the middle of a city and a ton of impervious surfaces and yet these river herring are still coming in big numbers.

136
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:58,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're hoping that with a fish ladder or a fish passage installed at the next big obstacle, which is Scally Dam at Horn Ponds, that the Mystic River herring migration might reach over a million fish, which would be huge.

137
00:11:59,278 --> 00:11:59,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

138
00:11:59,558 --> 00:11:59,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

139
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:00,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

140
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's, it's, it's not a small thing, and I know they have an army of volunteers.

141
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:11,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I've, I've received some of the solicitations myself, I just haven't been out to get out there and count some fish.

142
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:17,371
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, that's, that's one of my future ambitions, is to get out there and count some fish.

143
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,574
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dave, I'm gonna switch it over to you for a second.

144
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:25,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So professionally, you're kind of a Boston guy.

145
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:33,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet, you know, you kind of, you made your way north and got involved with the work of the association.

146
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:37,181
[SPEAKER_10]: What, what kind of, you know, prompted you to make that decision?

147
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.

148
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:46,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw an opportunity to work with an organization that was doing comprehensive work.

149
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:54,167
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the work that I was doing in Dorchester was at an affordable housing organization, and I was kind of the outlier, if you will.

150
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like the green nag, I'll call myself.

151
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:04,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the guy that was always poking and prodding us to do more around sustainability, but the chance to come here was a chance to really

152
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:13,002
[SPEAKER_03]: do what I cared about, which was working at that intersection of science and climate and people, and do it in a place that really needed it.

153
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:17,728
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do this work in an urban area really is where my heart is.

154
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:20,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always liked working in urban circumstances.

155
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Always have.

156
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not always, but...

157
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time now, several years.

158
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:29,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just feels like something I wanted to do and have a great team that I get to work with every day.

159
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:30,965
[SPEAKER_03]: They inspire me.

160
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:39,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just wonderful to be around younger people who are actually doing this work, but also bring some knowledge and bring some awareness to the organization.

161
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:47,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so, so, not that there are any for anybody, you know, in these professional environments, but kind of a typical day.

162
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,409
[SPEAKER_10]: What does it look like for you?

163
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there is a typical day.

164
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:52,652
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

165
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a typical day could mean anything from working on a grant proposal,

166
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:06,543
[SPEAKER_03]: to working within municipality and people who care about trees in a particular city or municipality.

167
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:12,307
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of my work right now centers on dealing with heat, urban heat.

168
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:17,531
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2020, we did a big study called Wicked Hot Mystic.

169
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at all 21 municipalities

170
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,414
[SPEAKER_03]: in the watershed on a really hot day.

171
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:25,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a 90 degree plus day in the middle of a heat wave.

172
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:35,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So we figured out, and that was done with a lot of volunteers, figured out where the hot spots were through the whole watershed, and then we said, how do we begin to cool that, those places off?

173
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's now called Wicked Cool Mystic.

174
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:39,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Very Bostonian.

175
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:42,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked Cool Mystic.

176
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:45,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're trying to figure out, as Daria related to, trees.

177
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:46,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can we put trees?

178
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can we put cooling centers?

179
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:47,747
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we do?

180
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,648
[SPEAKER_03]: splash pads, playgrounds.

181
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:56,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of my work is grant writing, some of it's kind of figuring out the policy and where we're going around tree policy and planning.

182
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's managing a few staff in the organization.

183
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:07,321
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Myra's grown from five to sixteen staff now in about three years, and we're about to jump again, so.

184
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:13,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my work just involves day-to-day management of the organization, along with Patrick and Shelley, the other deputy director.

185
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:15,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful, fantastic.

186
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:23,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So you set me up perfectly for the question that I have for Mariangeli, because I wanted to ask you, Mariangeli, is that not reaching?

187
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:24,112
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

188
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

189
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:26,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use this one.

190
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:27,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, very good.

191
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:28,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

192
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:33,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so most recently, what has made you say,

193
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:43,426
[SPEAKER_10]: What the heck are we gonna do about how hot the weather is getting and how it's changing the river ecology?

194
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:44,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

195
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:54,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say that what has made me think, what the heck are we gonna do with climate change and heat, is a personal experience.

196
00:15:54,502 --> 00:16:03,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Last summer, I had the greatest idea to drive my bike and go to a friend's house and do it in the middle of a heat wave.

197
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the Caribbean, I'm from Puerto Rico, you are used to going outside when it's very hot.

198
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,998
[SPEAKER_01]: and you just do activities, go to the beach and spend time with friends.

199
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,020
[SPEAKER_01]: But here the heat is a little bit different.

200
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like sticky, more humid.

201
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to go to my friend's house and driving my bike.

202
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:26,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the middle of the way, I just had to step on the side and drink a bunch of water because I felt like I was going to die.

203
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, OK, there's a lot of things that need to be done about this.

204
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:35,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's by personal experiences, but also by listening to people.

205
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, OK, there is stuff that needs to be done.

206
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:46,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things that actually inspired me to study public health and then also to start engaging in work with Mayra.

207
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:51,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And also finding ways of how not just people can be protected, but also the environment.

208
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day, when we think about healthy communities, it's one health.

209
00:16:56,984 --> 00:17:02,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the health of the people, but also the health of the environment, because it's everything interconnected.

210
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:04,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic.

211
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:13,231
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's like a significant crossover between what you do and what you do, Dave, in terms of addressing that concern.

212
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:17,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in fact, we're starting to talk internally about how we begin to

213
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:20,126
[SPEAKER_03]: cross-fertilize across teams.

214
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:26,512
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the work that Mariangeli is doing is around health equity.

215
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:31,055
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of my work is around tree equity, but how do we begin to kind of combine those?

216
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,897
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at a big air quality grant, for example, right now.

217
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:38,900
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that intersect with her work and my work and the rest of the work in the organization?

218
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,441
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.

219
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:47,686
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one of our particular members that comes here on a regular basis, and trees is her, that's her big thing.

220
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:53,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm surprised she's not here this evening because she would have lit right into that part of the discussion.

221
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:57,832
[SPEAKER_10]: But good, I'll tell her that there's folks out there that are working on tree equity.

222
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

223
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:01,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and that will be very exciting to her.

224
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, you might get a volunteer out of it.

225
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:16,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so, Daria, I want you, if you will, to talk a little bit about... Dave's talking about equity, but, you know, in a little different way.

226
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:24,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you talk about, kind of, the people equity side, diversity and inclusion in presenting the river's resources to the local community?

227
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

228
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:35,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty blatant in this watershed that certain communities are facing environmental burdens more than others.

229
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think certain communities have access to nature much more easily than others.

230
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:51,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Our watershed is, it's amazing in that it's 21 different municipalities, but it's also, you know, 21 different areas experiencing very different environments and different realities.

231
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:58,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot of what we're trying to do is figure out, by asking community members who live there, kind of, what do you need?

232
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:00,284
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to see in your environment?

233
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:06,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing where we can kind of plug in and help with that in any way we can, yeah.

234
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:06,826
[SPEAKER_10]: So in

235
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:19,308
[SPEAKER_10]: in terms of some of the things that you're hearing with regard to, particularly, you know, folks, you know, who may be considered, you know, kind of underserved or underrepresented, what kinds of things are they asking for?

236
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,189
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can, you know.

237
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

238
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:30,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Maria Angelou hosted a really great series of workshops asking communities just that question, so I might pass it to Maria Angelou if you don't mind to answer that one.

239
00:19:34,173 --> 00:20:01,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that one of the first things that people are asking, and this project was hosted in Everett, so a lot of the things that people are asking first is to be heard and to be included in the process of like planning for initiatives that are related to environmental justice or related to climate change, because at the end of the day, the people that should be also expressing their concerns are the ones that are experiencing, for example, extreme weather conditions, the heat waves,

240
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:09,152
[SPEAKER_01]: flooding because you have the stories and it's your live experiences and that should be informing the policies and the programs that are created.

241
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:27,043
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in terms of on the ground work, people are asking for a lot of trees to be planted, public spaces where you can have fun with your family and your friends, but at the same time they can serve as spaces that you can not only socialize but also get cool during the summer.

242
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:31,628
[SPEAKER_01]: like having more water parks, water amenities.

243
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:38,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a lot of green spaces, places to hang out, but at the same time get protected.

244
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:44,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I had done some poultry work with the group over in Malden, Malden River Works.

245
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:51,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's really an amazing project that they're kind of more in the development stages of.

246
00:20:52,728 --> 00:21:05,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know all of the nuts and bolts of it in terms of where they are now, but I know they had a big series of public meetings and, you know, different gatherings where they elicited a lot of public testimony.

247
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:14,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's so much of what everybody was asking for woven into the rubric of the program that they're developing.

248
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:15,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, so it works.

249
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:16,887
[SPEAKER_10]: It really does.

250
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:17,948
[SPEAKER_10]: It really does.

251
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:18,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, please, Dave.

252
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to add, so we're really using the approach that Mayor Angelou mentioned.

253
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:24,636
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout all of our work now.

254
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So we center with the community.

255
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:27,759
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk to community.

256
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,301
[SPEAKER_03]: We say, what is it that you want?

257
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to figure out ways to do that.

258
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:38,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So our Wicked Hot Mystic work, when we looked at all the hot spots in all the communities, that's just one layer.

259
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We go back to those communities and say, okay, this is where we think it's hot.

260
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you think it's hot?

261
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:50,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, when you're walking on your street, would you say you wanted shade, or do you want a splash pad, or something, or a cool block?

262
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:50,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

263
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:55,324
[SPEAKER_03]: We circle back to the community a few times now, as a matter of course, in all of our work.

264
00:21:56,384 --> 00:22:01,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really critically important to center those communities that have been left out for so long.

265
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:05,426
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the neighborhoods we work in were places that were redlined, historically.

266
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So they never got parks.

267
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:08,787
[SPEAKER_03]: They never got trees.

268
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,267
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a lot of asphalt.

269
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:14,488
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a lot of driveways, but they didn't have a place to go cool off.

270
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, we're trying to begin to rectify those situations.

271
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And then,

272
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:25,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout all of this, we have 25 miles of greenway we're trying to complete that connects all these communities in different ways.

273
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:28,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to make sure that those greenways are also cooled off as well.

274
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:29,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

275
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:38,090
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, and you spoke about, you know, a lot of the neighborhoods being redlined, and that's really how West Medford began.

276
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a lot of people don't realize it, but at the outset of

277
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:51,404
[SPEAKER_10]: probably the late 1880s, 1890s, there were only three streets in all of West Medford where people of color could live.

278
00:22:51,424 --> 00:23:00,035
[SPEAKER_10]: There was this street, Arlington Street, the next street over Lincoln Street, and then the third street over was Jerome Street, and for many years it was like that.

279
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:15,472
[SPEAKER_10]: And then eventually a couple more streets got added, and we moved a little bit closer to the railroad tracks, but generally speaking, after you cross the railroad tracks, Medford was primarily a white city, and this was the African-American neighborhood.

280
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:38,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford's a lot more diverse now, but in ways that diversity has impacted neighborhoods of color in a negative way because all of the development has pushed people out from places that used to be the only place where you saw black and brown people.

281
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:43,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a thorny but interesting problem.

282
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:45,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good, very good.

283
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:52,132
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Mariangeli, what do you, what do you say, I mean, because you've got to meet them sometimes.

284
00:23:52,232 --> 00:24:03,801
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you say to the climate change deniers and folks that don't believe that global warming and heat spots and all this good stuff that Dave is talking about are real things?

285
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,462
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you, what do you tell them?

286
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,121
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.

287
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:14,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that it's something that we're already experiencing.

288
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:28,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of people that are in denial of what is happening, but if we look back last summer, we had like three back-to-back heat waves, and then just like last week, it's April, and it was like already 88 degrees, which was a record.

289
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:40,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like pulling on a lot of data, which is something that also our organization based on, we do a lot of research because it's very important to have data to show out there.

290
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:45,578
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, just like also sharing the stories that we hear through the watershed.

291
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:54,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for the people that still have trouble thinking that this is real, sharing what people in the watershed has said that they have experienced.

292
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:13,805
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, being in a heat wave and having a person that has a disability at home that maybe is one of like on the second floor of the house and it's difficult for them to have an AC there, just sharing what people live in their daily basis and mixing that with data is a very impactful way of like giving a message.

293
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,605
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we have been saying,

294
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:21,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some experiences, but people in the community are the ones that have more of the experiences.

295
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:36,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Also providing forums and spaces where people can share those stories by themselves, because we're just here as an organization that is trying to do work, but at the end of the day, this is something that is part of the community, and we are just helping on the way.

296
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:37,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

297
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:38,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

298
00:25:38,826 --> 00:25:47,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we've done here at the community centers is, you know, we've become part of Medford's network of cooling centers.

299
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:57,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, in the heat of the summer, you know, if people need to, if they don't have air conditioning, or if they find they're living in a, you know, in a hot zone, in a hot house,

300
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,217
[SPEAKER_10]: they can make their way down to the community center.

301
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:08,361
[SPEAKER_10]: They can sit in 68 degrees comfort and not get heat stroke.

302
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:10,022
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's real.

303
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:10,742
[SPEAKER_10]: It's real.

304
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:21,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just happy that there are folks out there that are collecting the kinds of data that can be impactful as people make decisions about whether or not they want to believe this thing.

305
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:23,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's real.

306
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,211
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very real.

307
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:30,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Dave, what, what, what MIRA projects and programs are you most excited about right now?

308
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:32,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything?

309
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:33,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

310
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:35,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

311
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:42,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd say our education programs have really expanded exponentially.

312
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:56,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Natalia, who's not here tonight, has just become a really great educator, and she gets help from Daria, and Mariangeli, and Marissa, and my team, and so we've kind of expanded our outreach to more schools, which is great.

313
00:26:57,258 --> 00:27:01,038
[SPEAKER_03]: The stuff that I'm working on in trees is really pretty exciting.

314
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been able to get some funding for trees.

315
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,259
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to get

316
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,760
[SPEAKER_03]: an earmark from Senator Presley's office.

317
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually, I think some of that money's actually gonna come to Medford.

318
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:21,186
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking to Trees Medford about planting trees here, both public and private property.

319
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:25,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will probably happen this fall.

320
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,930
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have gone after two very large pots of money.

321
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,413
[SPEAKER_03]: about $2.5 million and $4 million in earmarks for next year.

322
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:41,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Congress is kind of, despite what you hear in the press, Congress is somewhat in our favor right now.

323
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:47,041
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we hope to kind of be able to move some money our way and be able to do some more tree planting.

324
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:56,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say the air quality study, which I'm not totally involved with, but the air quality work again is, it kind of speaks to what Mariangeli was saying.

325
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives us a backdrop in terms of data, and allows us to say, look, this is the reality on the ground.

326
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,157
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the reality in the air.

327
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:04,959
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to do about it?

328
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,481
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to change in terms of policy?

329
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:11,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And that policy piece is something I think that's important for everyone to think about is,

330
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:14,999
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to say to your municipality around policy?

331
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, should you have more cooling centers?

332
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Should you have more trees?

333
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:22,263
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your policy around seniors and emergencies?

334
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:26,146
[SPEAKER_03]: How are health centers involved in emergency management?

335
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So you all as residents get to make the difference around that stuff.

336
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:35,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encourage you to kind of work through your politicians and make things happen that you want to see happen.

337
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:37,694
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of important stuff, really.

338
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:38,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

339
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:49,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Daria, can, can you, can you talk a little bit about, you know, your favorite moment or few moments of being part of the organization so far?

340
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

341
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:52,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big question.

342
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:54,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's been a lot of them.

343
00:28:55,243 --> 00:29:03,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that whenever we do these really fun community events that really have no goal except for people just having fun by the river, that's, those are my favorite.

344
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:06,909
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we did a Project Misik.

345
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:12,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a drumming workshop next to the river and just seeing different ways those spaces can be used and enjoyed by the community.

346
00:29:14,873 --> 00:29:24,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working with a youth, a collection of youth groups, and I first came to them with the idea of like, what if we had a forum and you could all talk to each other?

347
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:26,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all said, what's a forum?

348
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really want to do that.

349
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:42,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So they said, let's call it a celebration instead, and let's just bring soccer balls and volleyballs and big drawing pads, and just seeing that come to life from their vision, those are some of my favorite, absolute favorite moments.

350
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

351
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:58,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, one of the things that, you know, it's been kind of my aim to do is to, is to incorporate some of the work that you do with youth into some of the youth initiatives that we have here at the community center.

352
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:04,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So, like this summer, for instance, we do a program called Hoops and Hope.

353
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:08,050
[SPEAKER_10]: which is, revolves around basketball.

354
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:21,978
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, having a table and having materials to be able to give out to the young people and talk about climate resiliency and talk about, you know, school education programs, and that would be a good opportunity.

355
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:32,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we've already talked with Michelle Lieberthal about Juneteenth and, you know, having you be a part of the Juneteenth celebration that we're going to do here at the community center.

356
00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:46,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are lots of opportunities for kind of a cross-pollination of what MIRA does and what the community center is doing, particularly as a resiliency hub in the city of Medford.

357
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:49,587
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can definitely talk some more about that.

358
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sounds amazing.

359
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

360
00:30:53,308 --> 00:31:01,290
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mariangeli, what new climate resiliency initiatives are you excited about in this particular program year?

361
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:26,222
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the initiatives that I get very excited about every summer is that we have a partnership with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, where we partner to provide funds to community-based organizations and municipalities in the watershed to create projects in their communities that are addressing extreme heat.

362
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:33,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that is very exciting because it varies greatly of the different projects that are created through this program.

363
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:44,880
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, planting more trees or doing a community party where people can go cool down, but also build a network with your neighbors and with your family.

364
00:31:45,680 --> 00:32:00,398
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it gives money to community-based organizations to provide social services, like utility bill assistance, because we know if you have an AC and have access to one, turning on the AC during the summer can be also stressful.

365
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:11,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So it provides some extra funding for people to give that to the community and also just programs to actually access an air conditioner.

366
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:20,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great initiative that we have and we're trying to also figure out how this can become a long-term program because it started during COVID-19 as emergency funding.

367
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:27,607
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're trying to make this program longer so it can actually keep serving community-based organizations and municipalities.

368
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:35,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, last time I checked, West Medford Community Center was considered a community-based organization.

369
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:43,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to hang out with us and some of that funding that comes through you comes through you and comes to us, that wouldn't be a problem for us, okay?

370
00:32:43,553 --> 00:32:45,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought I'd say that, you know?

371
00:32:45,493 --> 00:32:46,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Seemed to make sense to me.

372
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:53,136
[SPEAKER_10]: So, David, as you think about collaborations and youth development and community building,

373
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:57,840
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you think Myra's, you're gonna have to dance the next time that happens.

374
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,806
[SPEAKER_10]: How will Myra build on the successes of the past year?

375
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:11,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll continue expanding our outreach.

376
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:27,853
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of, like I said, my work has been focused on some of the communities like Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Somerville, Medford, so how do we begin to expand outwards to other communities that are facing these same issues, facing the same issues around heat?

377
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,434
[SPEAKER_03]: that have the need for trees or some other cooling amenities.

378
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:35,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's one thing I'm thinking that we're gonna do.

379
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,720
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

380
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:41,104
[SPEAKER_03]: The greenways are starting to really take off.

381
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:44,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, does that include the Clippership Connector?

382
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that part of the... Clippership Connector is part of our, part of the network we're trying to complete.

383
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:49,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a bunch of things coming.

384
00:33:49,973 --> 00:34:02,697
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bridge that's going to be built, not this year obviously, but in the next few years, over the Mystic, along the Orange Line connection, between the casino and what's called Draw Assembly Square.

385
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:05,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's gonna, that's got funding, that's gonna happen.

386
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So if someone has to jump off the,

387
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,042
[SPEAKER_03]: a bridge, it'll be a little bit lower than the Orange Line bridge.

388
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:16,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's one way of looking at it, yeah.

389
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:16,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

390
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:28,654
[SPEAKER_10]: But just the notion of taking these disparate locations and figuring out ways to connect them along the river, it's pretty exciting.

391
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:32,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been, you know, to various places, you know, along the river.

392
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:33,737
[SPEAKER_10]: As a matter of fact,

393
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:39,160
[SPEAKER_10]: with a landscape architect by the name of Carolyn Lewenberg.

394
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:43,102
[SPEAKER_10]: We just developed, well, we didn't develop the space.

395
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:48,265
[SPEAKER_10]: The space is already there, but it was capped because there was some environmental damage.

396
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:54,568
[SPEAKER_10]: It's behind the Andrews School, and it's a new, it hasn't been dedicated yet.

397
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:56,409
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a new meditation space.

398
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:59,070
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very exciting, and she did

399
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:03,534
[SPEAKER_10]: low landscape sculpture with stones in a maze.

400
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:09,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And then at three positions in the maze, there's a post and tablet with poetry.

401
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, that's where I come in.

402
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,985
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I did the poetry.

403
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:20,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the dedication is on April 26th, whatever that Saturday is.

404
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:24,193
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's called Mystic Meditation.

405
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:43,002
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can walk around in the maze, and you can read the poetry, and you can, it's very, very peaceful, and it's right along the river, so you can hear the river kind of talking in the background, and you can, it's part of the Clippership Connection, so you can continue to walk that path for miles and miles and miles, so.

406
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:44,303
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a great project.

407
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be a great thing.

408
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be a great thing.

409
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:50,186
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me think we should be doing a little bit more with connecting people to art.

410
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:54,748
[SPEAKER_03]: and the river, just somehow thinking about ways to incorporate art more into our work.

411
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:55,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your guy.

412
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:57,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm your guy.

413
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, all right, very good.

414
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:06,834
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and I want you all to, you know, take a crack at these last couple of questions that I have.

415
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:14,438
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you absolutely, Dave, you go first, what do you absolutely want the people to know about Myra tonight?

416
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:20,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really focused on equity and engagement of community.

417
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,691
[SPEAKER_03]: That's at the core of our work now.

418
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:28,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when we started, we were focused primarily on the river, but the river isn't just the river.

419
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:32,316
[SPEAKER_03]: The river is the river, it's the communities around it, it's the people in those communities.

420
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:44,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how do we help you get what you want, connect you to the river in stronger ways, and really try to create a more vibrant environment for everybody who lives

421
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:48,884
[SPEAKER_03]: in cities in particular, in this city, in these neighborhoods, in your neighborhood.

422
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,044
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we work with you to do that?

423
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:58,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the one thing that I really wanna accomplish by the time I leave MIRA, which won't be for a long time.

424
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:07,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, follow up on that, I didn't know that there were actually 21 municipalities that were in your catchment area.

425
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:14,570
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Malden, Everett, Medford, and Somerville, and Arlington, Winchester, but that's probably where I stopped.

426
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

427
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,271
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is in there?

428
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:22,076
[SPEAKER_03]: All the way out to, there's a little bit of a sliver in Reading, I think, actually, Daria's got the map, so.

429
00:37:22,496 --> 00:37:23,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

430
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:30,143
[SPEAKER_10]: There are these maps back there on the table with other resource materials that Daria and Mariangeli brought with them.

431
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:44,947
[SPEAKER_10]: So please avail yourself so you can kind of familiarize, if you're not already, familiarize yourself with all of the geography that Myra has in its catchment, because it's very significant, again, more significant than I even knew about.

432
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

433
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:54,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so, Daria, one thing you absolutely want the people to know about Myra.

434
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so hard of a question.

435
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:09,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, kind of building off of what you just said, we are a municipality of, or we're a watershed association, and in our watershed, there's 21 different municipalities.

436
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:12,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might be wondering, you know, first, what is a watershed?

437
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to talk about that.

438
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:19,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an area of land where if a drop of water lands in that area, it drains to the same place.

439
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:25,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that definition, you might be wondering, why is a watershed association doing this kind of work?

440
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:30,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's just a great kind of regional unit where we can all think together.

441
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the water that affects you affects me, affects our neighbors.

442
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:49,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like just that the Watershed Association is here to be kind of a facilitator for collaborating across these boundaries where, you know, flooding doesn't stop at Arlington and not go into Medford.

443
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:49,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all together.

444
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:56,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so just as a resource and as like a, you know, a place to build collaboration.

445
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:57,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

446
00:38:57,332 --> 00:39:25,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when there was a gasoline or oil spill down here by the rotary, and it had, you know, a damaging effect on, particularly on that part of the river, and I remember how active Myra was in talking to folks about that and getting folks' opinions and disseminating information, getting that information back to the state and federal agencies that were dealing with the cleanup and everything, so

447
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:27,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's important.

448
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:37,127
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important to have an advocate and to know that, you know, that's a primary resource that MIRA provides can be pretty comforting to folks.

449
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:38,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Mariangeli?

450
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:57,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So one takeaway from Mara, I will say that we care about climate change, but even though climate change can be this scary term, or we are not really sure what's happening and what's gonna happen in the future, we approach this with a very positive lens.

451
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Initiatives that are addressing extreme heat, flooding, they don't need to be boring or scary.

452
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:10,707
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be fun, they can be beautiful, they can be places that community can come together and we can become stronger.

453
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:22,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So, having in mind that this is a work that, as Dave was mentioning, can have art involved, we can have festivals, we can just make it beautiful and fun, and that's a takeaway that I will say.

454
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:25,417
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do this work in a very positive mindset.

455
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:36,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been to a couple of the celebrations that you have, and, you know, they are fun, they are very engaging, so, yeah, you're doing a good job in that regard.

456
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:52,297
[SPEAKER_10]: So I always, you know, well, more recently than before, but I kind of like to flip the script and, you know, we're sitting here as, you know, an organization of record for the, you know, the historic African-American community of West Medford.

457
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:55,660
[SPEAKER_10]: So, do you have any questions for us?

458
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear more of that history.

459
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know it very well.

460
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:11,936
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our staff actually used to live a couple blocks away, so that's how I first heard about West Medford Community Center.

461
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:20,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always wanted to learn more, so I'm grateful to be here tonight, but I'd like to hear more of the history from folks who've lived here a long time.

462
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:31,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we got that, so you can come to any one of the senior lunches that I host Tuesday through Thursday, from 12 to 1.30, say.

463
00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:36,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, if you sit down and talk to anyone there, they'll regale you.

464
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,161
[SPEAKER_10]: They might give you more than you bargained for.

465
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:43,466
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing is that the building itself will tell you a lot of the story.

466
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:44,567
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two exhibits.

467
00:41:45,107 --> 00:41:54,115
[SPEAKER_10]: One is the Afro-American Remembrance Project, and those are the plexiglass-covered exhibits all the way around and upstairs as well.

468
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:57,338
[SPEAKER_10]: And they really tell the more contemporary history of West Medford.

469
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:02,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be certainly, well, I'm happy to, you know, have lunch with you, right?

470
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:03,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't make you pay.

471
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:04,785
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways.

472
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:29,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the upper, on the upper, those are, that's the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and there are 28 portraits of folks who have made a significant impact in the latter-day history of West Medford, a number of whom are still with us, still doing great things, and then many of them, you know, who are deceased, who have passed by.

473
00:42:30,143 --> 00:42:35,271
[SPEAKER_10]: but all of them represent significant history of this community.

474
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:38,195
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we can, we can, we can, we can help you with that.

475
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I will come back and I'd love to hear some of those stories.

476
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:41,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely, absolutely.

477
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:44,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Daria.

478
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:47,735
[SPEAKER_10]: You got a question for me?

479
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:48,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

480
00:42:49,115 --> 00:43:03,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things that we're acutely aware of is this idea of green gentrification, which is, you know, we make the environments, you know, we build these beautiful parks, we bring in more trees, does it just displace the people who are currently living here?

481
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:12,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, a conversation at every conference we're going to, and people are still trying to figure out the best ways to improve the health of environment without

482
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:18,712
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, displacing the people that live here, and especially the West Medford community, which has been here for generations and generations.

483
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:27,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just kind of, what would be your take on that, and what would you want to see that would, you know, make you feel good about it?

484
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:29,680
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, it's interesting because, you know, in,

485
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:54,222
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not so much green gentrification here, it's bricks and mortar, much more so, and it's development gentrification, because, you know, there are a number of very, very aggressive developers that have come into this community and really, really targeted it as a place where they can buy houses on the cheap,

486
00:43:55,103 --> 00:44:00,785
[SPEAKER_10]: renovate them, and then sell them for, in all honesty, ridiculous amounts of money.

487
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:21,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, again, we're retaining a good number of our trees and green spaces, and we're even having them, you know, be, you know, spruced up to a certain extent, but we're losing a lot of the history of the community because of the, you know, really rapturous development that's been taking place.

488
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:38,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's, you know, there's a couple people, I'm not gonna name any names or, you know, try and shame anybody, but everybody knows, you know, who's in the neighborhood buying up all the houses and turning them into, you know, million-dollar condos that don't look like million-dollar condos, but that's another story for another day.

489
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I think we're doing pretty well with regard to the green spaces.

490
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:50,327
[SPEAKER_10]: But West Medford is a very desirable neighborhood.

491
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:54,048
[SPEAKER_10]: It has access to public transportation.

492
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:58,691
[SPEAKER_10]: It has access to all of the major roadways in the state.

493
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:03,073
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a place where a lot of people wanna live.

494
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:10,737
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people who are moving from those high-rise towers that want a little bit of green space where they can barbecue and drink Zinfandel with their friends.

495
00:45:11,537 --> 00:45:14,779
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coming to buy places in West Medford.

496
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:19,243
[SPEAKER_10]: and a lot of the families that I grew up with are long gone and hard to find, so.

497
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:23,647
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, but yeah, so, so, green's good.

498
00:45:24,427 --> 00:45:25,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Brick and mortar, not so much.

499
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:26,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

500
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Mariangeli, what about you?

501
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:49,589
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is kind of related to what Dario was mentioning, but also, Myra, I joined Myra, and I have a public health background, and we're really trying to incorporate that aspect, because as I was mentioning before, everything is related, the health of the people, the health of the environment,

502
00:45:50,149 --> 00:46:08,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to know what are the concerns of the community, what are the concerns in terms of health, because we know climate change, extreme heat affects the health of people, and especially people that are older adults, children, people with disabilities are especially vulnerable.

503
00:46:08,828 --> 00:46:11,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to know what are the concerns of the community in that.

504
00:46:11,951 --> 00:46:15,555
[SPEAKER_01]: but also what other social issues are of concern.

505
00:46:15,795 --> 00:46:17,957
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, housing also plays a big role.

506
00:46:19,018 --> 00:46:26,425
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was mentioning before, utility assistance, conditions in your house, all of those social factors also influence your well-being.

507
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:48,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for a lot of folks, you know, and I've, you know, seen, have had, you know, various conversations about it, but I think mental health is always an issue, particularly with aging populations where you get into, you know, the spectrum, Alzheimer's and dementia and so on and so forth, memory loss, so I think that that's always a concern.

508
00:46:49,105 --> 00:47:03,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that one of the other concerns folks have, you know, the heat zones and global warming and creating uncomfortable situations for people, and how do they keep themselves cool, how do they ward off heat stroke and things of that nature.

509
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:27,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, the other area of public health that's a concern is, you know, kind of the changing nature of the healthcare industry, consolidations in big hospitals and the loss of, you know, local health centers where folks, you know, with Medicare and various different types of health plans,

510
00:47:28,323 --> 00:47:38,325
[SPEAKER_10]: can feel as comfortable going and getting quality services as they might get at Mass General Brigham or, you know, one of the larger hospitals.

511
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:46,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we, the principal hospital in Medford for many, many years was Lawrence Memorial.

512
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:52,588
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, in the consolidation, the nature of what takes place at Lawrence Memorial is very different these days.

513
00:47:53,368 --> 00:48:03,344
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, so that, that kind of loss, the changes at Melrose-Wakefield, changes at, you know, various hospitals in the area, you know, that, that's, that's been concerning.

514
00:48:03,905 --> 00:48:05,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think those would be some of the things.

515
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:13,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to add that I brought some resources for what to do when it's very hot outside, and they're in the table.

516
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:20,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're wondering how you can keep yourself cool and protect yourself, your family, and your community, they're in the table at the back.

517
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:21,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic, fantastic.

518
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:28,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've run a little bit over what we scheduled to do, but it's an important conversation, and I'm really so thankful

519
00:48:29,412 --> 00:48:31,853
[SPEAKER_10]: that you guys came here to have it with us.

520
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:41,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, sometime in the future, we hope to have you back again, and we'll take up a little bit more of what we talked about tonight, and I'm sure there'll be new things to talk about as well.

521
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:45,941
[SPEAKER_10]: So, folks, could you show some love to Daria and Mariangeli and Dave?

522
00:48:47,322 --> 00:48:48,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

523
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:51,365
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so we're going to take a pause.

524
00:48:51,405 --> 00:48:56,010
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to break the set down so that we can get ready for the musical entertainment.

525
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:59,054
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'll be back to do some promotional stuff.

526
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll keep it rolling.

602
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:19,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm older than most people in here, okay.

603
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:25,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, no, 19, I think this might have been 1962, 63.

604
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:34,174
[SPEAKER_05]: This was during the pre, this was on the way to being Civil Rights era.

605
01:03:34,574 --> 01:03:36,876
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a young girl in Louisville, Kentucky,

606
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:49,366
[SPEAKER_05]: who was eight, nine, 10 years old, who was building the library of sounds in her mind, who had two parents who were diametrically opposed stylistically.

607
01:03:50,186 --> 01:04:06,334
[SPEAKER_05]: My father was Johnny Hartman, John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Johnny Hartman, oh my God, Johnny Hartman, Billy Eckstine, you know, he was the jazz head.

608
01:04:06,764 --> 01:04:15,347
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother was Tennessee Ernie Ford, Mahalia Jackson, George Beverly Shea, you know.

609
01:04:15,607 --> 01:04:19,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in between, somewhere in between there, Leontyne Price sprung up.

610
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:26,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, all of a sudden I'm eight, nine, and I'm starting to listen to

611
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:28,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your thing.

612
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Do what you want to do.

613
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:35,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And my mother came to the room and she said, girl, what are you listening to?

614
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:36,763
[SPEAKER_05]: You better turn that mess off.

615
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:37,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want that.

616
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:39,805
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to be in my house.

617
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,547
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to play that kind of music in my house.

618
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd be in the back.

619
01:04:43,953 --> 01:04:49,517
[SPEAKER_05]: bedroom with my little turntable and I'd have no such thing as earphones back then.

620
01:04:49,817 --> 01:04:54,821
[SPEAKER_05]: You just had to play it real soft so that she couldn't hear it because she wasn't having it.

621
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:56,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your thing, do what you want to do.

622
01:04:56,902 --> 01:04:58,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you who to sock it to.

623
01:04:58,444 --> 01:04:59,825
[SPEAKER_05]: She was not having that.

624
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:03,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is 1963-64, so this was the birthing of soul music, of

625
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:16,877
[SPEAKER_05]: pop music, of R&B, of the Beatles crossing the road, of crossing the river, of all of the bluesy related stuff.

626
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:20,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started to infiltrate my mind.

627
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:34,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden, ain't no way for me to love you if you don't let me.

628
01:05:38,828 --> 01:05:46,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, and it ain't no way for me to give you all that you need.

629
01:05:46,828 --> 01:05:48,091
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who I'm talking about, don't you?

630
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:53,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Aretha, and once, and I, what you want, baby, all right.

631
01:05:53,602 --> 01:06:00,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And once she's without respect, and she started spelling stuff out, my mother said, ooh, that has an educational slant to it.

632
01:06:02,524 --> 01:06:05,244
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, and her dad's a preacher too?

633
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:08,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I wonder how he feels about her leaving the church.

634
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:16,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, she started to warm to the style of music other than her favorite style.

635
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:25,168
[SPEAKER_05]: My biggest inspiration during that time was a woman who sang a song that went like this.

636
01:06:25,188 --> 01:06:41,833
[SPEAKER_05]: ♪ Who made the mountains ♪ ♪ Who made the trees ♪ ♪ Who made the rivers ♪

637
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:47,541
[SPEAKER_04]: flow to the sea.

638
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:57,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And who's in the rain when the earth seems dry?

639
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:04,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody bigger than you and I.

640
01:07:08,265 --> 01:07:16,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Who made the flowers bloom in the spring?

641
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:24,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Who writes the song for the robin to sing?

642
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:34,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And who hung the moon in the starry sky?

643
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:59,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody bigger than you and I. He lights the way when the road is long, and he'll keep you company.

644
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:24,099
[SPEAKER_07]: With loves to guide you, he'll walk beside you just like he walks with me.

645
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:24,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

646
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,121
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm weary.

647
01:08:28,653 --> 01:08:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm filled with despair.

648
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:41,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Who gives me courage to go on from there?

649
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:50,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And who gives me faith that will never, never die?

650
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:28,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody bigger than you and I. Thank you so much.

651
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:35,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I tell Terry, we talk about growing up black.

652
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:42,137
[SPEAKER_05]: How many had a grandmother that they stayed with?

653
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:51,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody that they got exposed to the grandmother's way of thinking, singing, cooking, working, dealing with life?

654
01:09:53,724 --> 01:09:57,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a grandmother who was amazing.

655
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:00,388
[SPEAKER_05]: She taught my mother everything she knew.

656
01:10:01,902 --> 01:10:15,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And my grandmother would get up and walk from Lower West End, Louisville, Kentucky, all the way up to Second and Broadway, which was about, I would say, three and a half miles.

657
01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:31,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And she would drag a basket behind her because she was going to the houses of white people whose laundry that she had washed, dried, ironed, creased,

658
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:39,733
[SPEAKER_05]: folded and packaged to come up to their house and carefully place them on their beds.

659
01:10:41,994 --> 01:10:44,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And she took no extra money.

660
01:10:45,295 --> 01:10:55,498
[SPEAKER_05]: She got paid a very menial salary, and she fed four children, working with different Caucasian families in the Louisville area.

661
01:10:56,238 --> 01:10:57,779
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what kept my mother going?

662
01:10:58,879 --> 01:10:59,799
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandmother going?

663
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Every Sunday morning,

664
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:12,650
[SPEAKER_05]: she'd be in that church, and she'd be taking them notes, and she'd be writing those scriptures, and she'd have her red marker pencil, and she'd be in there marking those scriptures.

665
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:18,113
[SPEAKER_05]: She needed help in navigating how hard this life was gonna be.

666
01:11:19,774 --> 01:11:23,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It already was hard, but she saw nothing but hardship coming.

667
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:26,678
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandfather had a,

668
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:30,525
[SPEAKER_05]: he was a porter, a porter?

669
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:32,186
[SPEAKER_05]: A porter.

670
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:48,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And his maybe first month on the job, he inadvertently hit something which fell off the train and rolled over in front of somebody that caused him to fall.

671
01:11:49,421 --> 01:11:54,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And because he was black, and I'm talking really, really black,

672
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:58,209
[SPEAKER_05]: they fired him.

673
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And he also was injured in the accident.

674
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:04,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was maybe 1930, 1932.

675
01:12:09,197 --> 01:12:10,278
[SPEAKER_05]: He never worked again.

676
01:12:12,219 --> 01:12:16,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And my grandmother had four children to raise and my grandfather.

677
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,785
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it was a lot of hauling of laundry.

678
01:12:20,415 --> 01:12:23,677
[SPEAKER_05]: up and down Broadway to get to white folks' houses.

679
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:37,706
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing that she did, what she'd get paid extra if she could bring a couple of peach pies, a couple of cobblers, a couple of chess pies, some of those smothered pork chops.

680
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:47,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me how you do the, show me how to cook those mashed potatoes because I tried, Ada, I cannot do it like you do it.

681
01:12:48,218 --> 01:12:56,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So her secrets she kept close to the chest because she knew that was something of value that she could market and live off of.

682
01:12:57,263 --> 01:12:57,803
[SPEAKER_05]: And she did.

683
01:12:57,823 --> 01:13:00,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I forgot to take my glasses off.

684
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:04,147
[SPEAKER_05]: You told me you were going to say something.

685
01:13:05,788 --> 01:13:08,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was, I would stay with her sometimes.

686
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:12,231
[SPEAKER_05]: She would be in the kitchen snapping beans on say a Sunday morning.

687
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:17,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go over on Saturday night and I'd be upstairs when she finally got a house that had a second floor.

688
01:13:19,304 --> 01:13:24,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, even before then, I'd stay with my grandmother, and we called her mom.

689
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:31,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would be like 8.30 in the morning, just really an hour before church is supposed to start.

690
01:13:33,154 --> 01:13:47,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd wake up and I'd hear, ♪ Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

691
01:13:58,923 --> 01:13:59,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody know this?

692
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:10,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Free to all the healing stream.

693
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:21,593
[SPEAKER_04]: flows from Calvary's mountain.

694
01:14:21,633 --> 01:14:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the chorus.

695
01:14:23,013 --> 01:14:38,039
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, in the cross, in the cross, be my glory.

696
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is that coming from?

697
01:14:50,223 --> 01:14:52,145
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that that's happening?

698
01:14:53,646 --> 01:15:08,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.

699
01:15:14,724 --> 01:15:16,045
[SPEAKER_05]: She snapped them green beans.

700
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And she put that pasta on, the macaronis.

701
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:21,851
[SPEAKER_05]: She let them boil.

702
01:15:21,871 --> 01:15:23,993
[SPEAKER_05]: She put the beans on low.

703
01:15:24,906 --> 01:15:30,650
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd have a hen or a ham or some kind of beef roast or something.

704
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:37,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe she'd have her chicken cut up and ready to fry when she got back from church, which was right across the alley.

705
01:15:37,415 --> 01:15:38,616
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an advantage.

706
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:40,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she'd put on her clothes.

707
01:15:41,018 --> 01:15:42,539
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd roll up her stockings.

708
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:44,766
[SPEAKER_05]: she'd still be humming.

709
01:15:45,967 --> 01:15:49,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I will trust in the law.

710
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I will trust in the law.

711
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:59,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I will trust in the law until I die.

712
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:07,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I will trust in the Lord.

713
01:16:07,086 --> 01:16:11,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I will trust in the Lord.

714
01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:19,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I will trust in the Lord till I die.

715
01:16:19,092 --> 01:16:25,876
[SPEAKER_05]: When she got through humming and singing and chirping through all of those songs, we were ready to go across the alley and go to church.

716
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:29,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And she'd sit there with her red marker pen, and she'd mark up all the scriptures.

717
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:31,980
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a church secretary.

718
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,120
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd take notes.

719
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:36,621
[SPEAKER_05]: This was an amazing, phenomenal woman.

720
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:41,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, she bore these four children who were all part of the church as well.

721
01:16:42,084 --> 01:16:43,024
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them sang.

722
01:16:43,504 --> 01:16:44,965
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother was a soprano.

723
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:46,645
[SPEAKER_05]: My auntie was an alto.

724
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:57,744
[SPEAKER_05]: younger uncle was a tenor and my older uncle was a bass and they'd get up and they'd sing as a, as a quartet and it was amazing.

725
01:16:58,265 --> 01:17:02,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing watching that growing up and I didn't realize how important it was.

726
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:05,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I never realized it until I start talking about it.

727
01:17:06,825 --> 01:17:10,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then I realized, this is why you are who you are.

728
01:17:10,607 --> 01:17:13,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is not just you, Donna.

729
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:18,292
[SPEAKER_05]: This is John, and Larry, and Gene, and Imagine, and my sister's name.

730
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: She changed her name to Falasha Day.

731
01:17:20,693 --> 01:17:24,035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Falasha Day, and Felix, and Fred.

732
01:17:24,135 --> 01:17:26,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is all your family members.

733
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:29,279
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Ada and John.

734
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:33,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And did I mention my father's mother and father were church people too?

735
01:17:34,202 --> 01:17:35,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Pentecostal.

736
01:17:35,522 --> 01:17:36,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Hallelujah.

737
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:37,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

738
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:43,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it was kind of like, what are you going to do, Donna?

739
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:44,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

740
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:46,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I want to sing blues and jazz.

741
01:17:48,427 --> 01:17:57,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And my grandmother would look at me like, mm, mm, mm, just snap them, snap them beans, snap them beans, snap them beans.

742
01:17:57,591 --> 01:17:58,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And she'd go into it.

743
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:04,174
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a sweet, sweet spirit.

744
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:10,640
[SPEAKER_04]: in this place.

745
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:21,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it is the spirit of the Lord.

746
01:18:21,465 --> 01:18:23,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm going to imitate my grandmother.

747
01:18:25,006 --> 01:18:32,910
[SPEAKER_04]: There are sweet expressions on each face.

748
01:18:36,188 --> 01:18:43,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that it's the presence of the Lord.

749
01:18:44,893 --> 01:18:58,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly joy, stay right here with me, filling me with your love.

750
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:03,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And for these blessings, Donna, get up, girl.

751
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,346
[SPEAKER_05]: You're supposed to be in the bathtub now.

752
01:19:05,846 --> 01:19:07,407
[SPEAKER_05]: We lift our voice.

753
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: You better be ready by the time I finish singing this song.

754
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:14,152
[SPEAKER_05]: And she'd just sing and sing and sing.

755
01:19:14,192 --> 01:19:17,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And then by the time I was ready, she was ready to leave.

756
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:21,137
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd pull my hair up, tie it up into the little ponytail.

757
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:22,978
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I got this ponytail thing.

758
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:25,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an old tradition in my family.

759
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd walk across the alley to the church.

760
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:38,362
[SPEAKER_05]: and come back after that, and my mother and my father and my sisters and my brothers and whoever else from the church was hungry, they would come and have dinner with my grandmother.

761
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was always enough to go around.

762
01:19:45,485 --> 01:19:46,006
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear me?

763
01:19:46,026 --> 01:19:47,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

764
01:19:48,607 --> 01:19:51,228
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my grandmother telling me, girl, you lying.

765
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:55,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you lying on me like that?

766
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

767
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,692
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a meaning to everything.

768
01:19:59,732 --> 01:20:03,435
[SPEAKER_05]: The prophecy is timed exactly right.

769
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:08,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so that was my upbringing.

770
01:20:09,058 --> 01:20:11,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up a Christian girl.

771
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:19,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no doubt in my mind I was gonna make it.

772
01:20:22,746 --> 01:20:31,711
[SPEAKER_05]: When I decided I wanted to be an entertainer, I just knew once they decided, once they heard me and they discovered me, that I was gonna be a star.

773
01:20:33,152 --> 01:20:33,892
[SPEAKER_05]: A star.

774
01:20:35,073 --> 01:20:37,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea what a star was.

775
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:39,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea.

776
01:20:40,016 --> 01:20:49,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think many of the people that I was emulating, that I was admiring, that I was wanting to become like, many of them didn't know what that meant either.

777
01:20:50,965 --> 01:20:55,169
[SPEAKER_05]: especially the African-American artists and entertainers.

778
01:20:55,650 --> 01:21:07,741
[SPEAKER_05]: They did not know the industry, the business, the money, the exploitation that was behind the joy that they brought to the stage with them.

779
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:09,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just up here singing.

780
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:16,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm singing because I love music and I love God and I love life and I love my woman and I love, I wanna tell y'all about it.

781
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:25,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And somebody was recording them and made billions of dollars that are still flowing today off that joy.

782
01:21:27,014 --> 01:21:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, do you say there's something wrong with that?

783
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:34,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like, what are you gonna do though?

784
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,562
[SPEAKER_05]: You gonna allow it to steal your joy?

785
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:39,404
[SPEAKER_05]: What joy you have left over?

786
01:21:40,483 --> 01:21:42,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did their money do for them?

787
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Look over there and see that man.

788
01:21:44,004 --> 01:21:47,086
[SPEAKER_05]: He's still got scoliosis.

789
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:53,188
[SPEAKER_05]: He's still recovering alcoholic, drug addict, gambling addict.

790
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:57,410
[SPEAKER_05]: He's still got a wife who is divorcing him.

791
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:04,093
[SPEAKER_05]: His life is no better off than anybody else's who are going through stuff.

792
01:22:06,244 --> 01:22:10,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't feel bad about him, because I see what having the money did for him.

793
01:22:10,986 --> 01:22:12,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely nothing.

794
01:22:13,488 --> 01:22:14,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, well, OK.

795
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:15,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

796
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

797
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:19,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Be rich, baby.

798
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:20,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Be wealthy.

799
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:21,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rich.

800
01:22:21,752 --> 01:22:22,452
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I say.

801
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:24,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Be wealthy.

802
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:25,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rich.

803
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:26,554
[SPEAKER_05]: All right?

804
01:22:26,774 --> 01:22:28,395
[SPEAKER_05]: You can clap for that if you want to.

805
01:22:28,975 --> 01:22:31,037
[SPEAKER_05]: If you feel me, clap it.

806
01:22:31,317 --> 01:22:31,817
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

807
01:22:33,798 --> 01:22:40,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So I decided at an early, early age, songs like this would help me through.

808
01:22:40,464 --> 01:22:43,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And this song is called, If I Can Help Somebody.

809
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:45,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody know this?

810
01:22:47,202 --> 01:23:02,833
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can help somebody as I pass alone.

811
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:14,721
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can cheer somebody with a word or a song.

812
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:41,280
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can show somebody that they're traveling wrong, then my living shall not be in vain.

813
01:23:43,855 --> 01:23:51,827
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can do my duty as a Christian heart.

814
01:23:53,177 --> 01:24:20,758
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can bring back beauty to a world uproot, if I can spread love's message as the master taught, then my living shall not

815
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:38,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Then my living shall not be in vain.

816
01:24:38,214 --> 01:24:51,380
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my living shall not be in vain.

817
01:24:54,675 --> 01:25:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I can help somebody as I pass along.

818
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:22,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Then my living, then my living, I don't know about your living, but my living,

819
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:34,628
[SPEAKER_04]: shall not be in vain.

820
01:25:36,109 --> 01:25:36,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen.

821
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:45,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so inspired.

822
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:49,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go home and write a tune tonight.

823
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:55,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well I do have a tune, it's called Dear Heavenly Father, I'm gonna sing it for you.

824
01:25:56,314 --> 01:26:04,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It really goes better with piano, but everything else is going better with piano too, so I'm gonna let my pretty songs hang out here by itself.

825
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:12,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's called Dear Heavenly Father, and I wrote it back when I had been derelict in my faith.

826
01:26:13,844 --> 01:26:20,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Right after Fisk, I kind of went like left field and started hanging out, getting high, getting whatever, whatever, whatever.

827
01:26:21,299 --> 01:26:21,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

828
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the day.

829
01:26:23,861 --> 01:26:35,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It was back in the day when I came just after the Afro scene and the Black Power and the, you know what I'm talking about.

830
01:26:35,851 --> 01:26:38,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I came just after that movement.

831
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:45,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And that meant all the drugs were around, all the craziness.

832
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:47,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was 16, 17, 18.

833
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:51,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I had never been exposed to any of that kind of stuff before.

834
01:26:52,033 --> 01:26:55,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just thought, well, if you're going to be gone, you're going to grow up.

835
01:26:55,075 --> 01:26:55,676
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to use.

836
01:26:55,696 --> 01:26:57,817
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to do all of this stuff.

837
01:26:57,857 --> 01:27:04,882
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to see what it's like to be so absolutely incapacitated that you wake up somewhere and you don't even know where you are.

838
01:27:05,342 --> 01:27:05,943
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

839
01:27:06,823 --> 01:27:07,544
[SPEAKER_05]: See how that feels?

840
01:27:07,564 --> 01:27:07,604
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

841
01:27:10,413 --> 01:27:11,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did it.

842
01:27:11,474 --> 01:27:11,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it.

843
01:27:11,974 --> 01:27:13,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I put myself through that.

844
01:27:14,656 --> 01:27:25,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I decided that I wanted to somehow, if God would allow me back in the greats, I would let him bless me.

845
01:27:25,363 --> 01:27:27,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would work in his favor.

846
01:27:28,065 --> 01:27:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would talk about him with people.

847
01:27:30,847 --> 01:27:35,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I have, Terry can tell you, I have a little bit of slippage from here.

848
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:37,812
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have a curse in front of you.

849
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:43,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, he said not lately, because he was on campus.

850
01:27:43,613 --> 01:27:45,634
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

851
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:47,575
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more information than you need to know.

852
01:27:49,475 --> 01:27:50,556
[SPEAKER_05]: But the song goes like this.

853
01:27:50,656 --> 01:28:05,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, dear heavenly father, I want to say something to you.

854
01:28:06,021 --> 01:28:07,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

855
01:28:08,389 --> 01:28:12,793
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking down on us.

856
01:28:13,534 --> 01:28:22,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And you see what we're going through.

857
01:28:22,643 --> 01:28:28,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So while you're looking down on your children,

858
01:28:30,431 --> 01:28:37,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Won't you please bless the ones who choose to ignore you?

859
01:28:37,954 --> 01:28:39,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And just remember us.

860
01:28:42,196 --> 01:28:43,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Deliver us.

861
01:28:45,797 --> 01:28:55,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember us in your blessings.

862
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:59,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, dear.

[SPEAKER_04]: dear heavenly father i don't know if you're listening to me you see it's been a long time since i last talked with you for too long

864
01:29:27,009 --> 01:29:49,995
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't seen so while you're looking down on your children won't you please bless the ones who choose to ignore you and just remember us deliver us

866
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,021
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I'm going to get you to join in with me.

867
01:30:29,081 --> 01:30:31,141
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a congregational song.

868
01:30:35,002 --> 01:30:36,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says, I will trust in the Lord.

869
01:30:38,223 --> 01:30:39,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I will trust in the Lord.

870
01:30:39,364 --> 01:30:40,204
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that song?

871
01:30:41,684 --> 01:30:43,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I will trust in the Lord till I die.

872
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:44,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it does that again.

873
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:48,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says, then the second verse says, I will watch, fight, and pray.

874
01:30:48,726 --> 01:30:48,766
[SPEAKER_05]: OK?

875
01:30:52,387 --> 01:30:54,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does all of that the same way, the first verse.

876
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:55,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll lead you through it.

877
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:59,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it says, I'm going to treat everybody right.

878
01:31:01,554 --> 01:31:02,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Very hard today.

879
01:31:03,475 --> 01:31:05,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So hard to remember what you said.

880
01:31:05,617 --> 01:31:06,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You said that, didn't you?

881
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:09,040
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you're going to treat me right, right?

882
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm, yeah.

883
01:31:12,322 --> 01:31:31,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna stay on my bended knees okay here we go I will trust in the lord I will trust in the lord I will trust in the lord till I die

887
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:20,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to watch, fight, and pray.

888
01:32:20,462 --> 01:32:27,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to watch, fight, and pray till I die.

889
01:32:27,547 --> 01:32:28,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to skip to the fourth verse.

890
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:34,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stay on my bended knees.

891
01:32:35,053 --> 01:32:38,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stay on my bended knees.

892
01:32:39,736 --> 01:32:48,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna stay on my bended knees until I die.

893
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:52,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna stay on my bended knees.

894
01:32:53,743 --> 01:32:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna stay on my bended knees.

895
01:32:58,425 --> 01:33:05,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna stay on my bended knees till I die.

896
01:33:05,629 --> 01:33:08,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Now hum with me, because you know what they say about humming, don't you?

897
01:33:09,436 --> 01:33:12,738
[SPEAKER_05]: They say if you hum, the devil can't tell what you're talking to God about.

898
01:33:13,778 --> 01:33:15,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just hum through them.

899
01:33:38,224 --> 01:34:01,142
[SPEAKER_07]: ♪ I'm gonna trust in the Lord till I die ♪

900
01:34:06,982 --> 01:34:07,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

901
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:15,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now, I have to check with, I have to check.

902
01:34:16,508 --> 01:34:17,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it time?

903
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:19,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some jazz?

904
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:20,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some jazz?

905
01:34:21,832 --> 01:34:22,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let me see.

906
01:34:24,354 --> 01:34:29,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's one that's, you know, I did this the last time I was here, the Come Sunday one by Duke Ellington, right?

907
01:34:29,737 --> 01:34:31,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, y'all remember Duke Ellington?

908
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:32,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I won't do that this time.

909
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do something that really, really, really is a,

910
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:37,973
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very lovely jazz ballad.

911
01:34:38,313 --> 01:34:45,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's written by a classic jazz composer and keyboard player named Bill Evans.

912
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:46,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody hear of Bill Evans?

913
01:34:49,023 --> 01:34:52,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And this song was made famous or beloved

914
01:34:53,354 --> 01:35:12,839
[SPEAKER_05]: revered by his duet with Tony Bennett and that's how I learned the song was listening to Tony with the purest of dulcet sounds just really rush into my soul with this lovely melody and it says now she said she started saying no I'm kidding

915
01:35:19,903 --> 01:35:34,437
[SPEAKER_05]: When lonely feelings chill the meadows of your mind, just think if winter comes, can spring be far behind?

916
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:44,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Within the deepest snows, the secret of a rose,

917
01:35:46,517 --> 01:35:53,907
[SPEAKER_05]: is merely that it knows you must believe in spring.

918
01:35:55,709 --> 01:36:01,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as the tree is sure its leaves will reappear.

919
01:36:03,229 --> 01:36:11,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It knows its emptiness is just the time of year.

920
01:36:11,674 --> 01:36:19,098
[SPEAKER_04]: The frozen mountain dreams of April's melting streams.

921
01:36:19,598 --> 01:36:27,002
[SPEAKER_05]: How crystal clear it seems you must believe in spring.

922
01:36:29,012 --> 01:36:37,656
[SPEAKER_06]: You must believe in love and trust it's on its way.

923
01:36:38,976 --> 01:36:45,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as the sleeping rose awaits the kiss of May.

924
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:54,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a world of woe, of things that come and go,

925
01:36:56,113 --> 01:37:04,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Where would you think you know you can't be certain of?

926
01:37:05,539 --> 01:37:13,064
[SPEAKER_04]: You must believe in spring and love.

927
01:37:29,503 --> 01:37:30,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am finished for tonight.

928
01:37:33,326 --> 01:37:33,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

929
01:37:33,766 --> 01:37:34,546
[SPEAKER_05]: You think that's enough?

930
01:37:35,787 --> 01:37:37,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless I want to do one more.

931
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:40,350
[SPEAKER_05]: What you want?

932
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:40,830
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

933
01:37:41,851 --> 01:37:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

934
01:37:46,554 --> 01:37:46,874
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

935
01:37:47,014 --> 01:37:47,154
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

936
01:37:47,815 --> 01:37:48,275
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

937
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:48,635
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

938
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:48,976
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

939
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:49,256
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

940
01:37:49,276 --> 01:37:49,396
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

941
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:49,476
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

942
01:37:55,529 --> 01:38:01,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I am weak, but thou art strong.

943
01:38:03,395 --> 01:38:08,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus, keep me from all wrong.

944
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:21,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be satisfied as long as I walk.

945
01:38:22,776 --> 01:38:28,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me walk close to thee.

946
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:29,420
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know it, you can join me.

947
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a closer walk with thee.

948
01:38:39,264 --> 01:38:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, Jesus is my plea.

949
01:38:48,486 --> 01:38:56,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Daily walk with close to thee.

950
01:38:56,889 --> 01:39:00,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it be, dear Lord.

951
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:05,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it be.

952
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:06,171
[SPEAKER_05]: One more verse.

953
01:39:08,289 --> 01:39:24,358
[SPEAKER_05]: When my feeble life is o'er, time for me will be no more.

954
01:39:25,879 --> 01:39:32,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Guide me safely, gently o'er,

955
01:39:35,562 --> 01:40:01,612
[SPEAKER_06]: ♪ To thy kingdom's shore ♪ To thy shore ♪ Just a closer walk with thee ♪ Granted Jesus is my plea

956
01:40:06,568 --> 01:40:14,834
[SPEAKER_07]: daily walking close to thee.

957
01:40:15,714 --> 01:40:20,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it be, dear Lord.

958
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:25,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it be, dear Lord.

959
01:40:26,682 --> 01:40:31,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it be, dear Lord.

960
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:39,393
[SPEAKER_05]: in the church today, amen.

961
01:40:44,736 --> 01:40:46,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for listening.

962
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

963
01:40:55,181 --> 01:40:57,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a standing ovation, Lord have mercy.

964
01:40:57,963 --> 01:40:59,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

965
01:41:00,244 --> 01:41:01,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now here's what I'm gonna do.

966
01:41:01,505 --> 01:41:03,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll move all my stuff out of the way.

967
01:41:03,426 --> 01:41:05,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Get all my house.

968
01:41:06,925 --> 01:41:18,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know if Donna realizes this but that that particular hymn the last hymn that she sung was really a signal hymn at Shiloh Baptist Church.

969
01:41:19,888 --> 01:41:31,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Conrad Sharpton and Levi Adams man they used to sing that song and light the church up you know so so you you bring in that particular song.

970
01:41:32,115 --> 01:41:35,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

971
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:39,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, Billy Thompson, absolutely.

972
01:41:39,299 --> 01:41:40,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rachel.

973
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:52,606
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that really kind of brought home what this community has always represented in terms of the spiritual life of a neighborhood, you know.

974
01:41:52,626 --> 01:41:53,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on with it.

975
01:41:53,927 --> 01:42:01,371
[SPEAKER_10]: When I talked to her about maybe, what was it, January, February?

976
01:42:01,922 --> 01:42:02,582
February, yeah.

977
01:42:02,602 --> 01:42:09,844
[SPEAKER_05]: When I think about the soul that I've seen on the wall, I'm gonna start crying and I'm sorry.

978
01:42:09,884 --> 01:42:14,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think about the people who have made this community the strongest that it is.

979
01:42:14,905 --> 01:42:22,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I think about the commitment, the love, the need, the dedication, the eye contact.

980
01:42:23,607 --> 01:42:27,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I start thinking about what am I going to say to these people?

981
01:42:28,428 --> 01:42:29,708
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I going to share?

982
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I going to write a poem, or will I write a prayer?

983
01:42:35,108 --> 01:42:39,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to rhyme.

984
01:42:39,529 --> 01:42:49,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But I start thinking about you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, even though I don't know you yet.

985
01:42:49,452 --> 01:42:56,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know that there's going to be somebody who's never heard this, felt this kind of joy, commitment.

986
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:02,014
[SPEAKER_05]: total consumption of the belief in the Holy Spirit.

987
01:43:02,394 --> 01:43:04,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there's people that don't know that.

988
01:43:05,276 --> 01:43:06,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And they need to see it.

989
01:43:06,737 --> 01:43:11,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's my job to find songs that will cultivate at least a curiosity.

990
01:43:11,821 --> 01:43:14,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want you to be here going, oh, I really like this.

991
01:43:21,285 --> 01:43:24,446
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit into some of these tunes.

992
01:43:24,506 --> 01:43:25,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The old church.

993
01:43:25,447 --> 01:43:26,207
[SPEAKER_05]: The old church.

994
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:27,567
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just good for the soul.

995
01:43:28,047 --> 01:43:29,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it is.

996
01:43:30,468 --> 01:43:31,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love praise and worship.

997
01:43:31,889 --> 01:43:32,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

998
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:34,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I was part of it for many years.

999
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:37,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't touch the soul like the hymns.

1000
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:40,112
[SPEAKER_05]: The hymn writers, they knew.

1001
01:43:40,272 --> 01:43:40,772
[SPEAKER_05]: They knew.

1002
01:43:40,792 --> 01:43:42,693
[SPEAKER_05]: They knew exactly.

1003
01:43:42,793 --> 01:43:48,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mention any of the composers, but I had their names here because I really respect

1004
01:43:49,538 --> 01:43:56,705
[SPEAKER_05]: When I make a copy of something and get lyrics, I put the composer down there because right now, you won't see who wrote the song.

1005
01:43:56,745 --> 01:43:58,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see who recorded it.

1006
01:43:59,228 --> 01:44:01,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be dismisled.

1007
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:10,279
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times you'll type up a song and you'll see this was blah, blah, blah's version of whatever.

1008
01:44:11,266 --> 01:44:16,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't look further than that, because blah, blah, blah did not write that song.

1009
01:44:16,227 --> 01:44:24,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Find out who wrote that song, and how many other great songs that person has written, and what other artists that he's made a star through his songwriting.

1010
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:28,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a lot of back information that we're never going to be able to get again.

1011
01:44:29,131 --> 01:44:29,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1012
01:44:29,751 --> 01:44:31,812
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to keep us in the dark.

1013
01:44:32,312 --> 01:44:33,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, excuse me.

1014
01:44:33,412 --> 01:44:34,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1015
01:44:34,813 --> 01:44:37,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me say this.

1016
01:44:37,053 --> 01:44:39,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine you're a sophomore.

1017
01:44:41,077 --> 01:44:41,878
[SPEAKER_10]: at Berkeley.

1018
01:44:42,758 --> 01:44:46,641
[SPEAKER_10]: You just know that, like Donna said earlier, you's going to be a star eventually.

1019
01:44:47,341 --> 01:44:54,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And you sit in this woman's class and she tells you that your A's are too sharp and your B's are too flat.

1020
01:44:56,788 --> 01:45:02,292
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so just sitting under a legendary singer

1021
01:45:03,855 --> 01:45:11,177
[SPEAKER_10]: how it has molded so many of those young people as they go out into the world and try and become, quote unquote, famous.

1022
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:16,539
[SPEAKER_10]: So Donna, I don't have the right words to say thank you.

1023
01:45:16,959 --> 01:45:21,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever you come to our little community, you bless us beyond belief.

1024
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:27,762
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really, really appreciate you being my friend and coming to our little home in West Medford.

1025
01:45:28,642 --> 01:45:32,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And giving some folks who haven't been here a chance to see what you do and how you do it.

1026
01:45:34,308 --> 01:45:34,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1027
01:45:35,029 --> 01:45:35,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1028
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:37,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1029
01:45:39,512 --> 01:45:47,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a wrap for this new live edition of WMCC's Words and Music program.

1030
01:45:47,858 --> 01:45:56,624

1031
