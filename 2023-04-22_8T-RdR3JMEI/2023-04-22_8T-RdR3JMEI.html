href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=14.461s">That's</a>  in Dorchester, for those of you that are new to the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=18.303s">My</a>  wife and I lived in that area for a number of years, not too far from the Dorchester Courthouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=25.068s">He</a>  currently serves as an associate park commissioner for the city of

Action's 2014 John O'Connor Award for grassroots leadership and Walk Boston's 2016 Golden Shoe Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=47.205s">So</a>  thank you all for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=49.208s">Thank</a>  you, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=50.63s">Thank</a>  you, Daria. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=51.411s">Thank</a>  you, Mariangeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=53.534s">So</a>  as we're still in the waning days of Poetry Month for 2023, I have to at least go there one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=60.878s">Now,</a>  you all know me, and I've written a lot of poetry that speaks to the legacy of the Mystic River in greater Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=67.381s">One</a>  particular piece was, in many ways, inspired by my friendship with Patrick Heron and the folks at MIRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=75.484s">It</a>  takes a little time to unfold, so bear with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=78.145s">This</a>  piece is called, A River Runs Through It. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=83.708s">Our</a>  valley is a place of legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=86.331s">Monuments</a>  of wood and bronze and stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=88.914s">Stories</a>  we tell and make our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=91.837s">Colonial</a>  towns that stand the test of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=94.559s">Old</a>  graveyards that reckon our lost prime. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=98.083s">Thoughts</a>  that bring a poet to a rhyme. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=101.186s">And</a>  a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=103.598s">Our</a>  valley is a place of history, heroes that fought in foreign wars, Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Corps, pride and service that extends their tours, courage seeping, sweating through their pores, death and loss that bravery ignores, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=122.788s">Our</a>  valley is a place of misery. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=126.091s">Native</a>  kindness lost in exploitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=129.374s">Liberties</a>  for some through subjugation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=133.117s">Faith</a>  distortions used to build a nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=135.639s">Confinement</a>  to the distant reservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=138.261s">Hopeful</a>  spirits lost at every station. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=140.764s">Museum</a>  cases filled with infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=144.607s">And</a>  a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=146.845s">Our</a>  valley is a place of shame, treaties that were violated, tribes that were decimated, disease that was initiated, environment that was devastated, trust that was annihilated, greed that is still celebrated, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=165.014s">Our</a>  valley is a place of industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=167.495s">Iron</a>  was smelted, tallow was melted, ships were built, frames were gilt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=173.123s">Leather</a>  was tanned. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=174.204s">Bridges</a>  were spanned. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=175.386s">Fabric</a>  was dyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=176.527s">Fish</a>  was fried. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=177.528s">Rum</a>  was distilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=178.669s">Barrels</a>  were filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=179.85s">Glass</a>  was blown. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=180.992s">Crops</a>  were grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=182.273s">Meadows</a>  were stamped. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=183.494s">Soldiers</a>  encamped. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=184.656s">Milk</a>  was homogenized, pasteurized, and fortified. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=189.22s">And</a>  a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=191.544s">Our</a>  valley is a place of industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=193.406s">Lies</a>  were told as papers passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=195.469s">Covenants</a>  never intended to last. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=197.751s">Stolen</a>  lands, great wealth amassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=200.134s">Rampant</a>  corruption now put on blast. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=202.597s">How</a>  did it get so bad so fast? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=204.88s">This</a>  silent guilt that sanitizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=207.342s">Race</a>  unrest that paralyzes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=209.685s">Black</a>  lives trying to matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=211.346s">Brown</a>  skin made to scatter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=213.008s">Red</a>  blood spilt and splattered. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=214.849s">Homes</a>  that only sell to some. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=216.971s">Banks</a>  don't lend to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=218.712s">Police</a>  don't look to serve and protect. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=221.274s">Fear</a>  and loathing breed disrespect and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=226.92s">Our</a>  valley is still a place of denial, for graves undug to drive a pile, for landed gentry remains on trial, for sins committed in the church's aisle and failure to turn equality's dial, for actions thought both vain and vile, no small amount of desecration where progress interred the bones of First Nation, with never a notion to a real preservation and a headlong rush toward contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=253.512s">Where</a>  is Missituk's compensation? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=256.077s">Are</a>  bluebacks and herring a standing ovation? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=259.184s">The</a>  watchers gather around the formation and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=264.785s">Our</a>  valley is a place of nativity, indigenous braves or slaves in captivity, immigrant enclaves in exclusivity, a treacherous path to beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=274.793s">Each</a>  clan wears a kindred face, covets a homeland's warm embrace, coveting gospels of time and space, every religion and every race, tribal spirits of fire and ice, a thousand types of beans and rice, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=291.515s">Our</a>  valley is a place of fertility, verdant shores by the sandy beaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=296.078s">Nature</a>  grows what the soul beseeches, ash and elm and maple preaches from the silent spring to the epic speeches, yet poisoned into the soil leeches, open wounds and ugly breaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=308.146s">We've</a>  yet to learn what nature teaches and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=313.756s">Our</a>  valley is a tapestry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=315.957s">Threads</a>  for every color and shade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=318.057s">Stripes</a>  for every soul displayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=320.538s">Winter</a>  and spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=321.618s">Summer</a>  and fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=322.758s">Translucent</a>  rain that showers all. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=326.479s">Rainbows</a>  await the heart's desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=328.76s">Together</a>  we face the cleansing fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=331.821s">Families</a>  grow strong with true resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=334.401s">Schools</a>  invest in each child's brilliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=338.202s">Each</a>  one brings their gifts and talents. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=341.79s">God's</a>  design puts the scales in balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=344.713s">Neighbors</a>  embrace a common will despite the screaming fool on the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=350.039s">Poems</a>  are written that resonate still and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=356.085s">Our</a>  valley is a place of revolution, where new voices seek a new solution that doesn't begin with a cash contribution, that doesn't end with filth and pollution. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=367.728s">Voices</a>  that hush when justice calls and push when progress slowly calls, presenting new and clear demands with concrete 10-year master plans and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=382.086s">Our</a>  valley is a place of revelation where cooperative efforts rebuild and the local folk join the highly skilled to reclaim, rebrand, and re-engineer with the local folk who volunteer to pluck the refuge from marsh and shore with only the thought to refresh and restore so future folks embrace and explore and the river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=408.347s">Our</a>  valley is a place of vibrancy that takes great pride in its energy, that seeks out moments of synergy, that wraps its models in honesty, that guards its resources zealously, that seeks its level with urgency, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=428.83s">Our</a>  valley is a place of true rebirth, as we try to protect our precious earth, where good people meet to set things right, and the cleanup ensues through the waning light, and then the party takes over the night, and the food and the music is out of sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=448.365s">We</a>  gather our kin at the father's shore, and labor together to open the door, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=465.835s">Okay,</a>  so I know it was a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=468.376s">I</a>  know it was a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=469.456s">You</a>  know, I'm still teaching myself to write shorter poems, but I'm not a very good teacher, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=476.577s">Okay,</a>  so I want to start with Beyond the Bend of the Stream. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=480.698s">Let's</a>  have a friendly chat with our folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=484.659s">Dari,</a>  can you talk a bit about the work, your work, and <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=493.158s">how</a>  it engages and impacts young people in the MIRA service communities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=500.84s">Yeah,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=501.881s">Young</a>  people specifically or everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=503.603s">We're</a>  all young at heart, I guess, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=507.247s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=507.867s">So</a>  a large part of my work is working with volunteers, which there's a few awesome volunteers in the audience today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=515.195s">It's</a>  always great to see your faces and hear your stories and how you connect with the mystic and what working with the mystic with your hands means to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=525.044s">We</a>  do a lot of activities and a lot of the work is powered by volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=531.206s">We</a>  started off our organization fully volunteer with people who just noticed that the river was polluted. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=539.789s">It</a>  had endured, you know, a lot of history of damage, which you just spoke to in your poem, and it was just these concerned residents who just decided <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=550.113s">We</a>  can't change what we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=552.477s">And</a>  so they started collecting data. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=554.399s">And</a>  that's kind of where our community science programs were born. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=558.305s">It's</a>  people who care and people who say, I need to get more information so I can make this change that I want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=567.137s">So</a>  that's kind of where we started and we've just added more and more onto that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=571.38s">We</a>  collect data around the herring migration, the river herring migration, which you mentioned alewives and blueback herring, our favorite fish, unapologetically, which have just started their migration. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=584.488s">Just</a>  this past week we saw our first ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=586.729s">And</a>  it used to signal the new year for the indigenous people who lived here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=592.794s">kind</a>  of bringing in the new year with this amazing migration of animals and so we have volunteers going out every hour from 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=603.507s">to</a>  7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=604.368s">seven</a>  days a week which is just a huge amount of dedication and love and <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=607.952s">for</a>  the species that we know supports such a diverse and vibrant ecosystem here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=614.215s">So</a>  those are a couple of things that are happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=616.716s">We</a>  also, of course, clean up trash where we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=621.979s">We</a>  remove invasive species. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=624.32s">We're</a>  doing more and more planting, trying to establish healthy meadows, healthy trees for shade and for habitat and for so many other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=636.246s">So,</a>  yeah, I guess all I do is help send emails so that everyone gets to the same place at the same time, but it's really the volunteers that are doing amazing, amazing work with us.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=648.136s">Just,</a>  just, just, can you give folks a sense of, in the typical herring run, how many fish we're talking about?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=657.463s">Oh,</a>  yeah, definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=659.345s">So</a>  way back when, they used to say that the herring were so plentiful that you could walk across the river on the backs of herring, which, can you just picture that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=667.931s">That</a>  would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=669.793s">So</a>  definitely overfishing was a huge issue, habitat loss because of dams. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=674.997s">And</a>  so at the lowest, they really dipped down to around 200,000 coming through our river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=679.581s">And</a>  with the establishment of fish ladders, our highest number was around 700,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=686.686s">which</a>  is huge, they've tripled in population. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=690.107s">Last</a>  year we had the largest river herring run in Massachusetts, which is remarkable because we're the most urbanized watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=697.069s">Our</a>  river runs right through the middle of a city and a ton of impervious surfaces and yet these river herring are still coming in big numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=705.291s">And</a>  we're hoping that with a fish ladder or a fish passage installed at the next big obstacle, which is Scally Dam at Horn Ponds, that the Mystic River herring migration might reach over a million fish, which would be huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=719.278s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=719.558s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=719.979s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=720.959s">So</a>  it's, it's, it's not a small thing, and I know they have an army of volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=726.143s">I've,</a>  I've received some of the solicitations myself, I just haven't been out to get out there and count some fish. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=732.027s">But</a>  you know, that's, that's one of my future ambitions, is to get out there and count some fish. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=737.732s">So</a>  Dave, I'm gonna switch it over to you for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=741.795s">So</a>  professionally, you're kind of a Boston guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=746.599s">And</a>  yet, you know, you kind of, you made your way north and got involved with the work of the association. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=754.134s">What,</a>  what kind of, you know, prompted you to make that decision?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=758.497s">Good</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=761.439s">I</a>  just saw an opportunity to work with an organization that was doing comprehensive work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=766.502s">You</a>  know, the work that I was doing in Dorchester was at an affordable housing organization, and I was kind of the outlier, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=774.207s">I</a>  was like the green nag, I'll call myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=778.069s">I</a>  was the guy that was always poking and prodding us to do more around sustainability, but the chance to come here was a chance to really <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=784.993s">do</a>  what I cared about, which was working at that intersection of science and climate and people, and do it in a place that really needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=793.743s">You</a>  know, do this work in an urban area really is where my heart is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=797.848s">I've</a>  always liked working in urban circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=800.29s">Always</a>  have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=800.811s">Well,</a>  not always, but... <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=801.952s">for</a>  a long time now, several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=804.276s">So</a>  it just feels like something I wanted to do and have a great team that I get to work with every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=810.084s">They</a>  inspire me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=812.207s">So</a>  it's just wonderful to be around younger people who are actually doing this work, but also bring some knowledge and bring some awareness to the organization.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=819.402s">Okay,</a>  so, so, not that there are any for anybody, you know, in these professional environments, but kind of a typical day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=827.208s">What</a>  does it look like for you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=829.17s">I</a>  don't know if there is a typical day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=831.731s">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=832.992s">You</a>  know, a typical day could mean anything from working on a grant proposal, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=840.458s">to</a>  working within municipality and people who care about trees in a particular city or municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=846.743s">A</a>  lot of my work right now centers on dealing with heat, urban heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=852.327s">In</a>  2020, we did a big study called Wicked Hot Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=858.071s">We</a>  looked at all 21 municipalities <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=860.673s">in</a>  the watershed on a really hot day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=862.434s">It</a>  was a 90 degree plus day in the middle of a heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=865.876s">So</a>  we figured out, and that was done with a lot of volunteers, figured out where the hot spots were through the whole watershed, and then we said, how do we begin to cool that, those places off? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=875.501s">So</a>  that's now called Wicked Cool Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=878.402s">Very</a>  Bostonian. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=881.284s">Wicked</a>  Cool Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=882.104s">So</a>  now we're trying to figure out, as Daria related to, trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=885.286s">Where</a>  can we put trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=886.086s">Where</a>  can we put cooling centers? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=887.247s">What</a>  can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=888.347s">splash</a>  pads, playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=890.189s">So</a>  a lot of my work is grant writing, some of it's kind of figuring out the policy and where we're going around tree policy and planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=897.374s">It's</a>  managing a few staff in the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=899.815s">You</a>  know, Myra's grown from five to sixteen staff now in about three years, and we're about to jump again, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=908.003s">Some</a>  of my work just involves day-to-day management of the organization, along with Patrick and Shelley, the other deputy director.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=913.986s">Wonderful,</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=915.567s">So</a>  you set me up perfectly for the question that I have for Mariangeli, because I wanted to ask you, Mariangeli, is that not reaching? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=923.432s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=924.212s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=925.533s">I</a>  can use this one.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=927.154s">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=928.335s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=930.015s">Okay,</a>  so most recently, what has made you say, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=934.975s">What</a>  the heck are we gonna do about how hot the weather is getting and how it's changing the river ecology?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=944.327s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=946.795s">So</a>  I will say that what has made me think, what the heck are we gonna do with climate change and heat, is a personal experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=954.502s">Last</a>  summer, I had the greatest idea to drive my bike and go to a friend's house and do it in the middle of a heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=963.21s">Because</a>  in the Caribbean, I'm from Puerto Rico, you are used to going outside when it's very hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=969.635s">and</a>  you just do activities, go to the beach and spend time with friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=973.098s">But</a>  here the heat is a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=975.06s">It's</a>  more like sticky, more humid. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=977.582s">So</a>  I decided to go to my friend's house and driving my bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=980.664s">And</a>  then in the middle of the way, I just had to step on the side and drink a bunch of water because I felt like I was going to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=987.45s">So</a>  I was like, OK, there's a lot of things that need to be done about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=991.876s">And</a>  that's by personal experiences, but also by listening to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=996.261s">I</a>  was like, OK, there is stuff that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=998.764s">And</a>  that's one of the things that actually inspired me to study public health and then also to start engaging in work with Mayra. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1007.295s">And</a>  also finding ways of how not just people can be protected, but also the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1012.44s">Because</a>  at the end of the day, when we think about healthy communities, it's one health. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1016.984s">It's</a>  the health of the people, but also the health of the environment, because it's everything interconnected.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1023.742s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1025.083s">So</a>  that's like a significant crossover between what you do and what you do, Dave, in terms of addressing that concern.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1033.251s">Yeah,</a>  in fact, we're starting to talk internally about how we begin to <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1038.325s">cross-fertilize</a>  across teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1040.287s">A</a>  lot of the work that Mariangeli is doing is around health equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1046.532s">A</a>  lot of my work is around tree equity, but how do we begin to kind of combine those? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1051.175s">We're</a>  looking at a big air quality grant, for example, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1054.858s">How</a>  does that intersect with her work and my work and the rest of the work in the organization?</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1058.94s">That's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1059.941s">We</a>  have one of our particular members that comes here on a regular basis, and trees is her, that's her big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1067.846s">So</a>  I'm surprised she's not here this evening because she would have lit right into that part of the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1073.609s">But</a>  good, I'll tell her that there's folks out there that are working on tree equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1077.912s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1079.132s">Yeah,</a>  and that will be very exciting to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1081.054s">I'm</a>  telling you, you might get a volunteer out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1083.775s">Okay,</a>  so, Daria, I want you, if you will, to talk a little bit about... Dave's talking about equity, but, you know, in a little different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1097.148s">Can</a>  you talk about, kind of, the people equity side, diversity and inclusion in presenting the river's resources to the local community?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1105.741s">Yeah,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1106.662s">I</a>  think it's pretty blatant in this watershed that certain communities are facing environmental burdens more than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1115.789s">And</a>  I think certain communities have access to nature much more easily than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1121.193s">Our</a>  watershed is, it's amazing in that it's 21 different municipalities, but it's also, you know, 21 different areas experiencing very different environments and different realities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1132.801s">So</a>  I think a lot of what we're trying to do is figure out, by asking community members who live there, kind of, what do you need? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1138.643s">What</a>  do you want to see in your environment? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1140.784s">And</a>  seeing where we can kind of plug in and help with that in any way we can, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1146.386s">So</a>  in <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1147.783s">in</a>  terms of some of the things that you're hearing with regard to, particularly, you know, folks, you know, who may be considered, you know, kind of underserved or underrepresented, what kinds of things are they asking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1160.188s">If</a>  you can, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1161.549s">Yeah,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1162.089s">I</a>  think Maria Angelou hosted a really great series of workshops asking communities just that question, so I might pass it to Maria Angelou if you don't mind to answer that one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1174.173s">I</a>  will say that one of the first things that people are asking, and this project was hosted in Everett, so a lot of the things that people are asking first is to be heard and to be included in the process of like planning for initiatives that are related to environmental justice or related to climate change, because at the end of the day, the people that should be also expressing their concerns are the ones that are experiencing, for example, extreme weather conditions, the heat waves, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1201.708s">flooding</a>  because you have the stories and it's your live experiences and that should be informing the policies and the programs that are created. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1209.693s">But</a>  then in terms of on the ground work, people are asking for a lot of trees to be planted, public spaces where you can have fun with your family and your friends, but at the same time they can serve as spaces that you can not only socialize but also get cool during the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1227.864s">like</a>  having more water parks, water amenities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1232.449s">So</a>  yeah, a lot of green spaces, places to hang out, but at the same time get protected.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1239.278s">I</a>  had done some poultry work with the group over in Malden, Malden River Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1244.985s">And</a>  that's really an amazing project that they're kind of more in the development stages of. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1252.728s">I</a>  don't know all of the nuts and bolts of it in terms of where they are now, but I know they had a big series of public meetings and, you know, different gatherings where they elicited a lot of public testimony. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1266.454s">And</a>  there's so much of what everybody was asking for woven into the rubric of the program that they're developing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1274.584s">So,</a>  you know, so it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1276.286s">It</a>  really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1276.907s">It</a>  really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1278.169s">Yeah,</a>  please, Dave.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1278.809s">I</a>  just wanted to add, so we're really using the approach that Mayor Angelou mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1283.395s">throughout</a>  all of our work now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1284.716s">So</a>  we center with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1286.778s">We</a>  talk to community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1288.179s">We</a>  say, what is it that you want? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1290.801s">We</a>  try to figure out ways to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1292.382s">So</a>  our Wicked Hot Mystic work, when we looked at all the hot spots in all the communities, that's just one layer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1298.607s">We</a>  go back to those communities and say, okay, this is where we think it's hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1301.83s">Where</a>  do you think it's hot? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1303.451s">Where,</a>  when you're walking on your street, would you say you wanted shade, or do you want a splash pad, or something, or a cool block? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1310.597s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1311.323s">We</a>  circle back to the community a few times now, as a matter of course, in all of our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1316.384s">And</a>  it's really critically important to center those communities that have been left out for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1321.645s">A</a>  lot of the neighborhoods we work in were places that were redlined, historically. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1326.026s">So</a>  they never got parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1327.567s">They</a>  never got trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1329.047s">They</a>  got a lot of asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1330.287s">They</a>  got a lot of driveways, but they didn't have a place to go cool off. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1334.528s">And</a>  so, we're trying to begin to rectify those situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1337.769s">And</a>  then, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1338.917s">Throughout</a>  all of this, we have 25 miles of greenway we're trying to complete that connects all these communities in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1345.521s">And</a>  we want to make sure that those greenways are also cooled off as well.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1349.404s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1350.425s">So,</a>  you know, and you spoke about, you know, a lot of the neighborhoods being redlined, and that's really how West Medford began. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1358.11s">I</a>  mean, a lot of people don't realize it, but at the outset of <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1362.993s">probably</a>  the late 1880s, 1890s, there were only three streets in all of West Medford where people of color could live. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1371.424s">There</a>  was this street, Arlington Street, the next street over Lincoln Street, and then the third street over was Jerome Street, and for many years it was like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1380.575s">And</a>  then eventually a couple more streets got added, and we moved a little bit closer to the railroad tracks, but generally speaking, after you cross the railroad tracks, Medford was primarily a white city, and this was the African-American neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1396.572s">Medford's</a>  a lot more diverse now, but in ways that diversity has impacted neighborhoods of color in a negative way because all of the development has pushed people out from places that used to be the only place where you saw black and brown people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1418.823s">So</a>  it's a thorny but interesting problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1424.806s">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1425.967s">So,</a>  Mariangeli, what do you, what do you say, I mean, because you've got to meet them sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1432.232s">What</a>  do you say to the climate change deniers and folks that don't believe that global warming and heat spots and all this good stuff that Dave is talking about are real things? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1443.901s">What</a>  do you, what do you tell them?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1446.92s">That's</a>  a very good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1451.043s">I</a>  will say that it's something that we're already experiencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1454.265s">I</a>  know there's a lot of people that are in denial of what is happening, but if we look back last summer, we had like three back-to-back heat waves, and then just like last week, it's April, and it was like already 88 degrees, which was a record. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1470.797s">So</a>  I feel like pulling on a lot of data, which is something that also our organization based on, we do a lot of research because it's very important to have data to show out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1481.232s">But</a>  at the same time, just like also sharing the stories that we hear through the watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1485.878s">Because</a>  for the people that still have trouble thinking that this is real, sharing what people in the watershed has said that they have experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1494.56s">For</a>  example, being in a heat wave and having a person that has a disability at home that maybe is one of like on the second floor of the house and it's difficult for them to have an AC there, just sharing what people live in their daily basis and mixing that with data is a very impactful way of like giving a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1514.125s">But</a>  as we have been saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1516.365s">We</a>  have some experiences, but people in the community are the ones that have more of the experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1521.448s">Also</a>  providing forums and spaces where people can share those stories by themselves, because we're just here as an organization that is trying to do work, but at the end of the day, this is something that is part of the community, and we are just helping on the way.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1537.265s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1538.145s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1538.826s">And</a>  what we've done here at the community centers is, you know, we've become part of Medford's network of cooling centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1548.45s">So,</a>  you know, in the heat of the summer, you know, if people need to, if they don't have air conditioning, or if they find they're living in a, you know, in a hot zone, in a hot house, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1558.475s">they</a>  can make their way down to the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1561.477s">They</a>  can sit in 68 degrees comfort and not get heat stroke. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1568.761s">So</a>  it's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1570.322s">It's</a>  real. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1570.803s">And</a>  I'm just happy that there are folks out there that are collecting the kinds of data that can be impactful as people make decisions about whether or not they want to believe this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1582.409s">Because</a>  it's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1583.67s">It's</a>  very real. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1585.111s">Okay,</a>  Dave, what, what, what MIRA projects and programs are you most excited about right now?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1592.375s">Everything?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1593.016s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1595.317s">Um...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1597.374s">Well,</a>  I'd say our education programs have really expanded exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1603.715s">Natalia,</a>  who's not here tonight, has just become a really great educator, and she gets help from Daria, and Mariangeli, and Marissa, and my team, and so we've kind of expanded our outreach to more schools, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1617.258s">The</a>  stuff that I'm working on in trees is really pretty exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1621.498s">We've</a>  been able to get some funding for trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1623.459s">We</a>  were able to get <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1625.319s">an</a>  earmark from Senator Presley's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1628.68s">And</a>  we're actually, I think some of that money's actually gonna come to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1633.883s">We've</a>  been talking to Trees Medford about planting trees here, both public and private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1641.886s">So</a>  that will probably happen this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1646.768s">We</a>  also have gone after two very large pots of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1650.79s">about</a>  $2.5 million and $4 million in earmarks for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1654.433s">So,</a>  you know, Congress is kind of, despite what you hear in the press, Congress is somewhat in our favor right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1661.718s">So,</a>  we hope to kind of be able to move some money our way and be able to do some more tree planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1669.443s">I'd</a>  say the air quality study, which I'm not totally involved with, but the air quality work again is, it kind of speaks to what Mariangeli was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1676.31s">It</a>  gives us a backdrop in terms of data, and allows us to say, look, this is the reality on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1681.896s">This</a>  is the reality in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1683.457s">What</a>  do you want to do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1685.319s">What</a>  do you want to change in terms of policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1688.282s">And</a>  that policy piece is something I think that's important for everyone to think about is, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1692.397s">What</a>  do you want to say to your municipality around policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1695.419s">You</a>  know, should you have more cooling centers? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1697.24s">Should</a>  you have more trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1699.101s">What's</a>  your policy around seniors and emergencies? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1702.844s">How</a>  are health centers involved in emergency management? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1706.766s">So</a>  you all as residents get to make the difference around that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1710.969s">And</a>  I encourage you to kind of work through your politicians and make things happen that you want to see happen.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1715.992s">A</a>  lot of important stuff, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1717.814s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1719.376s">Daria,</a>  can, can you, can you talk a little bit about, you know, your favorite moment or few moments of being part of the organization so far?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1730.42s">Oh</a>  my gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1731.361s">That's</a>  a big question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1733.762s">I</a>  think there's been a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1735.243s">I</a>  think that whenever we do these really fun community events that really have no goal except for people just having fun by the river, that's, those are my favorite. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1745.108s">For</a>  example, we did a Project Misik. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1746.989s">It's</a>  a drumming workshop next to the river and just seeing different ways those spaces can be used and enjoyed by the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1754.873s">I</a>  was working with a youth, a collection of youth groups, and I first came to them with the idea of like, what if we had a forum and you could all talk to each other? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1764.116s">And</a>  they all said, what's a forum? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1767.556s">We</a>  don't really want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1769.117s">So</a>  they said, let's call it a celebration instead, and let's just bring soccer balls and volleyballs and big drawing pads, and just seeing that come to life from their vision, those are some of my favorite, absolute favorite moments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1783.04s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1783.8s">Well,</a>  you know, one of the things that, you know, it's been kind of my aim to do is to, is to incorporate some of the work that you do with youth into some of the youth initiatives that we have here at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1798.726s">So,</a>  like this summer, for instance, we do a program called Hoops and Hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1805.408s">which</a>  is, revolves around basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1809.13s">But,</a>  you know, having a table and having materials to be able to give out to the young people and talk about climate resiliency and talk about, you know, school education programs, and that would be a good opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1822.018s">And</a>  I know we've already talked with Michelle Lieberthal about Juneteenth and, you know, having you be a part of the Juneteenth celebration that we're going to do here at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1833.184s">So</a>  there are lots of opportunities for kind of a cross-pollination of what MIRA does and what the community center is doing, particularly as a resiliency hub in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1846.627s">So</a>  we can definitely talk some more about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1850.308s">Yeah,</a>  that sounds amazing.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1851.588s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1853.308s">So</a>  Mariangeli, what new climate resiliency initiatives are you excited about in this particular program year?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1864.873s">One</a>  of the initiatives that I get very excited about every summer is that we have a partnership with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, where we partner to provide funds to community-based organizations and municipalities in the watershed to create projects in their communities that are addressing extreme heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1887.102s">And</a>  this is something that is very exciting because it varies greatly of the different projects that are created through this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1894.409s">For</a>  example, planting more trees or doing a community party where people can go cool down, but also build a network with your neighbors and with your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1905.68s">But</a>  at the same time, it gives money to community-based organizations to provide social services, like utility bill assistance, because we know if you have an AC and have access to one, turning on the AC during the summer can be also stressful. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1923.041s">So</a>  it provides some extra funding for people to give that to the community and also just programs to actually access an air conditioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1931.323s">So</a>  it's a great initiative that we have and we're trying to also figure out how this can become a long-term program because it started during COVID-19 as emergency funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1941.626s">But</a>  we're trying to make this program longer so it can actually keep serving community-based organizations and municipalities.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1948.307s">Okay,</a>  last time I checked, West Medford Community Center was considered a community-based organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1955.51s">So</a>  if you want to hang out with us and some of that funding that comes through you comes through you and comes to us, that wouldn't be a problem for us, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1963.553s">I</a>  just thought I'd say that, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1965.493s">Seemed</a>  to make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1967.674s">So,</a>  David, as you think about collaborations and youth development and community building, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1973.736s">How</a>  do you think Myra's, you're gonna have to dance the next time that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1982.064s">How</a>  will Myra build on the successes of the past year?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1988.938s">Well,</a>  we'll continue expanding our outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=1991.2s">We've</a>  kind of, like I said, my work has been focused on some of the communities like Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Somerville, Medford, so how do we begin to expand outwards to other communities that are facing these same issues, facing the same issues around heat? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2008.75s">that</a>  have the need for trees or some other cooling amenities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2012.454s">So</a>  I think that's one thing I'm thinking that we're gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2017.38s">What</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2018.721s">The</a>  greenways are starting to really take off.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2021.444s">Now,</a>  does that include the Clippership Connector?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2024.147s">Is</a>  that part of the... Clippership Connector is part of our, part of the network we're trying to complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2028.692s">So</a>  there's a bunch of things coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2029.973s">There's</a>  a bridge that's going to be built, not this year obviously, but in the next few years, over the Mystic, along the Orange Line connection, between the casino and what's called Draw Assembly Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2043.477s">So</a>  that's gonna, that's got funding, that's gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2046.878s">So</a>  if someone has to jump off the, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2049.039s">a</a>  bridge, it'll be a little bit lower than the Orange Line bridge.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2054.243s">I</a>  guess that's one way of looking at it, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2056.585s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2057.365s">But</a>  just the notion of taking these disparate locations and figuring out ways to connect them along the river, it's pretty exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2068.674s">And</a>  I've been, you know, to various places, you know, along the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2072.917s">As</a>  a matter of fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2074.858s">with</a>  a landscape architect by the name of Carolyn Lewenberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2079.681s">We</a>  just developed, well, we didn't develop the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2083.142s">The</a>  space is already there, but it was capped because there was some environmental damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2088.325s">It's</a>  behind the Andrews School, and it's a new, it hasn't been dedicated yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2094.628s">It's</a>  a new meditation space. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2097.029s">It</a>  was very exciting, and she did <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2100.271s">low</a>  landscape sculpture with stones in a maze. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2104.175s">And</a>  then at three positions in the maze, there's a post and tablet with poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2110.16s">And</a>  I, that's where I come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2112.623s">So,</a>  you know, I did the poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2115.085s">I</a>  think the dedication is on April 26th, whatever that Saturday is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2121.571s">and</a>  it's called Mystic Meditation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2124.733s">So</a>  you can walk around in the maze, and you can read the poetry, and you can, it's very, very peaceful, and it's right along the river, so you can hear the river kind of talking in the background, and you can, it's part of the Clippership Connection, so you can continue to walk that path for miles and miles and miles, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2143.282s">That</a>  sounds like a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2144.443s">It's</a>  gonna be a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2145.083s">It's</a>  gonna be a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2146.484s">That</a>  makes me think we should be doing a little bit more with connecting people to art. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2150.866s">and</a>  the river, just somehow thinking about ways to incorporate art more into our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2155.028s">I'm</a>  your guy.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2155.629s">Yeah,</a>  I'm your guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2157.99s">Okay,</a>  all right, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2159.271s">So,</a>  and I want you all to, you know, take a crack at these last couple of questions that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2168.635s">What</a>  do you absolutely, Dave, you go first, what do you absolutely want the people to know about Myra tonight?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2177.368s">We're</a>  really focused on equity and engagement of community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2180.71s">That's</a>  at the core of our work now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2183.591s">I</a>  think when we started, we were focused primarily on the river, but the river isn't just the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2188.214s">The</a>  river is the river, it's the communities around it, it's the people in those communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2192.396s">So,</a>  how do we help you get what you want, connect you to the river in stronger ways, and really try to create a more vibrant environment for everybody who lives <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2205.183s">in</a>  cities in particular, in this city, in these neighborhoods, in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2209.424s">How</a>  do we work with you to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2211.204s">I</a>  think that's the one thing that I really wanna accomplish by the time I leave MIRA, which won't be for a long time.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2218.746s">And</a>  you know, follow up on that, I didn't know that there were actually 21 municipalities that were in your catchment area. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2227.528s">You</a>  know, Malden, Everett, Medford, and Somerville, and Arlington, Winchester, but that's probably where I stopped.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2234.93s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2235.31s">What</a>  else is in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2236.391s">All</a>  the way out to, there's a little bit of a sliver in Reading, I think, actually, Daria's got the map, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2242.496s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2243.197s">There</a>  are these maps back there on the table with other resource materials that Daria and Mariangeli brought with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2250.523s">So</a>  please avail yourself so you can kind of familiarize, if you're not already, familiarize yourself with all of the geography that Myra has in its catchment, because it's very significant, again, more significant than I even knew about.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2264.967s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2268.287s">Okay,</a>  so, Daria, one thing you absolutely want the people to know about Myra.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2277.173s">That's</a>  so hard of a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2279.214s">I</a>  think, kind of building off of what you just said, we are a municipality of, or we're a watershed association, and in our watershed, there's 21 different municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2290.042s">So</a>  you might be wondering, you know, first, what is a watershed? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2293.004s">I</a>  would love to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2294.385s">It's</a>  just an area of land where if a drop of water lands in that area, it drains to the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2300.509s">So</a>  with that definition, you might be wondering, why is a watershed association doing this kind of work? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2306.433s">I</a>  think that it's just a great kind of regional unit where we can all think together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2310.796s">You</a>  know, the water that affects you affects me, affects our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2314.418s">So</a>  I feel like just that the Watershed Association is here to be kind of a facilitator for collaborating across these boundaries where, you know, flooding doesn't stop at Arlington and not go into Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2329.188s">It's</a>  all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2330.77s">Um,</a>  so just as a resource and as like a, you know, a place to build collaboration.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2336.532s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2337.332s">I</a>  remember when there was a gasoline or oil spill down here by the rotary, and it had, you know, a damaging effect on, particularly on that part of the river, and I remember how active Myra was in talking to folks about that and getting folks' opinions and disseminating information, getting that information back to the state and federal agencies that were dealing with the cleanup and everything, so <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2366.341s">So</a>  it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2367.402s">It's</a>  important to have an advocate and to know that, you know, that's a primary resource that MIRA provides can be pretty comforting to folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2378.428s">Mariangeli?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2382.311s">So</a>  one takeaway from Mara, I will say that we care about climate change, but even though climate change can be this scary term, or we are not really sure what's happening and what's gonna happen in the future, we approach this with a very positive lens. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2398.28s">Initiatives</a>  that are addressing extreme heat, flooding, they don't need to be boring or scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2404.263s">They</a>  can be fun, they can be beautiful, they can be places that community can come together and we can become stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2411.247s">So,</a>  having in mind that this is a work that, as Dave was mentioning, can have art involved, we can have festivals, we can just make it beautiful and fun, and that's a takeaway that I will say. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2422.755s">We're</a>  trying to do this work in a very positive mindset.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2426.438s">And</a>  I've been to a couple of the celebrations that you have, and, you know, they are fun, they are very engaging, so, yeah, you're doing a good job in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2437.605s">So</a>  I always, you know, well, more recently than before, but I kind of like to flip the script and, you know, we're sitting here as, you know, an organization of record for the, you know, the historic African-American community of West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2452.717s">So,</a>  do you have any questions for us?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2461.325s">I'd</a>  like to hear more of that history. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2463.727s">I</a>  don't really know it very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2465.369s">One</a>  of our staff actually used to live a couple blocks away, so that's how I first heard about West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2471.956s">I've</a>  always wanted to learn more, so I'm grateful to be here tonight, but I'd like to hear more of the history from folks who've lived here a long time.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2480.945s">Well,</a>  we got that, so you can come to any one of the senior lunches that I host Tuesday through Thursday, from 12 to 1.30, say. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2491.714s">And,</a>  you know, if you sit down and talk to anyone there, they'll regale you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2496.559s">They</a>  might give you more than you bargained for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2499.542s">The</a>  other thing is that the building itself will tell you a lot of the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2503.506s">We</a>  have two exhibits. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2505.107s">One</a>  is the Afro-American Remembrance Project, and those are the plexiglass-covered exhibits all the way around and upstairs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2514.155s">And</a>  they really tell the more contemporary history of West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2518.259s">I'd</a>  be certainly, well, I'm happy to, you know, have lunch with you, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2522.883s">I</a>  won't make you pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2524.264s">But</a>  anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2525.886s">And</a>  then the upper, on the upper, those are, that's the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and there are 28 portraits of folks who have made a significant impact in the latter-day history of West Medford, a number of whom are still with us, still doing great things, and then many of them, you know, who are deceased, who have passed by. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2550.143s">but</a>  all of them represent significant history of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2555.752s">So</a>  yeah, we can, we can, we can, we can help you with that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2558.355s">I</a>  will come back and I'd love to hear some of those stories.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2560.378s">Absolutely,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2563.643s">Daria.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2566.654s">You</a>  got a question for me?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2568.135s">Yeah,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2569.115s">I</a>  think one of the things that we're acutely aware of is this idea of green gentrification, which is, you know, we make the environments, you know, we build these beautiful parks, we bring in more trees, does it just displace the people who are currently living here? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2583.403s">And</a>  it's, you know, a conversation at every conference we're going to, and people are still trying to figure out the best ways to improve the health of environment without <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2593.528s">you</a>  know, displacing the people that live here, and especially the West Medford community, which has been here for generations and generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2600.253s">Yeah,</a>  just kind of, what would be your take on that, and what would you want to see that would, you know, make you feel good about it?</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2607.558s">It's,</a>  you know, it's interesting because, you know, in, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2610.46s">It's</a>  not so much green gentrification here, it's bricks and mortar, much more so, and it's development gentrification, because, you know, there are a number of very, very aggressive developers that have come into this community and really, really targeted it as a place where they can buy houses on the cheap, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2635.103s">renovate</a>  them, and then sell them for, in all honesty, ridiculous amounts of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2641.525s">And</a>  so, again, we're retaining a good number of our trees and green spaces, and we're even having them, you know, be, you know, spruced up to a certain extent, but we're losing a lot of the history of the community because of the, you know, really rapturous development that's been taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2662.492s">And</a>  there's, you know, there's a couple people, I'm not gonna name any names or, you know, try and shame anybody, but everybody knows, you know, who's in the neighborhood buying up all the houses and turning them into, you know, million-dollar condos that don't look like million-dollar condos, but that's another story for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2678.66s">Yeah,</a>  so I think we're doing pretty well with regard to the green spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2687.205s">But</a>  West Medford is a very desirable neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2691.347s">It</a>  has access to public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2695.209s">It</a>  has access to all of the major roadways in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2701.072s">It's</a>  a place where a lot of people wanna live. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2703.093s">A</a>  lot of people who are moving from those high-rise towers that want a little bit of green space where they can barbecue and drink Zinfandel with their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2711.537s">They're</a>  coming to buy places in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2715.179s">and</a>  a lot of the families that I grew up with are long gone and hard to find, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2720.524s">But,</a>  um, but yeah, so, so, green's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2724.427s">Brick</a>  and mortar, not so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2726.469s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2726.95s">Mariangeli,</a>  what about you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2731.681s">My</a>  question is kind of related to what Dario was mentioning, but also, Myra, I joined Myra, and I have a public health background, and we're really trying to incorporate that aspect, because as I was mentioning before, everything is related, the health of the people, the health of the environment, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2750.149s">So</a>  I would like to know what are the concerns of the community, what are the concerns in terms of health, because we know climate change, extreme heat affects the health of people, and especially people that are older adults, children, people with disabilities are especially vulnerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2768.828s">So</a>  I would like to know what are the concerns of the community in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2771.951s">but</a>  also what other social issues are of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2775.795s">For</a>  example, housing also plays a big role. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2779.018s">As</a>  I was mentioning before, utility assistance, conditions in your house, all of those social factors also influence your well-being.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2787.765s">I</a>  think for a lot of folks, you know, and I've, you know, seen, have had, you know, various conversations about it, but I think mental health is always an issue, particularly with aging populations where you get into, you know, the spectrum, Alzheimer's and dementia and so on and so forth, memory loss, so I think that that's always a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2809.105s">I</a>  think that one of the other concerns folks have, you know, the heat zones and global warming and creating uncomfortable situations for people, and how do they keep themselves cool, how do they ward off heat stroke and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2824.768s">And</a>  then, you know, the other area of public health that's a concern is, you know, kind of the changing nature of the healthcare industry, consolidations in big hospitals and the loss of, you know, local health centers where folks, you know, with Medicare and various different types of health plans, <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2848.323s">can</a>  feel as comfortable going and getting quality services as they might get at Mass General Brigham or, you know, one of the larger hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2859.205s">Because</a>  we, the principal hospital in Medford for many, many years was Lawrence Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2866.867s">And,</a>  you know, in the consolidation, the nature of what takes place at Lawrence Memorial is very different these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2873.368s">And</a>  so, you know, so that, that kind of loss, the changes at Melrose-Wakefield, changes at, you know, various hospitals in the area, you know, that, that's, that's been concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2883.905s">So,</a>  I think those would be some of the things.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2886.425s">I</a>  want to add that I brought some resources for what to do when it's very hot outside, and they're in the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2893.407s">So</a>  if you're wondering how you can keep yourself cool and protect yourself, your family, and your community, they're in the table at the back.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2900.449s">Fantastic,</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2901.95s">Well,</a>  we've run a little bit over what we scheduled to do, but it's an important conversation, and I'm really so thankful <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2909.412s">that</a>  you guys came here to have it with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2912.414s">And,</a>  you know, sometime in the future, we hope to have you back again, and we'll take up a little bit more of what we talked about tonight, and I'm sure there'll be new things to talk about as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2921.579s">So,</a>  folks, could you show some love to Daria and Mariangeli and Dave? <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2927.322s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2929.603s">OK,</a>  so we're going to take a pause. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2931.405s">We're</a>  going to break the set down so that we can get ready for the musical entertainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2936.03s">And</a>  then I'll be back to do some promotional stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2939.094s">And</a>  then we'll keep it rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/8T-RdR3JMEI&t=2940.876s">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>
