1
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I just welcome you and say good evening and welcome to the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium at historic Medford City Hall.

2
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:24,554
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Mark Rumley, and it's my honor to be a master of ceremonies this evening.

3
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:35,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, in the month of December, it is not unusual to look back over the past year and to note

4
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:42,284
[SPEAKER_04]: various events, occurrences, or milestones that have taken place during the last 12 months.

5
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:57,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it's a time when we look forward to a new year and we set goals, goals that are based on hope and desire that we will do well in our personal undertakings.

6
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is true, it is entirely fitting

7
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:20,620
[SPEAKER_04]: that we should gather in this place of government and witness Lieutenant John D. Buckley give his oath to faithfully perform the duties of chief of police in the city of Method.

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is the occasion that draws us together.

9
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:30,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So with my best New England voice, let's get started.

10
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:43,251
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, I ask you to remain seated and I'm going to introduce the special participants in our program this evening.

11
00:01:44,091 --> 00:02:01,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me introduce the Honorable Mayor Stephanie Burke, Chief Leo A. Sacco, Jr., Father Robert Casey, Lillian Bates,

12
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:10,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Rabbi Bram David, and Chief Michael Goulding of Weston.

13
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:11,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

14
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:30,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And as they take their seats, I ask that you all stand and join me in welcoming

15
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:39,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Lieutenant John D. Buckley, accompanied by his wife Dawn and daughters Allison and Sarah.

16
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:54,348
[SPEAKER_04]: also with Lieutenant Buckley is his mother, Mary, and his sister and brothers, Mary Listrow, Neil, Matthew, James, Kevin, and Michael Buckley.

17
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Please welcome them.

18
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:11,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask that you continue to stand as the Medford Honor Guard posts the colors.

19
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Group, attention!

20
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:25,510
Forward march.

21
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:34,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Left, left, right, left, left, left, left,

22
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:35,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.

23
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,751
At this time,

24
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:51,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I invite Lillian Bates, a graduate of Medford High School and a freshman at Bridgewater State University, to lead us in the singing of our national anthem.

25
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:07,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, say can you see

26
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:35,362
[SPEAKER_05]: by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,

27
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:45,911
[SPEAKER_05]: O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?

28
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:50,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And the rockets' red glare,

29
00:06:51,334 --> 00:07:03,778
[SPEAKER_05]: The bombs bursting in air gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

30
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:10,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet

31
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:25,122
[SPEAKER_05]: O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

32
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:57,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

33
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Miss Bates.

34
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:09,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, I ask that Allison and Sarah Buckley come forward and lead us all in the Pledge of Allegiance.

35
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:43,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

36
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:45,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Well done, ladies.

37
00:08:56,107 --> 00:09:04,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this time, I invite up Father Robert Casey, the chaplain of the Medford Police Department and pastor of Gate of Heaven and St.

38
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Bridget Parish in South Boston, who will offer our invocation.

39
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

40
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,961
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor for me to pray with you tonight.

41
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:28,213
[SPEAKER_00]: and to ask God's blessing upon our new chief of police, Jack Buckley.

42
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:32,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor Burke, for your choice of Jack.

43
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:40,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there were four great candidates, and I know that the decision you made in appointing Jack is the best for the future of the city of Method.

44
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:52,389
[SPEAKER_00]: We are grateful, Mayor Burke, for your trust and confidence also in appointing a member of the police department to this important role as chief of the department.

45
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:53,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So let us pray now.

46
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,060
[SPEAKER_00]: for Chief Buckley, for the city of Method, and its citizens.

47
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, we ask your presence here tonight as we come together to celebrate a new beginning for this great city of Method.

48
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:15,824
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you to bless this ceremony, to bless our newly appointed Chief John Buckley, and to bless the citizens of Medford.

49
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:28,580
[SPEAKER_00]: We give you thanks tonight for the distinguished service of Chief Buckley and are filled with gratitude for his record of honesty, integrity, and concern for the citizens of Medford these past 20 years.

50
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:41,703
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you, Lord, to guide him with your grace that he continues to make wise and prudent decisions and continues to lead with the respect of his officers and the citizens of Medford.

51
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:45,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Bless his family gathered here tonight and support them always.

52
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:55,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Lord, watch over and safeguard all our police officers and all our first responders who work each day and night to protect us and our freedoms.

53
00:10:56,744 --> 00:11:05,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Almighty God, we commend to your gracious care in keeping all men and women in law enforcement in our neighborhoods, cities, and on our highways.

54
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:19,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Defend them with your heavenly grace, protect their families, strengthen them in their trials, give them courage to face the perils which beset them, and grant them a sense of your abiding presence wherever they may be.

55
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,214
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask this in God's name.

56
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:23,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.

57
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:39,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct honor to introduce the Honorable Stephanie Burke, Mayor of the City of Medford.

58
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:43,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mark.

59
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:51,882
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd all like to sit down.

60
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:11,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening clergy, elected officials, chiefs of police, friends and family of police chief-elect Jack Buckley, members of the Metro Police Department, and residents.

61
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:18,543
[SPEAKER_08]: This evening we come together to witness the oath that will be taken shortly by our new police chief, Jack Buckley.

62
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:21,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I am proud to be your mayor for this occasion.

63
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:25,429
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I would like to share some historic facts

64
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The official formation of the police department was on March 21, 1870.

65
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:37,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Prior to that, dating back to the 1600s, they were known as peace officers.

66
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:45,701
[SPEAKER_08]: According to Medford on the Mystic, the first full-time police chief was Jophannes H. Whitney, who was appointed on May 1, 1884 in the town of Medford.

67
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:54,585
[SPEAKER_08]: The first chief to be named after becoming a city in 1892 was Emery D. Holmes.

68
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,727
[SPEAKER_08]: He was paid an annual salary of $1,101.93.

69
00:12:56,807 --> 00:13:02,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Oddly, in a report presented on February 1, 1892 by Chief Holmes, he said, I would call your attention to the quarters of the police.

70
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:14,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I will simply say that the present quarters are entirely inadequate.

71
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,803
[SPEAKER_08]: The more things change, the more they stay the same.

72
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:25,529
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been 10 police chiefs who have led the women and men of the Medford Police Department since beginning as a city.

73
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:34,597
[SPEAKER_08]: These chiefs strived to make our city safer, build partnerships in the community, and to protect and serve the people of Medford.

74
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:44,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Most recently, under the leadership of retired Chief Leo Sacco, we have made great strides in cultivating Medford as a welcoming community.

75
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:49,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chief Sacco, for your collaboration, your selflessness, and your leadership.

76
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:05,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So tonight, Lieutenant Buckley will join this illustrious group as our 11th permanent police chief.

77
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to take a moment to speak about Jack's professional career within our department.

78
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,481
[SPEAKER_08]: He joined the force in November 1998.

79
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:20,925
[SPEAKER_08]: He was elevated to sergeant in May 2008 and later to permanent lieutenant in September of 2015.

80
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:23,726
[SPEAKER_08]: His employment record is exemplary.

81
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:29,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the course of my various roles within the city of Method, I've had the opportunity to work with Jack.

82
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:35,240
[SPEAKER_08]: He is articulate, polite, and well-versed in the subject matter at hand.

83
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:48,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Throughout this appointment process, from the first time use of an assessment center to the group interview, Jack demonstrated composure under pressure, presented unique ideas, and a command of 21st century policing.

84
00:14:50,976 --> 00:15:00,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I was struck by what he thought was an accomplishment of his, that he was proud to be happily married after 20 years and an invested dad to Allison and Sarah.

85
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Kudos, Jack.

86
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,040
[SPEAKER_08]: All while serving 20 years on the force.

87
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,161
[SPEAKER_08]: This example portrayed his human side and his humble side.

88
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,423
[SPEAKER_08]: He also referenced that he is a man he is today due to his upbringing.

89
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:27,107
[SPEAKER_08]: The moral compass his parents instilled in him, hard work and being ethical.

90
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:40,077
[SPEAKER_08]: As President John F. Kennedy said, no responsibility of government is more fundamental than the responsibility of maintaining the highest standards of ethical behavior for those who conduct the public business.

91
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:54,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, with pillar one of the 21st century policing being to build trust and legitimacy, who better to build upon Chief Sacco's legacy than a person who embraces ethics, respect, and trustworthiness?

92
00:15:55,628 --> 00:16:00,551
[SPEAKER_08]: As Jack said, law enforcement culture should embrace a guardian rather than a warrior mentality.

93
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:08,277
[SPEAKER_08]: He also acknowledged that the police department does not reflect the proportionality of the makeup of the city of Method.

94
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:28,247
[SPEAKER_08]: He offered suggestions for augmenting participation in the civil service process for members of our minority community, and tonight I affirm that the mayor's office and chief will commit to offering minority candidates training sessions that will guide individuals through the exam process in order to ensure positive outcomes.

95
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:43,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I concur with Chief Holmes stated back in 1892, the current police station is totally inadequate.

96
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:50,615
[SPEAKER_08]: As chief, Jack will be tasked with overseeing the construction of the new police headquarters along with the team that we have assembled.

97
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:59,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I am confident that he and all those who have and will work in this new headquarter will be extremely proud of the completed facility.

98
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:06,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So in closing, I trust that our new chief will engage in our community through listening sessions.

99
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:12,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I trust that our new chief will be a role model for the women and men of the Medford Police Department.

100
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:17,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I trust that our new chief will implement the pillars of 21st century policing.

101
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:23,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And I trust that our new chief will work hard every day to protect the rights of all.

102
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:29,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And I trust that our chief will be a peace officer to the residents of Medford.

103
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I am proud to serve with you, Jack Buckley, in this next chapter of your professional career as Chief of the Medford Police Department.

104
00:17:48,134 --> 00:18:04,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this time, I would like to invite Police Chief-Elect John D. Buckley, his wife Dawn and daughters Allison and Sarah up to the front rail, along with Chief Michael Golding of Weston, formerly of Medford, Massachusetts, who will administer the oath of office.

105
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:46,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I, John D. Buckley, do solemnly swear and affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform on the duties that come upon me.

106
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,809
[SPEAKER_03]: and perform all the duties incumbent upon me.

107
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,231
As Chief of Police for the City of Medford.

108
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:56,554
As Chief of Police for the City of Medford.

109
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:57,716
Voting to the best of my ability.

110
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,677
Voting to the best of my ability.

111
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:01,699
And understanding.

112
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,600
And understanding.

113
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreeable to the rules and.

114
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:06,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreeable to the rules and.

115
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:08,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulations of the Constitution.

116
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulations of the Constitution.

117
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:11,929
The laws of this Commonwealth.

118

[SPEAKER_03]: The laws of this Commonwealth.

Any ordinances of the city of Edmonton.

121
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:20,162
So help me God.

122
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:21,607
Yeah.

123
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:26,244
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, my dear friends, please welcome Medford Police Chief John D. Buckley to the podium.

124
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:50,407
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely humbling to be here.

125
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:55,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honored and I appreciate your attendance.

126
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I can live up to half of the recognition you gave me, Madam Mayor.

127
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:06,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told to take a deep breath.

128
00:22:09,414 --> 00:22:13,176
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago, I sat on a stage very much like this one.

129
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:19,627
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking to an audience of police officers and family members of police officers.

130
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:26,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It was officially my first day as a sworn uniformed police officer.

131
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:40,232
[SPEAKER_02]: As the elected class president of my police academy graduating class, I was privileged to address the audience and to speak about the hopes, dreams, and concerns of a brand new police officer.

132
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:47,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke of duty and honor, of commitment, and of community service.

133
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:50,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about ideals and ethics.

134
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:55,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spoke the words, I've always wanted to be a police officer.

135
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:05,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, 20 years from that time, I stand before a similar audience.

136
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:09,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I stand here as a much older and wiser man

137
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I have had the best of times being a police officer, and I have had the worst of times being a police officer.

138
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:24,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet through it all, I have not lost sight of those hopes and those dreams.

139
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:33,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honored to still work for a police department where the men and women understand their commitment to community service.

140
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:40,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am proud to say that I still want to be the very best police officer that I can be.

141
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,625
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have now been chosen to lead the police department toward a new mission.

142
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:58,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud and humbled to have so many fine men and women looking to me to lead them into the next chapter for the city of Method and this police department.

143
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: To Mayor Burke, I cannot thank you enough.

144
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:19,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Your leadership, your vision, and your commitment to ensuring that the City of Medford remains a safe and responsive entity to the diverse community of Medford was evident throughout the selection process.

145
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:25,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise to do my best to live up to that commitment you have bestowed upon me.

146
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:27,990
[SPEAKER_02]: To your staff,

147
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:37,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Jen, Janine, Deanna, Lauren, and Allie, thank you for all you have done for me and the police department this week.

148
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:41,570
[SPEAKER_02]: To Mr. Rumley, Ms.

149
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:51,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Scanlon, Mr. Osborne, and the other department heads for the city of Method, I look forward to working closely with each of you.

150
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: To the members of the city council, I pledge to maintain the relationship that you have had with this police department

151
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:02,468
[SPEAKER_02]: For all these years, we will do good things together.

152
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:11,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Words cannot express my thoughts and respect to you, Chief Golden.

153
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:16,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You have acted as a coach, a mentor, and a role model.

154
00:25:18,362 --> 00:25:25,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope your role tonight in some way shows the respect I have for you, and I look forward to your stellar advice moving forward.

155
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:35,963
[SPEAKER_02]: To Chief Sacco, I'm not really emotional.

156
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:36,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where this comes from.

157
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:43,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to hear about this for a long time.

158
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:56,407
[SPEAKER_02]: To Chief Sacco, the only chief I have ever known, you and the Honorable Mayor Michael McGlynn gave me the opportunity to serve this city so many years ago.

159
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:07,706
[SPEAKER_02]: While this department has to move forward in your absence, I want you to know that I will do my best to follow those footprints you left behind.

160
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:10,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay close.

161
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:13,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to keep you as a Councilor and a friend.

162
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:22,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you for all you have done for us and leave you with the finest words one police officer can say to another.

163
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:26,793
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a damn good cop.

164
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:49,568
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many others I could thank, but time will certainly not allow it.

165
00:26:51,169 --> 00:27:01,934
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would be remiss to have reached the position I have today and not reach out with one quick single praise to an officer who has done so much for me in this department.

166
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Harold, you too are a fine cop.

167
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:11,978
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done a lot for this city.

168
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,281
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, I thank you, and I look forward to the challenges we will undoubtedly face together.

169
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:38,208
[SPEAKER_02]: As I look out across the auditorium, I see the faces of those I have been chosen to lead.

170
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I commit to you that I will do my best.

171
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:44,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I will undoubtedly make mistakes.

172
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:47,337
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the heart of the department.

173
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:51,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I will forever keep the best interests of the department in my heart.

174
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:55,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I impart upon you these few words.

175
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:58,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Be guardians, not warriors.

176
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:04,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how you once felt upon your police academy graduation.

177
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Reimagine that commitment to community service.

178
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:13,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Open your hearts and open your minds.

179
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind yourself what purpose we serve.

180
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:24,813
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no greater purpose in life than to be a servant of humanity.

181
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue to carry forward the mission of this police department in a peaceful, prejudice-free manner.

182
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:40,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of a police officer is always to devote oneself to the service of others.

183
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Open your hearts and open your minds.

184
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:48,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Together we will achieve great things.

185
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:52,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to now speak to the members of our community.

186
00:28:54,197 --> 00:28:57,820
[SPEAKER_02]: You should hear firsthand what the chief of police believes and what he hopes to accomplish.

187
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:04,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Community policing will remain the guiding philosophy of this police department.

188
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:14,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I will work to maintain the trust that has been bestowed upon this department by the people who live, work, commute, and play in Medford.

189
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:20,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust is the fundamental principle that will become the base of our relationship with the community of Medford.

190
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:29,322
[SPEAKER_02]: This department will work together with this community to co-produce the type of public safety it deserves.

191
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:41,019
[SPEAKER_02]: This department will continue to support a culture and practice of policing that reflects the values of protection and promotes the dignity of all.

192
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: This department will work closely with Mayor Burke to create a workforce which includes race, gender, language, life experience, and cultural background in order to ensure police effectiveness and to improve our understanding of our own diverse community.

193
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:15,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage my officers to regularly interact with the members of our community, its religious leaders, and our business community in order to identify problems so that we may collaborate on solutions that are meaningful to all.

194
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:24,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We will work with you with open hearts and open minds to make Medford a safe community for all.

195
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:27,990
[SPEAKER_02]: As I finish this speech,

196
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:39,073
[SPEAKER_02]: and embark on this new grand adventure, I want to finish with what I feel is the most important words of praise I have reserved and my final thoughts.

197
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:40,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are to my family.

198
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Mom, don't ever worry about me.

199
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:46,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing what I love.

200
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:53,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, dad would be proud.

201
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,912
[SPEAKER_02]: You and dad worked very hard to support your children.

202
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:07,736
[SPEAKER_02]: You both instilled your seven children with a strong work ethic and a devotion to family.

203
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:11,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Those values have led me to be here today.

204
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:19,266
[SPEAKER_02]: To my five brothers and my sister Mary, thank you for your support all these years.

205
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:29,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I may have achieved a position of prominence, I feel compelled to remind you all that this change is nothing.

206
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:36,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still the smartest, the strongest, the fastest, and the best looking brother.

207
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it will take some time to get used to being called chief, I can tell you there is one place I will never be known as chief.

208
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,245
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.

209
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:53,546
[SPEAKER_02]: My own home.

210
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:59,709
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's something better, something certainly more challenging and more worthwhile.

211
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:06,561
[SPEAKER_02]: This is odd.

212
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:09,884
[SPEAKER_02]: At home, I'm dead.

213
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:35,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a husband and I am a father, and to be grounded in your home life and to have a safe refuge of escape from work

214
00:32:36,195 --> 00:32:37,416
[SPEAKER_02]: is the most precious of things.

215
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:43,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Don, Allison and Sarah, thank you for all your love and support.

216
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:45,123
[SPEAKER_02]: You are my strength.

217
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:47,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so proud of all three of you.

218
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:50,028
[SPEAKER_02]: You are my greatest treasure.

219
00:32:52,530 --> 00:33:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I am most proud today to look upon you to be a living example that you too can have your dreams come true.

220
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:07,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to live this down.

221
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:14,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for coming and making this a special night.

222
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:20,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you all a safe and a happy holiday season, and I hope to make you proud.

223
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:54,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit down, Chief.

224
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:06,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think you probably feel the same way.

225
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:13,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good to be here tonight for this moment, at this time.

226
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,411
[SPEAKER_04]: We always measure time.

227
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:20,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We always look at it as if it can be contained.

228
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And a moment like this tells us that there's more.

229
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:31,260
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tomorrow, the next week, next month, the next year.

230
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a new chief who will lead us into that time, which can't be measured.

231
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:40,405
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

232
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:42,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Acknowledgements.

233
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Have to do some acknowledgements.

234
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:49,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I need my glasses.

235
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,933
[SPEAKER_04]: We have many chiefs among us tonight.

236
00:34:55,213 --> 00:35:05,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a new one, and we also have my buddy, retired Medford Police Chief Leo A. Sacco, Jr.

237
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,661
[SPEAKER_04]: and the son of Medford, Western Police Chief Michael Goulding.

239
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:57,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And up until now, Acting Police Chief, Barry Clemente, who never let me beat him in racquetball.

240
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:03,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Malden Police Chief Kevin Mollis is with us today.

00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:19,483

249
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:30,699
[SPEAKER_04]: of our superior officers in the Medford Police Department, and all of the patrol officers of the Medford Police Department who are with us tonight, and those who can't be with us tonight because they're on duty.

250
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Acknowledge them.

251
00:37:57,051 --> 00:38:08,440
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge my sister and brother department heads of the city of Method who are here tonight, along with all municipal employees and members of Medford boards and commissions.

252
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,941

274
00:41:04,192 --> 00:41:09,156
[SPEAKER_04]: There are too many people at City Hall who have worked on tonight's program to acknowledge.

275
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:18,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to acknowledge all the people in City Hall, be it the mayor's office, the law department, the city clerk's office, who worked to make this evening go.

276
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to acknowledge them.

00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:58,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Acknowledge them.

281
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:14,429
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, the chief's right on the job because he just handed me a note and it says, don't forget Alva Erickson.

282
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, there's always one that I would forget because not perfect.

283
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:48,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to extend an acknowledgement to City Councilor Michael Marks, who's with us tonight.

284
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,532
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens when you think you have everything under control.

285
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:02,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point,

286
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:10,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I call upon Rabbi Bram David of Temple Shalom for the benediction.

287
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:11,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Rabbi?

288
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:34,669
[SPEAKER_01]: In the book of Deuteronomy, we find the obligation of every community to appoint magistrates and officers to oversee and ensure that justice and peace prevail within the borders of that community.

289
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:50,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Eternal God, we have assembled here on this day to fulfill that obligation that you set before us as we have joined together to recognize the assumption of the command of Jack Buckley as he has taken his oath of office to the citizens of the city of Method.

290
00:43:51,647 --> 00:44:00,190
[SPEAKER_01]: We are grateful to our mayor, other officials, and the citizens who, with great deliberation and wisdom, have chosen Jack Buckley to serve as chief of police.

291
00:44:01,051 --> 00:44:12,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We pray that God will continue to grant each of you continued strength, health, and wisdom to govern this city so that every day may be as proud a moment as this specific one is for us today.

292
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:14,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Buckley,

293
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:16,547
[SPEAKER_01]: We only met recently.

294
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:23,190
[SPEAKER_01]: In the wake of the terrible shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, you reached out to our Jewish community.

295
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:30,713
[SPEAKER_01]: You not only helped us feel secured and protected, but also stood with us at our Show Up for Shabbat service.

296
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:41,417
[SPEAKER_01]: You remarked then at how proud you were that the citizens of Medford, in all of our diversity, came to that service in a show of unity and support.

297
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:47,074
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a leader committed to diversity, inclusivity, and community.

298
00:44:48,054 --> 00:44:50,656
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an approachable and eager builder of relationships.

299
00:44:51,336 --> 00:44:52,737
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a true friend and leader.

300
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:06,526
[SPEAKER_01]: May God continue to give you the wisdom and strength to serve our community with such important values and qualities so that everyone in Medford feels seen, protected, and valued.

301
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:21,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask God to bless the endeavors of your hand, to keep you and the men and women who serve under you safe, that God be with you in difficult times, and bless you with the wisdom of King Solomon when situations require it.

302
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:37,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Guide and lead the men and women who serve under you with honor and respect, and in turn, may they respect you, not only for all that you have accomplished up until now in your life, for the relationships that you have built and will build with them.

303
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:53,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, dear God, we ask that you bless his mother, Mary, wife, Dawn, and his children, Allison and Sarah, recognizing the important role you have as a source of love, patience, and strength behind your son, husband, and father.

304
00:45:54,610 --> 00:46:04,538
[SPEAKER_01]: May you be blessed to share many continued moments of joy in life and health and contentment as a family who truly inspire each other to the highest ideals in life.

305
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:11,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I offer the traditional Jewish words of thanksgiving upon reaching this milestone, the shehecheyanu prayer.

306
00:46:12,962 --> 00:46:19,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Baruch ata Adonai Eloheinu melech haolam, shehecheyanu vekiyamanu vehigiyanu lezman hazeh.

307
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:27,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessed are you, Lord our God, for giving us life, sustaining us, and allowing to reach this joyous occasion.

308
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:28,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.

309
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:28,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.

310
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:51,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we conclude, we would ask the members of the Medford Police Department to stay in the chambers at the end of the ceremony.

311
00:46:51,878 --> 00:46:55,200
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be pictures and that sort of thing, so it'd be easier if you stay.

312
00:46:56,602 --> 00:47:02,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we extend an invitation to everyone to join us in the mayor's office for refreshments.

313
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:06,809
[SPEAKER_04]: There's pastry and other good things there, and you're all invited.

314
00:47:08,146 --> 00:47:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Medford High School String Ensemble will now close our program with the playing of America the Beautiful, but before they do, I have to ask Sergeant Hartnett, retire the colors.

315
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:11,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

316
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,143
[SPEAKER_04]: wish everyone a joyous Christmas and New Year's.

317
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:18,851
an an an

318
00:49:40,288 --> 00:49:53,583

319

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
