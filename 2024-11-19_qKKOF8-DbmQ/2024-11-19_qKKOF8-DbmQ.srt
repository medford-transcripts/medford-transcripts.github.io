27
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:38,198
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-059, communications from the mayor.

28
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Joint resolution to make Medford hunger free.

29
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:51,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It is hereby resolved by her honor, the Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, the Honorable Medford City Council and Honorable Medford School Committee that.

30
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:59,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas hunger and poverty are issues of grave concern in the United States, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the city of Medford.

31
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:08,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas Medford is committed to educating people about food insecurity and the importance of food banks and alleviating hunger in our communities.

32
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:22,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Food insecurity is a persistent and significant reality in Medford, where 1 in 10 people, 1 in 8 children, and 1 in 14 seniors do not know where their next meal will come from.

33
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:31,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the Greater Boston Food Bank and its member agencies provide vital hunger relief services to our most valuable neighbors,

34
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:42,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas, Medford shall strive to work with hunger relief organizations to make Eastern Massachusetts hunger-free by supporting access to three healthy meals a day for our residents in need.

35
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:58,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the City of Medford, by her honor, the Mayor, the Honorable City Council, and the Honorable Medford School Committee, that one, Medford will set the goal to be hunger-free no later than January 1st, 2028, and two,

36
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:13,253
[SPEAKER_09]: that all residents of Medford are respectfully requested to take note of this joint resolution and participate fittingly in achieving this important and worthwhile goal.

37
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:29,434
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

38
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:32,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, 19 Richard Street, Mayor of Medford.

39
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, everybody.

40
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:35,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

41
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:36,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

42
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:40,681
[SPEAKER_19]: To the two new Councilors, you look very nice in those seats.

43
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,302
[SPEAKER_19]: We're here before you.

44
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:56,750
[SPEAKER_19]: I have Saram McGivern from the Board of Health, as well as the COO of the Greater Boston Food Bank here with us tonight, just to give you some statistics on hunger

45
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:59,785
[SPEAKER_19]: in Medford and obviously the Commonwealth.

46
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:16,257
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a pledge that was brought to my attention several weeks back, and it's something that I believe strongly in, and I'm sure you all do, to try to reach the goal on or before, before would be great, 2028 to declare Medford hunger-free.

47
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:20,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, one in 10 people are hungry, one in eight children.

48
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:28,665
[SPEAKER_19]: There are children in our schools, families that we see at the baseball fields, seniors that can't get out of their homes.

49
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:31,986
[SPEAKER_19]: So I thank you for taking this pledge with us.

50
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:36,887
[SPEAKER_19]: The Medford School Committee voted last night unanimously to also take this pledge.

51
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:43,529
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a number of different things we want to bring awareness to.

52
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:45,650
[SPEAKER_19]: One is the new food pantry.

53
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,991
[SPEAKER_19]: The grand opening that I hope you all can make is in a couple of weeks, the Walnut Street

54
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:53,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Center on Mystic Ave.

55
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:58,558
[SPEAKER_19]: It has a beautiful pantry set up, so that is going to help tremendously in our community.

56
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:05,460
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have micro pantries that have been installed up and around different churches.

57
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:09,122
[SPEAKER_19]: We have one being built by our Department of Public Works.

58
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:13,343
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they built it in one day that is going to go up in front of City Hall.

59
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,223
[SPEAKER_19]: City Hall is going to sponsor it.

60
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,224
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor's office is going to take charge.

61
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:19,805
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to have everybody sign

62
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:27,270
[SPEAKER_19]: the proclamation and laminate it and put it on the side of the food pantry, so I'd love you all to get involved.

63
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:39,973
[SPEAKER_19]: It's to spread awareness and to reduce the stigma for those that need help, who are insecure when it comes to food, and this is just a great step in moving Medford forward.

64
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:48,134
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would like to bring up the professionals on the topic, and they've worked very hard on this as well as

65
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:52,527
[SPEAKER_19]: a whole host of things in Medford and we greatly appreciate the steps we've been able to take.

66
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:53,449
Thank you.

67
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you please have your name and address for the record?

68
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:56,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

69
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you don't mind I read from notes.

70
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I made such a mess of it last night that I'll just read through this.

71
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:04,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Councilors.

72
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:06,304
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Carol Tinken.

73
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:10,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a Medford resident living at 261 Governors Avenue.

74
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:21,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also the Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President of Distribution Services at the Greater Boston Food Bank, the largest food bank in New England and the 12th largest food bank in the United States.

75
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I am here before you this evening to commend you on this proclamation, and thank you for your leadership in this important step to ensure all Medford residents have access to healthy food.

76
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:40,552
[SPEAKER_06]: By setting this high standard, Medford will show other cities and towns in the Commonwealth that there is not only a commitment to end hunger, but an action to end hunger.

77
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:47,137
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past two and a half years, in partnership with the City, the Malden YMCA, Project Bread, St.

78
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:48,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Francis, St.

79
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:59,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray's, and the Unitarian Universalist Pantries, and the Medford Schools, we've been able to move Med from the third largest meal gap in eastern Massachusetts

80
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:06,194
[SPEAKER_06]: to the seventh place, the third being we were only putting enough food in Medford for one meal a day for the people who need it.

81
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:16,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to give you an idea of how much that is, roughly 900 to a million meals are needed in Medford annually to feed those who are not able to access food.

82
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:24,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now we are about 200,000 meals short of that goal, a little bit more than 200,000, so we've made enormous progress.

83
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:33,179
[SPEAKER_06]: In the last year, we, as the mayor rightly said, we're looking at that 2028 goal, but we're expecting to beat it.

84
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly the new pantry will help support all the other pantries, but that has yet to be seen when it's open.

85
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,032
[SPEAKER_06]: The hunger-free, that is, access to hungry food is within our reach.

86
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we reach it, we need to sustain it.

87
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:55,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be the key to making this pledge what is really have feet.

88
00:08:55,358 --> 00:09:03,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we will use this as leadership, a leadership opportunity for us to show other cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts and in the commonwealth.

89
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:05,614
[SPEAKER_06]: that this can be done.

90
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:21,799
[SPEAKER_06]: The Food Security Task Force will continue to be at the center of this work and I'm here to assure you that the Greater Boston Food Bank will stand with this community in lockstep and certainly as I'm a resident I have a lot to hang my hat on to make sure that that happens.

91
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:26,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to yield to my colleague from Project Bread who will provide you with some more data.

92
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:41,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello my name is Sarah and I'm a resident here in Medford I live at 16 6th Street and I'm the vice president of programs and policy.

93
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,307
[SPEAKER_17]: work at Project Bread.

94
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:48,170
[SPEAKER_17]: So you are very fortunate you have two powerhouses right here in the city of Medford.

95
00:09:48,931 --> 00:10:02,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Project Bread has worked really closely over the last several years with Medford Public Schools and this year we helped to launch free breakfast in all of the school buildings across the city.

96
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:18,990
[SPEAKER_17]: And we also work with the YMCA and with parks and playgrounds to provide summer meals to kids in need who rely on school lunch and school breakfast during the school year.

97
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:26,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we know that there are a growing number of kids who are struggling with food insecurity.

98
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:32,079
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I'm sure you're aware, there's even a growing number of kids who are struggling with homelessness here in this

99
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:47,943
[SPEAKER_17]: City, and so we want to ensure that kids always have reliable, healthy meals every single day so that they can grow and thrive and take advantage of all that Medford has to offer.

100
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,924
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank you for your consideration around this pledge.

101
00:10:52,265 --> 00:11:00,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for working together with us, Project Bread, and with the Greater Boston Food Bank, and with the Food Security Task Force here.

102
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:01,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

103
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,876
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, I'm Sarah McGivern, 63 Watervale Road.

104
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,501
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm the Mass in Motion Coordinator in the Board of Health.

105
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:14,908
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm the coordinator of the Food Security Task Force.

106
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:20,876
[SPEAKER_20]: which convened about two years ago to work on issues related to hunger in our community.

107
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:27,439
[SPEAKER_20]: We recognized that there were a lot of people that were trying to work on getting people food secure, but they weren't all working together.

108
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:32,422
[SPEAKER_20]: So in fall of 2017, we started meeting and trying to get some common goals.

109
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:40,866
[SPEAKER_20]: The first thing we did was we did a food assessment for the city and we published this food plan, which I brought the summary copies for you.

110
00:11:57,292 --> 00:12:05,039
[SPEAKER_20]: So this food plan, we spent a lot of time writing and researching and looking at best practices from other communities.

111
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,725
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are a lot of recommendations in there for what our city can do to become more food secure.

112
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:30,426
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was published two years after we started meeting, and now we're at a point where we're really proud because the school committee and the city councilor and the mayor and our leaders in our community are all coming together and saying, you're all coming together and saying you're making this a priority, that we need to make sure that nobody in our city goes hungry.

113
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:34,369
[SPEAKER_20]: So we really thank you for this attention, your attention to this matter.

114
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,674
[SPEAKER_20]: And also we are one of the first communities, we think probably the first community in the Commonwealth to be doing this, so thank you.

115
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:47,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, good evening.

116
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,314
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Marian O'Connor.

117
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the Director of Board of Health for the City of Bedford.

118
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:56,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you on behalf of putting forth this resolution tonight.

119
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,378
[SPEAKER_01]: It is truly a public health victory for the City of Bedford.

120
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:11,203
[SPEAKER_01]: To think there is one child, one adult, one senior citizen that doesn't know where their next meal is coming from in this country, in this state, is a tragedy.

121
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:16,546
[SPEAKER_01]: to know to the extent that it's happening here in Medford is really a call to action.

122
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:29,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And your resolution tonight is really a call to action for all the residents of Medford to get behind this effort to eradicate hunger and security in this community.

123
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:34,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to applaud the Food Security Task Force led by Sara.

124
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:36,509
[SPEAKER_01]: and the work that they've done.

125
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,652
[SPEAKER_01]: The food plan is really a blueprint for how we can achieve these goals.

126
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:52,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I also sincerely want to thank the Greater Boston Food Bank and the Malden YMCA for their efforts in helping us really move the needle tremendously in this endeavor.

127
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you deeply from the bottom of my heart for this resolution tonight.

128
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:56,542
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

129
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:57,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

130
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:02,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

131
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to applaud everybody for bringing this forward.

132
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think people actually know

133
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,061
[SPEAKER_02]: that Medford has a food shortage.

134
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:15,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody thinks we're a nice, wealthy community.

135
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:18,646
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not wealthy, but life is good here.

136
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:23,490
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are many, many families that struggle with food that I know of.

137
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been happy to do my part with St.

138
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:28,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis Food Bank and St.

139
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:30,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray's and the Unitarian Church over the years.

140
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:37,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And you actually get to see the amount of people that do need food on a weekly basis, and I applaud.

141
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:40,439
[SPEAKER_02]: the task force for bringing this forward.

142
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:47,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like, hopefully we can move up this date to a closer date rather than that long.

143
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us the date for Walnut Street?

144
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:52,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you gave that.

145
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,272
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Walnut Street Food Bank.

146
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:57,596
[SPEAKER_02]: February 14th, Valentine's Day.

147
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And can we urge people to bring donations that day?

148
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:09,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, if you could come forward, just because there's people watching at home on TV, and so everyone gets the correct information.

149
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's gonna be pretty crowded that day.

150
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

151
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:17,312
[SPEAKER_06]: But if people do, I'm sure that they won't go wasted at all.

152
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:20,614
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that the RSVP list right now is quite high.

153
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And I applaud you for your work at the food bank, too.

154
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there many times.

155
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:24,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

156
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:26,418
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great building, great facility.

157
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate that.

158
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:27,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

159
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am very proud to be a Medford resident and seeing this happen.

160
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:32,323
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.

161
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually there for the opening, when you opened it up.

162
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:35,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did you, really?

163
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a long time ago, when you first opened.

164
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

165
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:39,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I commend you for your work.

166
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:40,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor.

167
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:40,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

168
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:43,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

169
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:52,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

170
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Councilor Marks first.

171
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:58,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

172
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:04,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn for presenting this joint resolution.

173
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:16,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I also would like to thank the Greater Boston Food Bank, as well as Project Bread and our very own Method Food Security Task Force for doing yeoman's work on this subject.

174
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:23,106
[SPEAKER_13]: The question I have, and maybe this is for our own task force, is that the 2019 food plan goals

175
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:32,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that how we're going to arrive at making method hunger free over the next several years?

176
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:44,779
[SPEAKER_13]: And if so, if you could describe, I know there's some broad strokes listed, removal of systematic barriers to food security, improved access to food assistance programs.

177
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,281
[SPEAKER_13]: How will this be done in order for us to move forward?

178
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:52,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, this sheet that you have in front of you is a summary of the greater

179
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:57,905
[SPEAKER_20]: version of the food plan, which is on the city website, and it's really long and much more detailed.

180
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:09,955
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think the answer is that the Food Security Task Force is part of my part-time position in the Board of Health, and I'm the only person who's paid to be running it.

181
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:14,299
[SPEAKER_20]: It really depends on the partners and the capacity that they have.

182
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,165
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, this new food pantry that's opening on the 14th is a collaboration between the Malden Y and the Greater Boston Food Bank, and it's

183
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:24,779
[SPEAKER_20]: them who have decided to put their resources together to make this happen.

184
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:38,144
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the city is not paying for it or doesn't have a lot of control over how that happened, besides just saying that there's a need and then our partners that work in our city responded to it.

185
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,602
[SPEAKER_20]: There are lots of ideas, but there's not really a concrete plan of exactly what's going to happen when.

186
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:53,844
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have an idea of how we could do something more detailed, let's set up a time to talk.

187
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you for that.

188
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:13,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I think part of the concern that I see is the fact that disseminating information out to the public, and how do we get into the circles where we may have a larger need?

189
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:20,001
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not sure quite how to do that, to be honest with you, and maybe we can do some brainstorming.

190
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:24,343
[SPEAKER_13]: In my other life, I work with homeless families.

191
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:35,891
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can tell you right now that probably a majority, if not all, of our families that we service through the Department of Housing and Community Development do have food insecurities.

192
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:43,776
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Greater Boston Food Bank has done tremendous work in assisting 3,600 families currently right now.

193
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,820
[SPEAKER_13]: that the state houses to get them off the street.

194
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:57,584
[SPEAKER_13]: And in my opinion, when you end food insecurity, you also need to end homelessness.

195
00:18:58,265 --> 00:18:59,686
[SPEAKER_13]: And they go hand in hand.

196
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:00,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's a really good point.

197
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:10,712
[SPEAKER_20]: And the reason why we have chosen to work on food is because it's a little bit easier than working on, say, the cost of living, or fair wages, or

198
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:18,528
[SPEAKER_20]: this big looming housing crisis that we have, like getting food to people compared to those other problems is a little bit easier.

199
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:22,631
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't have a good answer for you.

200
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:40,862
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I've been on this council, uh, 18 years and I could tell you over the last year or two, I received more phone calls from people that are living out of their car that lived in the city, can no longer afford to live here, but maybe in their car living in the cemetery or behind

201
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:44,303
[SPEAKER_13]: the mall, and it's happening more and more.

202
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:54,765
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really at a point right now that I think we as a community have to step up and address this issue that for years maybe just went under the radar.

203
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:58,206
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm seeing it more and more, I'm fielding the phone calls now.

204
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:05,368
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we should work in conjunction with your task force as well as

205
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:12,771
[SPEAKER_13]: any other agency that would like to step up and assist our homeless families that are coming from the city.

206
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,092
[SPEAKER_13]: These aren't people that are just moving into the community.

207
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:22,255
[SPEAKER_13]: These are families that have lived here for many years that all of a sudden, because of the economy, they can't keep up and they become homeless.

208
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:27,298
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's at an epidemic proportion right now.

209
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:29,759
[SPEAKER_13]: But I appreciate all the work you're doing.

210
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I do support this and will support this tonight.

211
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:52,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you bringing all those issues up to the forefront, because we see that every day becoming more and more of an issue in the Department of Public Health, even particularly for seniors who are trying to live in their homes, who can no longer afford to keep them up or to stay there, and issues snowball.

212
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Sarah's position is part-time.

213
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grant-funded.

214
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:02,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know when that grant will end, and it's unfortunately most of the work we do

215
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:05,238
[SPEAKER_01]: around these issues are not city funded, they're grant funded.

216
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:16,785
[SPEAKER_01]: So going forward, maybe we can have a discussion as to how we can sustain these wonderful jobs and positions that do this kind of work with city funding.

217
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

218
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:18,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

219
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:18,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

220
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:19,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

221
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

222
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:22,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

223
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:25,720
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I just want to thank everyone who's here.

224
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,804
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also want to thank you for giving us multiple at-bats on this, going to the school committee, coming here, because I don't think enough people in Medford know these statistics.

225
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:34,985
[SPEAKER_21]: They're pretty shocking.

226
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:36,305
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just going to repeat them.

227
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:45,370
[SPEAKER_21]: 1 in 10 residents of the city facing food insecurity, 1 in 8 children facing food insecurity, 1 in 14 seniors facing food insecurity.

228
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,731
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think every time we can say that,

229
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:50,553
[SPEAKER_21]: on public access television and wherever else so that people know it's a problem is important.

230
00:21:52,254 --> 00:22:08,780
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Councilor Marks and Sra and Marianne and others brought up a really good point which is that addressing food insecurity is an intersectional issue and the work that we do around housing affordability and the cost of living and the economy and making sure Medford works for everyone who lives here helps address this problem.

231
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,822
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't mean we don't have food plans and food-based solutions but I think we need to think of it holistically.

232
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:22,167
[SPEAKER_21]: I, in my other life, work with college students and workers on campuses, and this is a huge problem there.

233
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:31,894
[SPEAKER_21]: I was lucky enough to be at a Greater Boston Food Bank sponsored event and Project Bread and a bunch of others talking about housing and food insecurity, homelessness, and hunger on public college campuses.

234
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:37,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Upwards of 25% of students at community colleges in Massachusetts are facing hunger on a regular basis.

235
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:38,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Upwards of 10% of

236
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,584
[SPEAKER_21]: community college students are facing housing insecurity or homelessness on a regular basis.

237
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,406
[SPEAKER_21]: So some of those people live here.

238
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of those people live in Medford and go to school at these places.

239
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:56,057
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to bring that into the conversation and thank the groups that are here who are working to address that.

240
00:22:56,077 --> 00:23:00,541
[SPEAKER_21]: I also want to thank the MicroPantry group and the Board of Health as well.

241
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:22,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think I've said almost everything I want to say, and I'm really happy about the intentional approach and the progress that we've made, but I want to make sure that we get the resources that we need to address it and that we can do our best to try to integrate food and food insecurity into the other conversations we're having about what it means to live in Medford.

242
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

243
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

244
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:25,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

245
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:32,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Madam Mayor, and to your team for putting together such a well-thought-out proclamation.

246
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, the matter before us is

247
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:43,620
[SPEAKER_05]: comprehensive data-driven collaborative effort that was put together between community stakeholders working together towards a common goal.

248
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:56,885
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I support wholeheartedly today, Mr. President, and it's something that I'll support wholeheartedly in the future when we continue to talk about ways that we can come up with funding mechanisms to continue to fulfill positions of vital need here in the community.

249
00:23:56,925 --> 00:24:02,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank the administration for bringing this resolution and proclamation forward and would move approval on the matter.

250
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilman Knight.

251
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell.

252
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:11,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell.

253
00:24:11,707 --> 00:24:12,487
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

254
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:15,528
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I really just want to echo what my fellow councilors have been saying.

255
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:30,313
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate everyone for coming out, for the mayor, for putting this forward, and to Mary, and for really putting a fine point on the fact that we have a number of great programs going on in Medford, but the funding mostly comes from outside, or almost entirely comes from outside sources.

256
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:44,803
[SPEAKER_23]: I emailed Sarah about this, and she gave me a great listing of different ways that these services are delivered and can be delivered beyond just kind of like the standard food bank that we think of different ways to have people get access to this stuff.

257
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:56,692
[SPEAKER_23]: So again, echoing Councilor Knight and the point that looking as it's budget time, funding sources are ways that we can really address this problem and help to add on to how we can fix this problem in Medford.

258
00:24:57,553 --> 00:24:57,833
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

259
00:24:58,113 --> 00:24:58,954
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

260
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:02,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you all.

261
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,943
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to answer a little bit about Councilor Marks' question and just in a way of an update.

262
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:16,087
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be sending out a press release within the next few days of all the open board and committee positions.

263
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:28,707
[SPEAKER_19]: commission positions that are available as well as any other task force, pilot programs that the mayor's office is going to see if there's interest in, and one of those will be an affordable housing task force.

264
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:36,832
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's hopefully there'll be some interest in the council as well, but ways to create more affordable housing in Medford.

265
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,153
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have our Office of Community Development

266
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,087
[SPEAKER_19]: that is working on a housing production plan.

267
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:46,669
[SPEAKER_19]: We are putting out an RFQ for a consultant to do a housing production plan.

268
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:53,874
[SPEAKER_19]: We're also working on a number of different things related to housing and the 340B projects that are before us.

269
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,295
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to give you those in the way of updates.

270
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:58,637
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank you for your support.

271
00:25:59,237 --> 00:26:02,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank my chief of staff, David, who is here tonight as well.

272
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,220
[SPEAKER_19]: My family came because it's...

273
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:06,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I have two chief of staff, David.

274
00:26:06,714 --> 00:26:13,136
[SPEAKER_19]: My family brought them here, as well as Sarah, who brought her son here, because it is such an important issue.

275
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:19,098
[SPEAKER_19]: And thank you to Sarah, to Sarah, to Carol, and Mary Ann for working so diligently on this.

276
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:22,219
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a group effort, and you're part of that group.

277
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,100
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

278
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,941
[SPEAKER_19]: I have the proclamation here to sign, and after you take the vote, I will pass it around.

279
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:27,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

280
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:29,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

281
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:30,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

282
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:33,644
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't be redundant.

283
00:26:33,764 --> 00:26:37,385
[SPEAKER_16]: I know what my fellow Councilors said is very important.

284
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:42,807
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that as a former teacher and a coach, the avenues and the partnerships of the school is going to be vital.

285
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:53,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Working in my capacity in recreation in Somerville, one of the biggest partnerships we have are the school department.

286
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,853
[SPEAKER_16]: And one thing we realized is we realized how many of our

287
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:12,598
[SPEAKER_16]: young men that we, at the coaching side, how many kids have serious concerns, you know, that they come in in the morning with their free breakfast, free lunch, and then some of those kids don't eat again until Monday morning.

288
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:16,542
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know we took an active role in really

289
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:28,412
[SPEAKER_16]: You're looking at our athletic department, our guidance department, really looking at those individuals and using those avenues because there's a connection there where

290
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:33,688
[SPEAKER_16]: kids have trust in those people and to reach those families.

291
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:37,731
[SPEAKER_16]: And once that started, it really took off.

292
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:49,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've reached out to a few different organizations that will be hopefully working with Method soon about doing some food drives and really do some great things here in Method.

293
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:54,585
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm really excited about this because where I was seeing it, it was really in a bubble.

294
00:27:55,346 --> 00:28:00,433
[SPEAKER_16]: And now being the first in the Commonwealth, we're really bringing this out on the forefront.

295
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:05,340
[SPEAKER_16]: So I give the mayor a lot of credit and city staff and volunteers.

296
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,301
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is amazing.

297
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:09,986
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, kudos and I support this 100 100%.

298
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:10,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

299
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:13,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

300
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:21,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And before I call the roll, or before the clerk calls the roll, I'd just like to thank everyone for coming down tonight to speak on this issue.

301
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very important issue that actually, it has an impact on so many people throughout this community.

302
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:35,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think far too many times people think, or just under the assumption that everyone has a meal, when everyone does not.

303
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:37,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's something that needs to be addressed.

304
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:41,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm happy that this is coming before us tonight.

305
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to thank everyone for their involvement in this.

306
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:47,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

307
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,931
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you could give us your name and address for the record.

308
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:55,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Reverend Wendy Miller Olapade 105 Brooks Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

309
00:28:56,497 --> 00:29:05,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to add the affirmation that it takes a village.

310
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,722
[SPEAKER_12]: to solve problems like this.

311
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:20,626
[SPEAKER_12]: That it is not just our city government's responsibility or not just the department's responsibility that all of our neighbors can help each other.

312
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:32,230
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to share that, you know, as one of the pastors in town who's got a micro food pantry at their church, it took us about two months

313
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:36,725
[SPEAKER_12]: make, to actively have to keep that full.

314
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,207
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't have to do anything now.

315
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:45,049
[SPEAKER_12]: People just put food in the pantry and people come and take food out of the pantry.

316
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,472
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a beautiful, beautiful thing and it didn't take much at all.

317
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:58,537
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that that's a tiny little, tiny little piece of the pie and yet somehow

318
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:21,510
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when we start to pull together as a community, when we create opportunities to talk to each other across difference, when we look at each other and say, you're a human being, and I'm a human being, and you go to that church, and you go to that temple, and you go to that mosque, and you don't go anywhere, but we still share this beautiful community together, and that we're all responsible for it.

319
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,412
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to lift that up and say, we can do this if we just

320
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:29,313
[SPEAKER_12]: talk to each other.

321
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:30,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, John.

322
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:42,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street Method Mass.

323
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,182
[SPEAKER_22]: If I may, I'd like to commend the mayor for her mission and her entourage.

324
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,543
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a great idea because no one should be hurting.

325
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:58,086
[SPEAKER_22]: If they're hurting now, imagine if at full employment, mind you, as we're going to hear tonight from the State of the Union.

326
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:14,368
[SPEAKER_22]: Imagine if we have a recession or something worse We're it's really going to be much worse of course I'm sort of thinking out loud Would it be possible to ask the presidential candidate the ex?

327
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:20,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Resident of massive method mass mr.. Bloomberg for some assistance on this matter.

328
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:21,489

00:41:18,798 --> 00:41:21,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight.

412
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:23,499
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

413
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,880
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

414
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,060
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

415
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you and congratulations.

416
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:27,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck guys.

417
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:28,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

418
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:35,343
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Morell.

419
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:36,243
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

420
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:37,443
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

421
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:38,384
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

422
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:42,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

423
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:46,526
[SPEAKER_09]: 19-623 offered by Councilor Knight, update on the Eversource project.

424
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:49,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

425
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:50,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

426
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:55,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And through you, I'd like to thank also our friends from Eversource that are here this evening.

427
00:41:55,593 --> 00:42:01,479
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple weeks ago, we put forward a resolution asking that we get quarterly updates on the Eversource project.

428
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:04,642
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a large scale, large scope project that's going to be coming through our community.

429
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:16,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought that it might be in the best interest, as well as my colleagues did, I believe, to have periodic updates as to what's going on, what to expect, and to be able to address any concerns that may be coming up in the neighborhood.

430
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, we do have some representatives here from Eversource that I'd like to thank for being here.

431
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,660
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Mr. Shortell, Mr. Zamparelli, and

432
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:31,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe we have a new community relations liaison here that we're going to be introduced to this evening.

433
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:36,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to turn the floor over to our friends from Eversource, provided my council colleagues have no problem with that.

434
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can move on with an update from our friends over at Eversource, Mr. President.

435
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:41,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Consul Knight.

436
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:43,011
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could please have your name and address for the record.

437
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:44,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

438
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:46,494
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Collins, Londonderry, New Hampshire.

439
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:49,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the Eversource project manager for this particular project.

440
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:54,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update to the project.

441
00:42:55,762 --> 00:43:02,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We did provide a handout that I think all the councilors received that provides an overall overview of the project.

442
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:05,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll quickly go through that as well as provide an update.

443
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:07,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And also with me is Sean Shortell.

444
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about community relations, I'll turn it over to Sean since he's the go-to guy for community relations.

445
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Overview of the project, the project's approximately eight miles long.

446
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:28,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts at the substation in Woburn, goes through Winchester, Medford, Somerville, Boston, and into the substation on the Mystic River.

447
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:41,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Just want to clarify one thing that I think the council has a misunderstanding on the project, based on watching some of the prior meetings on TV.

448
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:45,127
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an electric transmission project.

449
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:46,067
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a gas.

450
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:49,806
[SPEAKER_03]: line project, so just for clarification.

451
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:53,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a 115,000 volt underground transmission line project.

452
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:59,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, again, between the two substations.

453
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:16,746
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for the project is back a few years ago, I don't remember exactly when, it was before my time with Eversource, but ISO New England did a study and concluded that the greater Boston area is at risk for potential outages.

454
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:27,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is one of a number of projects that Eversource has and Engrid has to increase the reliability of the greater Boston grid.

455
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:31,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So this project is necessary for the entire area.

456
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:36,182
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to.

457
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:45,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Page three of the handout, you'll see that the process of construction is you can visualize a train.

458
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:48,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a construction train.

459
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:54,530
[SPEAKER_03]: The cattle catcher at the front is the saw cutting exercise.

460
00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:05,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a saw cut go out in front of the project, saw cut the street to make sure that the excavation is neat in the asphalt.

461
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:10,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we come back later, excavate the trench.

462
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:15,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we come back behind that, install the pipe, backfill the pipe, and move on.

463
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:25,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, it's done from a manhole to manhole segment standpoint.

464
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:32,116
[SPEAKER_03]: We install one manhole, then install another manhole and try to work between the two manholes is the most efficient way of doing it.

465
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:38,823
[SPEAKER_03]: The project has nine vaults, electric manholes that are approximately 10 by 10 by 30.

466
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,245
[SPEAKER_03]: We have five of them installed.

467
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:42,907
[SPEAKER_03]: We have four remaining.

468
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:57,722
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to page five of the handout, you'll see the location of the various electric vaults and the ones that have been installed, when they were installed, and the ones that are remaining.

469
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:03,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, the project itself, we have about 35% of the

470
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,483
[SPEAKER_03]: of the trenching pipe work done.

471
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:15,630
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to page six of the handout, you'll see what work we have done, when it was done, and what work is remaining.

472
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:23,879
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently have a plan developed to get this project completed this summer.

473
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:47,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself, McCourt Construction Company, who is our contractor for doing this particular work, will be reaching out to the city to work with the city staff to present our plan and get buy-in on what we think can be done, how it can be done to minimize the impact to the community as we're moving forward with the construction.

474
00:46:51,263 --> 00:47:02,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Following completion of the pipeline from substation to substation, a separate contractor will be coming back next year to pull the cable and splice the cable.

475
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:09,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the cable splicing is start, that's a 24-7 operation.

476
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Estimate is going to take about five days of 24-hour operations at each manhole to do the splicing.

477
00:47:19,805 --> 00:47:25,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, if you've got any questions regarding the construction of the project, I'll be glad to answer any questions.

478
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:32,476
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, I'll turn it over to Mr. Shortell to talk about the community outreach aspects of the project.

479
00:47:33,697 --> 00:47:33,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

480
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:36,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let them finish their presentation, Mr. President.

481
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:38,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we have any questions, we can do it.

482
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:39,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to ruin the flow.

483
00:47:40,142 --> 00:47:43,205
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could please continue with the presentation, and we'll do questions at the end.

484
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:43,365
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

485
00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:48,066
[SPEAKER_18]: tag in for Rob Collins.

486
00:47:48,246 --> 00:47:50,867
[SPEAKER_18]: My name's Sean Schwartel, and I live in Charlestown, Massachusetts.

487
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,730
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've appeared before the city council a few times before.

488
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,072
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that we have two new members, so congratulations.

489
00:47:59,953 --> 00:48:06,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob and I put this packet together with some of the construction means and methods slides so that you have a better understanding of what you'll see in the roadway.

490
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:12,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of these slides may be redundant to other members, but just a refresher on what the construction activity looks like.

491
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,221
[SPEAKER_18]: And that kind of segues into my role.

492
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:22,484
[SPEAKER_18]: My role with the project is to communicate what we're doing, when we're doing it, to stakeholders along the routes.

493
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:29,307
[SPEAKER_18]: That's businesses, schools, and most importantly, your constituents and your neighbors.

494
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:42,453
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have a community outreach program where we go door-to-door during each phase of construction in advance of that work so that people are kind of have a general awareness of what's happening on their street on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis.

495
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:48,077
[SPEAKER_18]: We also layer that with website updates that are updated weekly.

496
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:51,080
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's an example of that on slide 10.

497
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:57,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, we are co-hosting some of the information about the project on the city's own web page.

498
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:02,892
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's something that we also update not quite as frequently as weekly, the Eversource

499
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:14,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Project updates are weekly, but the ones that go through the city website are a little less frequent, and we can certainly accelerate that if we determine from our stakeholders at the city that there's a need to do so.

500
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:17,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, we have stakeholder emails.

501
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:22,003
[SPEAKER_18]: I think almost everybody on the council has been getting them from me over the past year.

502
00:49:22,563 --> 00:49:32,128
[SPEAKER_18]: They generally go out biweekly, letting you know what's going on in what part of town and what some of the issues that we've identified and how we've attempted to address them.

503
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:47,622
[SPEAKER_18]: And then as Rob mentioned, municipal coordination, we're working closely with your city engineer, your city traffic engineer, your police department on what our plan is to get this project done in 2020, this summer.

504
00:49:48,523 --> 00:49:52,325
[SPEAKER_18]: And then finally, there's a 24-hour hotline and email address for residents with questions.

505
00:49:53,185 --> 00:50:01,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Those emails and 800 numbers, they come to me, and I respond to them generally within 24 hours, sometimes even sooner.

506
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:11,017
[SPEAKER_18]: And then as I mentioned, slide 10 is a brief example of what the project website looks like that's hosted by Eversource.com.

507
00:50:11,597 --> 00:50:16,881
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the final slide is both Rob's contact information, my contact information, and

508
00:50:17,742 --> 00:50:20,663
[SPEAKER_18]: my supervisor Todd's contact information as well.

509
00:50:20,863 --> 00:50:22,583
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is our cell phone number.

510
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:23,824
[SPEAKER_18]: It goes right to our email.

511
00:50:23,864 --> 00:50:24,944
[SPEAKER_18]: We are here.

512
00:50:25,604 --> 00:50:28,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob has an office in Medford on High Street.

513
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:30,806
[SPEAKER_18]: And I try to be here several days a week.

514
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:37,568
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to be responsive and work with you to alleviate any concerns of your neighbors and constituents.

515
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:46,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

516
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:47,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, Councilor Knight.

517
00:50:48,055 --> 00:50:49,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

518
00:50:49,156 --> 00:50:52,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank you both for being here this evening and thank you for your presentation.

519
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Sean's done a great job, I think, of keeping us informed as to what's going on with the project.

520
00:50:57,203 --> 00:51:00,005
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all been receiving periodic updates, there's no question about that.

521
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also safe to say that the

522
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:08,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst is yet to come when it comes to the construction and the impact it's going to have on our community.

523
00:51:08,075 --> 00:51:14,797
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're looking at the project breakdown here, we're about 40% of the total project is in the city of Medford.

524
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:20,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do I see here?

525
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,181
[SPEAKER_05]: 5,800 feet scheduled for completion along Winthrop Street.

526
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:28,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Another 1,400 feet on south, another 550.

527
00:51:28,443 --> 00:51:31,364
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a significant amount of construction that's going to take place in the community.

528
00:51:31,744 --> 00:51:33,365
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think really what's going to make this

529
00:51:34,136 --> 00:51:44,249
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the least painful on everybody in the community is going to be this open dialogue and our ability to sit down with other sources on a periodic basis to get updates from them to address the concerns that we have in the community.

530
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:51,719
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been very responsive, in my opinion, based upon the concerns that I've had in my neighborhood right in front of the Medford High School project they did.

531
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,801
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of work out there at the beginning of the school year.

532
00:51:55,322 --> 00:51:59,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It went relatively smooth considering the scope of the construction work that was being done.

533
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:03,447
[SPEAKER_05]: The area was maintained relatively clean.

534
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Access to the park, access to the sidewalks was still there.

535
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:09,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Traffic was able to flow as best as possible.

536
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:16,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought that the road construction detours that they made made it passable and livable for the period of time that they were there doing the work.

537
00:52:17,455 --> 00:52:22,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I do appreciate the work that Eversource has done in putting into this.

538
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:31,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I do appreciate the work that McCourt Contracting has done putting into this because they are paying close attention to some of the community needs and quality of life issues in our neighborhoods.

539
00:52:31,561 --> 00:52:33,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd hope that we can continue this dialogue.

540
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:42,746
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the great things I thought that we got during the Craddock Bridge project was those three week schedules with the project briefing overviews that said, you know,

541
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:45,288
[SPEAKER_05]: 83% done with the project.

542
00:52:45,448 --> 00:52:48,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, we're going to be working at these locations on these times.

543
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:54,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty much the emails that we've been getting from Sean anyway throughout the course of the sporadic construction that's been going on.

544
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:58,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, I want to thank our friends from Eversource.

545
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:04,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, you know, there's going to be a lot more time to talk about some of the issues and the impacts that are going to happen along with this project.

546
00:53:05,064 --> 00:53:11,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of right now, you know, I think that it's the open dialogue, the understanding as to when the construction is going to happen and the impact that it's going to have on the neighborhood.

547
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:18,258
[SPEAKER_05]: in the neighbors, in the traffic, in the congestion in the community that really needs to get out there so that we can get ahead of it.

548
00:53:19,418 --> 00:53:20,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilman Knight.

549
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:20,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilman Beers.

550
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:22,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

551
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:24,119
[SPEAKER_21]: I just had a quick question for you, Rob.

552
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,420
[SPEAKER_21]: So it says in here 7 to 10 days.

553
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,301
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know anything about the engineering of the project, so completely ignorant.

554
00:53:34,642 --> 00:53:37,322
[SPEAKER_21]: If my questions come from a place of ignorance, I hope you'll correct me.

555
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:39,042
[SPEAKER_21]: But it says 7 to 10, you said 5.

556
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,783
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that, are you doing something different?

557
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:54,752
[SPEAKER_03]: My subcontractor is saying that basically once they start the splicing, it typically takes about five days, a continuous 24-hour operation.

558
00:53:55,112 --> 00:53:57,173
[SPEAKER_03]: We say seven to 10 just to be on the safe side.

559
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:58,313
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep, got it.

560
00:53:59,954 --> 00:54:02,695
[SPEAKER_21]: And is this basically just pulling the cable from one end to the other?

561
00:54:02,935 --> 00:54:09,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens is if you go to slide eight, you'll see

562
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Top left-hand corner is a picture of three cable reels.

563
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:20,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So these cables, this cable is actually three-phase, so it's three separate cables that are pulled simultaneously through the pipe.

564
00:54:20,553 --> 00:54:21,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what the reel looks like.

565
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:28,759
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes about two days of pulling to pull from one manhole to the other, which on average is about 2,000 linear feet.

566
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:31,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll start up, pull the cable.

567
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:38,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they get the cable pulled from adjoining manholes into a single manhole,

568
00:54:39,045 --> 00:54:43,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they start splicing, and that splicing operation takes five days or so.

569
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:43,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Got it.

570
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:54,575
[SPEAKER_21]: And just looking at what Councilor Neill was looking at, is there a reason you, and maybe it's completely coincidental, is there a reason that it looks like the construction started on the MassDOT jurisdiction and is moving to Medford, or?

571
00:54:54,795 --> 00:55:05,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So it started in MassDOT because we didn't have the GOL in Medford, and we did, from a MassDOT standpoint, it was within MassDOT jurisdiction, so we started in MassDOT.

572
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:06,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thanks.

573
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:08,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

574
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:09,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell.

575
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:11,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

576
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:16,339
[SPEAKER_23]: So going back to the cable splicing, which you mentioned is once that work starts, it's 24 hours, it's around the clock.

577
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,244
[SPEAKER_23]: What kind of sound can we expect from that?

578
00:55:19,284 --> 00:55:20,667
[SPEAKER_23]: And then also lighting.

579
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:27,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's relatively minimal because the splicing is down inside this underground vault.

580
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:34,074
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a generator, a whisper generator outside providing power down into the vault.

581
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:39,458
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be some lighting overhead shining down into the vault, but it's gonna be minimal.

582
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:45,802
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, and then how soon after the work is completed on these areas can we expect that curb to curb?

583
00:55:46,841 --> 00:56:08,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So in discussions with the city engineer basically what you want to do is You want it to you want the trench to sit for over a winter so that any settlement that's going to happen happens So that then when you do the curb to curb it's going to be nice and your settlements already occurred So we're looking at the following year doing the curb to curb.

584
00:56:09,107 --> 00:56:09,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

585
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:09,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

586
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:09,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I

587
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:11,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

588
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:12,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

589
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

590
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:18,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Regarding the vaults, in particular vault 8 and 10.

591
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:19,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

592
00:56:20,664 --> 00:56:23,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Any time frame when that work will start?

593
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hoping to get out there as soon as the winter moratorium is over.

594
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:31,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So April 15th.

595
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:36,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember off the top of my head if McCourt was looking at starting at 8 or 10.

596
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:39,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's when we want to try to start.

597
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,147
[SPEAKER_13]: And roughly, what's the length of those two vaults?

598
00:56:44,248 --> 00:56:46,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So the installation of the vault's about two weeks.

599
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:47,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Two weeks?

600
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:50,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, providing there's no ledge there.

601
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:52,333
[SPEAKER_03]: We encountered ledge at vault number nine.

602
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:58,016
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it took us as long as it did to install vault number nine.

603
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:03,620
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's no ledge, we should be able to get it excavated, the vault installed, and backfilled in about two weeks.

604
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:04,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

605
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,703
[SPEAKER_13]: And isn't there a way of checking for ledge before you start to dig?

606
00:57:09,364 --> 00:57:10,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

607
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's once you start digging, when you hit it, you hit it.

608
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:20,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we suspect there's going to be some ledge around manhole 8, but we're not 100% sure.

609
00:57:22,257 --> 00:57:25,880
[SPEAKER_13]: And depending on the type of ledge, would that include blasting?

610
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,082
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

611
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:30,604
[SPEAKER_03]: The MOU and the GOL precludes blasting.

612
00:57:30,644 --> 00:57:32,765
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have to come up with another method.

613
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:41,773
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did at manhole nine was essentially a big jackhammer, a whole rim attached to an excavator to beat on the ledge.

614
00:57:42,373 --> 00:57:44,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And that breaks it up, and then we're able to excavate it.

615
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:49,319
[SPEAKER_13]: And residents notified when that type of jackhammer was?

616
00:57:49,339 --> 00:57:49,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

617
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:57,851
[SPEAKER_13]: So if any of that takes place on vault 8 or 10, there'll be ample notification of area residents?

618
00:57:57,991 --> 00:57:58,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there will.

619
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:04,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys do any video of people's homes and so forth if they're in close proximity?

620
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:07,159
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't in that area, no.

621
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,043
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't be opposed to it if someone asked for it out of concern.

622
00:58:14,753 --> 00:58:32,110
[SPEAKER_13]: The other question I had, currently within the MOU, there's some language in there that states if there's any city utilities that are either over or under your transmission wire, if they're cast iron or so forth, that you would replace them.

623
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that not correct?

624
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:39,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember, off the top of my head, I don't have the MOU memorized.

625
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:40,815
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely identifying them.

626
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:44,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city comes out and takes a look at them.

627
00:58:45,377 --> 00:58:47,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's determined it needs to be replaced, then we'll address it.

628
00:58:48,478 --> 00:58:48,678
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

629
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Has any of that happened to date?

630
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:54,000
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't encountered one that needs to be replaced yet.

631
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,003
[SPEAKER_13]: But you are working over and under our utilities, correct?

632
00:58:58,023 --> 00:58:58,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

633
00:58:58,623 --> 00:59:01,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And you haven't seen anything to date that needs to be replaced?

634
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:02,467
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

635
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:08,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, replaced meaning you see something actively leaking or you see something actively wrong?

636
00:59:08,953 --> 00:59:10,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that when you see it?

637
00:59:10,595 --> 00:59:12,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we would notify the city and they would come out.

638
00:59:12,937 --> 00:59:18,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, but just the mere fact that it may be a cast iron pipe, water cast iron pipe, is that?

639
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:33,347
[SPEAKER_13]: From my reading of the MOU that I have in front of me, signed by the city solicitor, it states that, this is bullet point three.

640
00:59:34,176 --> 00:59:41,743
[SPEAKER_13]: It says, in addition to surface reconstruction, Eversource should upgrade city-owned underground utilities that are in close proximity.

641
00:59:42,304 --> 00:59:54,796
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, a minimum, a bucket width of five feet to their new transmission main and or for those utilities that cross over under the transmission main.

642
00:59:55,982 --> 01:00:02,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So are you saying that only if you see something actively wrong with the pipe that you would bring it to the city's attention?

643
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:02,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

644
01:00:03,124 --> 01:00:09,285
[SPEAKER_13]: So you don't think that there's a responsibility to replace anything that you cross over or under?

645
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:09,785
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

646
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:10,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

647
01:00:12,566 --> 01:00:16,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'd like to get just a response from the city solicitor.

648
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:26,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Regarding bullet point three in the MOU for March 9, 2017, that was signed by City Solicitor Rumley.

649
01:00:28,152 --> 01:00:36,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Just if we can get clarification on the responsibility of Eversource when they cross over our utilities.

650
01:00:37,657 --> 01:00:38,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

651
01:00:38,877 --> 01:00:49,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So Councilor Marks is making a motion to get a response back from the city solicitor regarding bullet point three on the MOU that we have with- From March 9th, 2017.

652
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:51,280
[SPEAKER_09]: From March 9th, 2017.

653
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,741
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Bears.

654
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:56,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

655
01:00:56,881 --> 01:00:57,421
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

656
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:58,121
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

657
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:00,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks, do you have any further questions?

658
01:01:00,962 --> 01:01:02,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I am good for now, thank you.

659
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

660
01:01:04,089 --> 01:01:04,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

661
01:01:04,609 --> 01:01:05,330
[SPEAKER_21]: I had one more.

662
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:11,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Just looking at Vault 12, police stations being built right across the street.

663
01:01:11,154 --> 01:01:12,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you plan to time that?

664
01:01:12,155 --> 01:01:13,356
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you coordinated that with the chief?

665
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:17,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've actually had discussions with the chief, and he wants that work done at nighttime.

666
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:17,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

667
01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:22,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be coordinating with the chief on exactly when we're going to get that done.

668
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:23,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

669
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:23,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

670
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:25,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

671
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

672
01:01:27,406 --> 01:01:29,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't mind, from the chair.

673
01:01:29,387 --> 01:01:31,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we know exactly when that's going to happen?

674
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:32,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I know at night, but do we know?

675
01:01:34,143 --> 01:01:35,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any type of time frame with regards to months?

676
01:01:35,884 --> 01:01:44,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have that right now because that's the part of the plan that we're going to be presenting to the city departments, traffic engineers, city engineer, and police department.

677
01:01:45,428 --> 01:01:49,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Mapping out what we want to do when we want to do it and get the buy-in.

678
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:53,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know when we can expect to maybe get a time frame?

679
01:01:54,812 --> 01:02:02,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping to meet with the city engineer and traffic engineer by the end of the month to work through that.

680
01:02:07,378 --> 01:02:13,165
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had a question, thank you for that answer, and I had a question regarding the splicing that Councilor Morell was asking.

681
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:16,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So you talked a little bit about, I think, noise.

682
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:18,570
[SPEAKER_09]: What about traffic?

683
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:23,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there going to be a heavy traffic impact on that street when that happens?

684
01:02:23,716 --> 01:02:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: when the splicing happens, it will be a lot, there will be a little bit of traffic impact, but it will be a lot less than when we're installing the vaults and installing the duct work.

685
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:42,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Because basically what it involves is just setting up a box truck, you know, a cargo van at the manhole location.

686
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:51,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So traffic will definitely be able to flow by it, but we will have to have a piece of equipment there to support the equipment.

687
01:02:54,162 --> 01:02:56,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other further questions from the consular?

688
01:02:56,503 --> 01:02:57,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?

689
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, seeing that there's no questions, Consular Night.

690
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:13,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I move to invite our friends from Eversource back next quarter for a future update.

691
01:03:14,073 --> 01:03:20,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure if anything happens in between then and now, we all have the ability to flip this packet over that they gave us and make a phone call and get the answers that we need.

692
01:03:22,191 --> 01:03:23,871
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a pressing need to bring them in sooner.

693
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:32,553
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been nothing more than accommodating in the past, so I don't see why we can't put this off till next quarter, have another update when the construction season starts in the spring, and go from there.

694
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you still like the table till next quarter?

695
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:37,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, same thing we did with the Lawrence Memorial.

696
01:03:37,394 --> 01:03:37,594
Okay.

697
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:47,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilmembers, would you like this to be a B paper on this original paper?

698
01:03:47,996 --> 01:03:48,237
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

699
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that's a B paper.

700
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:58,229
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Council and I to table this to next quarter, where we get our quarterly update, seconded by Councilor Bears.

701
01:03:58,809 --> 01:03:59,410
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

702
01:03:59,430 --> 01:03:59,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

703
01:04:00,131 --> 01:04:00,791
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

704
01:04:01,552 --> 01:04:02,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

705
01:04:02,574 --> 01:04:03,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

706
01:04:03,194 --> 01:04:04,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate all the information and the update.

707
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:05,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

708
01:04:06,678 --> 01:04:07,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your patience.

709
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:29,975
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-051 offered by Council and I be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize Medford native and MHS class of 1996 graduate Justin Springer on being honored as a 2019 ABCD Community Hero

710
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:34,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Consul Knight.

711
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:36,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

712
01:04:36,388 --> 01:04:38,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin Springer is a dear old friend of mine.

713
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:41,710
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to kindergarten all the way through high school together.

714
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,191
[SPEAKER_05]: A close, close friend of mine.

715
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:45,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Came to vacations with me and my family.

716
01:04:45,312 --> 01:04:47,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Grew up in West Medford.

717
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:52,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Spent a lot of great afternoons after school in his house, at his grandmother's house down on Monument Street.

718
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:55,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And we lost touch over the years, Mr. President.

719
01:04:55,596 --> 01:04:57,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And just recently, we fell back into touch.

720
01:04:57,777 --> 01:04:58,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I was speaking with

721
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:14,263
[SPEAKER_05]: His stepfather, Mel, not too long ago when he gave me an update that Justin was doing well, and I started paying attention on social media and noticed that Justin was named this community hero by the ABCD.

722
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:21,365
[SPEAKER_05]: And ABCD is an anti-poverty community development and human service organization, Mr. President.

723
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:24,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the largest non-profit human service agency in New England.

724
01:05:24,894 --> 01:05:32,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And it serves over 100 low-income families in greater Boston through its programs like neighborhood service centers and something we're all familiar with.

725
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we've all heard of the Head Start programs.

726
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:36,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Head Start falls under the ABCD as well.

727
01:05:37,243 --> 01:05:40,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So Justin was named a community hero this past year.

728
01:05:41,387 --> 01:05:44,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd just like to read a little bit about what they said about Justin in the brochure.

729
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:49,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin's proven to be a tremendous asset to ABCD by lending his vast branding and marketing skills.

730
01:05:50,222 --> 01:05:55,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Talents and resources to help bridge gaps in how communities assess public health education and engage with various initiatives.

731
01:05:56,166 --> 01:06:10,615
[SPEAKER_05]: His numerous accomplishments in this area include orchestrating a street outreach team every year, conducting social media platforms for many of ABCD Health Service programs, producing major fundraising events for the Take the Test Boston program, which ABCD Health Services is a founding member.

732
01:06:10,935 --> 01:06:12,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did this all in his own dime.

733
01:06:13,253 --> 01:06:25,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I always think it's important that we notice and recognize the individuals that were born and raised in this community, whose families still live here, who helped make this community great.

734
01:06:25,557 --> 01:06:29,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should point out the good things that they're doing in other places and here in Medford.

735
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:32,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin's someone that's really an inspiration.

736
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,341
[SPEAKER_05]: He's someone that's given his time, his energy, and his effort.

737
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll free a charge to the city of Boston and to its surrounding communities to help make our lives a better place.

738
01:06:42,725 --> 01:06:45,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Helping service over 100,000 families that are in need.

739
01:06:46,108 --> 01:06:55,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it was important that we point out the great work that Medford residents continue to do on a daily basis, not only here in Medford, but in Massachusetts and across the globe.

740
01:06:56,034 --> 01:06:59,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this resolution.

741
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilman Knight, and thank you for bringing this forward tonight.

742
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:06,687
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

743
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:07,468
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

744
01:07:07,968 --> 01:07:08,629
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

745
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:09,450
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

746
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:14,616
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-052 offered by Vice President Caraviello.

747
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:24,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council contact the DCR to replace the guardrail on the bridge at Auburn Street in the interest of public safety.

748
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:26,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

749
01:07:26,682 --> 01:07:27,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

750
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:36,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, this guardrail which is over by Whole Foods has been probably hit several times in the past few months.

751
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:46,877
[SPEAKER_02]: The steel is on the sidewalk and it's kind of a safety hazard for people that are walking by because that's the sidewalk you have to go by to get to the crosswalk.

752
01:07:49,519 --> 01:08:00,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask the DCI to replace it as soon as possible, and if we could also send a message to Representative Gobley to hopefully expedite this so we can get this done as soon as possible.

753
01:08:01,548 --> 01:08:02,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

754
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:05,971
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell.

755
01:08:06,492 --> 01:08:07,212
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

756
01:08:07,232 --> 01:08:08,433
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

757
01:08:08,453 --> 01:08:09,134
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

758
01:08:13,285 --> 01:08:14,987
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-053 offered by Councilor Bears.

759
01:08:15,227 --> 01:08:33,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council meet in Committee of the Whole to discuss the report of the acting city solicitor regarding a draft ordinance enabling the establishment of a payment in lieu of taxes pilot commissioned as requested by Councilor, I'm sorry, as requested by the Council in paper 20-021.

760
01:08:43,525 --> 01:08:44,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

761
01:08:44,265 --> 01:08:45,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

762
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:46,986
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it says it all.

763
01:08:47,346 --> 01:08:51,868
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to move the report that we got from the acting solicitor to a future committee of whole meeting.

764
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:54,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

765
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:56,990
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

766
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,750
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

767
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:58,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

768
01:08:58,411 --> 01:08:59,051
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

769
01:08:59,191 --> 01:08:59,951
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

770
01:09:03,713 --> 01:09:09,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I would ask at this point if Councilor Marks could please share the next two motions.

771
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,321
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

772
01:09:18,341 --> 01:09:18,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn these off for you.

773
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:21,024
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to turn it off.

774
01:09:21,064 --> 01:09:21,664
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

775
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:26,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can get it for you.

776
01:09:26,268 --> 01:09:31,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I got it right here.

777
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:32,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Put yours on, too.

778
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:32,414
4, 5, 4, 5, 5.

779
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:52,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper 20-054 offered by Vice President Caraviello and President Falco.

780
01:09:52,706 --> 01:10:00,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the city administration develop a pilot program to resurface a portion of our roads using recycled asphalt.

781
01:10:01,836 --> 01:10:03,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello.

782
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:16,607
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up with this thing now?

783
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:23,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have one that shows all the?

784
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:25,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, leave this on, right?

785
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,090
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so sensitive.

786
01:10:39,642 --> 01:10:40,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

787
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:55,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week at the MMA show, myself and President Falco had the opportunity to meet a company that does what they call Horton Place Mill Asphalt Recycling.

788
01:10:56,245 --> 01:11:07,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they do is they come and they grind and they take our asphalt that normally we would give back to the asphalt company and we would buy it back from them.

789
01:11:07,974 --> 01:11:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: We would keep our own asphalt here.

790
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:16,621
[SPEAKER_02]: They recycle it in place and heat it and it goes right back down on the road as soon as they do it.

791
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:22,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a very good cost saving plan because when we talk to them,

792
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:30,955
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave us a price of somewhere around $25 a yard, which normally we pay $48 a yard.

793
01:11:31,615 --> 01:11:37,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So thinking outside of the box, we could probably do two streets for the price of one street.

794
01:11:38,256 --> 01:11:41,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's something that's worthwhile looking at.

795
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:46,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the opportunity to speak with Steve Tanaya and

796
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:54,295
[SPEAKER_02]: DPW director and they both liked it and they agreed that it's something that we should look into.

797
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:57,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll yield to President Falco.

798
01:11:57,417 --> 01:11:59,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

799
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:00,179
[SPEAKER_13]: President Falco.

800
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

801
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:09,606
[SPEAKER_09]: As Councilor Caraviello noted, we actually talked to the representative, or representative at the MMA conference.

802
01:12:10,287 --> 01:12:13,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's definitely, I think, something that we should pursue.

803
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:21,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why we're recommending a pilot program, thinking that this would be a nice idea to try out on some of our streets.

804
01:12:21,555 --> 01:12:24,117
[SPEAKER_09]: It would definitely save the city some money.

805
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:27,819
[SPEAKER_09]: And it definitely has some benefits as well.

806
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:34,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you take a look at the number of streets that we're repaving each year, we're very limited to what we can do with the funds that we have.

807
01:12:35,062 --> 01:12:42,906
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of an out-of-the-box, kind of thinking out-of-the-box type of solution where we could do something with the recycled asphalt.

808
01:12:45,067 --> 01:12:48,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's definitely some benefits to it.

809
01:12:48,249 --> 01:12:52,091
[SPEAKER_09]: It uses in-place materials that are already there in front of you.

810
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,913
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually do it all right there, recycle it right on site.

811
01:12:55,474 --> 01:12:57,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, it saves money.

812
01:12:57,255 --> 01:13:00,417
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a shorter construction time to actually repave a road.

813
01:13:01,297 --> 01:13:10,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's easier to work around catch basins, manholes, water valves, and other type of things that you'll find in the middle of the street when you're repaving a road.

814
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:15,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also lowers the engineering and traffic control costs as well.

815
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is an idea that we wanted to bring forward.

816
01:13:17,986 --> 01:13:23,008
[SPEAKER_09]: We think it would be beneficial to our community and actually save the community money as well.

817
01:13:23,088 --> 01:13:26,929
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this point I'd like to move for approval.

818
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:27,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

819
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:30,451
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Knighton.

820
01:13:50,363 --> 01:13:54,226
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I know.

821
01:13:55,267 --> 01:14:05,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Can the sponsors of the resolution please explain to me if this is a machine that would come and do this, like, infrared technology right there on the site, if this eliminates the use of manpower and it's a machine that's performing the work?

822
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we have a brochure.

823
01:14:07,717 --> 01:14:08,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get some copies out to you.

824
01:14:09,839 --> 01:14:15,723
[SPEAKER_02]: They mill it, grind it, and heat it, and put it back down immediately as it's done.

825
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:24,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, with Chapter 90 money being thin, I don't think this is something that you'd probably want to use like in High Street or Main Street.

826
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:31,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it'd be a worthwhile project to look at on some of the side streets that really need attention.

827
01:14:34,652 --> 01:14:42,317
[SPEAKER_05]: devices, Mr. President, in various shapes and forms and various places on the internet, which means they must all be awesome, right?

828
01:14:42,337 --> 01:14:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're on the internet and they almost work great.

829
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:45,680
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it makes sense.

830
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a machine that's performing the work.

831
01:14:47,301 --> 01:14:51,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're alleviating our exposure to liability for workers getting injured.

832
01:14:52,304 --> 01:15:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also having the machine perform the work so we know we're going to get the same standard, the same quality, every single time the work gets done.

833
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,831
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something I support wholeheartedly.

834
01:15:01,851 --> 01:15:03,192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that we've discussed in the past.

835
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:13,901
[SPEAKER_05]: with street scan and other types of infrared technologies that we can use to determine what our underground infrastructure looks like, what our streets and roadways look like, what condition they're in without actually having to go and rip them apart.

836
01:15:13,921 --> 01:15:18,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So I support it wholeheartedly and I thank my colleagues for raising the issue.

837
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:24,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally when we do a street, they come and they grind it and maybe sit three, four, five, maybe a week before we get started.

838
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:27,553
[SPEAKER_02]: This gets, as fast as it's ground, it's put right back down.

839
01:15:27,573 --> 01:15:30,995
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming they could probably do a street in a day or maybe more.

840
01:15:35,368 --> 01:15:35,869
[SPEAKER_23]: Also more up.

841
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:37,230
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

842
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:44,059
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to thank Councilors carry on Falco for bringing this forth as I did not have the pleasure to attend the MMA training.

843
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,222
[SPEAKER_23]: I did a little research on this myself.

844
01:15:46,282 --> 01:15:51,709
[SPEAKER_23]: So to your points, it's cough saving it diverts waste and then the fact that you're doing the work.

845
01:15:52,277 --> 01:15:57,462
[SPEAKER_23]: At that actual site, you're removing the fuel costs associated with transporting these very heavy materials.

846
01:15:57,582 --> 01:15:59,084
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm excited to see this.

847
01:15:59,224 --> 01:16:00,305
[SPEAKER_23]: I support this.

848
01:16:00,886 --> 01:16:06,671
[SPEAKER_23]: And I appreciate you guys for raising something that's just one small way to move Medford forward in a more sustainable way.

849
01:16:07,012 --> 01:16:07,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

850
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:11,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

851
01:16:12,248 --> 01:16:12,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

852
01:16:14,148 --> 01:16:18,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Council marks I know that I appreciate my colleagues doing their due diligence.

853
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:23,992
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that this council, especially myself, we've looked at the biggest issue, which is.

854
01:16:26,113 --> 01:16:38,059
[SPEAKER_16]: employees for the DPW and any way we can help lighten their load and, like Councilor Morell said, look at the whole footprint, our footprint and how we can improve.

855
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:54,567
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's important though that we really dedicate a recommendation to the mayor as we move forward to budget season for that, I know I've been saying it year after year, but a sidewalk pothole.

856
01:16:55,522 --> 01:17:00,146
[SPEAKER_16]: making it even a bigger piece, which is repaving and re-sidewalks.

857
01:17:00,186 --> 01:17:04,409
[SPEAKER_16]: I know as you go on to the next resolution, it's in the same breath.

858
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:07,111
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that we need the employees.

859
01:17:07,171 --> 01:17:14,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that when Mayor Burke, before she left office, they've eliminated the civil service test for hiring.

860
01:17:14,837 --> 01:17:18,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's about time that we really put our money where our mouth is and make sure that

861
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:35,552
[SPEAKER_16]: We put the employees in place and the equipment that's needed to implement projects like this and really do something off the cuff here, something we haven't done or haven't seen in a long time.

862
01:17:35,612 --> 01:17:40,256
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm pretty excited about this initiative and I appreciate bringing it forward.

863
01:17:40,316 --> 01:17:40,956
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

864
01:17:41,197 --> 01:17:41,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

865
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:42,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

866
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:45,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

867
01:17:46,803 --> 01:17:47,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Any idea what it costs?

868
01:17:49,043 --> 01:17:56,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's, like I said, their projection was somewhere about $25 a yard or a foot.

869
01:17:56,606 --> 01:17:57,326
[SPEAKER_02]: No, for the machine.

870
01:17:57,827 --> 01:17:58,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry?

871
01:17:58,527 --> 01:17:59,247
[SPEAKER_02]: To buy the machine.

872
01:18:00,207 --> 01:18:01,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a big piece of machine.

873
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:04,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's something we're buying.

874
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:09,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Keran said we're paying $48 right now for the same thing.

875
01:18:11,671 --> 01:18:13,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost half of what we're already paying.

876
01:18:14,513 --> 01:18:15,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, no, no, it's the same thing.

877
01:18:15,514 --> 01:18:23,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and if we buy the machine, we're going to have to save 50% of the costs, plus fuel and manpower on the machine.

878
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's worth figuring out what the machine costs and buying one, as opposed to contracting out work to an outside entity to perform work we could do in-house.

879
01:18:32,563 --> 01:18:34,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it was a pretty big...

880
01:18:35,793 --> 01:18:36,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Few pieces of equipment.

881
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:57,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah that If I may I think there'll be a pretty big capital cost to buy that machine I think the best thing in my own speak for Councilor caviar, but I think we would agree in this I think through the pilot program if we could pick out You know a handful of streets that this probably bring in a rep from one of these companies because I'm sure there's many that do it and actually talk to them and

882
01:18:58,115 --> 01:19:00,499
[SPEAKER_09]: and see, well, what type of streets will this work on?

883
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:07,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And then pick a handful of streets, come up with a pilot program, and just resurface those streets with recycled asphalt.

884
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, get a price.

885
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:10,948
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, get a price beforehand.

886
01:19:10,988 --> 01:19:13,090
[SPEAKER_09]: But see how many streets we could do.

887
01:19:14,231 --> 01:19:18,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to figure out if we could have like a, the mayor has some sort of a budget for this.

888
01:19:18,895 --> 01:19:20,176
[SPEAKER_09]: And then see what we can do.

889
01:19:20,236 --> 01:19:24,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's definitely more efficient, I think, in lower cost than what we're doing now.

890
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:28,584
[SPEAKER_09]: We have very limited funding, chapter 90 funding for street repair.

891
01:19:28,604 --> 01:19:31,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this would hopefully allow us to do more streets.

892
01:19:32,987 --> 01:19:38,209
[SPEAKER_09]: just make our money go further, so I think developing a pilot program around this would be something that would be beneficial.

893
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:47,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, I guess my question is that is the intention to establish a pilot program that would privatize a portion of the work that the DPW is now performing?

894
01:19:49,983 --> 01:19:51,624
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not doing the streets anyways.

895
01:19:51,645 --> 01:19:53,085
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not paving the streets right now.

896
01:19:53,146 --> 01:19:53,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not potholes.

897
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:54,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not potholes.

898
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:55,207
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the whole street.

899
01:19:55,567 --> 01:20:03,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that work would fall under the scope of the DPW just because historically they've contracted out doesn't mean that it's not work that would fall under their purview.

900
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:06,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall the DPW milling and grinding streets, the whole streets.

901
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't recall them having the proper equipment to be able to do it.

902
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:17,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But it still would fall within the scope of their labor certification for work that they could perform as ME02, maintenance equipment operator.

903
01:20:19,906 --> 01:20:23,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, our manpower staff is kind of thin.

904
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:29,881
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why if we have a machine that can pave streets that does the work of four people, we might be a worthwhile investment.

905
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:35,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I could, from the chair, I agree that funding would be an issue.

906
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:38,575
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Chapter 90 money is very limited.

907
01:20:38,655 --> 01:20:41,457
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's about $980,000 a year we receive.

908
01:20:42,298 --> 01:20:44,740
[SPEAKER_13]: However, there is linkage money that's out there.

909
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,362
[SPEAKER_13]: You would know better than I, Mr. President, how much money is left in that account.

910
01:20:48,403 --> 01:20:54,167
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would tend to say, as Councilor Knights mentioned, if we could take that equipment and do it in-house,

911
01:20:55,187 --> 01:21:02,528
[SPEAKER_13]: We go from doing one or two streets to many streets, and I realize the upfront cost, but it may be worth looking at.

912
01:21:02,548 --> 01:21:04,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

913
01:21:04,389 --> 01:21:05,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bierce.

914
01:21:06,169 --> 01:21:11,970
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's a pilot program, and if at the end of the pilot program it's so successful, I think we should explore what Councilor Knight was suggesting.

915
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:21,592
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to make a motion to add a B paper to this, requesting that our state delegation ask the Speaker of the House and the Senate President to increase Chapter 90 in this year's budget.

916
01:21:27,942 --> 01:21:42,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you know, on the original paper 20-054 and the BPAS amended by Councilor Bears to ask the state delegation to increase our Chapter 90 funds.

917
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:44,554
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

918
01:21:45,014 --> 01:21:45,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

919
01:21:47,816 --> 01:21:48,937
[SPEAKER_13]: The clerk just corrected me.

920
01:21:49,627 --> 01:21:50,807
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do the B paper first.

921
01:21:51,068 --> 01:21:55,509
[SPEAKER_21]: And to clarify, asking the Speaker of the House and the Senate President, that's where we are in the budget cycle.

922
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:06,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Amended B paper by Councilor Bears, that we ask the Speaker of the House and the Senate President to increase the City of Medford's Chapter 90 funds.

923
01:22:06,394 --> 01:22:07,194
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

924
01:22:07,414 --> 01:22:07,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

925
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:08,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

926
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:09,935
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.

927
01:22:10,436 --> 01:22:11,316
[SPEAKER_13]: On the original paper, 20-054.

928
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:20,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Offered by Councilor President Falco, Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell.

929
01:22:20,422 --> 01:22:20,982
[SPEAKER_13]: All in favor?

930
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:21,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

931
01:22:21,823 --> 01:22:22,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

932
01:22:22,784 --> 01:22:24,685
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it, the paper is approved.

933
01:22:25,426 --> 01:22:30,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper 20-055 offered by Vice President Caraviello and President Falco.

934
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:40,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the city administration develop a pilot program to repair our trip and hazard sidewalks by saw cut repair instead of grinding.

935
01:22:40,858 --> 01:22:42,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Vice President Caraviello.

936
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:43,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

937
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:49,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, something we came up with visiting the trade show last week.

938
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:55,548
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a company that takes trip and fall hazards.

939
01:22:56,995 --> 01:22:59,457
[SPEAKER_02]: of sidewalks, and they grind them and smooth them.

940
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:08,044
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a machine in our city that does it, but it is not, according to Mr. Chairman, it is not a very big one.

941
01:23:08,885 --> 01:23:18,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But this company would come in, they would identify all the trip hazards, and they could repair them at a cost of about $125 per sidewalk.

942
01:23:20,134 --> 01:23:25,358
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, every year we are approving lawsuits

943
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:33,032
[SPEAKER_02]: At $5,000 a piece, if we save one lawsuit, we can probably do 25 sidewalks.

944
01:23:33,752 --> 01:23:36,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, something that's worth looking into.

945
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:41,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, they'll come in, help us develop a list, and do the work.

946
01:23:42,537 --> 01:23:47,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I spoke with Mr. Cairns and Mr. Tenaglia.

947
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,782
[SPEAKER_02]: They both agree it's a worthwhile program to do.

948
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll yield to President Falco.

949
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:53,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

950
01:23:55,016 --> 01:24:05,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And this here is another solution where it's just a more efficient solution, where it's not going to cost as much money.

951
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:11,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Because with a lot of these trip sidewalks, trip and fall sidewalks, it's just an edge that pops up.

952
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:14,864
[SPEAKER_09]: So what they do is they literally cut the edge, flatten it down.

953
01:24:15,304 --> 01:24:16,705
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have to replace the whole panel.

954
01:24:17,165 --> 01:24:20,547
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't take days, it literally takes probably hours.

955
01:24:22,288 --> 01:24:27,011
[SPEAKER_09]: The sidewalk's not out of service, it's not costing you as much money because you don't have to replace the whole thing.

956
01:24:27,031 --> 01:24:30,594
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to worry about someone destroying the cement when it's trying to dry.

957
01:24:30,614 --> 01:24:32,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's definitely more efficient.

958
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:41,519
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a concept that's used in other communities, Cambridge, Quincy, Newton, Lowell, Salem, Swampsford, Haverhill, Westfield, Peabody.

959
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:43,520
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just some of them.

960
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,601
[SPEAKER_09]: They use this, I guess, at Gillette Stadium as well.

961
01:24:47,222 --> 01:24:52,064
[SPEAKER_09]: And they use it at different colleges, BC, UMass, Lowell.

962
01:24:53,865 --> 01:24:56,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a bunch of colleges that use this as well.

963
01:24:56,507 --> 01:25:01,310
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's definitely more efficient for our community, and it would save the community money as well.

964
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:04,673
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd just like to move the paper forward at this point in time.

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1004
01:29:09,374 --> 01:29:10,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Two quick questions.

1005
01:29:10,856 --> 01:29:13,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Might actually be for the clerk, so I, yeah.

1006
01:29:13,718 --> 01:29:16,000
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't know the protocol there.

1007
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:25,356
[SPEAKER_21]: I notice a couple of the polling locations don't have addresses, specifically Ward 7, Precinct 1, north building entrance, but there's not a street address.

1008
01:29:25,396 --> 01:29:27,637
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that just common practice, or?

1009
01:29:27,657 --> 01:29:34,863
[SPEAKER_15]: I can actually go in and add the street address.

1010
01:29:35,243 --> 01:29:41,928
[SPEAKER_15]: It has not customarily been on the call to election for that precinct, but I'm happy to add it in.

1011
01:29:41,968 --> 01:29:44,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it posted online with it, or is it everywhere else that has the address?

1012
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:45,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it is online.

1013
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:45,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1014
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:51,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Will there be early voting and does that have to be part of this resolution?

1015
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:58,779
[SPEAKER_15]: There will be early voting from February 24th to February 28th here in the council chambers during regular city hall business hours.

1016
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:00,780
[SPEAKER_21]: And that doesn't have to be included within the resolution?

1017
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,182
[SPEAKER_15]: That does not have to be included within this.

1018
01:30:03,042 --> 01:30:05,444
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a designation of polling places for election day only.

1019
01:30:06,385 --> 01:30:09,288
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can add something, if the council will indulge me.

1020
01:30:11,089 --> 01:30:19,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Lori Howley from Lawrence Memorial Hospital contacted me when she contacted many of you about construction updates for the hospital.

1021
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:27,712
[SPEAKER_15]: The main building at the hospital will be undergoing construction during election day.

1022
01:30:28,113 --> 01:30:33,015
[SPEAKER_15]: But we are still able to use the main hospital building as a polling place.

1023
01:30:33,836 --> 01:30:40,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Rather than voting in the main lobby, there'll be a new fully accessible temporary entrance just to the left of that lobby entrance.

1024
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,942
[SPEAKER_15]: And voting will take place downstairs in the hospital cafeteria.

1025
01:30:46,343 --> 01:30:48,424
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to request a reverse 911 call.

1026
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:57,450
[SPEAKER_15]: For 3-1 through Captain Clemente just to alert residents that that's happening, but there's no change in building.

1027
01:30:57,490 --> 01:31:00,833
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no change in address It's just a different floor on the same building.

1028
01:31:00,853 --> 01:31:14,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I've already been in touch with the Secretary of State's office There is no need for us to to designate a new polling place or anything like that but it's just it's just a matter of I want I want residents who normally vote there to To know that there's going to be a slight change.

1029
01:31:14,543 --> 01:31:17,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, will you Mr. Clerk post additional signage?

1030
01:31:18,065 --> 01:31:20,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, absolutely.

1031
01:31:20,487 --> 01:31:25,791
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also just want to say that I will be early voting in the chambers, which the clerk would like to hear.

1032
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:31,955
[SPEAKER_15]: I urge everyone who's within listening distance to vote early in the chambers.

1033
01:31:34,737 --> 01:31:35,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

1034
01:31:36,219 --> 01:31:37,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1035
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:37,480

1047
01:32:06,309 --> 01:32:13,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1048
01:32:13,092 --> 01:32:13,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1049
01:32:14,393 --> 01:32:16,394
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rules.

1051
01:32:20,195 --> 01:32:20,936
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1052
01:32:21,396 --> 01:32:22,136

01:32:23,857 --> 01:32:25,197
[SPEAKER_09]: These are papers under suspension.

1054
01:32:25,217 --> 01:32:34,161
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-0-060 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of John Byers on his recent passing.

1055
01:32:34,701 --> 01:32:35,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1056
01:32:35,788 --> 01:32:42,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, many of us that have been involved in local government and local politics over the years have come to know and love John Byers.

1057
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:51,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of us who spent a lot of time in Barry Park in the South Medford area of the city would always see Johnny riding his bike down at the basketball courts.

1058
01:32:52,477 --> 01:32:56,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of us that listen to sports radio on WEI would quite often hear Johnny call in.

1059
01:32:57,281 --> 01:33:09,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of us that would watch cable access television back in the early and late 90s would see Johnny on his TV shows and as a special guest on a variety of other local celebrities' TV shows.

1060
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:14,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And just this past week, Johnny lost his battle with cancer.

1061
01:33:15,054 --> 01:33:18,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, Johnny was someone that was a student of government.

1062
01:33:18,257 --> 01:33:18,977
[SPEAKER_05]: He loved government.

1063
01:33:19,377 --> 01:33:22,079
[SPEAKER_05]: He ran for mayor several times, school committee, I believe, as well.

1064
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:25,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe he ever ran for city council, but I may be mistaken.

1065
01:33:25,482 --> 01:33:29,925
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do recall that he'd run for a number of shots at public office.

1066
01:33:30,685 --> 01:33:34,108
[SPEAKER_05]: His father, Phil, is a great guy, a brother of mine from the Elks Club.

1067
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:40,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And his son, or his brother, Phillip, and his father are both very close friends of mine, lifelong Metro residents, Mr. President.

1068
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny was residing in Walkling Court at the time of his passing.

1069
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:52,438
[SPEAKER_05]: He was surrounded by friends and family when he went, and I just hope that we can all take the time to extend our deep and sincere condolences to the family on their loss.

1070
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:54,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny was a special person in this community.

1071
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,321
[SPEAKER_05]: He was someone that we all knew and loved, and he's going to be sadly missed.

1072
01:33:58,921 --> 01:33:59,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1073
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:00,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

1074
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:02,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1075
01:34:03,554 --> 01:34:06,537
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head.

1076
01:34:06,997 --> 01:34:09,619
[SPEAKER_13]: John was a staple in this community for many years.

1077
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:17,926
[SPEAKER_13]: He was one of the founders with local community access, ran a show for a number of years, and the one thing I remember about John

1078
01:34:18,866 --> 01:34:20,306
[SPEAKER_13]: He never held any words back.

1079
01:34:20,887 --> 01:34:24,487
[SPEAKER_13]: He'd tell you exactly where you stood with him, whether you liked it or not.

1080
01:34:25,707 --> 01:34:27,988
[SPEAKER_13]: And he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1081
01:34:28,588 --> 01:34:35,309
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to dedicate this meeting, if it's all right with my council colleague, after John Baez.

1082
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:40,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to make that part of the motion?

1083
01:34:45,832 --> 01:34:47,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I make that part of the motion?

1084
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:49,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

1085
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Dedicate this meeting after.

1086
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:51,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Dedicate this meeting?

1087
01:34:52,206 --> 01:34:52,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1088
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:52,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1089
01:34:53,409 --> 01:34:53,930
[SPEAKER_13]: John Baez.

1090
01:34:55,735 --> 01:34:57,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you want to just mention a corner, Brad?

1091
01:34:57,876 --> 01:34:58,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1092
01:34:58,956 --> 01:35:03,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure we're including everything we want to include.

1093
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:17,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone that spent so much time in the neighborhood that he grew up in, someone that spent so much time outdoors riding his bike in the parks and stuff like that, someone that was a fixture in the neighborhood is someone that probably would warrant consideration for a corner dedication, Mr. President.

1094
01:35:17,222 --> 01:35:24,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe that John grew up in the College Ave area, but I'll have to get the specifics to that before I bring forward a motion that would request such.

1095
01:35:24,979 --> 01:35:29,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, and Councilor Knight, thank you for bringing this forward, and thank you, Councilor Marks, as well.

1096
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:33,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I had met Johnny a few times when I was growing up.

1097
01:35:33,984 --> 01:35:42,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember playing park league, playing basketball, and you'd go to the different parks, and he would always be at the park, and you'd see him on his bike, and he was a really, really nice person.

1098
01:35:43,149 --> 01:35:45,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And my thoughts and prayers go to his family.

1099
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:48,973
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1100
01:36:10,018 --> 01:36:15,162
[SPEAKER_09]: While under suspension, 20-061 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1101
01:36:15,623 --> 01:36:19,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the City Council discuss concerns with South and Main Street.

1102
01:36:31,556 --> 01:36:32,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1103
01:36:32,697 --> 01:36:33,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1104
01:36:35,739 --> 01:36:39,560
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could, this is really just to update South and Main Street.

1105
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:48,302
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that we've had some serious issues there in the past week, but had a discussion with State Representative Donato.

1106
01:36:48,562 --> 01:36:53,023
[SPEAKER_16]: He has informed me that with the hard work of his

1107
01:36:56,449 --> 01:37:01,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Representative Donato and Representative Garbaly and Representative Barber.

1108
01:37:01,754 --> 01:37:15,786
[SPEAKER_16]: They are presenting a bond bill on Wednesday tomorrow for $5 million to help alleviate the issues on South and Main Street.

1109
01:37:16,287 --> 01:37:18,509
[SPEAKER_16]: I've contacted the Chief of Police and Traffic.

1110
01:37:19,355 --> 01:37:28,169
[SPEAKER_16]: and also meeting with the mayor tomorrow to try to expedite some of the, again, low-hanging fruit that we've asked for.

1111
01:37:30,772 --> 01:37:54,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I think we dodged another bullet on Friday, but the stop sign on Toro and South, the raised sidewalks that we discussed on Main and South, and painting the walkways, I mean, painting the street with limiting the lanes, I think these are short budgetary measures.

1112
01:37:55,346 --> 01:37:58,389
[SPEAKER_16]: fixes, and I think that would make a huge difference in that area.

1113
01:37:58,829 --> 01:38:02,652
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the residents that I've talked to are frustrated.

1114
01:38:03,573 --> 01:38:15,002
[SPEAKER_16]: We are all frustrated, but we hope to have some movement and hopefully have some word, some definitive answers for everybody by next meeting on next Tuesday.

1115
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:16,283
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you.

1116
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:17,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1117
01:38:17,884 --> 01:38:18,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

1118
01:38:19,345 --> 01:38:22,146
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1119
01:38:22,466 --> 01:38:25,266
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope that bond bill passes and we can get the money soon.

1120
01:38:27,127 --> 01:38:46,732
[SPEAKER_21]: I talked to a few residents, and I think what happened on Friday, there was a pedestrian accident on Friday, and we are very lucky, as someone who's lost a friend in a situation like that, the different way that the car impacts the person can deeply affect how that turns out, and I think we really lucked out.

1121
01:38:48,003 --> 01:38:57,468
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that the pipeline project is going to South Street, so maybe the painting and all that might be a little, raised crosswalks, sidewalks might be a little more difficult, but a stop sign at Truro and South.

1122
01:38:58,097 --> 01:39:00,018
[SPEAKER_21]: that can go in even if they're gonna tear up the road.

1123
01:39:00,199 --> 01:39:01,780
[SPEAKER_21]: That's exactly where the incident happened.

1124
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:09,886
[SPEAKER_21]: A resident at 76 South talked to me in October when I was running and I spoke to her about, she specifically requested that.

1125
01:39:09,966 --> 01:39:11,007
[SPEAKER_21]: We brought it up recently.

1126
01:39:11,427 --> 01:39:17,272
[SPEAKER_21]: I really think that stop sign, expedite the expediting on that if we can.

1127
01:39:18,793 --> 01:39:21,615
[SPEAKER_21]: We really don't want another incident to go poorly there.

1128
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:23,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Peters.

1129
01:39:23,616 --> 01:39:24,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

1130
01:39:25,322 --> 01:39:44,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank You mr. President also, and I want to thank councillor Scarpelli for his work on this in this follow-through If we could just track whether or not our resolutions from several months back This council put together a laundry list of resolutions that were supposed to be sent to the Traffic Commission Can we just have maybe the city clerk follow up?

1131
01:39:45,006 --> 01:39:48,127
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm being told that some of them may have not made it that far and

1132
01:39:49,168 --> 01:40:08,060
[SPEAKER_09]: To the traffic commission So I'd like to just follow up on it regarding signage and so forth that we requested Thank You Councilor Marks, I believe that when we talked about this not too long ago Was he within the last couple of weeks so letter went to the police chief am I correct?

1133
01:40:08,601 --> 01:40:17,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so right a Letter may have gone to the chief, but I'm not sure I'm not sure that they acted upon any of our requests

1134
01:40:18,276 --> 01:40:20,358
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make sure and reiterate that.

1135
01:40:20,899 --> 01:40:26,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad to hear about the bond bill, but honestly I've been hearing a lot of things about the bond bill.

1136
01:40:27,546 --> 01:40:31,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there's money there in the bond bill, but somehow it just doesn't go anywhere.

1137
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:35,033
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm pleased to see that they are looking into it.

1138
01:40:36,184 --> 01:40:43,373
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm going to be cautiously optimistic, because I've been there, done that with the bond bills.

1139
01:40:43,674 --> 01:40:50,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And the $5 million bond bill, I believe the $5 million bond bill is basically for the lights in the square, if I'm correct.

1140
01:40:52,007 --> 01:40:55,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the smart lighting system that will carry the traffic to the square.

1141
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:58,252
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as South Street goes, you are correct.

1142
01:40:58,292 --> 01:41:14,404
[SPEAKER_09]: That laundry list of solutions or potential solutions that we came up with with the residents that night, you know, we need an update on that because that's really, I think those things are the things that are hopefully going to have an impact on that situation down there.

1143
01:41:14,904 --> 01:41:17,426
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a number of points of information.

1144
01:41:17,466 --> 01:41:19,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Berrios has the first point of information.

1145
01:41:20,853 --> 01:41:21,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1146
01:41:24,655 --> 01:41:28,137
[SPEAKER_21]: In terms of what's exactly in the bond bill, I'm not going to speak to the specifics of that.

1147
01:41:28,197 --> 01:41:35,041
[SPEAKER_21]: But just in terms of the process, you are correct that this bill has not, I believe it might be part of a larger transportation bond bill package.

1148
01:41:35,341 --> 01:41:36,082
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure.

1149
01:41:36,302 --> 01:41:38,263
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an $18 billion package.

1150
01:41:39,263 --> 01:41:42,525
[SPEAKER_21]: It hasn't been passed by the House, nor the Senate, nor signed by the governor at this point.

1151
01:41:42,545 --> 01:41:45,687
[SPEAKER_21]: And then even after that, Governor Baker has to release those funds to us.

1152
01:41:48,248 --> 01:41:52,309
[SPEAKER_21]: We are several steps away in the process, but the House potentially voting on that tomorrow would be good.

1153
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:54,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Peters.

1154
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:54,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1155
01:41:55,951 --> 01:42:08,835
[SPEAKER_05]: May I be so bold to suggest, Mr. President, that we ask the City Clerk to research the paper that we had forwarded previously to Mayor Burke's administration relative to South Street and forward that to the current administration so that they have it fresh and on their desk.

1156
01:42:10,136 --> 01:42:11,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would offer that in the form of a motion.

1157
01:42:14,046 --> 01:42:14,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have that?

1158
01:42:15,007 --> 01:42:15,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

1159
01:42:15,307 --> 01:42:15,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1160
01:42:15,587 --> 01:42:15,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1161
01:42:15,828 --> 01:42:19,191
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of console of nights, seconded by constant coffee.

1162
01:42:19,211 --> 01:42:19,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

1163
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:20,752
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

1164
01:42:20,892 --> 01:42:21,473
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

1165
01:42:21,513 --> 01:42:22,374
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

1166
01:42:24,896 --> 01:42:25,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.

1167
01:42:26,417 --> 01:42:28,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone is more than welcome to talk and ask questions.

1168
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:29,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So one minute please.

1169
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:30,381
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the strangest.

1170
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:33,704
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time console night, did you have any further comments on that?

1171
01:42:34,485 --> 01:42:34,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1172
01:42:39,923 --> 01:42:42,245
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked about this topic ad nauseum, Mr. President.

1173
01:42:42,265 --> 01:42:45,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been going on now for probably the better part of four years.

1174
01:42:45,688 --> 01:42:51,672
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I will say is that nobody knows this issue and this concern better than Councilor Lungo, who is now Mayor Lungo.

1175
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:52,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Her parents live on the road.

1176
01:42:52,953 --> 01:42:53,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Her parents live on the street.

1177
01:42:54,735 --> 01:43:00,019
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us to think that we're going to talk the talk and it's going to fall on deaf ears, I don't think is the case, Mr. President.

1178
01:43:00,059 --> 01:43:06,444
[SPEAKER_05]: She's had a vested interest in performing solutions at this intersection for as long as I can remember, as soon as the issue came up.

1179
01:43:07,065 --> 01:43:10,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo was all over it, now Mayor Lungo I'm sure will be on top of it as well.

1180
01:43:11,449 --> 01:43:15,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I don't think there's any reason for us to anticipate or expect or not to act.

1181
01:43:15,914 --> 01:43:21,440
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think that when we're looking at the scope of projects that are going on down there, we have the police station, we have the Eversource project.

1182
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:33,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one solution we may have, Mr. President, is to designate that a live construction zone, which may allow us an opportunity to meet with our friends at Area 4 for Massachusetts Highway Department and put some controls in at the bottom of the ramp.

1183
01:43:34,153 --> 01:43:38,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe no left turn if you're getting off the highway, because there's no need to get onto Mystic Ave.

1184
01:43:39,878 --> 01:43:41,319
[SPEAKER_05]: from the off-ramp.

1185
01:43:41,999 --> 01:43:51,003
[SPEAKER_05]: You should only be able to take a left-hand turn if you're coming off the off-ramp right there at South Street, because if you just stay on the road and get off behind the DPW, you can be on Mystic Ave as well.

1186
01:43:51,043 --> 01:43:53,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some controls that we can put in place, Mr. President.

1187
01:43:53,584 --> 01:44:02,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I think because of the scope of construction that's going on at the police station and the scope of construction with the South Street project, we may have a little bit of leverage here to speak with some of our friends.

1188
01:44:03,189 --> 01:44:17,267
[SPEAKER_05]: over at Area 4 and use their engineering expertise to come up with some short-term solutions during this very dangerous construction period, which is going to take place for a couple of years now, Mr. President, to provide some short-term relief and short-term solutions until we can address it more holistically.

1189
01:44:18,513 --> 01:44:19,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1190
01:44:19,353 --> 01:44:27,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I may clarify, I mean, from what I heard, that $5 million would be for the lights that would be kind of at the bottom of South Street in the square.

1191
01:44:27,235 --> 01:44:31,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think even out here at City Hall, because they're smart lights and they all talk to each other.

1192
01:44:31,496 --> 01:44:35,637
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, I think, what the $5 million would go mostly towards.

1193
01:44:37,177 --> 01:44:38,917
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a number of residents that would like to speak.

1194
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:41,858
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could please have your name and address for the record.

1195
01:44:42,598 --> 01:44:45,439
[SPEAKER_00]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1196
01:44:47,437 --> 01:45:03,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to get up to give Councilor Bears the opportunity to be reminded that we should try to avoid the use of the word accident when there's an incident with a car.

1197
01:45:03,604 --> 01:45:04,504
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't an accident.

1198
01:45:05,304 --> 01:45:09,106
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the inevitable result of a country that is built around the automobile.

1199
01:45:09,286 --> 01:45:15,288
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that every adult must drive, and in particular, it's the inevitable result of a failure to make that particular intersection safe.

1200
01:45:15,688 --> 01:45:16,529
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an accident.

1201
01:45:19,677 --> 01:45:22,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1202
01:45:22,299 --> 01:45:23,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record.

1203
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:27,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1204
01:45:28,344 --> 01:45:32,827
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up on the agenda.

1205
01:45:33,447 --> 01:45:41,854
[SPEAKER_22]: The Selton Main Street intersection has been a problem when I got my license and most people in this room, if not all, were not even born.

1206
01:45:47,018 --> 01:45:50,801
[SPEAKER_22]: I hear the $5 million bond is possible.

1207
01:45:50,821 --> 01:46:00,489
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure, even if it does go through, if that will help, even if you spend $50 million.

1208
01:46:02,811 --> 01:46:15,382
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, I hate to reiterate and repeat myself, the risk of being cruder, but I would suggest trying in right turn only at this juncture from South onto Main, right street only.

1209
01:46:18,054 --> 01:46:22,659
[SPEAKER_22]: Or else, as someone else suggested in the past, let me back up.

1210
01:46:23,019 --> 01:46:29,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, Councilor Knight mentioned, I believe something to the effect of shutting down that exit on Route 16 heading east.

1211
01:46:30,566 --> 01:46:34,790
[SPEAKER_22]: If the state will do that, that would be a big help.

1212
01:46:37,373 --> 01:46:39,475
[SPEAKER_22]: And another, sorry?

1213
01:46:42,106 --> 01:46:44,449
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't necessarily my suggestion, Mr. President.

1214
01:46:44,469 --> 01:47:00,388
[SPEAKER_05]: My suggestion would be to, if you're coming off the ramp, to make it left turn only so you can't take a right onto Mystic Ave coming off the highway ramp because you can stay on the highway and get off at the road with no name that we were trying to take over there over by the dance studio behind the DPW yard to still put you back out on Mystic Avenue.

1215
01:47:01,089 --> 01:47:09,554
[SPEAKER_05]: But to shut that exit down for people that were coming off would actually close down the only access that they had to Medford Square, which is our central business district, and I don't think that that's something that we want to do.

1216
01:47:10,074 --> 01:47:14,957
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to divert all the traffic off Route 16 and not let them come to our central business district if they're coming that way.

1217
01:47:15,337 --> 01:47:27,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's going to take engineers and engineering, Mr. President, but for a short-term solution in the meantime to implement public safety controls, I think that's something that we could consider because it's an active construction site with the police station and the Eversource project.

1218
01:47:29,203 --> 01:47:31,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilman Knight, for clarifying my brain on that.

1219
01:47:32,904 --> 01:47:44,329
[SPEAKER_22]: However, if it was shut down, they still could take the exit at Winthrop Street, near where your condominium's located, towards that rotary.

1220
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:55,773
[SPEAKER_22]: Another person or persons has suggested another idea, and that would be to make South Street a one-way,

1221
01:47:56,845 --> 01:47:59,125
[SPEAKER_22]: which it is, but in the opposite direction.

1222
01:48:00,266 --> 01:48:06,827
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand some of the residents don't like that, but again, this has been going on for over 50 years.

1223
01:48:07,787 --> 01:48:14,089
[SPEAKER_22]: I and we all know people that have personally been injured and there have been deaths there.

1224
01:48:16,249 --> 01:48:19,330
[SPEAKER_22]: I would start with right to rent only and good luck with the bond.

1225

1232
01:48:58,022 --> 01:49:05,265
[SPEAKER_13]: was nominated for their work in the 2019 Method Mayoral Debate live from Chevalier.

1233
01:49:06,286 --> 01:49:12,949
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was an event coverage category at this year's Mass Creator Awards.

1234
01:49:13,989 --> 01:49:19,731
[SPEAKER_13]: And the event category is for any citywide event covered for television, either live or taped.

1235
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:23,632
[SPEAKER_13]: And unfortunately, we did not win.

1236
01:49:23,712 --> 01:49:34,095
[SPEAKER_13]: But the fact that we were mentioned, Mr. President, in a community access station that has one full-time employee.

1237
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:37,113
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Patrick Gordon, he's the station manager.

1238
01:49:38,014 --> 01:49:42,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Other surrounding communities have three, four, upwards of nine.

1239
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:49,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe Somerville Community Television has about nine full-time employees, Mr. President.

1240
01:49:50,386 --> 01:49:52,547
[SPEAKER_13]: And Patrick runs the station.

1241
01:49:52,887 --> 01:49:56,868
[SPEAKER_13]: He's done an admirable job with very little resources there.

1242
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:01,869
[SPEAKER_13]: And trying to attract Method residents to get involved.

1243
01:50:02,269 --> 01:50:03,269
[SPEAKER_13]: It's community access.

1244
01:50:03,849 --> 01:50:08,851
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would personally like to thank him for his efforts and thank

1245
01:50:10,491 --> 01:50:20,077
[SPEAKER_13]: the station volunteers for their efforts on being nominated for the category of live event and being nominated.

1246
01:50:20,097 --> 01:50:23,059
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe next time we'll win, Mr. President.

1247
01:50:23,559 --> 01:50:24,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Patrick Gordon.

1248
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,341

01:50:28,928 --> 01:50:30,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

1252
01:50:31,129 --> 01:50:36,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick brought it to our attention last week after the meeting.

1253
01:50:36,552 --> 01:50:37,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you brought it up.

1254
01:50:38,774 --> 01:50:40,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Councilor Marks said, he's one guy.

1255
01:50:40,335 --> 01:50:42,656
[SPEAKER_02]: He does work over here.

1256
01:50:42,696 --> 01:50:43,737
[SPEAKER_02]: He's at the station.

1257
01:50:44,577 --> 01:50:48,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad he's gotten some recognition for the work that he's done.

1258
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we'll look for more things in the future from him.

[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, happy birthday to Mrs. Night.

1264

[SPEAKER_21]: It's free.

1292
01:52:14,624 --> 01:52:16,064
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's not free in a lot of communities.

1293
01:52:16,185 --> 01:52:17,805
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's an important thing to note.

1294
