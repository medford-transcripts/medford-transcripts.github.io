    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=269.454s">Yes,</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehn, 19 Richard Street, Mayor of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=273.357s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=274.337s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=276.198s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=276.498s">To</a>  the two new Councilors, you look very nice in those seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=281.441s">We're</a>  here before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=282.502s">I</a>  have Saram McGivern from the Board of Health, as well as the COO of the Greater Boston Food Bank here with us tonight, just to give you some statistics on hunger <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=297.283s">in</a>  Medford and obviously the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=300.265s">This</a>  is a pledge that was brought to my attention several weeks back, and it's something that I believe strongly in, and I'm sure you all do, to try to reach the goal on or before, before would be great, 2028 to declare Medford hunger-free. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=316.777s">Right</a>  now, one in 10 people are hungry, one in eight children. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=321.283s">There</a>  are children in our schools, families that we see at the baseball fields, seniors that can't get out of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=329.085s">So</a>  I thank you for taking this pledge with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=332.446s">The</a>  Medford School Committee voted last night unanimously to also take this pledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=337.967s">We</a>  have a number of different things we want to bring awareness to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=343.549s">One</a>  is the new food pantry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=345.71s">The</a>  grand opening that I hope you all can make is in a couple of weeks, the Walnut Street <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=351.536s">Center</a>  on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=353.757s">It</a>  has a beautiful pantry set up, so that is going to help tremendously in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=358.978s">We</a>  also have micro pantries that have been installed up and around different churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=366.061s">We</a>  have one being built by our Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=369.162s">I</a>  think they built it in one day that is going to go up in front of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=373.503s">City</a>  Hall is going to sponsor it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=375.243s">The</a>  mayor's office is going to take charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=377.684s">We're</a>  going to have everybody sign <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=380.329s">the</a>  proclamation and laminate it and put it on the side of the food pantry, so I'd love you all to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=388.37s">It's</a>  to spread awareness and to reduce the stigma for those that need help, who are insecure when it comes to food, and this is just a great step in moving Medford forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=400.553s">So</a>  I would like to bring up the professionals on the topic, and they've worked very hard on this as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=408.595s">a</a>  whole host of things in Medford and we greatly appreciate the steps we've been able to take.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=413.73s">Could</a>  you please have your name and address for the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=415.918s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=418.039s">I</a>  hope you don't mind I read from notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=419.34s">I</a>  made such a mess of it last night that I'll just read through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=423.863s">Good</a>  evening, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=425.203s">My</a>  name is Carol Tinken. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=426.504s">I</a>  am a Medford resident living at 261 Governors Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=430.987s">I'm</a>  also the Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President of Distribution Services at the Greater Boston Food Bank, the largest food bank in New England and the 12th largest food bank in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=441.913s">I</a>  am here before you this evening to commend you on this proclamation, and thank you for your leadership in this important step to ensure all Medford residents have access to healthy food. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=451.863s">By</a>  setting this high standard, Medford will show other cities and towns in the Commonwealth that there is not only a commitment to end hunger, but an action to end hunger. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=461.252s">In</a>  the past two and a half years, in partnership with the City, the Malden YMCA, Project Bread, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=467.198s">Francis,</a>  St. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=468.298s">Ray's,</a>  and the Unitarian Universalist Pantries, and the Medford Schools, we've been able to move Med from the third largest meal gap in eastern Massachusetts <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=479.488s">to</a>  the seventh place, the third being we were only putting enough food in Medford for one meal a day for the people who need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=486.334s">And</a>  just to give you an idea of how much that is, roughly 900 to a million meals are needed in Medford annually to feed those who are not able to access food. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=497.384s">So</a>  right now we are about 200,000 meals short of that goal, a little bit more than 200,000, so we've made enormous progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=505.091s">In</a>  the last year, we, as the mayor rightly said, we're looking at that 2028 goal, but we're expecting to beat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=514.28s">And</a>  certainly the new pantry will help support all the other pantries, but that has yet to be seen when it's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=523.349s">The</a>  hunger-free, that is, access to hungry food is within our reach. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=527.512s">Once</a>  we reach it, we need to sustain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=529.974s">That</a>  will be the key to making this pledge what is really have feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=535.358s">And</a>  again, we will use this as leadership, a leadership opportunity for us to show other cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts and in the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=544.693s">that</a>  this can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=545.834s">The</a>  Food Security Task Force will continue to be at the center of this work and I'm here to assure you that the Greater Boston Food Bank will stand with this community in lockstep and certainly as I'm a resident I have a lot to hang my hat on to make sure that that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=562.219s">I'm</a>  going to yield to my colleague from Project Bread who will provide you with some more data.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=572.181s">Hello</a>  my name is Sarah and I'm a resident here in Medford I live at 16 6th Street and I'm the vice president of programs and policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=581.786s">work</a>  at Project Bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=583.447s">So</a>  you are very fortunate you have two powerhouses right here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=588.931s">Project</a>  Bread has worked really closely over the last several years with Medford Public Schools and this year we helped to launch free breakfast in all of the school buildings across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=603.54s">And</a>  we also work with the YMCA and with parks and playgrounds to provide summer meals to kids in need who rely on school lunch and school breakfast during the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=619.431s">Because</a>  we know that there are a growing number of kids who are struggling with food insecurity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=627.016s">And</a>  as I'm sure you're aware, there's even a growing number of kids who are struggling with homelessness here in this <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=632.657s">City,</a>  and so we want to ensure that kids always have reliable, healthy meals every single day so that they can grow and thrive and take advantage of all that Medford has to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=648.483s">So</a>  I thank you for your consideration around this pledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=652.265s">Thank</a>  you for working together with us, Project Bread, and with the Greater Boston Food Bank, and with the Food Security Task Force here.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=661.008s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=666.451s">Hi,</a>  I'm Sarah McGivern, 63 Watervale Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=668.916s">I'm</a>  the Mass in Motion Coordinator in the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=672.343s">I'm</a>  the coordinator of the Food Security Task Force. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=675.473s">which</a>  convened about two years ago to work on issues related to hunger in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=681.496s">We</a>  recognized that there were a lot of people that were trying to work on getting people food secure, but they weren't all working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=687.939s">So</a>  in fall of 2017, we started meeting and trying to get some common goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=693.202s">The</a>  first thing we did was we did a food assessment for the city and we published this food plan, which I brought the summary copies for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=717.292s">So</a>  this food plan, we spent a lot of time writing and researching and looking at best practices from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=725.159s">And</a>  there are a lot of recommendations in there for what our city can do to become more food secure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=732.512s">So</a>  that was published two years after we started meeting, and now we're at a point where we're really proud because the school committee and the city councilor and the mayor and our leaders in our community are all coming together and saying, you're all coming together and saying you're making this a priority, that we need to make sure that nobody in our city goes hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=750.486s">So</a>  we really thank you for this attention, your attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=755.21s">And</a>  also we are one of the first communities, we think probably the first community in the Commonwealth to be doing this, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=767.253s">Hello,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=768.033s">My</a>  name is Marian O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=769.334s">I'm</a>  the Director of Board of Health for the City of Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=772.275s">And</a>  I want to thank you on behalf of putting forth this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=776.417s">It</a>  is truly a public health victory for the City of Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=780.178s">To</a>  think there is one child, one adult, one senior citizen that doesn't know where their next meal is coming from in this country, in this state, is a tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=792.065s">to</a>  know to the extent that it's happening here in Medford is really a call to action. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=797.347s">And</a>  your resolution tonight is really a call to action for all the residents of Medford to get behind this effort to eradicate hunger and security in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=810.131s">I</a>  want to applaud the Food Security Task Force led by Sara. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=815.488s">and</a>  the work that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=816.589s">The</a>  food plan is really a blueprint for how we can achieve these goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=821.192s">I</a>  also sincerely want to thank the Greater Boston Food Bank and the Malden YMCA for their efforts in helping us really move the needle tremendously in this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=832.68s">So</a>  again, thank you deeply from the bottom of my heart for this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=836.202s">It's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=837.003s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=841.884s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=843.166s">I</a>  want to applaud everybody for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=846.09s">I</a>  don't think people actually know <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=850.399s">that</a>  Medford has a food shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=853.081s">I</a>  think everybody thinks we're a nice, wealthy community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=855.824s">We're</a>  not wealthy, but life is good here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=858.746s">But</a>  there are many, many families that struggle with food that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=863.57s">And</a>  I've been happy to do my part with St. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=866.092s">Francis</a>  Food Bank and St. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=868.975s">Ray's</a>  and the Unitarian Church over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=870.876s">And</a>  you actually get to see the amount of people that do need food on a weekly basis, and I applaud. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=878.817s">the</a>  task force for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=881.059s">And</a>  I would like, hopefully we can move up this date to a closer date rather than that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=888.687s">Can</a>  you give us the date for Walnut Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=891.069s">I</a>  don't think you gave that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=893.291s">For</a>  the Walnut Street Food Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=896.314s">February</a>  14th, Valentine's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=898.817s">And</a>  can we urge people to bring donations that day?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=903.201s">Excuse</a>  me, if you could come forward, just because there's people watching at home on TV, and so everyone gets the correct information.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=911.227s">I</a>  think it's gonna be pretty crowded that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=913.829s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=914.049s">But</a>  if people do, I'm sure that they won't go wasted at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=917.532s">But</a>  I know that the RSVP list right now is quite high.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=920.934s">And</a>  I applaud you for your work at the food bank, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=922.856s">I've</a>  been there many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=924.377s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=925.017s">It's</a>  a great building, great facility.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=926.478s">We</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=927.339s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=927.94s">And</a>  I am very proud to be a Medford resident and seeing this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=931.702s">This</a>  is great.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=932.603s">I</a>  was actually there for the opening, when you opened it up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=935.064s">Where</a>  did you, really?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=935.905s">Yeah,</a>  a long time ago, when you first opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=937.486s">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=938.627s">I</a>  commend you for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=939.627s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=940.187s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=942.469s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=948.512s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=953.655s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Marks first.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=957.672s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=959.113s">I</a>  want to thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn for presenting this joint resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=965.336s">I</a>  also would like to thank the Greater Boston Food Bank, as well as Project Bread and our very own Method Food Security Task Force for doing yeoman's work on this subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=977.423s">The</a>  question I have, and maybe this is for our own task force, is that the 2019 food plan goals <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=985.967s">Is</a>  that how we're going to arrive at making method hunger free over the next several years? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=993.912s">And</a>  if so, if you could describe, I know there's some broad strokes listed, removal of systematic barriers to food security, improved access to food assistance programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1005.499s">How</a>  will this be done in order for us to move forward?</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1009.502s">Well,</a>  this sheet that you have in front of you is a summary of the greater <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1013.381s">version</a>  of the food plan, which is on the city website, and it's really long and much more detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1018.385s">But</a>  I think the answer is that the Food Security Task Force is part of my part-time position in the Board of Health, and I'm the only person who's paid to be running it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1030.075s">It</a>  really depends on the partners and the capacity that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1034.799s">For</a>  example, this new food pantry that's opening on the 14th is a collaboration between the Malden Y and the Greater Boston Food Bank, and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1041.578s">them</a>  who have decided to put their resources together to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1045.219s">I</a>  mean, the city is not paying for it or doesn't have a lot of control over how that happened, besides just saying that there's a need and then our partners that work in our city responded to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1060.56s">There</a>  are lots of ideas, but there's not really a concrete plan of exactly what's going to happen when. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1067.382s">If</a>  you have an idea of how we could do something more detailed, let's set up a time to talk.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1076.632s">Okay,</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1078.533s">I</a>  think part of the concern that I see is the fact that disseminating information out to the public, and how do we get into the circles where we may have a larger need? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1094.759s">And</a>  I'm not sure quite how to do that, to be honest with you, and maybe we can do some brainstorming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1101.422s">In</a>  my other life, I work with homeless families. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1105.043s">And</a>  I can tell you right now that probably a majority, if not all, of our families that we service through the Department of Housing and Community Development do have food insecurities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1116.771s">And</a>  the Greater Boston Food Bank has done tremendous work in assisting 3,600 families currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1126.078s">that</a>  the state houses to get them off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1129.64s">And</a>  in my opinion, when you end food insecurity, you also need to end homelessness. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1138.265s">And</a>  they go hand in hand.</p>

    <p>[s-4VJY_TglE_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1139.846s">Yeah,</a>  that's a really good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1141.226s">And</a>  the reason why we have chosen to work on food is because it's a little bit easier than working on, say, the cost of living, or fair wages, or <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1151.604s">this</a>  big looming housing crisis that we have, like getting food to people compared to those other problems is a little bit easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1158.548s">So</a>  I don't have a good answer for you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1163.451s">You</a>  know, I've been on this council, uh, 18 years and I could tell you over the last year or two, I received more phone calls from people that are living out of their car that lived in the city, can no longer afford to live here, but maybe in their car living in the cemetery or behind <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1181.522s">the</a>  mall, and it's happening more and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1184.963s">And</a>  it's really at a point right now that I think we as a community have to step up and address this issue that for years maybe just went under the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1195.225s">But</a>  I'm seeing it more and more, I'm fielding the phone calls now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1198.946s">And</a>  I think we should work in conjunction with your task force as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1206.728s">any</a>  other agency that would like to step up and assist our homeless families that are coming from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1212.831s">These</a>  aren't people that are just moving into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1215.352s">These</a>  are families that have lived here for many years that all of a sudden, because of the economy, they can't keep up and they become homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1222.936s">And</a>  it's at an epidemic proportion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1228.158s">But</a>  I appreciate all the work you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1229.839s">I</a>  do support this and will support this tonight.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1234.976s">I</a>  appreciate you bringing all those issues up to the forefront, because we see that every day becoming more and more of an issue in the Department of Public Health, even particularly for seniors who are trying to live in their homes, who can no longer afford to keep them up or to stay there, and issues snowball. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1253.285s">Again,</a>  Sarah's position is part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1256.407s">It's</a>  grant-funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1258.768s">We</a>  don't know when that grant will end, and it's unfortunately most of the work we do <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1262.577s">around</a>  these issues are not city funded, they're grant funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1265.679s">So</a>  going forward, maybe we can have a discussion as to how we can sustain these wonderful jobs and positions that do this kind of work with city funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1277.485s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1278.166s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1278.406s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1279.026s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1279.987s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1281.507s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1282.838s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I just want to thank everyone who's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1287.16s">And</a>  I also want to thank you for giving us multiple at-bats on this, going to the school committee, coming here, because I don't think enough people in Medford know these statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1294.104s">They're</a>  pretty shocking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1295.365s">I'm</a>  just going to repeat them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1296.325s">1</a>  in 10 residents of the city facing food insecurity, 1 in 8 children facing food insecurity, 1 in 14 seniors facing food insecurity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1305.39s">And</a>  I think every time we can say that, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1307.232s">on</a>  public access television and wherever else so that people know it's a problem is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1312.254s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks and Sra and Marianne and others brought up a really good point which is that addressing food insecurity is an intersectional issue and the work that we do around housing affordability and the cost of living and the economy and making sure Medford works for everyone who lives here helps address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1328.8s">That</a>  doesn't mean we don't have food plans and food-based solutions but I think we need to think of it holistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1336.103s">I,</a>  in my other life, work with college students and workers on campuses, and this is a huge problem there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1342.187s">I</a>  was lucky enough to be at a Greater Boston Food Bank sponsored event and Project Bread and a bunch of others talking about housing and food insecurity, homelessness, and hunger on public college campuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1352.034s">Upwards</a>  of 25% of students at community colleges in Massachusetts are facing hunger on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1358.179s">Upwards</a>  of 10% of <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1359.96s">community</a>  college students are facing housing insecurity or homelessness on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1363.624s">So</a>  some of those people live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1366.006s">Some</a>  of those people live in Medford and go to school at these places. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1369.11s">And</a>  I just want to bring that into the conversation and thank the groups that are here who are working to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1376.077s">I</a>  also want to thank the MicroPantry group and the Board of Health as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1385.093s">Yeah,</a>  I think I've said almost everything I want to say, and I'm really happy about the intentional approach and the progress that we've made, but I want to make sure that we get the resources that we need to address it and that we can do our best to try to integrate food and food insecurity into the other conversations we're having about what it means to live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1402.96s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1403.6s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1404.641s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1405.935s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, and thank you, Madam Mayor, and to your team for putting together such a well-thought-out proclamation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1413.453s">Ultimately,</a>  the matter before us is <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1415.617s">comprehensive</a>  data-driven collaborative effort that was put together between community stakeholders working together towards a common goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1424.02s">It's</a>  something that I support wholeheartedly today, Mr. President, and it's something that I'll support wholeheartedly in the future when we continue to talk about ways that we can come up with funding mechanisms to continue to fulfill positions of vital need here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=1436.925s">So</a>  I thank the administration for bringing this resolution and proclamation forward and would move approval on the matter.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2490.561s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2495.383s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2496.703s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2497.463s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2499.904s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2502.885s">19-623</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, update on the Eversource project.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2508.587s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2509.448s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2511.109s">And</a>  through you, I'd like to thank also our friends from Eversource that are here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2515.593s">A</a>  couple weeks ago, we put forward a resolution asking that we get quarterly updates on the Eversource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2521.539s">It's</a>  going to be a large scale, large scope project that's going to be coming through our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2525.142s">And</a>  I thought that it might be in the best interest, as well as my colleagues did, I believe, to have periodic updates as to what's going on, what to expect, and to be able to address any concerns that may be coming up in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2536.393s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, we do have some representatives here from Eversource that I'd like to thank for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2541.137s">We</a>  have Mr. Shortell, Mr. Zamparelli, and <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2544.44s">I</a>  do believe we have a new community relations liaison here that we're going to be introduced to this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2551.466s">So</a>  I'd like to turn the floor over to our friends from Eversource, provided my council colleagues have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2556.61s">And</a>  we can move on with an update from our friends over at Eversource, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2560.228s">Thank</a>  you, Consul Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2561.109s">If</a>  we could please have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2563.271s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2564.152s">My</a>  name is Rob Collins, Londonderry, New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2566.914s">I</a>  am the Eversource project manager for this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2570.417s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to provide an update to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2575.762s">We</a>  did provide a handout that I think all the councilors received that provides an overall overview of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2583.049s">And</a>  I'll quickly go through that as well as provide an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2585.991s">And</a>  also with me is Sean Shortell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2588.033s">When</a>  we talk about community relations, I'll turn it over to Sean since he's the go-to guy for community relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2594.559s">Overview</a>  of the project, the project's approximately eight miles long. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2598.442s">It</a>  starts at the substation in Woburn, goes through Winchester, Medford, Somerville, Boston, and into the substation on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2610.264s">Just</a>  want to clarify one thing that I think the council has a misunderstanding on the project, based on watching some of the prior meetings on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2622.106s">This</a>  is an electric transmission project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2625.327s">It's</a>  not a gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2627.363s">line</a>  project, so just for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2630.106s">It</a>  is a 115,000 volt underground transmission line project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2636.273s">Basically,</a>  again, between the two substations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2642.262s">The</a>  reason for the project is back a few years ago, I don't remember exactly when, it was before my time with Eversource, but ISO New England did a study and concluded that the greater Boston area is at risk for potential outages. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2657.346s">And</a>  so this is one of a number of projects that Eversource has and Engrid has to increase the reliability of the greater Boston grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2667.849s">So</a>  this project is necessary for the entire area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2675.581s">You</a>  go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2678.687s">Page</a>  three of the handout, you'll see that the process of construction is you can visualize a train. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2687.169s">It's</a>  really a construction train. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2690.869s">The</a>  cattle catcher at the front is the saw cutting exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2694.97s">We</a>  have a saw cut go out in front of the project, saw cut the street to make sure that the excavation is neat in the asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2706.784s">Then</a>  we come back later, excavate the trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2711.353s">Then</a>  we come back behind that, install the pipe, backfill the pipe, and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2720.304s">Typically,</a>  it's done from a manhole to manhole segment standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2725.589s">We</a>  install one manhole, then install another manhole and try to work between the two manholes is the most efficient way of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2733.237s">The</a>  project has nine vaults, electric manholes that are approximately 10 by 10 by 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2739.684s">We</a>  have five of them installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2741.886s">We</a>  have four remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2745.353s">If</a>  you go to page five of the handout, you'll see the location of the various electric vaults and the ones that have been installed, when they were installed, and the ones that are remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2758.522s">Overall,</a>  the project itself, we have about 35% of the <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2766.18s">of</a>  the trenching pipe work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2769.304s">If</a>  you go to page six of the handout, you'll see what work we have done, when it was done, and what work is remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2778.574s">We</a>  currently have a plan developed to get this project completed this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2785.934s">Myself,</a>  McCourt Construction Company, who is our contractor for doing this particular work, will be reaching out to the city to work with the city staff to present our plan and get buy-in on what we think can be done, how it can be done to minimize the impact to the community as we're moving forward with the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2811.263s">Following</a>  completion of the pipeline from substation to substation, a separate contractor will be coming back next year to pull the cable and splice the cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2824.473s">Once</a>  the cable splicing is start, that's a 24-7 operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2829.998s">Estimate</a>  is going to take about five days of 24-hour operations at each manhole to do the splicing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2839.805s">And</a>  with that, if you've got any questions regarding the construction of the project, I'll be glad to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2846.391s">If</a>  not, I'll turn it over to Mr. Shortell to talk about the community outreach aspects of the project.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2853.697s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2854.758s">I'm</a>  going to let them finish their presentation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2856.579s">And</a>  then if we have any questions, we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2858.381s">I</a>  don't want to ruin the flow.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2860.142s">If</a>  you could please continue with the presentation, and we'll do questions at the end.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2863.305s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2866.765s">tag</a>  in for Rob Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2868.246s">My</a>  name's Sean Schwartel, and I live in Charlestown, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2872.708s">So</a>  we've appeared before the city council a few times before. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2875.75s">I</a>  know that we have two new members, so congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2879.953s">Rob</a>  and I put this packet together with some of the construction means and methods slides so that you have a better understanding of what you'll see in the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2886.676s">Some</a>  of these slides may be redundant to other members, but just a refresher on what the construction activity looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2893.48s">And</a>  that kind of segues into my role. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2895.801s">My</a>  role with the project is to communicate what we're doing, when we're doing it, to stakeholders along the routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2902.544s">That's</a>  businesses, schools, and most importantly, your constituents and your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2909.847s">So</a>  we have a community outreach program where we go door-to-door during each phase of construction in advance of that work so that people are kind of have a general awareness of what's happening on their street on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2923.793s">We</a>  also layer that with website updates that are updated weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2928.658s">And</a>  there's an example of that on slide 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2932.081s">Additionally,</a>  we are co-hosting some of the information about the project on the city's own web page. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2937.467s">And</a>  that's something that we also update not quite as frequently as weekly, the Eversource <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2943.513s">Project</a>  updates are weekly, but the ones that go through the city website are a little less frequent, and we can certainly accelerate that if we determine from our stakeholders at the city that there's a need to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2955.699s">Additionally,</a>  we have stakeholder emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2957.82s">I</a>  think almost everybody on the council has been getting them from me over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2962.563s">They</a>  generally go out biweekly, letting you know what's going on in what part of town and what some of the issues that we've identified and how we've attempted to address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2973.595s">And</a>  then as Rob mentioned, municipal coordination, we're working closely with your city engineer, your city traffic engineer, your police department on what our plan is to get this project done in 2020, this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2988.523s">And</a>  then finally, there's a 24-hour hotline and email address for residents with questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=2993.185s">Those</a>  emails and 800 numbers, they come to me, and I respond to them generally within 24 hours, sometimes even sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3002.47s">And</a>  then as I mentioned, slide 10 is a brief example of what the project website looks like that's hosted by Eversource.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3011.597s">And</a>  then the final slide is both Rob's contact information, my contact information, and <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3017.742s">my</a>  supervisor Todd's contact information as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3020.863s">So</a>  that is our cell phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3022.944s">It</a>  goes right to our email. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3023.864s">We</a>  are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3025.604s">Rob</a>  has an office in Medford on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3029.265s">And</a>  I try to be here several days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3030.886s">We</a>  want to be responsive and work with you to alleviate any concerns of your neighbors and constituents.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3045.573s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3046.754s">Actually,</a>  no, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3048.055s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3049.156s">I'd</a>  like to thank you both for being here this evening and thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3053.039s">You</a>  know, Sean's done a great job, I think, of keeping us informed as to what's going on with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3057.203s">We've</a>  all been receiving periodic updates, there's no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3060.766s">I</a>  think it's also safe to say that the <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3064.233s">Worst</a>  is yet to come when it comes to the construction and the impact it's going to have on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3068.075s">When</a>  you're looking at the project breakdown here, we're about 40% of the total project is in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3075.398s">And</a>  what do I see here? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3080.66s">5,800</a>  feet scheduled for completion along Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3084.141s">Another</a>  1,400 feet on south, another 550. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3088.443s">So</a>  there's a significant amount of construction that's going to take place in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3091.744s">And</a>  I think really what's going to make this <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3094.136s">you</a>  know, the least painful on everybody in the community is going to be this open dialogue and our ability to sit down with other sources on a periodic basis to get updates from them to address the concerns that we have in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3104.429s">They've</a>  been very responsive, in my opinion, based upon the concerns that I've had in my neighborhood right in front of the Medford High School project they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3113.02s">a</a>  lot of work out there at the beginning of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3115.322s">It</a>  went relatively smooth considering the scope of the construction work that was being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3119.744s">The</a>  area was maintained relatively clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3123.687s">Access</a>  to the park, access to the sidewalks was still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3126.889s">Traffic</a>  was able to flow as best as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3130.051s">And</a>  I thought that the road construction detours that they made made it passable and livable for the period of time that they were there doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3137.455s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I do appreciate the work that Eversource has done in putting into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3142.117s">I</a>  do appreciate the work that McCourt Contracting has done putting into this because they are paying close attention to some of the community needs and quality of life issues in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3151.561s">And</a>  I'd hope that we can continue this dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3153.942s">One</a>  of the great things I thought that we got during the Craddock Bridge project was those three week schedules with the project briefing overviews that said, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3163.906s">83%</a>  done with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3165.448s">Next</a>  week, we're going to be working at these locations on these times. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3168.15s">And</a>  that's pretty much the emails that we've been getting from Sean anyway throughout the course of the sporadic construction that's been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3175.456s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I want to thank our friends from Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3178.279s">I</a>  think that, you know, there's going to be a lot more time to talk about some of the issues and the impacts that are going to happen along with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3185.064s">But</a>  as of right now, you know, I think that it's the open dialogue, the understanding as to when the construction is going to happen and the impact that it's going to have on the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3192.477s">in</a>  the neighbors, in the traffic, in the congestion in the community that really needs to get out there so that we can get ahead of it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3199.418s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3200.259s">Councilman</a>  Beers.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3201.759s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3202.939s">I</a>  just had a quick question for you, Rob. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3206.52s">So</a>  it says in here 7 to 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3209.44s">I</a>  don't know anything about the engineering of the project, so completely ignorant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3214.642s">If</a>  my questions come from a place of ignorance, I hope you'll correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3217.922s">But</a>  it says 7 to 10, you said 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3219.182s">Is</a>  that, are you doing something different?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3222.848s">My</a>  subcontractor is saying that basically once they start the splicing, it typically takes about five days, a continuous 24-hour operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3235.112s">We</a>  say seven to 10 just to be on the safe side.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3237.193s">Yep,</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3239.954s">And</a>  is this basically just pulling the cable from one end to the other?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3242.935s">So</a>  what happens is if you go to slide eight, you'll see <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3250.567s">Top</a>  left-hand corner is a picture of three cable reels. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3254.309s">So</a>  these cables, this cable is actually three-phase, so it's three separate cables that are pulled simultaneously through the pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3260.553s">And</a>  that's what the reel looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3262.274s">That</a>  takes about two days of pulling to pull from one manhole to the other, which on average is about 2,000 linear feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3269.319s">So</a>  they'll start up, pull the cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3272.281s">Once</a>  they get the cable pulled from adjoining manholes into a single manhole, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3279.045s">Then</a>  they start splicing, and that splicing operation takes five days or so.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3283.508s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3284.088s">And</a>  just looking at what Councilor Neill was looking at, is there a reason you, and maybe it's completely coincidental, is there a reason that it looks like the construction started on the MassDOT jurisdiction and is moving to Medford, or?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3294.795s">So</a>  it started in MassDOT because we didn't have the GOL in Medford, and we did, from a MassDOT standpoint, it was within MassDOT jurisdiction, so we started in MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3306.042s">Great,</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3307.784s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3308.766s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3310.188s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3311.43s">So</a>  going back to the cable splicing, which you mentioned is once that work starts, it's 24 hours, it's around the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3316.74s">What</a>  kind of sound can we expect from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3319.284s">And</a>  then also lighting.</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3321.226s">So</a>  it's relatively minimal because the splicing is down inside this underground vault. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3327.59s">There</a>  will be a generator, a whisper generator outside providing power down into the vault. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3334.835s">There</a>  will be some lighting overhead shining down into the vault, but it's gonna be minimal.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3340.038s">Okay,</a>  and then how soon after the work is completed on these areas can we expect that curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3346.841s">So</a>  in discussions with the city engineer basically what you want to do is You want it to you want the trench to sit for over a winter so that any settlement that's going to happen happens So that then when you do the curb to curb it's going to be nice and your settlements already occurred So we're looking at the following year doing the curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3369.107s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3369.467s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3369.727s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3371.018s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3371.939s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3373.58s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3375.741s">Regarding</a>  the vaults, in particular vault 8 and 10.</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3379.203s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3380.664s">Any</a>  time frame when that work will start?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3384.347s">We're</a>  hoping to get out there as soon as the winter moratorium is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3390.371s">So</a>  April 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3392.773s">And</a>  I don't remember off the top of my head if McCourt was looking at starting at 8 or 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3397.456s">But</a>  that's when we want to try to start.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3400.605s">And</a>  roughly, what's the length of those two vaults?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3404.248s">So</a>  the installation of the vault's about two weeks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3407.369s">Two</a>  weeks?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3407.99s">Yeah,</a>  providing there's no ledge there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3410.471s">We</a>  encountered ledge at vault number nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3412.633s">That's</a>  why it took us as long as it did to install vault number nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3418.536s">But</a>  if there's no ledge, we should be able to get it excavated, the vault installed, and backfilled in about two weeks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3424.2s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3425.12s">And</a>  isn't there a way of checking for ledge before you start to dig?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3429.364s">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3431.226s">It's</a>  once you start digging, when you hit it, you hit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3434.648s">I</a>  mean, we suspect there's going to be some ledge around manhole 8, but we're not 100% sure.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3442.257s">And</a>  depending on the type of ledge, would that include blasting?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3446.22s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3448.182s">The</a>  MOU and the GOL precludes blasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3450.644s">We</a>  would have to come up with another method. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3453.086s">What</a>  we did at manhole nine was essentially a big jackhammer, a whole rim attached to an excavator to beat on the ledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3462.373s">And</a>  that breaks it up, and then we're able to excavate it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3465.816s">And</a>  residents notified when that type of jackhammer was?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3469.339s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3471.505s">So</a>  if any of that takes place on vault 8 or 10, there'll be ample notification of area residents?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3477.991s">Yes,</a>  there will.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3478.551s">Do</a>  you guys do any video of people's homes and so forth if they're in close proximity?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3485.157s">We</a>  haven't in that area, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3489.06s">We</a>  wouldn't be opposed to it if someone asked for it out of concern.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3494.753s">The</a>  other question I had, currently within the MOU, there's some language in there that states if there's any city utilities that are either over or under your transmission wire, if they're cast iron or so forth, that you would replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3512.51s">Is</a>  that not correct?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3515.933s">I</a>  don't remember, off the top of my head, I don't have the MOU memorized. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3519.434s">We're</a>  definitely identifying them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3521.475s">And</a>  the city comes out and takes a look at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3525.377s">And</a>  if it's determined it needs to be replaced, then we'll address it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3528.478s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3529.318s">Has</a>  any of that happened to date?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3531.779s">We</a>  haven't encountered one that needs to be replaced yet.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3535.04s">But</a>  you are working over and under our utilities, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3538.023s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3538.623s">And</a>  you haven't seen anything to date that needs to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3542.287s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3542.667s">Now,</a>  replaced meaning you see something actively leaking or you see something actively wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3548.953s">Is</a>  that when you see it?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3550.595s">Then</a>  we would notify the city and they would come out.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3552.937s">Right,</a>  but just the mere fact that it may be a cast iron pipe, water cast iron pipe, is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3560.48s">From</a>  my reading of the MOU that I have in front of me, signed by the city solicitor, it states that, this is bullet point three. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3574.176s">It</a>  says, in addition to surface reconstruction, Eversource should upgrade city-owned underground utilities that are in close proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3582.304s">For</a>  example, a minimum, a bucket width of five feet to their new transmission main and or for those utilities that cross over under the transmission main. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3595.982s">So</a>  are you saying that only if you see something actively wrong with the pipe that you would bring it to the city's attention? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3602.344s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3603.124s">So</a>  you don't think that there's a responsibility to replace anything that you cross over or under?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3609.605s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3610.626s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3612.566s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to get just a response from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3617.247s">Regarding</a>  bullet point three in the MOU for March 9, 2017, that was signed by City Solicitor Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3628.152s">Just</a>  if we can get clarification on the responsibility of Eversource when they cross over our utilities.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3637.657s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3638.877s">So</a>  Councilor Marks is making a motion to get a response back from the city solicitor regarding bullet point three on the MOU that we have with- From March 9th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3650.019s">From</a>  March 9th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3652.68s">On</a>  that motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3655.781s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3656.881s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3657.441s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3658.881s">Councilor</a>  Marks, do you have any further questions?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3664.609s">I</a>  had one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3666.431s">Just</a>  looking at Vault 12, police stations being built right across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3671.154s">Do</a>  you plan to time that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3672.155s">Have</a>  you coordinated that with the chief?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3673.556s">So</a>  we've actually had discussions with the chief, and he wants that work done at nighttime.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3677.559s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3677.999s">So</a>  we will be coordinating with the chief on exactly when we're going to get that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3683.223s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3683.483s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3684.584s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3685.945s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3687.406s">So</a>  if you don't mind, from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3689.387s">So</a>  do we know exactly when that's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3691.689s">I</a>  know at night, but do we know? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3694.143s">Do</a>  you have any type of time frame with regards to months?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3695.884s">I</a>  don't have that right now because that's the part of the plan that we're going to be presenting to the city departments, traffic engineers, city engineer, and police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3705.428s">Mapping</a>  out what we want to do when we want to do it and get the buy-in.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3710.09s">Do</a>  you know when we can expect to maybe get a time frame?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3714.812s">I'm</a>  hoping to meet with the city engineer and traffic engineer by the end of the month to work through that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3727.378s">And</a>  I had a question, thank you for that answer, and I had a question regarding the splicing that Councilor Morell was asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3733.245s">So</a>  you talked a little bit about, I think, noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3737.309s">What</a>  about traffic? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3738.63s">Is</a>  there going to be a heavy traffic impact on that street when that happens?</p>

    <p>[Rob Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3743.716s">when</a>  the splicing happens, it will be a lot, there will be a little bit of traffic impact, but it will be a lot less than when we're installing the vaults and installing the duct work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3755.001s">Because</a>  basically what it involves is just setting up a box truck, you know, a cargo van at the manhole location. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3762.964s">So</a>  traffic will definitely be able to flow by it, but we will have to have a piece of equipment there to support the equipment.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3774.162s">Are</a>  there any other further questions from the consular? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3776.503s">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3780.485s">Okay,</a>  seeing that there's no questions, Consular Night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3789.991s">I</a>  move to invite our friends from Eversource back next quarter for a future update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3794.073s">I'm</a>  sure if anything happens in between then and now, we all have the ability to flip this packet over that they gave us and make a phone call and get the answers that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3802.191s">There</a>  is a pressing need to bring them in sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3804.051s">They've</a>  been nothing more than accommodating in the past, so I don't see why we can't put this off till next quarter, have another update when the construction season starts in the spring, and go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3812.833s">Do</a>  you still like the table till next quarter? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3815.234s">Yeah,</a>  same thing we did with the Lawrence Memorial.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3823.416s">Councilmembers,</a>  would you like this to be a B paper on this original paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3827.996s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3828.257s">Okay,</a>  so that's a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3830.78s">On</a>  the motion of Council and I to table this to next quarter, where we get our quarterly update, seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3838.809s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3839.43s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3840.131s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3841.552s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3842.574s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3843.194s">Appreciate</a>  all the information and the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3845.317s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3857.666s">20-051</a>  offered by Council and I be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize Medford native and MHS class of 1996 graduate Justin Springer on being honored as a 2019 ABCD Community Hero <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3873.927s">Consul</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3874.767s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3876.388s">Justin</a>  Springer is a dear old friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3878.409s">We</a>  went to kindergarten all the way through high school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3881.83s">A</a>  close, close friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3883.471s">Came</a>  to vacations with me and my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3885.312s">Grew</a>  up in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3887.513s">Spent</a>  a lot of great afternoons after school in his house, at his grandmother's house down on Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3893.275s">And</a>  we lost touch over the years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3895.596s">And</a>  just recently, we fell back into touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3897.777s">I</a>  was speaking with <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3899.778s">His</a>  stepfather, Mel, not too long ago when he gave me an update that Justin was doing well, and I started paying attention on social media and noticed that Justin was named this community hero by the ABCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3914.843s">And</a>  ABCD is an anti-poverty community development and human service organization, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3921.385s">It's</a>  the largest non-profit human service agency in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3924.894s">And</a>  it serves over 100 low-income families in greater Boston through its programs like neighborhood service centers and something we're all familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3932.48s">I'm</a>  sure we've all heard of the Head Start programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3934.401s">Head</a>  Start falls under the ABCD as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3937.243s">So</a>  Justin was named a community hero this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3941.387s">And</a>  I'd just like to read a little bit about what they said about Justin in the brochure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3945.149s">Justin's</a>  proven to be a tremendous asset to ABCD by lending his vast branding and marketing skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3950.222s">Talents</a>  and resources to help bridge gaps in how communities assess public health education and engage with various initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3956.166s">His</a>  numerous accomplishments in this area include orchestrating a street outreach team every year, conducting social media platforms for many of ABCD Health Service programs, producing major fundraising events for the Take the Test Boston program, which ABCD Health Services is a founding member. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3970.935s">And</a>  he did this all in his own dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3973.253s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I always think it's important that we notice and recognize the individuals that were born and raised in this community, whose families still live here, who helped make this community great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3985.557s">And</a>  we should point out the good things that they're doing in other places and here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3989.959s">Justin's</a>  someone that's really an inspiration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3992.12s">He's</a>  someone that's given his time, his energy, and his effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3996.021s">I'll</a>  free a charge to the city of Boston and to its surrounding communities to help make our lives a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4002.725s">Helping</a>  service over 100,000 families that are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4006.108s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it was important that we point out the great work that Medford residents continue to do on a daily basis, not only here in Medford, but in Massachusetts and across the globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4016.034s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4217.588s">Do</a>  you have one that shows all the? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4223.429s">Yeah,</a>  leave this on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4225.35s">It's</a>  so sensitive.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4239.642s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4242.446s">Last</a>  week at the MMA show, myself and President Falco had the opportunity to meet a company that does what they call Horton Place Mill Asphalt Recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4256.245s">And</a>  what they do is they come and they grind and they take our asphalt that normally we would give back to the asphalt company and we would buy it back from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4267.974s">We</a>  would keep our own asphalt here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4270.536s">They</a>  recycle it in place and heat it and it goes right back down on the road as soon as they do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4278.242s">It</a>  sounds like a very good cost saving plan because when we talk to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4284.353s">They</a>  gave us a price of somewhere around $25 a yard, which normally we pay $48 a yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4291.615s">So</a>  thinking outside of the box, we could probably do two streets for the price of one street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4298.256s">So</a>  I think it's something that's worthwhile looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4302.757s">I</a>  had the opportunity to speak with Steve Tanaya and <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4307.17s">DPW</a>  director and they both liked it and they agreed that it's something that we should look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4315.616s">And</a>  I'll yield to President Falco.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4317.417s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4319.619s">President</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4320.399s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4321.821s">As</a>  Councilor Caraviello noted, we actually talked to the representative, or representative at the MMA conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4330.287s">And</a>  it's definitely, I think, something that we should pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4333.149s">And</a>  that's why we're recommending a pilot program, thinking that this would be a nice idea to try out on some of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4341.555s">It</a>  would definitely save the city some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4345.137s">And</a>  it definitely has some benefits as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4348.179s">I</a>  mean, if you take a look at the number of streets that we're repaving each year, we're very limited to what we can do with the funds that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4355.062s">So</a>  this is kind of an out-of-the-box, kind of thinking out-of-the-box type of solution where we could do something with the recycled asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4365.067s">And</a>  there's definitely some benefits to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4368.249s">It</a>  uses in-place materials that are already there in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4372.452s">They</a>  actually do it all right there, recycle it right on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4375.474s">And</a>  like I said, it saves money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4377.255s">It's</a>  a shorter construction time to actually repave a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4381.297s">And</a>  it's easier to work around catch basins, manholes, water valves, and other type of things that you'll find in the middle of the street when you're repaving a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4391.143s">And</a>  it also lowers the engineering and traffic control costs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4395.725s">So</a>  this is an idea that we wanted to bring forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4397.986s">We</a>  think it would be beneficial to our community and actually save the community money as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4403.088s">So</a>  at this point I'd like to move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4407.67s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4408.79s">On</a>  the motion for approval, Councilor Knighton. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4430.363s">That's</a>  all I know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4435.267s">Can</a>  the sponsors of the resolution please explain to me if this is a machine that would come and do this, like, infrared technology right there on the site, if this eliminates the use of manpower and it's a machine that's performing the work?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4445.916s">In</a>  fact, we have a brochure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4447.717s">We'll</a>  get some copies out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4449.839s">They</a>  mill it, grind it, and heat it, and put it back down immediately as it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4456.93s">And</a>  like I said, with Chapter 90 money being thin, I don't think this is something that you'd probably want to use like in High Street or Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4464.82s">But</a>  I think it'd be a worthwhile project to look at on some of the side streets that really need attention.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4474.652s">devices,</a>  Mr. President, in various shapes and forms and various places on the internet, which means they must all be awesome, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4482.337s">Because</a>  they're on the internet and they almost work great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4484.639s">But</a>  no, it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4485.7s">I</a>  mean, it's a machine that's performing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4487.301s">So</a>  we're alleviating our exposure to liability for workers getting injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4492.304s">We're</a>  also having the machine perform the work so we know we're going to get the same standard, the same quality, every single time the work gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4500.43s">This</a>  is something I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4501.851s">It's</a>  something that we've discussed in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4503.832s">with</a>  street scan and other types of infrared technologies that we can use to determine what our underground infrastructure looks like, what our streets and roadways look like, what condition they're in without actually having to go and rip them apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4513.921s">So</a>  I support it wholeheartedly and I thank my colleagues for raising the issue.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4518.625s">Normally</a>  when we do a street, they come and they grind it and maybe sit three, four, five, maybe a week before we get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4524.57s">This</a>  gets, as fast as it's ground, it's put right back down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4527.573s">So</a>  I'm assuming they could probably do a street in a day or maybe more.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4535.368s">Also</a>  more up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4536.329s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4537.331s">I</a>  want to thank Councilors carry on Falco for bringing this forth as I did not have the pleasure to attend the MMA training. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4544.48s">I</a>  did a little research on this myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4546.282s">So</a>  to your points, it's cough saving it diverts waste and then the fact that you're doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4552.277s">At</a>  that actual site, you're removing the fuel costs associated with transporting these very heavy materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4557.582s">So</a>  I'm excited to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4559.224s">I</a>  support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4560.886s">And</a>  I appreciate you guys for raising something that's just one small way to move Medford forward in a more sustainable way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4567.012s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4570.827s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4572.248s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4574.148s">Council</a>  marks I know that I appreciate my colleagues doing their due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4578.25s">I</a>  know that this council, especially myself, we've looked at the biggest issue, which is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4586.113s">employees</a>  for the DPW and any way we can help lighten their load and, like Councilor Morell said, look at the whole footprint, our footprint and how we can improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4598.439s">I</a>  think it's important though that we really dedicate a recommendation to the mayor as we move forward to budget season for that, I know I've been saying it year after year, but a sidewalk pothole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4615.522s">making</a>  it even a bigger piece, which is repaving and re-sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4620.186s">I</a>  know as you go on to the next resolution, it's in the same breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4624.489s">So</a>  I think that we need the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4627.171s">I</a>  know that when Mayor Burke, before she left office, they've eliminated the civil service test for hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4634.837s">I</a>  think it's about time that we really put our money where our mouth is and make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4640.041s">We</a>  put the employees in place and the equipment that's needed to implement projects like this and really do something off the cuff here, something we haven't done or haven't seen in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4655.612s">So</a>  I'm pretty excited about this initiative and I appreciate bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4660.316s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4661.197s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4661.917s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4664.962s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4666.803s">Any</a>  idea what it costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4669.043s">Yes,</a>  it's, like I said, their projection was somewhere about $25 a yard or a foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4676.606s">No,</a>  for the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4677.827s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4678.527s">To</a>  buy the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4680.207s">Oh,</a>  it's a big piece of machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4681.468s">I</a>  don't think it's something we're buying. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4685.029s">And</a>  Mr. Keran said we're paying $48 right now for the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4691.671s">It's</a>  almost half of what we're already paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4694.513s">Right,</a>  no, no, it's the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4695.514s">Oh,</a>  and if we buy the machine, we're going to have to save 50% of the costs, plus fuel and manpower on the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4703.158s">Maybe</a>  it's worth figuring out what the machine costs and buying one, as opposed to contracting out work to an outside entity to perform work we could do in-house.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4712.563s">It</a>  looks like it was a pretty big... <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4715.793s">Few</a>  pieces of equipment.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4717.134s">Yeah</a>  that If I may I think there'll be a pretty big capital cost to buy that machine I think the best thing in my own speak for Councilor caviar, but I think we would agree in this I think through the pilot program if we could pick out You know a handful of streets that this probably bring in a rep from one of these companies because I'm sure there's many that do it and actually talk to them and <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4738.115s">and</a>  see, well, what type of streets will this work on? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4740.68s">And</a>  then pick a handful of streets, come up with a pilot program, and just resurface those streets with recycled asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4747.785s">And</a>  then, of course, get a price. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4749.467s">So</a>  I mean, get a price beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4750.988s">But</a>  see how many streets we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4754.231s">Try</a>  to figure out if we could have like a, the mayor has some sort of a budget for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4758.895s">And</a>  then see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4760.236s">And</a>  it's definitely more efficient, I think, in lower cost than what we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4764.66s">We</a>  have very limited funding, chapter 90 funding for street repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4768.604s">So</a>  I think this would hopefully allow us to do more streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4772.987s">just</a>  make our money go further, so I think developing a pilot program around this would be something that would be beneficial.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4779.05s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I guess my question is that is the intention to establish a pilot program that would privatize a portion of the work that the DPW is now performing? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4789.983s">They're</a>  not doing the streets anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4791.645s">They're</a>  not paving the streets right now.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4793.146s">It's</a>  not potholes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4793.966s">It's</a>  not potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4794.627s">It's</a>  the whole street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4795.567s">Because</a>  that work would fall under the scope of the DPW just because historically they've contracted out doesn't mean that it's not work that would fall under their purview.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4803.212s">I</a>  don't recall the DPW milling and grinding streets, the whole streets.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4807.936s">I</a>  don't recall them having the proper equipment to be able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4810.417s">But</a>  it still would fall within the scope of their labor certification for work that they could perform as ME02, maintenance equipment operator.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4819.906s">Unfortunately,</a>  our manpower staff is kind of thin.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4824.753s">That's</a>  why if we have a machine that can pave streets that does the work of four people, we might be a worthwhile investment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4831.69s">So</a>  if I could, from the chair, I agree that funding would be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4836.414s">And</a>  the Chapter 90 money is very limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4838.655s">I</a>  think it's about $980,000 a year we receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4842.298s">However,</a>  there is linkage money that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4845.16s">You</a>  would know better than I, Mr. President, how much money is left in that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4848.403s">But</a>  I would tend to say, as Councilor Knights mentioned, if we could take that equipment and do it in-house, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4855.187s">We</a>  go from doing one or two streets to many streets, and I realize the upfront cost, but it may be worth looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4862.548s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4864.389s">Councilor</a>  Bierce.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4866.169s">I</a>  think it's a pilot program, and if at the end of the pilot program it's so successful, I think we should explore what Councilor Knight was suggesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4872.35s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to add a B paper to this, requesting that our state delegation ask the Speaker of the House and the Senate President to increase Chapter 90 in this year's budget.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4962.519s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4964.26s">Again,</a>  something we came up with visiting the trade show last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4970.865s">This</a>  is a company that takes trip and fall hazards. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4976.995s">of</a>  sidewalks, and they grind them and smooth them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4981.079s">We</a>  do have a machine in our city that does it, but it is not, according to Mr. Chairman, it is not a very big one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4988.885s">But</a>  this company would come in, they would identify all the trip hazards, and they could repair them at a cost of about $125 per sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5000.134s">As</a>  we all know, every year we are approving lawsuits <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5006.268s">At</a>  $5,000 a piece, if we save one lawsuit, we can probably do 25 sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5013.752s">Again,</a>  something that's worth looking into. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5016.094s">Like</a>  I said, they'll come in, help us develop a list, and do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5022.537s">Again,</a>  I spoke with Mr. Cairns and Mr. Tenaglia. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5027.44s">They</a>  both agree it's a worthwhile program to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5030.442s">And</a>  I'll yield to President Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5032.595s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5035.016s">And</a>  this here is another solution where it's just a more efficient solution, where it's not going to cost as much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5045.72s">Because</a>  with a lot of these trip sidewalks, trip and fall sidewalks, it's just an edge that pops up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5051.963s">So</a>  what they do is they literally cut the edge, flatten it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5055.304s">They</a>  don't have to replace the whole panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5057.165s">It</a>  doesn't take days, it literally takes probably hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5062.288s">The</a>  sidewalk's not out of service, it's not costing you as much money because you don't have to replace the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5067.031s">You</a>  don't have to worry about someone destroying the cement when it's trying to dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5070.614s">So</a>  it's definitely more efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5072.655s">It's</a>  a concept that's used in other communities, Cambridge, Quincy, Newton, Lowell, Salem, Swampsford, Haverhill, Westfield, Peabody. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5081.539s">So</a>  that's just some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5083.8s">They</a>  use this, I guess, at Gillette Stadium as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5087.222s">And</a>  they use it at different colleges, BC, UMass, Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5093.865s">So</a>  there's a bunch of colleges that use this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5096.507s">So</a>  it's definitely more efficient for our community, and it would save the community money as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5101.33s">So</a>  I'd just like to move the paper forward at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5105.033s">Move</a>  for approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5638.921s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5640.042s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5641.833s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5643.554s">I</a>  think Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5646.997s">John</a>  was a staple in this community for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5650.48s">He</a>  was one of the founders with local community access, ran a show for a number of years, and the one thing I remember about John <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5658.866s">He</a>  never held any words back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5660.887s">He'd</a>  tell you exactly where you stood with him, whether you liked it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5665.707s">And</a>  he will be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5668.588s">And</a>  I'd like to dedicate this meeting, if it's all right with my council colleague, after John Baez.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5678.43s">Do</a>  you want to make that part of the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5685.832s">Do</a>  I make that part of the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5687.315s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5689.56s">Dedicate</a>  this meeting after. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5691.144s">Dedicate</a>  this meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5692.206s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5692.667s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5693.409s">John</a>  Baez.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5695.735s">Did</a>  you want to just mention a corner, Brad? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5697.876s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5698.956s">I</a>  just want to make sure we're including everything we want to include.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5704.238s">Someone</a>  that spent so much time in the neighborhood that he grew up in, someone that spent so much time outdoors riding his bike in the parks and stuff like that, someone that was a fixture in the neighborhood is someone that probably would warrant consideration for a corner dedication, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5717.222s">I</a>  do believe that John grew up in the College Ave area, but I'll have to get the specifics to that before I bring forward a motion that would request such.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5724.979s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, and Councilor Knight, thank you for bringing this forward, and thank you, Councilor Marks, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5730.142s">I</a>  had met Johnny a few times when I was growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5733.984s">I</a>  remember playing park league, playing basketball, and you'd go to the different parks, and he would always be at the park, and you'd see him on his bike, and he was a really, really nice person. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5743.149s">And</a>  my thoughts and prayers go to his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5746.251s">At</a>  this time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5770.018s">While</a>  under suspension, 20-061 offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5775.623s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council discuss concerns with South and Main Street.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5791.556s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5792.697s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5795.739s">If</a>  I could, this is really just to update South and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5799.6s">I</a>  know that we've had some serious issues there in the past week, but had a discussion with State Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5808.562s">He</a>  has informed me that with the hard work of his <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5816.449s">Representative</a>  Donato and Representative Garbaly and Representative Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5821.754s">They</a>  are presenting a bond bill on Wednesday tomorrow for $5 million to help alleviate the issues on South and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5836.287s">I've</a>  contacted the Chief of Police and Traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5839.355s">and</a>  also meeting with the mayor tomorrow to try to expedite some of the, again, low-hanging fruit that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5850.772s">Again,</a>  I think we dodged another bullet on Friday, but the stop sign on Toro and South, the raised sidewalks that we discussed on Main and South, and painting the walkways, I mean, painting the street with limiting the lanes, I think these are short budgetary measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5875.346s">fixes,</a>  and I think that would make a huge difference in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5878.829s">I</a>  think the residents that I've talked to are frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5883.573s">We</a>  are all frustrated, but we hope to have some movement and hopefully have some word, some definitive answers for everybody by next meeting on next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5895.122s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5896.583s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5897.884s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5899.345s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5902.466s">I</a>  hope that bond bill passes and we can get the money soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5907.127s">I</a>  talked to a few residents, and I think what happened on Friday, there was a pedestrian accident on Friday, and we are very lucky, as someone who's lost a friend in a situation like that, the different way that the car impacts the person can deeply affect how that turns out, and I think we really lucked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5928.003s">I</a>  know that the pipeline project is going to South Street, so maybe the painting and all that might be a little, raised crosswalks, sidewalks might be a little more difficult, but a stop sign at Truro and South. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5938.097s">that</a>  can go in even if they're gonna tear up the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5940.199s">That's</a>  exactly where the incident happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5941.94s">A</a>  resident at 76 South talked to me in October when I was running and I spoke to her about, she specifically requested that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5949.966s">We</a>  brought it up recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5951.427s">I</a>  really think that stop sign, expedite the expediting on that if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5958.793s">We</a>  really don't want another incident to go poorly there.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5962.676s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Peters. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5963.616s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5965.322s">Thank</a>  You mr. President also, and I want to thank councillor Scarpelli for his work on this in this follow-through If we could just track whether or not our resolutions from several months back This council put together a laundry list of resolutions that were supposed to be sent to the Traffic Commission Can we just have maybe the city clerk follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5985.006s">I'm</a>  being told that some of them may have not made it that far and</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5989.168s">To</a>  the traffic commission So I'd like to just follow up on it regarding signage and so forth that we requested Thank You Councilor Marks, I believe that when we talked about this not too long ago Was he within the last couple of weeks so letter went to the police chief am I correct?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6008.601s">Okay,</a>  so right a Letter may have gone to the chief, but I'm not sure I'm not sure that they acted upon any of our requests <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6018.276s">So</a>  I just want to make sure and reiterate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6020.899s">I'm</a>  glad to hear about the bond bill, but honestly I've been hearing a lot of things about the bond bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6027.546s">Like</a>  there's money there in the bond bill, but somehow it just doesn't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6031.87s">But</a>  I'm pleased to see that they are looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6036.184s">But</a>  I'm going to be cautiously optimistic, because I've been there, done that with the bond bills.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6043.674s">And</a>  the $5 million bond bill, I believe the $5 million bond bill is basically for the lights in the square, if I'm correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6052.007s">So</a>  it's the smart lighting system that will carry the traffic to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6055.91s">As</a>  far as South Street goes, you are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6058.292s">That</a>  laundry list of solutions or potential solutions that we came up with with the residents that night, you know, we need an update on that because that's really, I think those things are the things that are hopefully going to have an impact on that situation down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6074.904s">So</a>  we have a number of points of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6077.466s">Councilor</a>  Berrios has the first point of information.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6080.853s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6084.655s">In</a>  terms of what's exactly in the bond bill, I'm not going to speak to the specifics of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6088.197s">But</a>  just in terms of the process, you are correct that this bill has not, I believe it might be part of a larger transportation bond bill package. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6095.341s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6096.302s">It's</a>  an $18 billion package. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6099.263s">It</a>  hasn't been passed by the House, nor the Senate, nor signed by the governor at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6102.545s">And</a>  then even after that, Governor Baker has to release those funds to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6108.248s">We</a>  are several steps away in the process, but the House potentially voting on that tomorrow would be good.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6113.09s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Peters. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6114.11s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6115.951s">May</a>  I be so bold to suggest, Mr. President, that we ask the City Clerk to research the paper that we had forwarded previously to Mayor Burke's administration relative to South Street and forward that to the current administration so that they have it fresh and on their desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6130.136s">And</a>  I would offer that in the form of a motion.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6134.046s">Do</a>  you have that?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6135.828s">So</a>  on the motion of console of nights, seconded by constant coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6139.211s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6139.631s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6140.892s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6141.513s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6144.896s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6146.417s">Everyone</a>  is more than welcome to talk and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6148.719s">So</a>  one minute please. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6149.72s">That's</a>  the strangest. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6150.401s">The</a>  last time console night, did you have any further comments on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6154.485s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6159.923s">We've</a>  talked about this topic ad nauseum, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6162.265s">It's</a>  been going on now for probably the better part of four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6165.688s">One</a>  thing I will say is that nobody knows this issue and this concern better than Councilor Lungo, who is now Mayor Lungo. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6171.833s">Her</a>  parents live on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6172.953s">Her</a>  parents live on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6174.735s">So</a>  for us to think that we're going to talk the talk and it's going to fall on deaf ears, I don't think is the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6180.059s">She's</a>  had a vested interest in performing solutions at this intersection for as long as I can remember, as soon as the issue came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6187.065s">Councilor</a>  Lungo was all over it, now Mayor Lungo I'm sure will be on top of it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6191.449s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't think there's any reason for us to anticipate or expect or not to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6195.914s">But</a>  I do think that when we're looking at the scope of projects that are going on down there, we have the police station, we have the Eversource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6201.72s">I</a>  think one solution we may have, Mr. President, is to designate that a live construction zone, which may allow us an opportunity to meet with our friends at Area 4 for Massachusetts Highway Department and put some controls in at the bottom of the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6214.153s">Maybe</a>  no left turn if you're getting off the highway, because there's no need to get onto Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6219.878s">from</a>  the off-ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6221.999s">You</a>  should only be able to take a left-hand turn if you're coming off the off-ramp right there at South Street, because if you just stay on the road and get off behind the DPW, you can be on Mystic Ave as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6231.043s">So</a>  there are some controls that we can put in place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6233.584s">I</a>  think because of the scope of construction that's going on at the police station and the scope of construction with the South Street project, we may have a little bit of leverage here to speak with some of our friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6243.189s">over</a>  at Area 4 and use their engineering expertise to come up with some short-term solutions during this very dangerous construction period, which is going to take place for a couple of years now, Mr. President, to provide some short-term relief and short-term solutions until we can address it more holistically.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6258.513s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6259.353s">And</a>  if I may clarify, I mean, from what I heard, that $5 million would be for the lights that would be kind of at the bottom of South Street in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6267.235s">And</a>  I think even out here at City Hall, because they're smart lights and they all talk to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6271.496s">So</a>  that's, I think, what the $5 million would go mostly towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6277.177s">We</a>  have a number of residents that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6279.198s">If</a>  you could please have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6282.598s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6287.437s">I</a>  just wanted to get up to give Councilor Bears the opportunity to be reminded that we should try to avoid the use of the word accident when there's an incident with a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6303.604s">That</a>  wasn't an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6305.304s">That</a>  was the inevitable result of a country that is built around the automobile. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6309.286s">It's</a>  just that every adult must drive, and in particular, it's the inevitable result of a failure to make that particular intersection safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6315.688s">That's</a>  not an accident.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6319.677s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6322.299s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6323.72s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6328.344s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6333.447s">The</a>  Selton Main Street intersection has been a problem when I got my license and most people in this room, if not all, were not even born. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6347.018s">I</a>  hear the $5 million bond is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6350.821s">I'm</a>  not sure, even if it does go through, if that will help, even if you spend $50 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6362.811s">Again,</a>  I hate to reiterate and repeat myself, the risk of being cruder, but I would suggest trying in right turn only at this juncture from South onto Main, right street only. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6378.054s">Or</a>  else, as someone else suggested in the past, let me back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6383.019s">Also,</a>  Councilor Knight mentioned, I believe something to the effect of shutting down that exit on Route 16 heading east. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6390.566s">If</a>  the state will do that, that would be a big help. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6397.373s">And</a>  another, sorry?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6402.106s">That</a>  wasn't necessarily my suggestion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6404.469s">My</a>  suggestion would be to, if you're coming off the ramp, to make it left turn only so you can't take a right onto Mystic Ave coming off the highway ramp because you can stay on the highway and get off at the road with no name that we were trying to take over there over by the dance studio behind the DPW yard to still put you back out on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6421.089s">But</a>  to shut that exit down for people that were coming off would actually close down the only access that they had to Medford Square, which is our central business district, and I don't think that that's something that we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6430.074s">We</a>  don't want to divert all the traffic off Route 16 and not let them come to our central business district if they're coming that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6435.337s">So,</a>  you know, it's going to take engineers and engineering, Mr. President, but for a short-term solution in the meantime to implement public safety controls, I think that's something that we could consider because it's an active construction site with the police station and the Eversource project.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6449.203s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman Knight, for clarifying my brain on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6452.904s">However,</a>  if it was shut down, they still could take the exit at Winthrop Street, near where your condominium's located, towards that rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6467.97s">Another</a>  person or persons has suggested another idea, and that would be to make South Street a one-way, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6476.845s">which</a>  it is, but in the opposite direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6480.266s">I</a>  understand some of the residents don't like that, but again, this has been going on for over 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6487.787s">I</a>  and we all know people that have personally been injured and there have been deaths there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6496.249s">I</a>  would start with right to rent only and good luck with the bond.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6500.83s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6503.102s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6506.724s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6507.445s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6508.566s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6509.086s">The</a>  motion passes.</p>
