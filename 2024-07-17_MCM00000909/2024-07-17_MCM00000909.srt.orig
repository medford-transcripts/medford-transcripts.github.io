1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:07,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome everyone to the Medford Chartered Study final report subcommittee meeting, June 26, 2024.

2
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:17,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two members absent, but hopefully one might show up and we'll, but our task today is basically just sort of make a plan for the final report.

3
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:21,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you all have.

4
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:21,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,151
[SPEAKER_00]: So she'll be here shortly.

6
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:26,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

7
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:27,232
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

8
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:33,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I don't know if anybody has had a chance to look at the final reports.

9
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, part of our final report is going to actually be the charter.

10
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:43,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the one that was mentioned at our last meeting was Somerville.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville is

12
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,278
[SPEAKER_03]: not really comparable to us because they're so much bigger.

13
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:54,281
[SPEAKER_03]: But their final report, they did create a new charter from scratch the way we are.

14
00:00:54,361 --> 00:01:00,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's similar in that way, where a lot of the other final reports just involved edits to the charter.

15
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:06,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, just looking at a possible structure.

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,990
[SPEAKER_03]: The beginning is members.

17
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,351
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty easy.

18
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we can just list our members.

19
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:17,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them included bios.

20
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:19,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really necessarily think we need to do that.

21
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:26,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's an introductory letter which just sort of gives acknowledgements and explains our process.

22
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's different ways to do it.

23
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:35,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the reports have the next section would be called at a glance.

24
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:53,443
[SPEAKER_03]: where you know you're sort of given sort of a summary but then the next section oh here's gene could be recommendations which um i think is maybe uh maybe slightly similar but and then

25
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,111
[SPEAKER_03]: The way Somerville did it, they had a community engagement summary next.

26
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:02,434
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and then they had the charter text and then an appendix.

27
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:06,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, you know, we have things, we're going to have hygiene.

28
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:11,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just talking, we're just getting started talking about like what kind, how do we want to structure this report?

29
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:14,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just giving the example of the way Somerville did it.

30
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:19,869
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I saw, I don't know, I mean, how, let's see, I did find,

31
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I, we don't have to do this kind of thing.

32
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Framing Sam Framingham's wasn't as long, but they did.

33
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:36,877
[SPEAKER_03]: They did this kind of thing where they had a, I don't know how visual we want to get, you know?

34
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:48,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they had this chart where they talked about some of the changes that they did and why kind of in a chart.

35
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:54,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I feel like it's nice to have the visual, but it's also a little bit

36
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:01,481
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we could probably get into a deeper explanation with text.

37
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:04,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts?

38
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:09,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say, sorry.

39
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:12,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Jean.

40
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:15,387
[SPEAKER_02]: When was the email when you sent out all the sample charters?

41
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a while ago.

42
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at all of them, but I can't find them.

43
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, yeah, I could look it up.

44
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:28,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that, and I just randomly picked those.

45
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,561
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably other final reports, too.

46
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:33,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for instance, I just looked at Framingham's this morning, and that wasn't in that bunch.

47
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:40,315
[SPEAKER_03]: But Somerville's, you know, because Somerville wrote their,

48
00:03:42,847 --> 00:04:03,476
[SPEAKER_03]: wrote a you know a whole charter like ours did some of the some of the charters as I was saying just had edits whereas Somerville's had the entire charter so obviously the charter the draft charter that we that the call center is working on and that we're going to finalize um soon is going to be in

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

50
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:18,367
[SPEAKER_03]: See, they have, I mean, this is a long report, but basically, it's about 35 pages, and then they have the charter text, which is going to be several pages.

51
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And then whatever we choose to put in the appendix.

52
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:23,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

53
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:27,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that one, I think.

54
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:28,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

55
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:36,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So the part then we would be responsible for writing and structuring is, you know, the beginning.

56
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: The members is pretty straightforward.

57
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:48,415
[SPEAKER_03]: They wrote a whole thing about their process.

58
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we can do that to a certain extent.

59
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:55,198
[SPEAKER_03]: They had actually a pretty complex process in a way that they voted and whatnot.

60
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:04,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then, you know, so we can, we can, and then they have this at a glance section.

61
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that summary.

62
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:10,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like it gives people don't want to read the whole charter.

63
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:12,993
[SPEAKER_02]: They can exactly have summary.

64
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have recommendations.

65
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:24,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, I guess they save the sort of explanation part, you know, to explain what their decisions were based on for the recommendation section.

66
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:28,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And this part, hmm.

67
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:34,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this was just sort of, this is actually more saying what.

68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, but that that could be helpful.

69
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:49,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the ones we looked at had like an executive summary of the highlights of the changes, which I thought.

70
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:50,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

71
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:51,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to include.

72
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:53,409
[SPEAKER_02]: This one maybe doesn't have it, but.

73
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:59,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it has it sort of in the recommendations.

74
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

75
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:09,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where they talked about, so, you know, the kind of their major decisions and how they, what they considered and.

76
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:11,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

77
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:16,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, so a lot of it is semantics, like what are you going to call what, you know?

78
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:26,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that to open with members, you know, just say who the members are.

79
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:29,991
[SPEAKER_03]: In our case, there's going to be like a few former members, et cetera.

80
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the sort of introductory letter, which will sort of acknowledgements like, you know, I'd like to acknowledge all the people who answered our survey, the, you know, the elected officials and city officials who took their time to be interviewed, et cetera.

81
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:52,493
[SPEAKER_01]: A call-in center.

82
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:53,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

83
00:06:55,475 --> 00:07:01,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be, so that's, I guess, what I'm proposing is that we just list the members, and we have this introductory letter.

84
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, we have options.

85
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:14,771
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do this at a glance, which is, as we just noticed, is kind of a, it's almost like an educational page of, I mean, we could, you know, we could include that.

86
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:17,133
[SPEAKER_03]: What do people think?

87
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:22,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the at-a-glance is a really good idea, but that we should probably do it last.

88
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

89
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:28,013
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean put it at the end of the report?

90
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,375
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, just write it last.

91
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:38,982
[SPEAKER_01]: After we've written everything else, kind of go back and say, OK, these are the things that we spent a lot of time thinking and writing about and that stand out as important.

92
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:40,262
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

93
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:47,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the big question is, how do we want to structure

94
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:57,259
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to sort of write out our major decisions and why we made them and what materials we used.

95
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:03,823
[SPEAKER_03]: The materials themselves, then how much of that do we include in the appendix, et cetera?

96
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:10,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't think we would include those in the recommendations, but we might want to include them in the appendix.

97
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:18,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want to call that section major recommendations or, I don't know, what else?

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

99
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,422
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they call them?

100
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:27,704
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, they just, no, they just made this chart.

101
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm comfortable with recommendations.

102
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you guys feel about it.

103
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm comfortable with that as well.

104
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:37,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

105
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:38,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would.

106
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we would open with just members and intro letter.

107
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,493
[SPEAKER_03]: At a glance, which will fill in later.

108
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:56,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And recommendations, I think, then our major question is, what are we going to include?

109
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the charter is long, right?

110
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:00,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and

111
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:07,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't include every single thing in the charter in that, because a lot of it is standard language.

112
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to highlight what our system is.

113
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:21,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of our recommendations, like going to a ward alderman type government that we did, I think that's one of the major points of this charter that's going to affect.

114
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

115
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:26,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.

116
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:27,532
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I agree with you.

117
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Ward representation for council.

118
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:40,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just, I noticed that in Somerville's, they actually put as their first recommendation, which I think we could consider because we did the same thing.

119
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:41,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did it go?

120
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I had Somerville.

121
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:47,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Write a new and modernized charter to just.

122
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:51,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because we could have chosen to just take the existing charter

123
00:09:53,743 --> 00:10:01,007
[SPEAKER_03]: make modifications, which would have been hard in our case because it was just a very nutshell plan A charter.

124
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:07,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville's, I believe, was from the late 1800s, and I guess that's another reason they put modernized there.

125
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:11,112
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do we think?

126
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:21,198
[SPEAKER_00]: The term years that we decided for the different forms of government, whether it be the mayor, I think we recommended four years.

127
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,174
[SPEAKER_00]: and school committee state too.

128
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:31,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the important stuff that we handled, the different articles and so forth, doesn't tickle them like these things do.

129
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:32,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

130
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:52,128
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of putting this in as a recommendation, maintain the mayor council form of government.

131
00:10:52,168 --> 00:11:01,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was a big decision that we undertook, but I don't think there was much, there wasn't much controversy about it in the city.

132
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:13,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there seemed to be just a general feeling that, you know, nobody wanted to switch from purchasing manager, but we could still include it in our recommendations or,

133
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:22,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I think in large part, this document should also be driven by the actual.

134
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:27,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Minutes from all of our meetings, right?

135
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:36,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think those will really illuminate what it was that we were interested in what we discussed what we were worried about.

136
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And.

137
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:52,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, like, if maintaining the mayor council system doesn't show up in the minutes, like, clearly, as a group, we didn't think it was even worth talking about.

138
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're happy with the way it works now.

139
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure it's going to show up in the minutes.

140
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's leave that could be a possibility.

141
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:09,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess, David, what I'm hearing you saying is,

142
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:22,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the best way to approach this is to review the minutes and pull up, maybe, I mean, I would maybe even just sort of look at what we voted on.

143
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:26,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

144
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:38,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it also, those things that we voted on, especially where we were split, it's, I think, really good there to put kind of what was the reasoning behind

145
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:50,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly behind the folks who won the vote, we can decide whether or not we also want to put something from kind of the folks who didn't win the vote.

146
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:59,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think anywhere where we voted and it wasn't nearly unanimous, we should say, like, this was clearly a place where we were split.

147
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,221
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the reasonings behind we made the choice we made.

148
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:09,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's fair to assume that the things we're split on are the same things that other people are going to have questions about.

149
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

150
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:15,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that could be an approach that would make sense.

151
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I gotta tell you, I gotta agree with Dabita.

152
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great point, a great way of handling it.

153
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:32,243
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it shows people that we just weren't rubber stamping things and that we are just going through the motions here that there was, you know, good, positive discussion, which ended up the vote one way or the other, you know?

154
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:36,446
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's important for the public to see that, the effort that went into this.

155
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:38,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

156
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:42,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking, I think that's good.

157
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:42,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't.

158
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:55,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be nice to keep this short and sweet and not too lengthy because so maybe it's just this was a split vote, but you don't have to say like, who they were, or, you know, certainly not who they were.

159
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's anything.

160
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,287
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I was going to say is we should speak with one voice.

161
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:09,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the places where the vote was split are the places, like, I think that's going to point towards things we should probably include in our recommendations, right?

162
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:11,375
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a thing we thought about.

163
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:14,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the reasoning behind what we ended up doing.

164
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,362
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a piece of me always that feels like the folks who didn't win the vote should also get a voice in there.

165
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:26,087
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's probably better to speak with one voice as a committee and say, like, here was the thinking.

166
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:37,426
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to guess the place where we are unanimous, it's unlikely that like city councilors or random citizens or the mayor are going to be like, why would they ever have decided to do this?

167
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:38,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

168
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:39,616
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.

169
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:47,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But part of our thinking, when we outline it, will, I think, inevitably include what we considered.

170
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:56,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like, well, we weighed this, but ultimately, you know, because it's not like these issues are black and white, some of them.

171
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:59,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, oh, everything we looked at said to do this.

172
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:04,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there could be, you know, there would be ups and downs to certain decisions.

173
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to show that we considered it all.

174
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was thinking maybe keep it to the big policy decisions.

175
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:21,641
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of many votes on, you know, things that weren't always.

176
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:22,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

177
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:31,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, would be more high level, I think, then the recommendation section.

178
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

179
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:32,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

180
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:45,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So and then the other thing I was, you know, so, so I guess so we have a couple of ideas before us, we have, well, we go through the minutes, we look at our votes, we decide what the recommendations are.

181
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:50,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we go through now because all of us know kind of what the big things are.

182
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And we make a list of what we want to include in the recommendations.

183
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we review the minutes anyway and see if there's anything we want to add.

184
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:07,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other piece I was just thinking is because the other question we're going to have to answer is, well, OK, how are we going to write this?

185
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,218
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some people who are willing to write.

186
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:15,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we want to, you know, I mean, we can.

187
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:18,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we want it to be consistent.

188
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:31,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that in the editing, but maybe we should consider what's the format we want for these sections so that somebody doesn't just write two pages of text, and then somebody uses bullet points.

189
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:33,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

190
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:34,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make any sense?

191
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:35,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

192
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:46,695
[SPEAKER_02]: If we like Somerville, we could try to follow them with edits or something, or if we had some kind of guide.

193
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:59,778
[SPEAKER_03]: We could, I mean, you know, they sort of, for every recommendation, they did policy considerations and community feedback, that's what they included.

194
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,123
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they named the recommendation and then... I like that.

195
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:07,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

196
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:10,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't... Yeah, so...

197
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:20,845
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then things like, for instance, for the ward representation for city council, we looked at so much data, right?

198
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:27,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at, you know, the historical level of representation from the different wards and things like that.

199
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:38,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that it would be important to include that, but then how do we include that in

200
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:45,475
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to try to keep it concise in this section and then maybe, I don't know.

201
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:48,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the other thing we're going to have to decide.

202
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:56,622
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a huge appendix if we're going to include, well, we're going to include this survey report, I thought, I think.

203
00:17:56,662 --> 00:18:00,125
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll include your listening sessions wrap up.

204
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:05,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But so then the question is, do we want to include,

205
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:12,697
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the materials that we created for the word, you know, all those charts and graphs.

206
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:14,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

207
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:23,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm thinking we might also have like a, I don't know if we should footnote it.

208
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:27,009
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, we looked at some studies, right?

209
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:36,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're saying, well, we looked at these studies on word representation, like I, you know, and then footnote them.

210
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:45,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how people, I don't see any of these final reports footnoted, but do you think that's a little over the top?

211
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:47,134
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

212
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:53,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is for this city council.

213
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:54,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

214
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they might track those footnotes down and look at them.

215
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:03,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

216
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:06,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

217
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:20,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can propose right now to make a list of recommendations that we know we want to include in the final report and then review the minutes and the votes and see if we want to add anything.

218
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:21,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

219
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:34,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so far we have the, just the recommendation for a new, that we decided to write a new charter as opposed to,

220
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I mean, how do we feel about that?

221
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that kind of like an obvious for Medford?

222
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:44,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So obvious that we don't have, I mean, it was our first decision that we had to make.

223
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:48,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is just, we did have to vote on it.

224
00:19:48,259 --> 00:20:02,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we voted to follow the new model charter or the as a yeah, there's a it's an opportunity to educate people that have good point.

225
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:07,772
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to do the plan A, B, C, that we could take pieces from.

226
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not required to pick a plan.

227
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.

228
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the other one we talked about that might come next would be to keep mayor council.

229
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:27,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there was the ward representation for city council.

230
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:40,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other, in terms of just that section of the charter that outlines the city council, did we make any other major changes in that?

231
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,231
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't change the term.

232
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:52,373
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have made, we didn't change how they elect president and vice president.

233
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:53,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have ended up,

234
00:20:55,973 --> 00:21:01,815
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have ended up putting in some details about certain authorities that the council president has, right?

235
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:08,838
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe that doesn't need to be like in these recommendations in the nutshell, what do you think?

236
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:18,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the appointments, is that in article two or is that somewhere else?

237
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:19,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm trying to remember.

238
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:25,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I just pulled up my notes from from the article 2 and 3 subcommittee.

239
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:29,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely spent a fair amount of time.

240
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:36,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of making sure we were happy with appointment powers and we spent a lot of time talking about.

241
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:39,540
[SPEAKER_01]: When the city council could override the mayor.

242
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of that kind of came from.

243
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:49,949
[SPEAKER_01]: We kept on talking to people who said that they wanted the city council to have a little bit more power.

244
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:57,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, I think, strengthened in some small ways the city council's ability to override the mayor.

245
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:11,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And in other ways, we were like, we decided, for example, that the city council, I think, can't, like, block mayoral appointments, if I remember correctly.

246
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:17,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, we said that they would have confirmation power from multi-member boards.

247
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Not not for department.

248
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:21,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.

249
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:25,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, like, that's the thing I think we could explain kind of just our.

250
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:27,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I didn't agree with that, right?

251
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:32,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Our thinking was that with the department heads, they are direct employees of the mayor.

252
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:37,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, like, the city council being inserted in there was inappropriate.

253
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it kind of confuses the issue of who do they work for.

254
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:43,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

255
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:56,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we under, like we could maybe do, the third recommendation could be just about the city council.

256
00:22:56,088 --> 00:23:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we would have board representation, confirmation power from multi-member boards or confirmation power in general, and then we can discuss.

257
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:11,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also think the other thing that we did that I think is significant is include

258
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:16,606
[SPEAKER_03]: align allowing the city council to hire staffs to appropriation.

259
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:17,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

260
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:27,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and also I think to call the mayor and staff, uh, we can, they can compel mayoral attendance and city employee attendance of city council meetings.

261
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,389
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another big power we gave them.

262
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:38,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, I just, in general, I really liked the way Somerville is doing it, where we can kind of put multiple recommendations on there.

263
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, they did it by article.

264
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:49,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we could do that.

265
00:23:49,552 --> 00:24:00,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So although they started with their first recommendation for, oh, they did it by article.

266
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's why their number, so general.

267
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:03,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

268
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:05,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Writing the noon chart and maintain.

269
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:07,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are under general.

270
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:10,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they go into the articles.

271
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,598
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah.

272
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:21,385
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so that so that's what we so that's for legislative and I have asked a question about.

273
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:28,911
[SPEAKER_02]: The vacancy stuff that we did is that new or is that existing?

274
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:33,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to highlight that just like we spent some time talking about?

275
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:37,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe more on the mayor side.

276
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:38,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was less on City Council,

277
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:44,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone leaves, how they're replaced.

278
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:47,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to highlight that?

279
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:55,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's new and we've made it more specific, but I don't know that it's the kind of thing.

280
00:24:55,838 --> 00:25:03,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we discussed it, but I don't know that anybody would find our final answer controversial, if that makes sense.

281
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so too, but we didn't change the city council.

282
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:17,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the vacancy procedure for filling a city council, it's the same.

283
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:27,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we might have added something in case that layer didn't produce anyone, basically.

284
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:28,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

285
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:33,065
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be appointed by the chair.

286
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget.

287
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,588
[SPEAKER_01]: We just said that the city council can appoint someone if

288
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:40,460
[SPEAKER_01]: If everything else fails, they can choose somebody.

289
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.

290
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:55,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so after the legislative branch would be the mayor, the executive branch, and obviously the mayor, that was the four-year term, is probably the biggest change, right?

291
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:56,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And the term limit.

292
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And the term limit, exactly.

293
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:03,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Four-year term and four-term limit.

294
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,901
[SPEAKER_03]: We liked the fours there.

295
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do that on purpose.

296
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:11,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It's four terms, right?

297
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:12,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Four times four, 16.

298
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,769
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we, I think that's what we decided.

299
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:22,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, if, if some, like, we said that the mayor can only be elected four times.

300
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:28,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they are appointed, they could like technically do 17 and a half years or something like that.

301
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:29,677
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

302
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:32,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

303
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:40,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything else major in the executive section that we remember?

304
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't recall.

305
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:49,032
[SPEAKER_02]: The absent vacancy stuff that we did we spend some time on that, but was it just wordsmithing?

306
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:53,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think maybe there wasn't.

307
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:59,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we talk about what the process is now for filling a mayoral vacancy?

308
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,382
[SPEAKER_03]: We did do stuff, we did sort of say if the mayor's incapacitated, we did stuff like that.

309
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:08,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, okay.

310
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:11,144
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a different section.

311
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:17,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that was in the executive branch section.

312
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:22,187
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know how much we want to get into the vacancy thing.

313
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:23,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

314
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just trying to be thorough, but.

315
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.

316
00:27:28,436 --> 00:27:33,877
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we can always, it's better to put everything on and we can always decide, okay, we won't include that in the recommendations.

317
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:35,117
[SPEAKER_03]: See, they.

318
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:38,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Decided that the mayor can call special meetings of the city council.

319
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:41,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's new or different than it previously was.

320
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really the only change we made to the mayor.

321
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put down vacancy process question marks.

322
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:54,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

323
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:56,313
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be.

324
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:01,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then school committee.

325
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,618
[SPEAKER_03]: School committee.

326
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:11,584
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a big one because we had the ward representation, but then with the combined wards.

327
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:16,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll just call it, I mean, it's a change to ward representation.

328
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:19,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the process for implementing it.

329
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:20,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

330
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's probably the biggest change, right?

331
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:30,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have to address the mayor's chair, since that was the last feedback we got, even though we voted to keep it.

332
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:33,688
[SPEAKER_02]: The group voted.

333
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:38,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, see, they didn't switch to ward or they didn't recommend switching to ward.

334
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:40,673
[SPEAKER_03]: No, wait a minute.

335
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,474
[SPEAKER_03]: They must have had a ward base.

336
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:43,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they kept it.

337
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:43,915
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, got it.

338
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:44,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

339
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:45,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just reading this.

340
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:53,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have to address the chair issue, definitely.

341
00:28:56,413 --> 00:29:12,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than changing the composition and addressing the chair issue, were there any other big changes in that section?

342
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:21,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe we should, like, for instance, talk about the terms, because we've talked about why we kept them at two years, maybe for both city council and

343
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:26,915
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that term should be under both of them.

344
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:27,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

345
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:32,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Under general, do we want to do compensation?

346
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:33,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we?

347
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:36,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've got to bring that because we did make that.

348
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's everyone.

349
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, yeah.

350
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:48,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless we end up putting it under the article that it's going to go under, which I,

351
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:54,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Not exactly sure what it is yet, because the call-in center is working in wherever it's supposed to go.

352
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be later in the charter.

353
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:01,030
[SPEAKER_02]: In the model charter, it's under each article.

354
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:07,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, each article does say, you mean for how the people are, how they're compensated?

355
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a compensation section under two.

356
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:19,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We have that too, because the compensation will still be decided by ordinance.

357
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:31,562
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we also made that recommendation to put in the charter that there would be an advisory committee formed to research the compensation.

358
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And that part comes late.

359
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:34,203
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I meant comes late.

360
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:34,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

361
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:36,964
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in Article 6, maybe, the budget.

362
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:37,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

363
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:37,564
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

364
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:50,809
[SPEAKER_03]: But we, but maybe we, maybe, yeah, we'll have to figure out where to put compensation just as a, because it is a general topic and it was a hot topic that came up.

365
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:52,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that goes under general.

366
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:53,251
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.

367
00:30:56,614 --> 00:30:56,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

368
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:02,959
[SPEAKER_03]: So there wasn't, I don't think there was any other big thing that I can recall on the school committee.

369
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Article five was we were letting,

370
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:15,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Collins interdrafted, but interesting.

371
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:23,873
[SPEAKER_03]: The article six, that was a big one, right?

372
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:27,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

373
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:31,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, honestly,

374
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:46,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much of the things that we put in Article 6 were changes to the process because we didn't really have, we didn't, there wasn't, the only timeline that's been used is kind of the state law timeline, right?

375
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's been in the charter.

376
00:31:50,736 --> 00:32:00,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like my brain is, but didn't we recommend adopting the

377
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:07,916
[SPEAKER_02]: timeline that they're currently working under or no?

378
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:12,917
[SPEAKER_02]: The timeline that's been negotiated between city council.

379
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:22,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we wanted to make sure that nothing we put in the charter conflicted with that because that's important.

380
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:27,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did add an annual budget meeting.

381
00:32:27,182 --> 00:32:27,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that.

382
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:37,911
[SPEAKER_02]: We that this is probably where we put that sentence that we voted on about the next charter review shouldn't include a more thorough.

383
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:48,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that could go under the under this particular section of the final report, yes.

384
00:32:50,874 --> 00:32:51,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And.

385
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:57,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Just seeing how.

386
00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:17,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get, I feel like for this one, for this particular section of the final report, we just, we sort of have to use the draft of article six that we created and basically just pull out the major parts of the timeline and put it in.

387
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:18,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

388
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:19,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Timeline.

389
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:28,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Article seven was elections and sort of, I feel like one of the main things we did there was the ballot position.

390
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:29,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

391
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:32,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that go?

392
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:33,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's there.

393
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:35,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an article.

394
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: That's article eight is the citizen.

395
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:41,626
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean citizen initiative measures?

396
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:42,506
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

397
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:45,947
[SPEAKER_03]: For elections, we decided that the ballot position.

398
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:46,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

399
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:47,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

400
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:48,528
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

401
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:57,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Would no longer be automatically alphabetical order, basically, right?

402
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So ballot position was a big thing.

403
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:08,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And Maury, do you remember, because you were on this, did we make any other major decisions?

404
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:15,109
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, I was just trying to think the same thing on this one here, because they all kind of played together with me.

405
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.

406
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think we did either.

407
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:26,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we didn't change any eligibility requirements to run for office.

408
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:29,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we change any signature requirements?

409
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:32,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I know of.

410
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:36,970
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just write maybe signature requirements because that was a big issue in it.

411
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:43,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we didn't put any big thing in here about changing who can vote or anything like that.

412
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:48,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Somerville tried to do.

413
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:51,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't actually know what status of this chart, this

414
00:34:54,252 --> 00:34:59,373
[SPEAKER_00]: But they try to do rank choice voting, right?

415
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:00,514
[SPEAKER_03]: They did, yeah.

416
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:06,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if it's still with the city council.

417
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:06,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

418
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:12,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it got very, I think it got stalled once they submitted this.

419
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:16,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Article 8, the big one is regular charter review.

420
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:21,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can talk about... No, that's...

421
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: That's article nine.

422
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:26,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Article eight is the free petition.

423
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:28,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

424
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:32,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they didn't put that in the Somerville Charter.

425
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:33,308
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

426
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:33,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

427
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Article eight was citizen participation mechanisms.

428
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,570
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a lot of stuff in that.

429
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:41,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

430
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,391
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a recall.

431
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:45,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

432
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:49,093
[SPEAKER_03]: That one, again, we probably have to use the actual text.

433
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:53,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the recall is going to be a big one to explain.

434
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:53,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

435
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:57,992
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean by use the actual text?

436
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:04,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at the text and pull out the main parts of it that we think we should highlight in this.

437
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was a lot in it.

438
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:06,676
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.

439
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:07,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

440
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:07,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

441
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:09,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, recalls for sure.

442
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:14,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a residency requirement or something like that?

443
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that even go through?

444
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That was for multi-member boards.

445
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:18,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

446
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:19,381
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

447
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:19,862
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

448
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:20,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

449
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because we did the initiative petition.

450
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:31,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was a lot in there.

451
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:32,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

452
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:44,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one heading could be like citizen initiative petitions, because that's the two, the get it on the agenda, and the ballot, and then there could be

453
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:49,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And would a referendum come under that?

454
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:53,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's where you try to recall an ordinance, right?

455
00:36:53,639 --> 00:37:05,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure a council or mayor can initiate a petition too and vote on it and send it to the legislature body or the House of Reps.

456
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:06,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.

457
00:37:06,383 --> 00:37:07,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right, Melva?

458
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:13,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Councils initiate their own petition and not put it in front of the voters.

459
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this particular section, Article 8, was mostly about the voters, right?

460
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:20,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

461
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:24,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was about citizen-led initiatives.

462
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:25,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

463
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

464
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's recall, referendum, and ballot initiatives.

465
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:33,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

466
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:36,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Recall, referendums, ballot positions.

467
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:39,305
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

468
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:44,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Article 9, we ended up doing a lot in Article 9.

469
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think was general, now we're in general provisions.

470
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:55,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So periodic charter review we did.

471
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:55,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Well.

472
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we, I think we didn't have a periodic ordinance review.

473
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:09,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that was another thing that we decided on.

474
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:18,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not establish a periodic review of multiple member bodies, but we did put some other stuff in article nine.

475
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:23,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we have to just look that over in the minutes, look over minutes.

476
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:37,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, this article, this transition provisions are pretty letter, boilerplate, and the Collins Center is going to do that for us.

477
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:45,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So, look, they, this is sort of what, similar to what we did, but they put it in just later.

478
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:51,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually, I think, we're going to put it in our charter, not just recommend.

479
00:38:53,302 --> 00:38:59,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I can't remember if we voted to put it in the charter or just recommend that the city council create an ordinance.

480
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:02,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we'll have to look for minutes for.

481
00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:09,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

482
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:11,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

483
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:21,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say we do the sections we talked about and then later we can decide what goes in the appendix and that will probably become more clear as we actually write the

484
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:48,732
[SPEAKER_03]: report so now the question is the actual drafting of it i mean we have go ahead we're putting in a community engagement section right i think yeah so in the if we do this introductory letter it will sort of talk about all the elements i mean we'll definitely include in the appendix

485
00:39:50,676 --> 00:40:00,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the survey report, the listening sessions, do we want to actually put, devote like a page or a certain section of the final report to community engagement?

486
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:01,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should.

487
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:01,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

488
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:04,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like a way of showing we did our thing.

489
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:08,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

490
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:13,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should also, like, that's something that should also definitely show up on the

491
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:39,083
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the like one or two pages with the most important points that we should put probably at the front as like marketing material practically you know a lot of times people call like an executive summary we should put that in there as well right like the we want people to know that we really did reach out we really did listen to a lot of opinions from a lot of people um i think that's important to let people know

492
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:46,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so just let's just go, let's just review the actual structure of what we're talking about now.

493
00:40:47,039 --> 00:41:00,047
[SPEAKER_03]: First, we have, we're going to have members, then an introductory letter with, you know, just kind of acknowledge people or whatever, and etc.

494
00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:09,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about at a glance, which is more like sort of informational, right, but that will

495
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:13,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we talked about the recommendations.

496
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:18,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we would have the draft charter and then the appendix.

497
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:24,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So where would we put the community engagement or the other section you were just talking about?

498
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:35,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put it before the policy recommendations or the maybe it's the letter.

499
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:42,067
[SPEAKER_02]: like a summary of our process or something, just like how many meetings we had.

500
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:47,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you want to kind of summarize the process we had, and part of it would be community engagement.

501
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:49,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about that.

502
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:51,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about doing that in the introductory letter.

503
00:41:52,394 --> 00:41:57,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we want to highlight community engagement, we could also do that.

504
00:41:58,338 --> 00:42:00,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we did, we did, we did.

505
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:02,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was pretty impressive.

506
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,622
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the listening sessions were impressive.

507
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:05,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And so

508
00:42:07,598 --> 00:42:31,072
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be talked about and then we can have a sort of a... So if we put that after the introductory letter, then we would have members, introductory letter, community engagement, at a glance, which I feel should probably go before the recommendations because it's pretty much describing all the different sections of the charter.

509
00:42:32,613 --> 00:42:34,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the recommendations by article.

510
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:38,015
[SPEAKER_03]: then the charter, then the appendix.

511
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:40,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is obviously not set in stone.

512
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:44,420
[SPEAKER_03]: If as we're working, something else makes more sense, we could do it.

513
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,102
[SPEAKER_03]: But does that sound reasonable?

514
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:48,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

515
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:50,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

516
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:51,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So the drafting.

517
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:55,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can write the community engagement.

518
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:56,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

519
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking maybe do we divvy up the

520
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, Milva, if you wanted to write the letter.

521
00:43:04,556 --> 00:43:05,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll do that.

522
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:06,797
[SPEAKER_02]: As the chair.

523
00:43:06,937 --> 00:43:19,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do we divvy up the recommendation sections by article, and people take an article, and we all take, like we just say which articles we, maybe the ones that you were on.

524
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:25,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Or people who want to, you know, I mean, assuming that, who's interested in drafting?

525
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:27,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I can help draft.

526
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:27,997
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

527
00:43:28,478 --> 00:43:31,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And Phyllis, I think I got the impression that Phyllis would.

528
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:32,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

529
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:37,066
[SPEAKER_03]: From the email when she said she couldn't come, but she said to give her a task.

530
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:39,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's not necessarily writing.

531
00:43:39,428 --> 00:43:41,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

532
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:45,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to help or draft or edit either.

533
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:48,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably better at editing than I am at drafting.

534
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:48,797
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

535
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:51,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you, Daveed.

536
00:43:51,706 --> 00:43:53,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Drafting is not my strength.

537
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:54,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm good at one.

538
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:57,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that if you, maybe you, I mean, I don't know.

539
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:58,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw out an idea.

540
00:43:58,428 --> 00:43:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is crazy.

541
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:01,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if Gene is going to go for this.

542
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, what if me and Gene split the drafting and Maury, Phyllis, and Daveed edit?

543
00:44:10,293 --> 00:44:11,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you want to draft a section.

544
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:13,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want to do a short one, Daveed.

545
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:13,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

546
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:15,895
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you.

547
00:44:16,436 --> 00:44:17,056
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good with that.

548
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:18,657
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that, Gene?

549
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that too much?

550
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:26,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're trying to keep it short and sweet, because people need something that long.

551
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:31,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we have July, right?

552
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:33,294
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

553
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:34,714
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's our timeline.

554
00:44:36,955 --> 00:44:42,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on vacation next week, so I could start the week after.

555
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:42,318
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

556
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:47,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll propose that I will do articles two and three

557
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Article four, article five, I don't even know what we're gonna say about it.

558
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just leave that in question right now.

559
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:59,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do the citizens petition one.

560
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:00,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

561
00:45:01,314 --> 00:45:01,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's eight.

562
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:03,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll do eight.

563
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:10,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I can help with the war if you want, because I did all the demographic stuff.

564
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:14,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that would be under two and three, so.

565
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:18,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you want, you can, if you want help with that.

566
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:34,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So that leaves the school committee, the budget, financial procedures, elections, and then the general provisions, which sort of had a lot of stuff in it, but maybe not all stuff that we would highlight heavily in the recommendations.

567
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:41,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't at the meeting for some of the votes on the school committee.

568
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:42,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do that one too.

569
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

570
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:46,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So wait, which ones are you're doing two and three, Melva?

571
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:47,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And four.

572
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:48,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And four.

573
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:49,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Five, we're leaving open.

574
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I did six because I was on the budget.

575
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

576
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I wasn't on this article seven.

577
00:45:59,061 --> 00:45:59,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do that one too.

578
00:45:59,862 --> 00:46:03,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's going to be short because it's, you know, it's mostly about the ballot position and

579
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:09,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe signatures, we'll have to look at.

580
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:14,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that actually gets us started.

581
00:46:15,377 --> 00:46:17,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Article 9 will just sort of hold.

582
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:19,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

583
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:24,341
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the budget, Article 6 and 8.

584
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:37,246
[SPEAKER_03]: 8.

585
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:37,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about just the other thing, David, would you be interested in doing the minutes and slash votes review?

586
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:39,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm happy to go through that.

587
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:43,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I'm pretty sure I'll have them all in a folder.

588
00:46:44,574 --> 00:46:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm going to have to look.

589
00:46:46,255 --> 00:46:46,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably do.

590
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:54,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time they're approved, do they get posted on the website?

591
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:03,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I send them to Emma, and I actually have never looked to see where she posts them, but they're posted somewhere on our website.

592
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:11,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what kind of order they're in, you know, like if they're chronological or if they're just thrown into a folder, but let me just look right now.

593
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:18,117
[SPEAKER_03]: manfordmad.org slash charter study.

594
00:47:19,157 --> 00:47:21,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And come on computer.

595
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:25,900
[SPEAKER_03]: If you scroll down, you see meeting minutes.

596
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:31,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are, there's a folder.

597
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:31,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

598
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:36,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they're not necessarily in, they're just in.

599
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll run through them all.

600
00:47:39,004 --> 00:47:43,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, you know, try and compile kind of important bits.

601
00:47:44,718 --> 00:47:47,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And they only get posted once they're approved.

602
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:50,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the last meeting we had won't be there.

603
00:47:50,843 --> 00:47:57,489
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you see anything missing, I can send you whatever didn't get posted.

604
00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:00,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I have all of the meetings.

605
00:48:01,132 --> 00:48:04,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I joined the committee, I have them in my email as well.

606
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:09,939
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really for the ones in 2023 before I joined that I was interested.

607
00:48:09,979 --> 00:48:11,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all there.

608
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So this seems perfect.

609
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

610
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:21,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the question is, when do we want to reconvene?

611
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:24,789
[SPEAKER_02]: What's our drafting?

612
00:48:26,131 --> 00:48:30,054
[SPEAKER_02]: When do we want to have the final draft done with everybody reviewed?

613
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:37,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the Collins Center, hopefully as we speak, is working on the draft charter that they're going to get to us, and everyone's going to read that.

614
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,701
[SPEAKER_03]: But the final report,

615
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:43,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So in August, we're supposed to get together to just sort of finalize the draft charter.

616
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:52,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it would be good if we had the final report ready by, I would like to say September 1st.

617
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that seem unreasonable?

618
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:58,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I thought it was end of July.

619
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:11,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I don't think we, I mean, because I'm thinking August 3rd, we're going to meet to talk, providing that we have it, which I think we will, we're going to meet to talk about the actual draft of the charter, right?

620
00:49:11,374 --> 00:49:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be questions on that.

621
00:49:13,476 --> 00:49:16,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe things that we have to tighten up or whatever.

622
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:18,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Collins Center will be with us for that.

623
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:23,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So, assuming that might take a couple of me, I mean, maybe September meeting.

624
00:49:23,783 --> 00:49:25,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we'll have enough time to finalize.

625
00:49:25,664 --> 00:49:28,645
[SPEAKER_03]: The draft charter and then look at this final report.

626
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:31,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the ideal actually.

627
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:33,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

628
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's because I would, yeah, let let's say August.

629
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:37,911
[SPEAKER_03]: August.

630
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:39,361
[SPEAKER_03]: 12th.

631
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:40,282
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?

632
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:47,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that August 12th is for you and me to finish our writing for you to review?

633
00:49:47,648 --> 00:49:57,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, I'm looking I'm saying I'm talking about August 12th as a deadline for the final report, because then we could give it to the committee.

634
00:49:57,317 --> 00:50:00,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're they're gonna have to vote on it.

635
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ideal situation is that we finish in October.

636
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's, that's our

637
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:15,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Steve's date that I'm trying to get everybody towards.

638
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:21,015
[SPEAKER_03]: If we finish by August 12th, then that will give people a couple of weeks to read it for the September meeting.

639
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:22,255
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

640
00:50:22,295 --> 00:50:24,397
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a week later than that, whatever.

641
00:50:26,618 --> 00:50:33,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should have our, Maury and Debbie, do you need a week, two weeks to review?

642
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,630
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I could do it in a week, you know.

643
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:45,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and the other question, so yeah, so I would like to have these, let's see.

644
00:50:46,495 --> 00:50:48,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right now, it's June 25th.

645
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:58,682
[SPEAKER_03]: June is July 15th, an unreasonable deadline to just finish those two, to finish those things.

646
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

647
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:07,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's so that we can read each other's stuff before we send it to Maury.

648
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:09,784
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that would be.

649
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess I'm trying to connect this in my mind with the next time we're going to meet where hopefully then we would have like actual material that we that maybe David and Maury will have read and edited and fill us and.

650
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:30,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe at our next meeting, after everybody's read the drafts and we.

651
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:36,653
[SPEAKER_03]: can go through whatever edits we need, then we sort of can put it together and see what's left to do.

652
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:39,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll have about a month to do whatever's left to do.

653
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:41,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

654
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:42,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

655
00:51:43,195 --> 00:51:46,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be better if we could have it do the 22nd.

656
00:51:46,935 --> 00:51:47,236
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

657
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:51,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I'm away all next week, so.

658
00:51:51,897 --> 00:51:52,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fine.

659
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:57,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I finish things, I'll create a folder

660
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:01,425
[SPEAKER_03]: like a Google, a folder.

661
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:11,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, eventually this will all go into one document, but I'll create a folder and just create separate documents for like the different introductory letter or articles two and three, et cetera.

662
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:17,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can do that so that they'll be available for people to read as they get finished.

663
00:52:18,714 --> 00:52:22,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So I create a lot of like legislative reports for the state.

664
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:26,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can format it.

665
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:37,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you give me the pieces, I know how to use, I have Microsoft Word and I can create headings that are all consistent and stuff like that.

666
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that can maybe be at the end.

667
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:42,472
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have the drafts of the pieces, but.

668
00:52:42,552 --> 00:52:42,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

669
00:52:43,532 --> 00:52:51,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we use Google Docs to work on it, would that interact with whatever you're going to be using to format it at the end?

670
00:52:53,027 --> 00:52:54,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's fine.

671
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Google Docs.

672
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:56,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like its formatting.

673
00:52:57,055 --> 00:53:02,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in Google Docs, but what I would do is just download it all into Microsoft.

674
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:12,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I only suggested that because it just seemed it's the only way I know of really, other than Dropbox.

675
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:12,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

676
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:13,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

677
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:14,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Then sharing.

678
00:53:16,304 --> 00:53:17,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Teams account.

679
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:22,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We could use my Teams account, which is, but well, maybe we shouldn't do that.

680
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:23,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

681
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:27,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Google Docs is probably better for while we're working on it.

682
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:27,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again,

683
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can format it.

684
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, I regularly use a typesetting software that's really pretty called LaTeX.

685
00:53:36,025 --> 00:53:37,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So either one of those works.

686
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:44,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are much more used to seeing how Microsoft Word things look, but we can do... Yeah, whatever.

687
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:45,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Formatting doesn't take a long time.

688
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:50,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this is awesome.

689
00:53:50,112 --> 00:53:55,497
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a plan for putting together this, and I'll create the folder.

690
00:53:55,517 --> 00:53:56,578
[SPEAKER_03]: We can put everything in it.

691
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:59,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the next question is, do we want to have another meeting?

692
00:54:01,142 --> 00:54:10,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we're making July 22nd the deadline for getting everything written, should we look at the calendar in front of me?

693
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:10,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

694
00:54:12,677 --> 00:54:21,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's maybe meet around that week to see if there's anything else that needs to happen, anything else that needs to get written, anything surprising that we need to argue about.

695
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:25,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the 15th, just to have a discussion or something like that or some day.

696
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:27,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Or talk about sort of how things are going.

697
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:29,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this plan even working?

698
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:32,451
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to push it out of the week or whatever.

699
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:33,732
[SPEAKER_03]: What day of the week?

700
00:54:33,752 --> 00:54:34,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a calendar?

701
00:54:34,612 --> 00:54:35,133
[SPEAKER_03]: What day of the week?

702
00:54:35,253 --> 00:54:37,354
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so weird.

703
00:54:37,454 --> 00:54:38,455
[SPEAKER_00]: 15th is a Monday.

704
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:40,056
[SPEAKER_03]: 15th is a Monday.

705
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:41,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Can people meet on a Monday?

706
00:54:42,922 --> 00:54:46,168
[SPEAKER_00]: 22nd is Monday also that we established already.

707
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:47,851
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that week?

708
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:51,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Week of the 15th, what works for people?

709
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:55,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm free from July 10th to September 1st, so you all just let me know.

710
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:57,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

711
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying evenings?

712
00:54:59,736 --> 00:55:01,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Days are a little easier for me.

713
00:55:01,177 --> 00:55:01,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever works.

714
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:03,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Days are easier.

715
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday.

716
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the days.

717
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:09,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to see it start a little bit later, if you don't mind.

718
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:15,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe start at 3.30 or somewhere around there.
