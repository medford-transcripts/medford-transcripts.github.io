1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:01,097
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,500
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to be here, right?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

4
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:09,162
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding.

5
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:18,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the good news is you only need three for a quorum, so.

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's good.

7
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,029
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be around tomorrow.

8
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:33,768
[SPEAKER_08]: here, here, here.

9
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,081
[SPEAKER_03]: report.

10
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:24,007
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually we're good.

11
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:25,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're good.

12
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:35,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I have copies of the other copies of the agenda on the bench, if anybody would like to grab a copy up here and the report details.

13
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,463
[SPEAKER_04]: a few a bit of background on the welcoming city ordinance.

14
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:50,487
[SPEAKER_04]: The total number of, uh, ice detainers is not part of the report.

15
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:53,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the reports also available online.

16
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, um uh, the welcoming city ordinance requests

17
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:08,638
[SPEAKER_04]: the total number of ICE detainers, administrative wardens, and other requests for information or assistance from the Federal Immigration Agency.

18
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:15,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And the report says the Medford Police Department has received some ICE detainers, but we do not know exactly how many we received.

19
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:24,881
[SPEAKER_04]: The police department does not and has no way to track that information based on its available database used for law enforcement investigations.

20
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:26,361
[SPEAKER_04]: We will come back to that.

21
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:26,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And

22
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:33,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to articulate that section of the report.

23
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:46,662
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also wanna read out, for additional background on this topic, please be advised that the Medford Police Department's Police Policy and Procedure 2018-01 also sets forth the following requirements.

24
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:52,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Any person who is arrested by this department shall be booked in accordance with preexisting policy.

25
00:15:52,986 --> 00:16:05,235
[SPEAKER_04]: If in the course of the standard processing procedures, ICE files an immigration detainer with the Medford Police Department, the arrestee shall be made aware of the detainer and provided a copy, which is the original fax sent to Medford Police.

26
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:17,385
[SPEAKER_04]: The arrestee shall also be made aware that this department will not hold them in custody on the ICE detainer if they post bail or are released on their own recognizance.

27
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:30,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I have done a bit of research on what an ICE detainer is, and I wanted to help people understand a little bit more about what that means.

28
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:42,406
[SPEAKER_04]: ICE detainers are a form that is sent by immigration to local police departments.

29
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:52,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it says that the police department must hold somebody until ICE comes and retrieves them and arrest them.

30
00:16:54,291 --> 00:17:00,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That form is then sent with the arrestee and the police department does not keep the form.

31
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:13,868
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is that were the police department to make a copy of the form, they would have to keep the copy of that form and the full criminal record of the arrestee.

32
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:21,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that record would become public record and would be kept indefinitely.

33
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:29,092
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is that it may not be

34
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:43,456
[SPEAKER_04]: in the best interest of our residents for the Medford Police Department to keep those records, but that a tally of the number of ICE detainers that have come in may be more in line with what we're looking to do.

35
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:55,223
[SPEAKER_04]: To give a little bit further background here, something that I think is important for us to keep in mind about these conversations and a little bit more about the background of the Welcoming City Ordinance.

36
00:17:56,081 --> 00:18:19,288
[SPEAKER_04]: is that the intention of the Welcoming City Ordinance and in what we're trying to do as this part of this committee and the work that we do in Medford City Council is to be the public facing body, elected body of Medford that is responsive to the residents when there's something that comes up that's concerning to residents.

37
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:26,549
[SPEAKER_04]: there's been an increase in ICE arrests in Medford or it's been very public, very visible.

38
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hear from our residents that people are concerned about that.

39
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:50,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we are so public and all of our meetings have to be public, if there is sensitive information about a resident that may be arrested or their records may become part of the public domain, it may not be in their interest for us to talk about it in city council.

40
00:18:52,065 --> 00:19:06,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I want us to do as city councilors is to be able to talk to residents about what we know, but not share personal information about other residents and things that may be happening to them.

41
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:10,430
[SPEAKER_04]: There are things that can be done that protect our residents and other avenues.

42
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:15,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And those things are happening, but we are not, I am not doing them.

43
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:17,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming is not doing them.

44
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:22,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Tseng, Councilor Callahan are not necessarily doing those things.

45
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:31,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we are a public body, and our meetings are public and transparent, and what we can do is we can tell you that, to the best of our knowledge,

46
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:52,211
[SPEAKER_04]: we are responding to your concerns, we're finding out about things, and then we're sharing back to you that we are doing our best to take care of the people that live in Medford to the best of our ability, but we can't know too much about the individuals or we would have to tell you all their business because that's our job.

47
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:57,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think similarly, that's the job of the Medford Police Department.

48
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that in the beginning of this meeting, so that as we discuss what this reporting should look like going forward.

49
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:16,941
[SPEAKER_04]: We keep that in the back of our minds and not get it confused what the role of our public facing bodies are as we try to take care of each other.

50
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:40,141
[SPEAKER_04]: of a mutual aid organization or a social worker that works for a nonprofit or even somebody that works in city hall, but is an appointed person or a staffer or somebody else, but is not necessarily an elected official or somebody who's in a position of authority and speaks to the public and something like this.

51
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to say that in the beginning.

52
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:51,926
[SPEAKER_04]: The councilors have all reviewed the report, I believe, and I was hoping that Chief Buckley could speak to the report.

53
00:20:51,986 --> 00:21:01,509
[SPEAKER_04]: This report was also done by the interim chief who was on duty for a few months while Chief Buckley was out, so he didn't prepare this report.

54
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:07,491
[SPEAKER_04]: But would you mind speaking to the report a little bit and just tell us a little bit about what we have here?

55
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me, sorry, which one was it?

56
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:17,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.

57
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:20,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Jack Buckley, City of Medford, 100 Main Street.

58
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:22,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting all this feedback.

59
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:28,790
[SPEAKER_07]: A little work up here.

60
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?

61
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm here to answer questions mostly.

62
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:41,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the report was filed and I've read the report and gone over it.

63
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:44,287
[SPEAKER_07]: It's accurate.

64
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:57,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand in my absence, there might have been some changes to the city ordinance and you filled me in on that just the other day, which is okay.

65
00:21:57,464 --> 00:21:59,187
[SPEAKER_07]: We could talk about that also this evening.

66
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:08,281
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will say, we understand what's going on with Homeland Security and ICE, not just in this city, but across the country.

67
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:18,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are doing our part as per ordinance and per policy to, and following Massachusetts General Law.

68
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:24,308
[SPEAKER_07]: And so far, I think we've complied with the ordinance and policy and law.

69
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:26,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm here.

70
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:27,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where you want to begin.

71
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:28,604
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's fine.

72
00:22:28,624 --> 00:22:30,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you being here.

73
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:38,068
[SPEAKER_04]: The report says that you didn't track the detainers.

74
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:44,691
[SPEAKER_04]: There were no administrative warrants received.

75
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:54,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a response to a public safety call on Route 16 West involving an ICE agent, but that went

76
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,923
[SPEAKER_04]: the police department arrived, there was no nothing to respond to.

77
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:09,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So they left that there was no information given to a federal immigration agency.

78
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:16,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are no task forces that the Medford Police Department participated in that

79
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: federal immigration agencies also participated in.

80
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:22,878
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a summary of what the report outlines.

81
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:41,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, also just to let people know, it's fine if these reports say we received no ICE detainers, we received no administrative warrants, there were no public safety calls, we did nothing with any federal immigration agencies and we participated in no task forces with immigration.

82
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,550
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

83
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:46,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, that's absolutely fine.

84
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:54,893
[SPEAKER_04]: There was actually, I'm gonna have Councilor Leming say the next thing that I was probably about to say.

85
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

86
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:58,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he has questions, great, go ahead.

87
00:23:58,296 --> 00:23:58,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't wanna.

88
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:07,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, first of all, so, so glad to have you back and a bit of a feedback.

89
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:08,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

90
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:25,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, first off, so so glad to have you back serving serving people of Medford again.

91
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:29,407
[SPEAKER_09]: And just wanted to.

92
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,526
[SPEAKER_09]: wish you wish you the best and congratulate you on your, your good health right now.

93
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:49,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so there was one part of the of the report that I did ask acting chief Kavina about, but I think it would be

94
00:24:50,242 --> 00:25:05,307
[SPEAKER_09]: good to have some of the answers discussed a little bit more publicly, which is the Medford Police Department has received some ICE detainers, but we do not know exactly how many we received.

95
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:16,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, the Police Department does not and has no way to track that information based on its available database used for local law enforcement investigations.

96
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:16,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So

97
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:38,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I also previously asked about specific arrest cases in relation to a couple of high profile arrests that the Department of Homeland Security said that Medford made.

98
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:46,507
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tried to ask the police department about that through a public records request, but it was a very,

99
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,426
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a bit of a strange process because like I had to know the exact potential date that an individual was arrested.

100
00:25:55,186 --> 00:26:04,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And otherwise I couldn't really get too much of an answer on these specific cases when constituents reached out to me.

101
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:12,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of this is a way of saying that it's my impression that the Medford Police Department might be using

102
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:23,350
[SPEAKER_09]: police database software that could be out of date or it could be that that's just the best available and police database and police.

103
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:29,034
[SPEAKER_09]: The software that you use is just not all that advanced across all police departments.

104
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:39,083
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just like, I would appreciate it if you'd be able to just talk a little bit about the software that is used to track these things and why it is

105
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:47,607
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of difficult from your perspective to, to offer those details in a report.

106
00:26:47,908 --> 00:27:04,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So it steer me if I if I go off and I'm not following what you asked me, the software is perfectly fine, right, we make, we write police reports, we respond to incidents is what we make arrests, it's docketed, it's associated with the booking and with the police report that would be associated, we can track

107
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:07,801
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, multi years it doesn't go away we have all the information.

108
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:17,831
[SPEAKER_07]: What we don't have if you said to me, I'm going to use your example ice says they have a high profile arrest in the city of Medford.

109
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't give a name.

110
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:26,459
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't give a data, we can't go in and say, we don't know how to track who was arrested and then ice.

111
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:28,036
[SPEAKER_07]: put a detainer on.

112
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:33,000
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, if you arrest Jack Buckley, there's a whole profile and an arrest docket.

113
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,485
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not indicating or marking that arrest or that booking with ICE detainer on a computer database.

114
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:45,030
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can't go into the computer database and track it by ICE detainers per se.

115
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I could track anybody who's been arrested.

116
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:48,513
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a little information.

117
00:27:52,862 --> 00:28:03,432
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you're referring to would only mean when the police department made an arrest, and then that person's in our custody and ICE files a detainer on that individual.

118
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:06,675
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't include anything that ICE is doing on their own.

119
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:13,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we don't record, we don't have any, sometimes we don't have any knowledge of them at all, of their activity.

120
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:25,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so it's, sorry, just to paraphrase what you're saying about the ice container specifically, it is recorded in some form in the database, but it's difficult to extract.

121
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:25,988
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not recorded.

122
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:26,548
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

123
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:29,069
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not recorded.

124
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:29,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's not.

125
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's not recorded at all in the database.

126
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,612
[SPEAKER_07]: We take the piece of paper.

127
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:38,273
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, please hold Jack Buckley.

128
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:42,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We inform the individual who's placed under arrest

129
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,192
[SPEAKER_07]: of the detainer, we give them a copy.

130
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:49,113
[SPEAKER_07]: They can look it over, we put it in their personal property also.

131
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:54,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we put a copy of that piece of paper in their arrest folder, it's just a manual folder.

132
00:28:54,914 --> 00:29:04,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But in our database, we are not marking that this person was wanted by ICE or immigration status as it relates to detainers.

133
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:09,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I could have the company do that, it's not beyond, but do you want that?

134
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:12,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are some of the questions.

135
00:29:12,787 --> 00:29:16,008
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to abide by an ordinance.

136
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:16,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

137
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:17,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

138
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:21,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been having some AV problems in this room lately.

139
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:22,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

140
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:28,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we have to abide by a booking process that is governed by state law, federal law.

141
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:41,267
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a city ordinance that wants us to collect certain data, but we also don't want to expose a lot of that data or to mark somebody for like, would you want me to mark individuals for their gang activity?

142
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,008
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't do that.

143
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:44,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you want me to mark somebody for their immigration status?

144
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't do that.

145
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:47,131
[SPEAKER_07]: But do we want me to mark?

146
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:50,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you put in the ordinance and you require me to do it, I can do it.

147
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:54,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't think it's in the best interest of this city or the individuals.

148
00:29:56,238 --> 00:29:58,119
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not a technology issue.

149
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:02,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that we don't want to do it.

150
00:30:02,324 --> 00:30:04,946
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to mark in that sense.

151
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:17,856
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, sorry, Councilor Leming, if I may, there is also, I mean, there are conversations that we've had in other contexts about, you know,

152
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:21,898
[SPEAKER_04]: not discriminating against residents based on immigration status.

153
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And a great way to do that is to not know somebody's immigration status.

154
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And we frequently don't.

155
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:36,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And the police department not knowing somebody's immigration status is like, you know, one of the elements of that.

156
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:39,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what is the goal?

157
00:30:42,315 --> 00:31:04,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the question we have to ask ourselves is what's the goal of us collecting this information if it's the number of arrests so we can be transparent with our residents and say there is an increased number of ICE activity in the city and we would like to hold us accountable, we would like to make sure our police department is abiding by

158
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:24,289
[SPEAKER_04]: the ordinance and things of that nature, then maybe it would be in our interest to request that the police department keep a tally and we can keep track of it in that manner and not that we are associating arrests with individuals.

159
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:31,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Also because often these arrests are of people who are citizens or people who's the thing gets thrown out after and

160
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:34,427
[SPEAKER_04]: we wouldn't want it to be tagged right away.

161
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:40,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I do see Councilor Collins hand is raised, but I'll go back to Councilor Leming first.

162
00:31:44,682 --> 00:32:02,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that does lead into a question that was on my mind in response to what you just said, which is, even if it's not recorded in a computer, is it feasible for the police department to keep a tally just for the sake of these reports on how many ICE detainers are received?

163
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:04,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's feasible.

164
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,791
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, do you want me to tally on a chart?

165
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:12,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not being facetious, I'm just like, do you want me to say, okay, one ice detainer, two ice detainers?

166
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:16,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that I would, I would actually like, I'm not kidding, I would like to see that in a report.

167
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:22,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't mean that to be funny, or I mean... No, I'm not being funny either, I think that would be a good idea.

168
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:28,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, me creating a document or a clipboard of all ice detainers, that's...

169
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:37,312
[SPEAKER_07]: We're creating public documents, but some of might argue that the simple fact that an agency faxed that to me creates a public document, right?

170
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:42,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I say, well, I gave it to the individual who the detainee was and we put it in their arrest folder.

171
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:47,860
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could give me some information, I could go into that folder and see where it is, but it is not a record we are keeping, right?

172
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not readily available in that sense.

173
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:54,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not dancing around the law here, I'm just saying what it is.

174
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:59,629
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I create a document that has all of these ICE detainees, it would be more readily available and open to public

175
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:02,371
[SPEAKER_09]: records.

176
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:14,699
[SPEAKER_09]: As one city councilor I would appreciate those records because it creates more trust in the process and in the Medford Police Department because if you have

177
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:43,470
[SPEAKER_09]: a report that says we received a few ICE detainers, nobody really knows if that means two or means 20, but if there is a quantitative amount that is tracked over time, then you could say we received zero one week, two the next week, and then suddenly if you received 30 the week after, then that is some indication to residents that something could be going on.

178
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I think

179
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:52,594
[SPEAKER_09]: What scares people about this is the lack of any sort of information.

180
00:33:53,114 --> 00:34:02,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And the detainers is one data point that would be very useful to residents to be able to keep and pay attention to.

181
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:05,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do think any sort of tally would be helpful.

182
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,000
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

183
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:16,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And both of those are able to be done, but we're talking tally, like on a chalkboard type tally, as opposed to you want the detainees put in a logbook.

184
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:21,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do both, but one creates a problem over the other.

185
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I would personally be fine with just the number.

186
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,971
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

187
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:31,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chair, can I also just add one?

188
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:31,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

189
00:34:31,894 --> 00:34:36,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just something that needs to be talked about when it comes to detainment.

190
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:45,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time there is a Homeland Security operation, they can operate independently and take somebody into custody on their own in the city of Medford.

191
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:51,875
[SPEAKER_07]: That does not, we do not get a detainer, we do not get an administrative warrant, we get probably nothing.

192
00:34:54,437 --> 00:35:06,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time an individual is placed under arrest by the Medford Police Department and we get a detainer, it does not mean that they are taken into custody by Homeland Security or ICE.

193
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not gonna say it's random, sometimes they are taken into custody, sometimes they are not.

194
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:23,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make it clear that the detainer will not mean that that individual is placed into custody, and there may be other individuals placed into custody by federal agents where we don't get a detainer.

195
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:34,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a sense, the detainers are not a direct line to arrests or not arrests.

196
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:41,686
[SPEAKER_04]: They are something like a weather forecast, like it was forecast to rain 15 of the last 30 days.

197
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:44,889
[SPEAKER_04]: But did it rain?

198
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,771
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not sure.

199
00:35:46,872 --> 00:35:48,734
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an indication of something.

200
00:35:49,475 --> 00:36:01,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something that you as the Medford Police Department would have, as opposed to not having it, because you wouldn't have the number of ICE arrests, because you're not participating in them.

201
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:02,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

202
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:09,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to publicly say that it does not necessarily represent exactly who was taken into custody in the city of Medford by Homeland Security.

203
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:14,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It is also possible that we play somebody out arrest, there's no ice detainer filed.

204
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:20,799
[SPEAKER_07]: and ICE will take them into custody outside of the police station when they're bailed.

205
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:30,311
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many different variables that I can produce certain documents, but it doesn't mean what I, I just want the public to know it doesn't mean one certain thing.

206
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:31,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really useful to know that.

207
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we should say all of the things that are true publicly.

208
00:36:35,314 --> 00:36:50,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think that in order to be as transparent as possible, it's necessary that we share the information that we can share that's not overly sensitive to an individual, because it builds trust with the people that we're trying to build trust with.

209
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:56,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I do wanna go to Councilor Collins, because she's been raising her hand lately for a long time.

210
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:57,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins, are you unmuted?

211
00:36:58,339 --> 00:36:58,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

212
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:01,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Chair Lodero, but I'm happy to be patient if you wanna finish your thought.

213
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,580
[SPEAKER_04]: you.

214
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:03,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

215
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,561
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm done.

216
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:05,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all I'm also.

217
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:06,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

218
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:07,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

219
00:37:07,863 --> 00:37:12,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, um, I just first want to say, uh, chief.

220
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:13,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good to have you back.

221
00:37:13,346 --> 00:37:14,867
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all really happy to see you.

222
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:20,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize that I can't be in the chambers tonight, but thank you for being here and just want to extend.

223
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:24,173
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to echo Councilor Leming and extending a warm welcome back.

224
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:25,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your

225
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:40,026
[SPEAKER_01]: For all of us, this is a really, really fraught and activating and painful topic.

226
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:50,295
[SPEAKER_01]: More for the households and families of people who have already been directly affected by ICE detentions, but for everybody who cares about community preservation in Medford.

227
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:52,857
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to quickly ground us in, you know,

228
00:37:57,772 --> 00:37:59,993
[SPEAKER_01]: my paraphrasing of the stakes of this conversation.

229
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:11,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we're all thinking that and we all put that in our own ways, but it just, I know that we often have to use rather clinical language when we're talking about reports like these, because that's, you know, that's what's needed.

230
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about reports, we're talking about procedures.

231
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:25,566
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to begin my remarks tonight by, you know, acknowledging that we're here because of the presence that ICE and DHS have had in our communities and communities like Medford.

232
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:37,410
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this has been ripping people out of this community, sending them into a judicial system that is often so opaque and unfair as to be, in my opinion, un-American.

233
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:45,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know, either by fact or by common sense, in a lot of cases, what ICE and DHS are doing in Medford is discriminatory and prejudicial.

234
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:49,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it's important to state that at the top.

235
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:59,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, as we're as we're having this conversation about what we can do to document and observe and try to operate in this system together.

236
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:21,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know in light of that, you know, I think that the community is unified in wanting to see, you know, the best possible collaboration between city leaders and our public safety officials to making sure that we're doing everything that we possibly can to protect our public safety in light of this pretty unprecedented vulnerability and threat.

237
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:26,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to acknowledge that before going on and to

238
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:40,799
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, dilated on what the, what we're specifically speaking to in this meeting, you know, this is, um, I think it's, I personally, I'm really grateful that we have the welcoming city ordinance on the books, um, at this point in time.

239
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:52,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we all know that the purpose of this is to be able to work better together to inform the public and to foster better trust in what our public safety departments are doing and to increase transparency.

240
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:52,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

241
00:39:54,393 --> 00:40:08,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically when it comes to this report on ice presence in Medford, um, you know, as it's no secret to anybody for months, unfortunately, community members have been looking to city leaders for at the very least information and support about getting a handle on what.

242
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:11,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Ice activity is happening in Medford.

243
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:19,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I do just want to say, I understand that there's a lot of information that Medford police department can't give us and can't give the community.

244
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:23,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not because you don't want to, but because you don't have it.

245
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand those facts, and I think that's important to underline that.

246
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:52,555
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to emphasize what my fellow Councilors are saying, and that I think it is really important for us to parse out what is the, when we're just talking about information reporting, specifically information reporting, I think it's really important for us to have a conversation about what is the information that we do have that we can share to better help the community in protecting themselves and furthering

247
00:40:54,124 --> 00:41:02,050
[SPEAKER_01]: the mutual aid efforts that are occurring in Medford and people forming these really strong networks of looking out for each other.

248
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the best way to put it.

249
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:09,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frustrating that we're all trying to protect and preserve the community in such a profoundly low information environment.

250
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that we're all frustrated by that.

251
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:21,764
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that this conversation is most important when we're talking about what is the data that we do have that we can share in safe ways

252
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:27,467
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep people better informed about what's happening.

253
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:37,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've been really frustrated and I'm sure my fellow councillors and everybody's all been really frustrated by people saying, what's going on and saying, I only know as much as you do for the most part.

254
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're probably all feeling that way.

255
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:46,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically on the data requested in the report, I think that Councilor Leming brings up a really good point.

256
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:47,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just want to agree with him.

257
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's actually,

258
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:58,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to hear that the specific data of the detainers from ICE are not retained and stored.

259
00:41:58,872 --> 00:41:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's good.

260
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:03,037
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, essentially, we're talking about data security here.

261
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:05,320
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about data security for people who are already

262
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:07,649
[SPEAKER_01]: marginalized and vulnerable.

263
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:15,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the best defense is just not having that information, which is not necessary to keep and to have and to share.

264
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:18,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that sounds like it's where we want it to be.

265
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:29,307
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that having that very simple, obviously anonymized tally of simply how many detainers Medford Police Department is receiving,

266
00:42:30,354 --> 00:42:41,563
[SPEAKER_01]: would be helpful to us, would be the kind of information that would be helpful for Councilors, helpful for city leadership, and helpful for the community to know, simply to get that kind of coarsest understanding of what are the trend lines here?

267
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:45,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Is ICE having more of a presence in our community?

268
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:49,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it lowering that magnifying glass onto Medford?

269
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:50,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Are things holding steady?

270
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the kinds of things that I think community members really need to know when they're deciding

271
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:05,056
[SPEAKER_01]: how vigilant they need to be or how much they want to step up and, you know, keep an eye out on behalf of other vulnerable members of the community.

272
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:07,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and thank you again for being here, Chief.

273
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

274
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:22,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that there's sort of a conundrum about information versus

275
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:32,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Not information, it reminds me of our the C cups ordinance where it's like the body worn cameras are such an asset to the police department because.

276
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:52,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It increases accountability, but when you bring in all of this information about residents, you know, how do you balance the need for privacy and consent with the interest in increasing accountability for a police department and just general behavior with public.

277
00:43:54,082 --> 00:43:58,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And like keeping walking that line is so important, and I think that really applies here too.

278
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:04,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So maintaining privacy, maintaining, you know, some semblance of

279
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:09,723
[SPEAKER_04]: rational, normal behavior in these circumstances is so hard.

280
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:24,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you have a great point about that and about wanting to keep people's private information private, and also share what we can share with the public about how things are moving forward.

281
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a tally is the way that we can best do it.

282
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:29,935
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also, I mean,

283
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:44,053
[SPEAKER_04]: This July, there was an arrest like eight houses away from where I live, of a pizza delivery guy that I got a phone call about.

284
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:50,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I think it was last week, Councilor Callahan might be able to confirm this for me.

285
00:44:50,575 --> 00:44:54,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was arrested in South Medford.

286
00:44:54,997 --> 00:45:02,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the ICE officer noticed that somebody was taking a video, he pulled his mask up to hide his face.

287
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:17,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think the whole scenario is there's cognitive dissonance because our role here is to be

288
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:32,493
[SPEAKER_04]: obvious in how we take care of the city and the people that live here, and to be as honest and truthful and forthright in the way that we share information with the people that ask us questions.

289
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we don't say something, it's because, and people don't always believe this, but when we don't say something, it's because it's either illegal or because we are trying to protect sensitive information

290
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:52,273
[SPEAKER_04]: about somebody that we're not at liberty to talk about often.

291
00:45:52,733 --> 00:46:13,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that as we continue to walk these tricky lines, we can continue to see the value of balancing that and continue to prioritize taking care of our residents to the best of our ability.

292
00:46:15,512 --> 00:46:19,735
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I did wanna mention, I will go to you Councilor Leming next.

293
00:46:20,176 --> 00:46:20,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that on purpose?

294
00:46:21,937 --> 00:46:23,879
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, this is just on from the last time.

295
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:24,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevermind.

296
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:33,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I did wanna mention that in July, I believe and I meant to send this to you and I'm sorry, I will find it.

297
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:42,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe it was in July, we passed an amendment to the welcoming city ordinance requesting more frequent reporting.

298
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanna follow up on that and just see if we can get more frequent than six months, but I have to clarify what we said it was gonna be.

299
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:54,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at the time, did you find it?

300
00:46:55,761 --> 00:47:08,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at the time that we put this into practice, I mean, the welcoming city ordinance was written before President Trump took office, before any of this was happening, and it came like a tidal wave so much more than we anticipated.

301
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:08,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

302
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:17,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go to Councilor Leming to clarify, but I think a more frequent reporting schedule is kind of called for, Councilor Leming.

303
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:24,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, just, sorry, I'm going back to the specific page and the minutes where it was.

304
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:28,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, so I believe this was 25.

305
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:46,485
[SPEAKER_09]: 088 where we did request weekly written reports to the council on ice activity in Medford.

306
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:56,690
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, if you go to the, I could, and again, I understand that this is buried in council minutes from June 10th, 2025 on page 39.

307
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:56,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't,

308
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:28,108
[SPEAKER_09]: don't blame anybody for maybe not not tracking this uh if there's a lack of clarity there but the but we did vote to uh request that there be weekly written reports to the council on ice activity in Medford whereas before I believe it was um according to this it was on a monthly basis so

309
00:48:29,465 --> 00:48:32,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that I'd be happy to pass it over.

310
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:35,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, it was every six months.

311
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:49,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sort of I mean, I think that it wouldn't it would not need to be this level of detail if it's weekly and could be an email to the council.

312
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:50,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

313
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:59,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we don't have to, I don't think we have to do a PDF document where somebody comes to every single council meeting.

314
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:07,404
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be, I completely agree that it could just be an informal email saying we didn't have any detainers this week, thank you.

315
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:11,166
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't have, we had one detainer this week, thank you.

316
00:49:11,346 --> 00:49:17,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that could be reported to the public in some form during a council meeting.

317
00:49:17,909 --> 00:49:18,209
[SPEAKER_09]: We are,

318
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:26,032
[SPEAKER_09]: managing to broadcast these meetings a little bit more widely these days now that we have a YouTube live streaming.

319
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:28,192
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is one way to work.

320
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:29,473
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

321
00:49:29,493 --> 00:49:30,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was in charge of that YouTube happening?

322
00:49:30,954 --> 00:49:31,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.

323
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:34,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was it was it was a lot of it was me.

324
00:49:37,137 --> 00:49:52,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I think just like a few questions answered, do you think that would be feasible or would somebody in your department be able to accomplish that, I would always fight against once a week it's adding on to it but it's feasible something we could do it have to take a look at the language.

325
00:49:53,332 --> 00:49:57,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm repeating myself I understand this, I just want everyone to understand that

326
00:49:58,337 --> 00:50:06,366
[SPEAKER_07]: A number of detainees and or administrative warrants does not indicate a number of people taken into custody by Homeland Security nor does it include things that are outside.

327
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:15,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I don't want to call it random but it's just, yes, you've already explained it so sort of a benchmark and there is a measurement there but it's, I want to just be clear that it's not

328
00:50:16,177 --> 00:50:18,478
[SPEAKER_07]: go to tell you full activity.

329
00:50:18,578 --> 00:50:18,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

330
00:50:18,938 --> 00:50:34,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And I fully expect that if somebody on somebody on the internet actually does take these numbers and puts them on a chart, then there will be people potentially misinterpreting what those numbers mean.

331
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:39,002
[SPEAKER_09]: But, and that's just, that's always part of the public conversation.

332
00:50:39,022 --> 00:50:44,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is why I do appreciate you emphasizing what the detainers really indicate.

333
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:45,124
[SPEAKER_09]: But

334
00:50:45,863 --> 00:50:53,765
[SPEAKER_09]: again, people, it is one benchmark that we do have that the Medford Police Department has the ability to report.

335
00:50:54,505 --> 00:51:11,869
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that people would be very appreciative to know what that is and to be able to track it in a quantitative manner because public data increases trust and it increases transparency.

336
00:51:12,189 --> 00:51:14,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And even if there is some potential

337
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:23,940
[SPEAKER_09]: misinterpretation of what that data may mean, that just ends up being part of the conversation about it.

338
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,341
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our job to clarify that to people.

339
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:29,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, again, caution.

340
00:51:29,342 --> 00:51:31,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with a lot of what you said.

341
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:37,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It is open, there's accountability there, all those numbers, but it also increases public records requests.

342
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:41,026
[SPEAKER_07]: It's never not in my world.

343
00:51:42,303 --> 00:51:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I just say it to you.

344
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,466
[SPEAKER_07]: These are things that I think we all have to talk about at once.

345
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:56,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to find out later on down the line, like, you should be surprised at it, because there are people on both sides of the political argument who are gonna want this done.

346
00:51:57,655 --> 00:51:59,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Understandable.

347
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here.

348
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Do any other councillors have any other questions for Chief Buckley?

349
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:13,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here Councilor Tseng I know you had another meeting.

350
00:52:16,193 --> 00:52:17,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have any other questions.

351
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:26,758
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I wanna mention, I mean, of course, is that you don't need a nice detainer if you pick somebody up out of their car on the street, it's just for somebody who's already been arrested.

352
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only indicating, right?

353
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:37,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only indicating if somebody is- It is most often only used that an administrative mark if you have somebody in custody, however, it is not necessarily needed.

354
00:52:38,963 --> 00:52:41,024
[SPEAKER_07]: If I get arrested and it's a...

355
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:46,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, like an armed robbery case, right?

356
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And I end up getting bailed.

357
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:50,309
[SPEAKER_07]: ICE can show up and just sit outside.

358
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,870
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't need to give me a detainer.

359
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,190
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not asking me to hold anyone.

360
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,011
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're not required to give me anything.

361
00:52:56,051 --> 00:53:01,692
[SPEAKER_07]: They could place that individual under custody based on federal law, federal procedure.

362
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:05,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of, that's, I guess, what my point is.

363
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:13,315
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I could give you detainers, but there are so many variables here that it's- There just aren't really that many other things we can track.

364
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:16,726
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all very nebulous.

365
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:22,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we're watching for the other stuff, we can count this.

366
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:27,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins, go ahead.

367
00:53:29,544 --> 00:53:30,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.

368
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:35,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to say, again, I really appreciate this discussion.

369
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:37,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief, I really appreciate all of this information.

370
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:41,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is productive.

371
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:48,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that getting the, again, the very high level tally of detainers will help.

372
00:53:50,172 --> 00:53:54,074
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very small compared to the scope of what we're talking about, but it's something.

373
00:53:54,114 --> 00:54:15,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, you know, coupled with that, I appreciate the context that you've shared about how imperfect this information is and the disclaimers about how this really can't be extrapolated accurately to shine a light on how many other people are being picked up by ICE and DHS who don't have detainers and how many, you know,

374
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:20,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Detainers that after which a detention doesn't follow and all of those other caveats.

375
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the clarity around that.

376
00:54:23,788 --> 00:54:35,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, you know, I think that it's positive for us to have this high level anonymized tally and know everything that it doesn't say to us at the same time.

377
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:36,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is

378
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:39,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is something.

379
00:54:39,778 --> 00:55:01,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I just want to give voice to, you know, at least as one Councilor and as one resident, my frustration that dealing with the encroachment, often illegal encroachment of ICE and DHS into our community and how frustrating it is to have so few tools to do what feels like appropriately protecting our neighbors against these agents.

380
00:55:02,396 --> 00:55:04,918
[SPEAKER_01]: It does kind of feel like trying to build a house out of toothpicks.

381
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:06,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that that's important to say.

382
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:23,169
[SPEAKER_01]: and anything that we can be doing on the city side to empower ourselves and use every tool at our disposal and empower our neighbors to keep themselves safe and to keep their neighbors safe, I think that we should be doing.

383
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,511
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one small part of that.

384
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:26,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

385
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:30,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

386
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:33,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other comments from Councilors?

387
00:55:34,056 --> 00:55:35,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming, is your mic just on?

388
00:55:36,743 --> 00:55:37,303
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just on.

389
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:37,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

390
00:55:37,883 --> 00:55:38,803
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go ahead and turn that off.

391
00:55:39,584 --> 00:55:40,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

392
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:48,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, thank you so much, Chief, and I will open the floor for public comment if anybody has anything they would like to say about this paper.

393
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:51,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you can have it.

394
00:55:51,246 --> 00:55:52,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can.

395
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, seeing none.

396
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any motions?

397
00:56:01,008 --> 00:56:02,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Councilor Collins.

398
00:56:02,248 --> 00:56:04,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, go ahead.

399
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:06,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I would motion to keep the paper in committee.

400
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:09,770
[SPEAKER_04]: on the motion pending any.

401
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:11,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

402
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:15,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I was just gonna say pending any further comment by members of the community or councilors.

403
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:16,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I would motion to keep the paper in committee.

404
00:56:18,217 --> 00:56:19,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, understood.

405
00:56:19,357 --> 00:56:21,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Any, do we have a second?

406
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:25,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

407
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:30,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to come?

408
00:56:30,566 --> 00:56:31,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

409
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:33,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Paulette Vartabedian, Central Lab, Medford.

410
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Paulette Vartabedian, Central Lab Medford.

411
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:42,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you explain exactly what a detainer is?

412
00:56:43,409 --> 00:56:59,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And second question, if ICE goes, like if someone's walking down the street and they suspect that this person is illegal for whatever reason, and they pick this person up, does that person have to tell them their name?

413
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:05,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief Buckley, would you mind?

414
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

415
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:13,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me give this a shot.

416
00:57:16,312 --> 00:57:16,452
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

417
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:24,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not sometimes fully comprehend how the federal government and federal law enforcement works.

418
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:26,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if they're following any of these rules.

419
00:57:26,994 --> 00:57:28,995
[SPEAKER_07]: So a detainer is nothing but a piece of paper.

420
00:57:29,215 --> 00:57:35,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And it simply will just say to a law enforcement agency, or they could send it to a court for safety.

421
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,401
[SPEAKER_07]: You have Jack Buckley in your custody.

422
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:41,123
[SPEAKER_07]: We want you to hold them until we arrive.

423
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:45,245
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, just a piece of paper telling us to detain them.

424
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:46,947
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a civil order.

425
00:57:47,887 --> 00:58:01,396
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has already ruled with their mass Supreme courts that we do not have to abide by that because it's called something called a one decision and that they have to be subjected to bail and let free if they're open for bail, that sort of thing.

426
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really is just a piece of paper saying, hey, can you hold this individual?

427
00:58:09,618 --> 00:58:14,862
[SPEAKER_07]: from a federal agency to a city, in this case, it would be a city agency, yes.

428
00:58:15,443 --> 00:58:21,528
[SPEAKER_07]: For the individual, we just notify the individual and give them a copy to tell them that this is, there is a detainer placed on you.

429
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:29,374
[SPEAKER_07]: That no, only if we have them in our custody.

430
00:58:30,696 --> 00:58:38,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so in other words, if they've been placed under arrest by the Medford police department, if they're just, if there's an individual just walking down the street,

431
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:42,475
[SPEAKER_07]: we will have no involvement in their immigration status or their immigration custody.

432
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:52,358
[SPEAKER_07]: If Homeland Security decides that they are looking for an individual and they suspect it's me and I'm walking down the street, they can interact with that individual.

433
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:59,620
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not have to file a detainer or an administrative warrant with the police department or the jurisdiction.

434
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:08,042
[SPEAKER_07]: They're operating on federal authority and they can take that individual into custody if they need to, if they believe there's a reason to.

435
00:59:09,404 --> 00:59:15,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen anything, and this is going back in the years, but they could fingerprint them right on scene to know who they are, et cetera.

436
00:59:16,609 --> 00:59:23,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I mostly answered the question, but there's always gonna be variables that I just don't know their procedures, especially now.

437
00:59:24,733 --> 00:59:26,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

438
00:59:26,154 --> 00:59:26,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

439
00:59:31,037 --> 00:59:31,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.

440
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:34,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I appreciate the chief speaking to that.

441
00:59:34,299 --> 00:59:35,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that

442
00:59:36,376 --> 00:59:48,949
[SPEAKER_01]: just in response to the question that was asked by the resident, I think it's just important to use these public forums to share, just use yet another platform for people's basic constitutional rights when they're engaging with ICE.

443
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:57,097
[SPEAKER_01]: If they come to your door, every person has the constitutional right to not open the door, to not answer any questions.

444
00:59:58,077 --> 01:00:05,280
[SPEAKER_01]: and to not sign anything that is given to them and the right to speak with a lawyer before engaging further.

445
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:14,123
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of groups and also from my fellow Councilors who have been really instrumental in disseminating know your rights information like this throughout the community.

446
01:00:14,763 --> 01:00:16,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just, I appreciate the question.

447
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:26,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great opportunity to just continue repeating everybody's, regardless of immigration status, constitutional rights when engaging with ICE or DHS.

448
01:00:26,287 --> 01:00:26,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

449
01:00:28,568 --> 01:00:29,049
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

450
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:32,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunately doesn't apply when you're outside.

451
01:00:33,012 --> 01:00:38,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we've seen abductions outside with some frequency.

452
01:00:38,756 --> 01:00:40,558
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened to Ramesa Ozturk.

453
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:41,899
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened last week.

454
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,241
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened in July.

455
01:00:46,694 --> 01:00:48,875
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of the things we've been talking about today.

456
01:00:50,075 --> 01:00:55,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I see one more public comment on zoom, I will go to Micah, I'm going to ask you to unmute and you can.

457
01:00:57,238 --> 01:00:59,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, actually, Micah, just one second.

458
01:01:00,879 --> 01:01:01,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Levee.

459
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

460
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:19,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would also point out that on Councilor Callahan's desk, she's not present at the moment, but Councilor Tseng, there's a pile of red cards right there, if you'd be so kind to grab one for the camera.

461
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:29,939
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was involved in a campaign to distribute some of those to the community, trying to reach out to

462
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,761
[SPEAKER_09]: churches, nonprofits, etc.

463
01:01:33,242 --> 01:01:43,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And the issue is that technically, in response to Paulette's question, technically, if you are detained even outside, you don't have to say anything.

464
01:01:43,149 --> 01:01:44,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody has the right to remain silent.

465
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:54,538
[SPEAKER_09]: But the reality is that many folks, especially non-citizens, if they are detained, it's a very traumatic experience for them.

466
01:01:54,618 --> 01:01:56,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Oftentimes, they are

467
01:01:56,419 --> 01:01:58,161
[SPEAKER_09]: panic, they don't really know their rights.

468
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:19,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's part of this campaign was to encourage any non citizens visa holders to carry around these cards, which say, they say in English on one side, I do not wish to speak with you answer your questions or sign or hand you any documents based on my Fifth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.

469
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:31,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not give you permission to enter my home based on my Fourth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution unless you have a warrant to enter signed by a judge or magistrate with my name on it that you slide under the door.

470
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:36,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not give you my permission to search any of my belongings based on my Fourth Amendment rights.

471
01:02:36,611 --> 01:02:38,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I choose to exercise my constitutional rights.

472
01:02:39,014 --> 01:02:42,016
[SPEAKER_09]: These cards are available to citizens and non-citizens alike.

473
01:02:43,075 --> 01:02:54,707
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the other side, usually translated into another language, it says, and these are instructions to the cardholders themselves, do not open the door if an immigration agent is knocking on the door.

474
01:02:55,228 --> 01:02:57,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not answer any questions from an immigration agent.

475
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,653
[SPEAKER_09]: If they try to talk to you, you have the right to remain silent.

476
01:03:00,973 --> 01:03:03,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not sign anything without first speaking to a lawyer.

477
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,557
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the right to speak with a lawyer.

478
01:03:05,697 --> 01:03:09,780
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are outside of your home, ask the agent if you are free to leave.

479
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:11,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they say yes, leave calmly.

480
01:03:12,142 --> 01:03:13,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Give this card to the agent.

481
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:17,727
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are inside of your home, show the card through the window or slide it under the door.

482
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:20,129
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is an explanation of

483
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:28,275
[SPEAKER_09]: the rights of any citizens and non-citizens that may encounter an immigration agent.

484
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:31,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

485
01:03:31,118 --> 01:03:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go to Mr. Kesselman.

486
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:37,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a visitor.

487
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:39,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

488
01:03:40,505 --> 01:03:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please, Micah.

489
01:03:42,546 --> 01:03:43,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the timing.

490
01:03:46,249 --> 01:03:46,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

491
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:47,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

492
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street,

493
01:03:51,502 --> 01:04:02,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I do intend to read in some aggregated statistical data that certain citizen resident groups have.

494
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:03,910
[SPEAKER_02]: You can turn off your camera if you want.

495
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,291
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

496
01:04:06,831 --> 01:04:11,654
[SPEAKER_02]: That certain resident groups have put together.

497
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:16,677
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did want to ask a few questions for some clarifications first.

498
01:04:19,428 --> 01:04:21,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Odenski, say hi, and then I have to speak.

499
01:04:21,209 --> 01:04:22,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

500
01:04:23,571 --> 01:04:24,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

501
01:04:24,912 --> 01:04:25,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You're famous.

502
01:04:25,472 --> 01:04:27,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a city council speaker now.

503
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.

504
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Stand up.

505
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:30,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak up.

506
01:04:30,776 --> 01:04:31,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

507
01:04:31,637 --> 01:04:33,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Speak up, guys.

508
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:44,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So, first off, Chief Buckley, I'm happy to see you return healthy and hail and tackling this head on.

509
01:04:46,214 --> 01:04:54,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there's many residents in Medford that can't say the same for themselves right now.

510
01:04:55,623 --> 01:05:11,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would appreciate, I think many of the public would appreciate is what is the line that enables a lawful arrest and distinguishes it from

511
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:17,045
[SPEAKER_02]: an illegal, an illegal abduction.

512
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:33,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my understanding is that, and this is settled by, settled by, well settled by courts, that for DHS agents to arrest someone, they need one of three things.

513
01:05:33,873 --> 01:05:39,476
[SPEAKER_02]: They either need a judicial order, an administrative order, or

514
01:05:41,779 --> 01:05:50,547
[SPEAKER_02]: an articulable and reasonable fear that were they not to arrest this specific person, they would be a flight risk.

515
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:56,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But that does not seem to be what is currently being enforced.

516
01:05:57,393 --> 01:06:04,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And from my understanding, if they don't have any of those things, it is without question an illegal arrest.

517
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly I think you would agree that

518
01:06:09,287 --> 01:06:13,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Federal agents aren't immune from all basic laws.

519
01:06:14,473 --> 01:06:17,036
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't go in and steal a car.

520
01:06:17,396 --> 01:06:21,000
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't go in and shoot someone arbitrarily.

521
01:06:23,735 --> 01:06:41,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be helpful if the MPD were to give some guidance of what they consider to be the delta between what is something that they can, under the law, protect residents from versus where their hands are tied.

522
01:06:43,072 --> 01:06:43,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

523
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:48,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

524
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:50,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other public comments?

525
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:55,491
[SPEAKER_04]: One more, okay.

526
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:59,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on up to the podium and you can state your name and address for the record, please.

527
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:00,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

528
01:07:00,954 --> 01:07:03,135
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pull it down in front of you.

529
01:07:03,275 --> 01:07:04,596
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole mic stand.

530
01:07:04,957 --> 01:07:05,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm okay.

531
01:07:05,837 --> 01:07:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you're good.

532
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:08,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Patty Thibault.

533
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:10,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 168 Ashcroft Road.

534
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a Medford resident for over 30 years.

535
01:07:15,143 --> 01:07:18,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate what the city council and Chief Buckley are doing here tonight.

536
01:07:20,346 --> 01:07:21,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Since May,

537
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been going to the ICE headquarters in Burlington every week, and every week we hear stories of people being detained and abducted.

538
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:42,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And then often we hear that they've had follow-up with lawyers, people are helping them get out of detention.

539
01:07:42,778 --> 01:07:50,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess I'm just, I'm a little befuddled that here in Medford, we don't even have a way to track those people.

540
01:07:52,920 --> 01:08:04,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley has said there's these detainment orders, but once you let someone go, if someone's in the parking lot and ICE takes them, there's no way to track that.

541
01:08:04,327 --> 01:08:11,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, can't somebody see it and then say, hey, we've just had a resident taken by ICE in our parking lot.

542
01:08:12,112 --> 01:08:16,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there no way for citizens to call and say my neighbor's been taken?

543
01:08:18,216 --> 01:08:21,958
[SPEAKER_06]: There's gotta be some way to track this information, don't you think?

544
01:08:23,692 --> 01:08:25,452
[SPEAKER_06]: other than just these orders?

545
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is there someplace we can call?

546
01:08:28,393 --> 01:08:41,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there no way of knowing whether high school students are being taken, if they're showing up in North Medford or South Medford, so that we as citizens can stand up and help them?

547
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:46,158
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it, thank you.

548
01:08:47,078 --> 01:08:48,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your comment.

549
01:08:48,599 --> 01:08:52,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just reiterate what I said at the beginning of the meeting, which is that

550
01:08:54,590 --> 01:09:00,172
[SPEAKER_04]: There are different roles for different members of different bodies in the city.

551
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:06,093
[SPEAKER_04]: As the city council, we are public facing.

552
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:13,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We can serve in certain capacities.

553
01:09:14,335 --> 01:09:17,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Police Department can also serve in certain capacities.

554
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:21,597
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also mutual aid organizations that are a great way to

555
01:09:23,491 --> 01:09:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: work together with people to come together and help when you might see something happening that you wanna help with.

556
01:09:34,235 --> 01:09:36,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford City Council can't really do that.

557
01:09:37,656 --> 01:09:41,138
[SPEAKER_04]: But other people in town can and are doing that.

558
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:50,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a couple of people with their hands raised on Zoom that I'm gonna call on now to make public comment.

559
01:09:51,642 --> 01:09:52,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one moment.

560
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Ellen, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

561
01:09:57,398 --> 01:09:57,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

562
01:10:00,183 --> 01:10:01,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Ellen, you're already unmuted.

563
01:10:01,446 --> 01:10:01,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Ellen, go ahead.

564
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:07,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street, Medford.

565
01:10:08,419 --> 01:10:10,720
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a question for Chief Buckley.

566
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:22,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I understood you to say that an ICE detainer doesn't necessarily equal an ICE arrest.

567
01:10:24,123 --> 01:10:41,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to understand more about what happens when you detain someone under an ICE detainer and presumably ICE comes to the police station and then they may or may not take that person away.

568
01:10:41,313 --> 01:10:46,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly.

569
01:10:46,736 --> 01:10:49,057
[SPEAKER_04]: A form is faxed.

570
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:52,687
[SPEAKER_04]: is my understanding.

571
01:10:53,488 --> 01:11:06,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Form is faxed, but that's what a detainer means is that ICE wants the police department to hold that person so that ICE can come and arrest.

572
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:12,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, arrest the person that's already been held for a separate reason.

573
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:20,595
[SPEAKER_05]: But the chief seemed to say that an ICE detainer does not necessarily equal an ICE arrest.

574
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:23,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I don't understand that.

575
01:11:25,539 --> 01:11:29,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe I misunderstood what the chief was saying.

576
01:11:29,242 --> 01:11:33,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go ahead.

577
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:42,032
[SPEAKER_07]: When we arrest somebody under state law,

578
01:11:43,816 --> 01:11:44,776
[SPEAKER_07]: up for a state charge.

579
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:58,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We fingerprint them and that information goes filed and somewhere on California Homeland Security gathers up the information and will send a nice detainer to any police agency across the country on that individual.

580
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:04,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting that piece of paper in Massachusetts, the piece of paper does tell us to hold them and detain them.

581
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,381
[SPEAKER_07]: We in the Massachusetts law do not have that authority to do so.

582
01:12:09,501 --> 01:12:10,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And so

583
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:16,778
[SPEAKER_07]: We give them a copy, we put a copy in a folder, we process them normally, if they're subject to bail, they're released.

584
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:24,923
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone from Homeland Security does not show up, they're not arrested on that detainer, they're not held on that detainer.

585
01:12:25,363 --> 01:12:28,285
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not come out for every single arrest where there's a detainer.

586
01:12:29,406 --> 01:12:39,232
[SPEAKER_07]: If they do show up, they're not allowed, we don't have them come in the station and we don't assist them, they wait outside and they process, they arrest the individual and they come out.

587
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:47,285
[SPEAKER_07]: but also they do not have to file a detainer and they could show up and wait for that individual to be released from the police department.

588
01:12:47,305 --> 01:12:58,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, again, it kind of goes back, it's a little bit, there's so many different variables, but yes, filing a detainer doesn't always mean that an individual is placed into custody by Homeland Security.

589
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:02,530
[SPEAKER_07]: They may be, they may never show up.

590
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:03,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

591
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:03,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

592
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:06,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan.

593
01:13:07,271 --> 01:13:09,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna go to Anna Meyer.

594
01:13:10,618 --> 01:13:11,879
[SPEAKER_04]: name and address for the record.

595
01:13:13,581 --> 01:13:13,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

596
01:13:14,001 --> 01:13:16,063
[SPEAKER_00]: And apologies, I'm getting over a cold.

597
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:17,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep this super brief.

598
01:13:18,346 --> 01:13:20,408
[SPEAKER_00]: But Anna Meyer, 6 Douglas Road.

599
01:13:21,288 --> 01:13:24,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to start by voicing my appreciation for

600
01:13:25,645 --> 01:13:38,630
[SPEAKER_00]: City Councilors who I know are doing everything within their power to protect our neighbors, and I know one of many community members that's been deeply distraught by the effect that these abductions have had on families in Medford.

601
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:46,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope this is an appropriate place to say, but I just heard someone asking about other resources and

602
01:13:48,355 --> 01:14:01,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're talking about other mutual aid groups, so I would just take a second to plug that there is a hotline called Luce, and it's a great place to call if you think you have seen ICE or know anyone who needs any support.

603
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:05,746
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number is 617-370-5023, or can also be found on their website, lucemass.org.

604
01:14:05,806 --> 01:14:06,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

605
01:14:06,546 --> 01:14:07,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

606
01:14:17,392 --> 01:14:20,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Micah, I'll go back to you for one more minute.

607
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:23,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, OK.

608
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:37,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to just sort of read in some of the statistics, aggregated data that we're seeing in the city among resident action groups.

609
01:14:40,197 --> 01:14:45,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So try and figure, fit this into a minute, but I

610
01:14:48,335 --> 01:15:09,990
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in aggregate, in the last six months, you know, we have seen that have been reported to us, as many as eight, I'm just going to call them abductions because frankly, they're infringements of their abductions by ICE.

611
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:11,912
[SPEAKER_02]: We have received

612
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:29,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I at least 33 reports of incidents in the city and throughout and have verified a number of them, a number of them have not been verified.

613
01:15:30,843 --> 01:15:39,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some have been confirmed to not actually be ICE, in fact, but many others, most of the rest have been ICE.

614
01:15:40,685 --> 01:15:44,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is to say that, you know, this is a lot of work.

615
01:15:47,086 --> 01:15:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of work and data collection and assistance that people are doing in this city to help their neighbors, which is great and laudable, but it's on

616
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:03,249
[SPEAKER_02]: their own time while they're living their lives.

617
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:13,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really hard to hear sometimes the call to just let

618
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:21,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Neighbors keep doing this, right?

619
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, it is the city's role.

620
01:16:25,492 --> 01:16:27,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the police department's role.

621
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:39,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It is our various resources role to keep residents safe, keep them healthy and hale and secure in their physical wellbeing.

622
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:47,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can't just be shuffled off to concerned neighbors.

623
01:16:49,828 --> 01:17:02,021
[SPEAKER_02]: would that we could all devote all of our time to that, but we also have to, you know, do our own other jobs, too, at the same time, which is like, so I just wanted to point that out.

624
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:05,745
[SPEAKER_02]: One more observation, though, from the aggregated data.

625
01:17:06,165 --> 01:17:08,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So, starting in May,

626
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,683
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a number, about 20% of the incidents went unverified.

627
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:20,869
[SPEAKER_02]: When an event is unverified, that means that just no one could be sent out to confirm and gather information.

628
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the most recent couple of months, no events have gone unverified.

629
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:33,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is that

630
01:17:36,213 --> 01:17:37,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting more and more organized.

631
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:50,879
[SPEAKER_02]: We're more and more able to actually get people out and get this information and confirm or disconfirm whether or not something actually happened and whether or not someone is in need of assistance.

632
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It just goes to show that the need is still there.

633
01:17:58,198 --> 01:18:00,080
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of pressure to do this.

634
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it at that.

635
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:17,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I've submitted this information in a document form to this committee, so you can review it when you're able to on your own time.

636
01:18:17,934 --> 01:18:19,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to answer any questions, too, about it.

637
01:18:19,816 --> 01:18:22,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

638
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:28,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, go ahead, Paulette.

639
01:18:29,086 --> 01:18:29,506
[SPEAKER_03]: One more minute.

640
01:18:29,826 --> 01:18:31,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

641
01:18:31,727 --> 01:18:31,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

642
01:18:33,428 --> 01:18:35,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Paulette Radovidian, Central Lab Method.

643
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:38,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you repeat that number that that woman gave?

644
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,393
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, I actually have, I have cards.

645
01:18:41,533 --> 01:18:42,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I can give you a card at the end of the meeting.

646
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:43,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great, thank you.

647
01:18:46,656 --> 01:18:52,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing no further public comment, is there anything else from Councilors?

648
01:18:53,905 --> 01:18:56,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Are any further, oh, actually, you know what?

649
01:18:56,346 --> 01:19:00,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do a roll call vote on Councilor Collins' motion.

650
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:03,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

651
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:06,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, can you repeat the motion?

652
01:19:09,273 --> 01:19:10,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Anna, yes.

653
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:11,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, Councilor Callahan, what was that?

654
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:13,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you repeat the motion?

655
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:14,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you repeat the motion?

656
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:14,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

657
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:17,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, can you read it out?

658
01:19:18,957 --> 01:19:25,561
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion was from Vice President Collins to keep the paper and committee seconded by Councilor Levin.

659
01:19:31,685 --> 01:19:33,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan, did you hear that?

660
01:19:34,827 --> 01:19:35,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

661
01:19:35,107 --> 01:19:35,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

662
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:41,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan?

663
01:19:41,771 --> 01:19:42,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

664
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:44,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

665
01:19:45,734 --> 01:19:45,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

666
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:48,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

667
01:19:49,382 --> 01:19:50,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

668
01:19:51,563 --> 01:19:52,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

669
01:19:52,423 --> 01:19:52,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

670
01:19:53,943 --> 01:19:54,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair Lazzaro.

671
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:55,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

672
01:19:56,964 --> 01:19:58,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Five.

673
01:19:59,285 --> 01:20:01,345
[SPEAKER_04]: None in the negative, the motion passes.

674
01:20:07,787 --> 01:20:11,487
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

675
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:13,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?
