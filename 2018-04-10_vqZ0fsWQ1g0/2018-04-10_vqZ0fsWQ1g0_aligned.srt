1
00:00:01,145 --> 00:00:04,748
Please forgive me if I stumble on some motions or the verbiage.

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:09,011
Mr. Rousseau did try to get me a cheat sheet of Robert's Rules of Rights.

3
00:00:09,231 --> 00:00:11,813
We couldn't find it.

4
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:15,356
So, let's stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, please.

5
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:29,968
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

6
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:37,916
So first is the approval of minutes of the March 19, 2018 meeting.

7
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:40,958
Roll call vote.

8
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:42,019

So six present.

27
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:10,060
which is the item number one.

00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,229

32
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:22,497

33
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:23,038
Yes.

34
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:24,518
Mrs. Kretz?

35
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:24,878
Yes.

36
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:25,778
Mrs. McStone?

37
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:26,159
Yes.

38
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:27,399
Mr. Ruggiero?

39
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:27,659
Yes.

40
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:28,960
Mr. Russo?

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,320
Yes.

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,680
Mrs. Vanderkoop?

43
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,060
Yes.

44
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,981
Mayor Burke?

45
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:32,621
Absent.

46
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:34,682
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

47
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,062
I just did have one comment.

48
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:48,026
I did notice that there was a request for a report of who will be in charge of monitoring and keeping the online PTO, PTG friends of organizations.

49
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:49,907
Like who in the administration?

50
00:01:51,216 --> 00:02:03,409
You're going to, just on a report list, on the back of the report list, during our meeting last time, we asked that someone be assigned

51
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:12,484
the role of implementing or overseeing the PTO, PTG, new online thing.

52
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:17,488
Like who an administration or what administrative assistant or executive assistant.

53
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:18,829
We'll have an answer for you very soon.

54
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:23,212
Yeah, so I just wanted you to add it to the report list so that way we don't forget.

55
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:25,674
Not that I forget anything.

56
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:28,936
Who will be the administrator overseeing the PTO page?

57
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:29,337
Yes.

58
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,591
It's the website page that organizations will be starting in October.

59
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:38,013
So that was the only thing I saw from the minutes.

60
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:39,034
Thank you.

61
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:43,596
Next is the approval of bills and transfer funds.

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,937
Motion for approval?

63
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:45,497
Motion.

64
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:45,837
Second.

65
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:46,658
Second.

66
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:47,658
A roll call vote.

67
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,519
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

68
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,300
Yes.

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,381
Mrs. Kretz?

70
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:51,741
Yes.

71
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:52,761
Mrs. McStone?

72
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:53,182
Yes.

73
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:54,222
Mr. Ruggiero?

74
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:54,522
Yes.

75
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:55,623
Mr. Russo?

76
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:56,023
Yes.

77
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:57,204
Mrs. Vandiver?

78
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:57,624
Yes.

79
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:58,384
Mayor Burke?

80
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:58,985
Passed.

81
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,180
Six, yes, one absent.

82
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,421
Next is the approval of payrolls.

83
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:06,801
Motion of approval?

84
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:08,501
Second.

85
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:11,802
Wait, can I just, I'm sorry, my papers are out of order.

86
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:12,902
Can we go back to bills?

87
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:14,763
I did have one question on the bills.

88
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:17,443
On page, I don't know if Ms.

89
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:19,304
Patterson has a moment.

90
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:27,425
On page nine of 14, there is a, it says trustees of Boston College for $15,000.

91
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,226
It says Nellie Mae Foundation unclassified.

92
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:32,643
I just don't know what that is.

93
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:34,044
I don't think I've seen it before.

94
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:34,785
That's correct.

95
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:43,053
It was a one-time award last fall for Tim Klein as he received the award through the Nellie Mae Foundation.

96
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:52,962
And the program and partnership that he worked with for the purchase and services for that award was the trustees of Boston College.

97
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:55,498
So he received $15,000?

98
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:01,782
The school district received $15,000 on behalf of his award for teacher leadership.

99
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:05,584
That was presented and approved at the school committee meeting in October.

100
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:11,408
We received the funds, and they were in turn paid out to the organization that he partnered with.

101
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:17,153
Oh, so the Nellie Mae Foundation is who he partnered with?

102
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:21,555
No, Boston Public, the vendor that issued the payment.

103
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:26,037
Nellie Mae Foundation awarded the funds initially.

104
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:36,265
Yeah, I know that Boston College got the $15,000.

105
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,626
What was that?

106
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:38,126
How did that?

107
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:38,987
What was it about?

108
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:39,467
Could you just?

109
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:47,894
That was that Empower program where they were having kids do more things to help the kids who were not doing as well to get some additional assistance.

110
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:50,756
OK, so he won this award, won $15,000.

111
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:57,761
He used that to have Boston College come in and do a program with our students, and this is just the payment for it.

112
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:58,241
OK.

113
00:04:59,142 --> 00:04:59,542
Thank you.

114
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:01,643
I'd just like to get the whole story.

115
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:02,303
Thank you.

116
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,204
So now on to approval of payrolls.

117
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:06,904
Motion to approve.

118
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:07,104
Second.

119
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,205
Second.

120
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:09,905
Roll call vote.

121
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:10,305
Yes.

122
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,287
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

123
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:16,727
Yes.

124
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,007
Mrs. Kretz.

125
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:18,428
Yes.

126
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:19,728
Mrs. Mastone.

127
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:20,128
Yes.

128
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:21,308
Mr. Ruggiero.

129
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:21,568
Yes.

130
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:22,809
Mr. Russo.

131
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:23,129
Yes.

132
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:24,629
Mrs. Van de Kloot.

133
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:25,009
Yes.

134
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:25,890
Mayor Burke.

135
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,610
Absent.

136
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:26,950
Absent.

137
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:29,812
Six yes, one absent.

138
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:30,032
Yes.

139
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,014
Next is the report of the secretary.

140
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:33,514
Ms.

141
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:33,854
Pretz?

142
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:34,355
Yes.

143
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:37,237
So I have two reports this week.

144
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:42,920
The first report is regarding the Medford Malden Lodge of Elks scholarships.

145
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:52,287
On Sunday, March 18, the Medford Malden Lodge of Elks held its 34th annual 2018-19 scholarship award ceremony.

146
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:57,110
A total of 15 high school seniors from various local high schools

147
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:08,439
including Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School, Andover High School, Malden High School, Matanon, and Arlington Catholic were awarded a $500 scholarship.

148
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:15,962
The students who received these awards were honored for their exceptional academic achievement and their commitment to community support.

149
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:21,784
The ceremony began with a breakfast for all invited guests, their families, and friends.

150
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:26,126
The award ceremony included a brief summary of each recipient's essay

151
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:29,605
and a mention from their guidance counselors, recommendation letter.

152
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:38,691
Each recipient received a framed certificate proudly presented by Medford Malden Elks, BPOE number 1915.

153
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:49,958
Many thanks to the Lodge Scholarship Committee for their 34 years of continued commitment to students at Medford High School in various local high schools within the area.

154
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:56,342
The Lodge Committee Elks members present were Warren Costa, Lawrence Murphy, Paul Herbert,

155
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:57,820
and Mary Fitzgerald.

156
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:19,632
It was a wonderful event that I was invited to, and I was very happy to share this information, and I actually contacted the paper, and they put the picture of the students in the paper, and this award ceremony, we'll get to hear the names of the students who were awarded their certificates.

157
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:25,415
So I currently don't have their names, but they will be released once the awards come out in May.

158
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,728
Thank you.

159
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:27,568
Thank you very much.

160
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,209
The Mifflin Baldwin Lodge of Elks.

161
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,330
Really appreciate it.

162
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,153
Um, now report on March vouchers.

163
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:34,954
Yes.

164
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:41,999
So I have a report to share with the committee regarding the, um, probably like the expenditures for the month of March.

165
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,064
I signed up on the typical invoices related to heating, electricity, and pupil transportation.

166
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:52,107
Also, there were some miscellaneous invoices, including violin repairs,

167
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:58,222
interpreter invoices, and an invoice from the MASC for the Summit of Poverty, which Mr. Russo attended.

168
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:02,945
Also highlights from the March 23rd bill.

169
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:09,829
So what I like to do is I like to kind of find something that might be interesting and I kind of pick it out of the invoices and do a little write up on it.

170
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:16,073
So I signed up on a payment to Essex North Shore Agricultural Technical High School

171
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:19,305
in the amount of $35,295.

172
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:23,509
Currently, there are four students enrolled in Essex Aggie.

173
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:27,712
Two students are enrolled in horticulture, and they are in grades 10 and 12.

174
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:32,857
One student is enrolled in environmental science and technology, grade 11.

175
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:37,060
And one student is enrolled in animal science, grade 11.

176
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:42,745
Then the week of March 30th, I signed off on four invoices, totaling $15,646.

177
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,542
for Ronald C. Boyer, who was electrical fire alarms.

178
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:58,087
And what they did was they worked on Bistro 489 to download new fire alarm system software to eliminate invalid reports.

179
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,068
The invoice was $3,050.

180
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:06,272
There was also work done to connect a new sprinkler system in the cafe to the fire alarm system for $2,806.

181
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:15,217
There was also work at the Bistro to relocate the fire alarm pull stations in Horn Strobe for new floor plans.

182
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,200
The invoice was $550.

183
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,061
And then there was a third final payment from an invoice of $28,000.

184
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:30,023
Work performed to install the new fire alarm circuit and replace existing devices in the new vocational bistro.

185
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:31,983
And that was dated March 5.

186
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:37,404
And so the final payment for that was the $9,240.

187
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:42,765
So that was just a summary of some highlights from the month of March.

188
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:44,422
Thank you, Ms.

189
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:44,902
Kretz.

190
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:47,023
Ms.

191
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:48,343
van de Kloot and then Ms.

192
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:48,843
DiBenedetto.

193
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:53,764
Yes, I just want to thank Mrs. Kretz for that report and the interesting way she's presenting to us.

194
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:54,204
That's great.

195
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:55,264
Yep, you're welcome.

196
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:56,125
Ms.

197
00:09:56,185 --> 00:09:57,205
DiBenedetto.

198
00:09:57,565 --> 00:10:02,386
Kathy, I like these reports because they bring out some questions I'd like to ask the superintendent.

199
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:05,106
OK.

200
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:12,508
So I'd like an update on the cafe and when it's opening, the bistro, rather, the bistro.

201
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:14,159
So use the cafe.

202
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,620
Bistro 489.

203
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,522
Where are we with that?

204
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:22,807
And when can people go up there and have lunch and hang out on the deck?

205
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:25,370
Want to answer that?

206
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:25,430
OK.

207
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,979
So Bistro 489 is well on its way.

208
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,861
There are a few more things that have to happen.

209
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,364
There are some parts that were not immediately available.

210
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:42,450
We're also adjusting the bathroom for security reasons so you can go directly from the bistro into the bathroom rather than going into the corridor.

211
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:46,934
There have been a couple of events up there, but we're very close.

212
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:54,120
And I believe that this Friday, I want to make a tentative announcement, but this Friday prior to the marathon,

213
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:03,884
The Crystal Campbell Foundation will probably have some event there Friday morning, and I'll give you information about that tomorrow when I get that straightened away.

214
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:08,346
So it's operational to a degree, but full operation probably another week or so.

215
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:11,888
Thank you for the update.

216
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:13,788
Okay.

217
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:14,469
Mr. Roussell?

218
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:15,869
Yeah, Mr. Roussell.

219
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:21,752
Has the issue with the prep table been resolved at this point?

220
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:22,152
I'm sorry?

221
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:23,212
Has the prep table arrived?

222
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:23,473
Yes.

223
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,669
Any other questions on the Secretary's report?

224
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,470
A motion to accept?

225
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,410
Motion to accept both reports and place them on file.

226
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:36,311
Second.

227
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:37,591
A roll call vote?

228
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:38,172
Yes.

229
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:39,352
Seconded.

230
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:40,892
Mrs. DiBenedettino?

231
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:41,192
Yes.

232
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,273
Mrs. Kretz?

233
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:42,513
Yes.

234
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:43,433
Mrs. Stone?

235
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:43,773
Yes.

236
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:44,833
Mr. Ruggiero?

237
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,134
Yes.

238
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:46,214
Mr. Russo?

239
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:46,534
Yes.

240
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:47,614
Mrs. Van De Koop?

241
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:47,974
Yes.

242
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:48,735
Mayor Burke?

243
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:49,755
Absent.

244
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:56,352
Next on the agenda is the buildings and grounds subcommittee report, which I am the chair of.

245
00:11:56,392 --> 00:12:04,437
So in the interest of time, because we were delayed starting this meeting, we had a committee of the whole meeting before this about the superintendent search.

246
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:07,139
I am going to briefly talk about some highlights.

247
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,642
We did have a very productive meeting with 23 people at attendance.

248
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:15,145
They were principals, administrators, parents, school committee members.

249
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,896
Once we vote on this, this will be online so you can read it.

250
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:27,707
It does include highlights that every principal of every school had sent to me of what they've done since that February.

251
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:42,866
meeting asking for some updates to security that had been questioned and then some proposals or suggestions that people gave to us that we are looking into now.

252
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:49,412
One is that to re-evaluate the STARS program, Alice has been

253
00:12:50,393 --> 00:13:03,440
looked into and we're still moving forward in seeing how ALICE works in the school system with professional development and the cost, but also was suggested by the teacher union president to re-evaluate STARS.

254
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:07,543
Number two, someone talked about in our schools, the doors

255
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:24,126
can only be opened on one side, so they sell these magnetic strips that are $3.25 that you would put on the classroom door, so that your door, you can go in and out, except when, unfortunately, if there was a time that we would have to have a lockdown, the magnetic strip would come off.

256
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,887
So the teacher wouldn't have to unlock the door from one side.

257
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:31,148
I don't understand it unless I have to get out and see the classroom door.

258
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:34,289
Three was additional adjustment counselors.

259
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,389
Four was a safety committee.

260
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:46,733
and each school, not just a district-wide safety committee, but each school because they are such different physical plants and they have their own concerns that each school should have one.

261
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:51,615
Five was classroom keys in the main office for substitutes.

262
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:56,737
That is a concern that I don't know if it was a teacher or a principal had brought to us.

263
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:04,375
that if a substitute is in, if there was a lockdown situation, they wouldn't have the keys.

264
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,537
Number six was number on all the doors.

265
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:13,842
So if the fire department is called, all the doors, both internally and externally, would be numbered.

266
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:22,068
So if the teacher's on the inside and is down one hallway, they can say what door they're at, and that same exit door would be on the outside.

267
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:26,469
Number 7 would be additional method police officers assigned to schools.

268
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,250
8 was additional social and emotional training for all staff.

269
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,131
9 was additional walkie-talkies.

270
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,892
10 was keyless entry for staff and faculty.

271
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:44,034
What it was described to me was almost a tap card and that would be to end the main

272
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:51,056
building the front doors itself because right now custodians are the ones who let teachers in who arrive early.

273
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:57,637
It could be for hallways, it could be for classrooms, so tap cards I think is the more casual language.

274
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:04,639
11 is security training for both the before school staff and the after school staff and the early childhood staff.

275
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:12,201
12 was to have a standing security concern agenda item on the buildings and grounds subcommittee.

276
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,902
13 was information for new students.

277
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:35,986
This was brought by a city employee that said if a student, if we do drills, say in the fall, and a student transfers to our school mid-year, to have, to make sure that new orientation for students, that they're up to date with what their safety protocol would be at their school.

278
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:43,797
Number 14 is emergency kits for lockdown situations that teachers would have in their classroom.

279
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:55,125
And 15 was to make sure suggestions for children who have an IEP that services they would need during a lockdown is included on their IEP.

280
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:58,347
If you have any questions, please feel free

281
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:06,493
to email me, and this, after we discuss it, will be posted for, you can see what every school has been doing.

282
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:07,254
Ms.

283
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:07,874
DiBenedetto.

284
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:08,815
Thank you so much.

285
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:10,417
It was a really great meeting.

286
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:12,979
I appreciate all the work on the committee.

287
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:22,427
And these suggestions, I'd like them to move a lot of these suggestions forward directly to our Buildings and Grounds Director, John.

288
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,651
to the numbers on the doors, those are minimal cost.

289
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:38,015
And doing those type of facility upgrades and have a date for them to be set up for September maybe if you can, I don't know, get our team together over the summer.

290
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:49,620
Just put some goals in place and date timelines on them and what our next steps are and when we're gonna meet again to go over everything and make sure that all follow through has happened.

291
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:59,682
But the ideas that came out and whether or not we use ALICE or STARS or another program, we do need a program district-wide.

292
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:02,363
I feel like we should all be using the same language.

293
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:11,465
I feel like we all need to have the same number of looks on every building from K through 12 district-wide.

294
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:26,906
things implemented so that everybody, as they're moving up, if you learn it in third grade, you know it in fourth grade, you know it in fifth grade, so you're just constantly getting the same information year after year, and it's second thought.

295
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,306
And we label things, the words.

296
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,627
We use the words of what's happening.

297
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:33,507
I think that's the most important thing.

298
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,208
So through you to the superintendent,

299
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:46,542
about moving this to security, moving it to facilities, that's my motion on the floor, and to put some date timelines on this.

300
00:17:47,082 --> 00:18:00,511
So our intent is to take each one of these items, do a cost analysis, and do a feasibility analysis for you, and perhaps in some instances provide an alternative where the cost may be excessive.

301
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:03,353
And some of these things are, you know, like,

302
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,524
The duplicative and the initial fronts, you know, tap cards are very, very expensive.

303
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:13,907
You're talking extraordinary amounts of money for that, to do that, all the things.

304
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,129
But the metal strip is very inexpensive.

305
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:24,135
So you have to ask the question which one of these two could be done quickly and, you know, efficiently and provide the same situation.

306
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,917
You also want to be careful who you give keys to, don't give keys to.

307
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,946
and give you an analysis and a cost factor.

308
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:39,647
Some of it will go to budget, like counselors and things of that type, and some of it will come to you over the next two months.

309
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:40,647
Thank you.

310
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,447
Mr. Russo and then Ms.

311
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:42,907
Vanderpool.

312
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:55,830
I just wanted to, Mr. Nelson already kind of covered it, but I would not be comfortable, a $3 magnetic strip, I would still not be comfortable without an analysis of the cost to implement and maintenance.

313
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,214
A $3 strip, I'm assuming, is not the most robust thing and will have to be replaced with some regularity.

314
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:03,375
I'm guessing.

315
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,498
There's not a lot of products for $3 that last a long time.

316
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:10,942
So I want to know what these things really cost before we consider any of them.

317
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:12,324
Ms.

318
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:13,164
Vanderpool.

319
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,407
Just a technical thing.

320
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:21,272
Under the school committee members, Kathy Kretsch is already listed in the above as a subcommittee.

321
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:32,176
And if I'm listed separately, I should be put Paulette Vander Kloot, and please put non-voting, because I attended the meeting, but I'm not part of the subcommittee, and was not voting that night.

322
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,317
Or you could just put me in parents and community members.

323
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:35,717
Oh, I see.

324
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:35,997
OK.

325
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:36,297
OK.

326
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:37,618
All right.

327
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:41,219
So you'll be on as community member.

328
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:41,799
Yeah.

329
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,019
Got it.

330
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:42,799
That would be best.

331
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,000
And I think my name goes there.

332
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:48,937
So now you're on that committee?

333
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:49,758
No, you're on the committee.

334
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:50,338
It's you and me.

335
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,338
It's listed above.

336
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:51,618
OK.

337
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,179
I gotcha.

338
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,099
Thank you.

339
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,640
Mr. Ruggiero and then Ms.

340
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:57,981
Kretz.

341
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,702
Just a question for Superintendent Delson through you, the chair.

342
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:06,424
In your cost benefit analysis, could you also include the timescale for implementation?

343
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:07,464
I'm sure you will anyway.

344
00:20:07,484 --> 00:20:10,425
I just want to make sure that that's going to be part of your analysis.

345
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:14,343
So we would give you an idea of what it would take to put something in.

346
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:18,165
So something that would take construction, obviously would take longer.

347
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:21,787
Something that could be done just simply by adding it, wouldn't take very long.

348
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:29,971
But then it would be a process of, you might say this is a two month project, when it's approved, if it's approved.

349
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:31,052
Okay.

350
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:40,137
That'd be perfect, because I imagine the cost to add numbers to the doors, it's not gonna cost a lot of money, but it'll take a lot of time for everyone to put the numbers on.

351
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:46,473
We're going to use them too because the other factor is is that it's nice to have a tool But if you don't know how to put it on or apply it properly, it doesn't work.

352
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:55,339
Thank you Next on the agenda is oh, sorry.

353
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:04,926
Yeah, mr. Okay Yep, so something that wasn't in the report and it was just brought to my attention over like the last couple of days so the

354
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:28,787
The Medford Vocational Principle was not included in this meeting and what I found out was and what I know is that the Medford Vocational door has a buzzer and they have a raptor system and currently the vocational door is locked which is really a disadvantage for our customers because

355
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:45,416
Now our customers go to the front door and they have to walk all the way over to the cosmetology and automotive and services like that where they have in their office, they have the Raptor system, they have a buzzer on the door, they have cameras.

356
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:56,738
So I wanna make sure and update this report, the vocational school, their door should be operational and the buzzer should, they should have somebody, a security monitor,

357
00:21:57,114 --> 00:22:05,762
because we have these vocational services and programs for our customers in the community to come and use, including the new Bistro that's going to be coming.

358
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:12,127
So we need to have a security monitor on that side.

359
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,271
On the vocational door, there should be a security monitor.

360
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:17,932
That's completely opposite.

361
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:21,135
So let me answer that.

362
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:24,058
As you know, as a result of all this activity,

363
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:29,539
we are spending an exceptional amount of money on additional personnel for security.

364
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:39,107
And we've already spending in excess of $3,000 a week over and above what we budgeted for just security monitors in the schools.

365
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:43,971
And if you cover every door, you just keep adding to that.

366
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:52,438
So we've got a person at the door 31, which is down towards the physical education section.

367
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:53,539
We've got somebody in the front.

368
00:22:54,858 --> 00:23:03,125
It's going to be very important for us to try to figure out what's the balance between covering every door and how much money we're going to spend, because it's not sustainable in the long run.

369
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:10,512
So I think, you know, let us talk about that and come back to you with a report, because I think it's really a mistake to just simply putting people at every door.

370
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,274
We'd get ourselves in a situation where it's expensive.

371
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:20,100
Point of clarification, I think my colleague is asking for a monitor just like at all the other schools, so they can buzz people in.

372
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,662
There is a monitor in the front door of the high school.

373
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:24,342
There's a monitor at door 31.

374
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,083
That's the pool door.

375
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:27,965
But this is the vocational door.

376
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:30,647
Everybody you add costs money.

377
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:31,807
There's a motion on the floor.

378
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,188
I'll second it.

379
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:42,696
So we've got to decide how much we're going to put out there at this point in time and where it's going to go, because you're raising the cost of security substantially at this point in time.

380
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:45,057
And these things weren't budgeted at the beginning of the year.

381
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:45,778
Can I just?

382
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:51,002
We had the vocational side had a security monitor.

383
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,911
up until the point where the security.

384
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,312
There's a secretary doing the job.

385
00:23:56,272 --> 00:23:56,753
Okay.

386
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,954
And that's, there's an issue with that.

387
00:23:59,114 --> 00:23:59,434
Okay.

388
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:11,561
We can talk about, I mean, look, it's, it's, it's money that you want to spend, we'll spend it, but you've got to understand that every possible door in this place, if it has a security monitor, you're going to keep raising the, the level.

389
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:11,801
Right.

390
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:20,586
But they've had, Mr. Kretz, if I, if just so I can understand the history, if I went in for cosmetology or another service, I went into the Vogue front door,

391
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:23,729
And the secretary ran my license.

392
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:26,251
So now what are they asking the customers to do?

393
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:35,520
They have to go to the front door of Medford High School, and some of these are elderly people, and they have to go up the stairs, walk through the hallways.

394
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,501
They don't know where they're going.

395
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:50,490
It's quite a distance, and I just think that it's a disadvantage to our community if we're not going to have security, where we're going to have the bistro open to customers, but we're not going to have any security.

396
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,411
Wait, can I have a point of clarification?

397
00:24:52,471 --> 00:25:00,436
Are you asking for an additional person, or just the visual monitor so the secretary can buzz them in and read them?

398
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:06,118
I'm actually asking maybe for another person like a security monitor.

399
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:19,843
They used to have a security monitor who would let, who would be in the hallways and, you know, they would get buzzed in and they would go through, I think, you know, she might have run them through the Raptor system, I'm not quite sure.

400
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:21,905
But they have the Raptor system.

401
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:25,268
They have the monitors, but there's nobody there.

402
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:28,310
And they have a sign on the door that says that you must go.

403
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:29,812
So somebody will park.

404
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:30,953
Wait one second.

405
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,855
I got it right.

406
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:36,898
My second part of that question is so during the school day is is it

407
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:46,465
best to have that pool door security person down at the Vogue to deal with the thing.

408
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:52,169
Rather than have them at the pool door during the school day, have them at the vocational door.

409
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:57,733
And if people need to come into the pool, they can go down to the vocational and walk to the pool.

410
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:03,536
I mean, it might work better rather than elderly walking through our building.

411
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:05,697
That's a way to look at it.

412
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:08,178
That's a choice we have to make.

413
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:13,501
We've heard people advocate strongly for the pool door to be covered.

414
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,722
We've heard people advocate for people coming through one point of entry.

415
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,122
It never was a monitor at that door.

416
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:26,405
It was only the buzzer system and the rapture system inside the vocational school office.

417
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,728
That would be new to put someone at that door specifically.

418
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:37,974
So we can do whatever you think is in best interest, but if we keep adding layers and layers of people, we're going to have to assume that cost.

419
00:26:38,434 --> 00:26:39,435
We just have to decide.

420
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:50,152
So to follow up, can we do one week a tally, how many people are coming through the pool door during school hours?

421
00:26:51,265 --> 00:27:02,949
just to get an idea of how many people are actually using that, and if that person could be used more efficiently for customers and school departments.

422
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:10,571
So my issue is we don't want to make it so that people aren't coming and using our vocational programs.

423
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,592
We want people to come in and get their hair done.

424
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:16,213
I actually brought my mother there at one point, and my sister got their hair done.

425
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:18,554
And I got my hair done when I had a broken wrist.

426
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:21,215
And they do your nails, they do everything.

427
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:23,757
You can get an oil change, your hair done.

428
00:27:24,197 --> 00:27:26,759
You can get so many things done up there.

429
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,401
You can spend the whole day and have lunch.

430
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:35,465
So a motion to do a study till the next meeting.

431
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:43,010
And maybe a representative for the district can report that data.

432
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,392
And maybe even the people at the front desk can get some feedback.

433
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:54,233
Is there a second for the motion to do a study to see how many people use the pool door during school hours, and maybe it'd be a better resource to use it at the rope door.

434
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:56,254
Motion, second by Ms.

435
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:56,574
Kretz.

436
00:27:57,534 --> 00:27:58,814
I want a clarification.

437
00:27:59,035 --> 00:27:59,255
Yes.

438
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,936
So what would this study, I'm just trying to understand exactly.

439
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:05,037
So it's just going to be a number of people that walk through the door every day?

440
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:13,260
To see if the pool door, if people are using it as frequently during the school hours as the people who are trying to be

441
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,251
in the vocational door for services of the different shops.

442
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:22,813
Through the chair, before we vote on this motion, is it possible you could do a foot traffic study?

443
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:26,614
Is that going to be much more difficult, Superintendent Belson, or?

444
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:31,935
I think we can assess the flow during certain times of the day.

445
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:37,897
Certainly in the morning, there are people using the pool facility and other things of that type down that area.

446
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,698
Other times of day, people do come through there.

447
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:45,556
but there are people coming through the vocational entrance or wanting to come through the vocational entrance.

448
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:47,998
There are going to be people wanting to come through the bistro entrance.

449
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:50,359
There are people wanting to go to make way for kids.

450
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,463
There are people going to go to a lot of different entry points because it's more efficient.

451
00:28:55,943 --> 00:29:09,253
The difficulty for us is to determine, you know, which is the most necessary and how much we're willing to spend on having people in that category or how much we're willing to rely on the cameras and the Raptor system.

452
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:15,224
and the buzzer systems to be the most, let's say, likely form of check.

453
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:21,170
Are there motion detectors that can be used in front of these doors?

454
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,533
Because then you could just do, like, just click in?

455
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,394
There aren't motion detectors coming in those doors, no.

456
00:29:25,855 --> 00:29:30,159
There are motion detectors going in some of the rooms that trigger the lighting, but not the...

457
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:42,832
But if you go in the vocational office, there is a whole panorama, as you know, of cameras, of television screens, that you can see every door coming into the book.

458
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:54,143
So theoretically, a person sitting at a desk, if someone coming to the door, could recognize a person, just like they do at an elementary school in many ways, and let them in and tell them to come to the office.

459
00:29:56,308 --> 00:30:00,489
Again, it's an issue of how much we're prepared to do for security.

460
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,471
If it's possible, I'm not too interested in seeing that you have all the video cameras right there.

461
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:10,332
Could you just have the person at the desk take a rolling tally of how many times people go through each door?

462
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:11,853
It shouldn't be too difficult.

463
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:15,174
If they walk through the pool door, they just put a little hash mark on that.

464
00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:16,634
We can certainly ask to do it.

465
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:18,875
Obviously, they're doing other things and getting out of the movement.

466
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:19,315
Of course, right.

467
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:20,155
It might not be a perfect study.

468
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:20,776
You get a general sense.

469
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:25,117
There are certain times of the day when movement through there is more likely.

470
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,538
And there are other times of the day where it's pretty difficult.

471
00:30:28,598 --> 00:30:37,103
I'd like to make a friendly amendment to the motion that if we could just have a foot traffic study of all the doors, seeing that we're going to be doing anyway.

472
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,579
of the, well, that all the doors that are, all the doors.

473
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:45,740
There's 43 doors in the high school, all the doors would be open.

474
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,761
So right now, I think it's allocating the resource of the pool door person and the vocation person.

475
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:53,362
I think that's the immediate need that Ms.

476
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:54,342
Kretz is hearing about.

477
00:30:54,422 --> 00:30:59,023
So I think that should be the report right now so we can get that moving forward.

478
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,143
My final comment.

479
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:06,345
So I understand that we rent the pool and a lot of people use it early in the morning.

480
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:07,345
And I think, I know,

481
00:31:08,508 --> 00:31:17,496
from what the impression I'm getting from the superintendent is that he wants to make sure those people coming in and going out are signed in or let in appropriately.

482
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,257
And if that's the case, that's fine.

483
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:35,811
But then maybe when that rental stops during the morning, that person shifts over to the Vogue so that way when someone's coming up to get her hair done, she doesn't have to walk off him, walk through the whole building and cause that

484
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:38,594
to lose customers.

485
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:45,282
So we have a motion to find out the use of the both doors and allocate the resources.

486
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:46,864
Yes.

487
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:52,551
Relative traffic patterns both in the interest of time, because I do know that we did still start

488
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:53,631
20 minutes late.

489
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:55,592
There are some amazing students here.

490
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:57,133
Could someone have a motion?

491
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:57,673
Motion.

492
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,814
So we need to just vote that first.

493
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:02,635
And then we'll do a motion to take the out of order.

494
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:03,595
So Ms.

495
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:06,256
Van De Koop made a motion to take the agenda items out of order.

496
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:09,417
So we can go to the vote on it first.

497
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:10,657
Roll call vote.

498
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:11,518
OK.

499
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,378
Mrs. DiVentino?

500
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:12,658
Yes.

501
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:13,579
Mrs. Kretz?

502
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:13,799
Yes.

503
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:14,459
Mrs. Stone?

504
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:14,939
Yes.

505
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:15,839
Mr. Ruggiero?

506
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:16,139
Yes.

507
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,400
Mr. Russo?

508
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:17,820
Yes.

509
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,820
Mrs. Van De Koop?

510
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,201
Yes.

511
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:19,861
Mayor Burke?

512
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:20,501
Absent.

513
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:23,394
Six yes, one absent.

514
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:24,555
I want to thank Ms.

515
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,459
Rodriguez for letting us jump ahead of her report.

516
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,643
So the first report on the Scholastic Art Awards.

517
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:33,646
Mr. Zigny.

518
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:21,208
This past December, students in grades 7 through 12 from all across the nation submitted artwork for competition in the 2018 Scholastic Art Awards, which is the longest running and most prestigious national art competition in the country.

519
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:39,033
All works representing a broad range of art disciplines were evaluated through blind adjudication, first on a regional level by more than 100 affiliates of the Scholastic Art Awards, and then nationally by an impressive panel of creative industry experts.

520
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:45,996
Four Medford students have won recognition in the 2018 Massachusetts Scholastic Art Awards.

521
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,705
We have McGlynn Middle School 8th grader, Northa Richard, got honorable mention for her photography, Different Eyes, Same Soul.

522
00:33:54,806 --> 00:34:00,951
Medford High School sophomore, Frances Flood, received honorable mention for her photography, One Tree Hill.

523
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:04,093
Medford High School senior, Wendy St.

524
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:08,117
Jules, won a silver key for her mixed media work called Blackout.

525
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:16,443
And Medford High School senior, Julia Talbert, won the gold key in the comic art category for her work, The Moon Kingdom.

526
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:26,447
And Julia's entry that was recently on display at Tufts University also won a regional gold key and advanced to national judging in New York where it was awarded a gold medal.

527
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:30,472
And she'll be honored for her accomplishment at Carnegie Hall in June.

528
00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:32,635
So if we could have those four students come up.

529
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:12,043
Congratulations.

530
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,044
Thank you very much.

531
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:14,684
Come this way, yes.

532
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:15,865
Guys, come this way.

533
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:16,205
And Ms.

534
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:21,867
Van Aken, who teaches studio art, would just like to say a few words about her students.

535
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,009
Okay, just a few words.

536
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:45,015
About a hundred years ago, there was no formal mechanism for recognizing student artists.

537
00:35:46,255 --> 00:35:54,201
There was recognition for scholars, academic scholars, for student athletes, but not for budding artists.

538
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:59,123
And from that void came the Scholastic Art Awards.

539
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:08,667
Tonight, your community would like to acknowledge and honor your accomplishments in art.

540
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:16,630
And also to say to you, remind you something that you already know is that your ideas are important.

541
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,032
And to tell you that you do inspire us all.

542
00:36:34,203 --> 00:36:40,366
Next we have the Scholastic Writing Awards and Mrs. Chiesa will come up to present those.

543
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:51,691
Good evening.

544
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:52,371
How are you?

545
00:36:53,112 --> 00:37:00,215
The Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Awards are an important opportunity for students to find a way to express themselves creatively.

546
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:07,849
This year, there were over 2,500 applicants to the writing awards, grades seven through 12, similar to the art awards.

547
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,792
And Medford had 10 winners from the middle school and the high school total.

548
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:24,177
We had two receiving the gold key award, one receiving a silver key award, and seven receiving honorable mention awards.

549
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:30,060
Some students were repeat winners from 2017, and as I mentioned before, we had

550
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:31,780
three middle school winners.

551
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:40,545
This is the third time that we've had middle school participate and continuously accomplish.

552
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:49,991
The School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in partnership with the Boston Globe, is the affiliate for the sponsorship of this award for Massachusetts.

553
00:37:50,471 --> 00:38:00,217
And there are several different categories that students can participate in, including poetry, prose, memoirs, short stories, and the list continues.

554
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:02,983
We're very proud of our students.

555
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:09,948
I also want to take a minute to thank the teachers who go above and beyond to help the students with the submissions.

556
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:12,470
And that includes Mr. Ambrose, Ms.

557
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,790
Sanford, Ms.

558
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:19,674
Stevens, Mr. Heineck, Mr. Morris, Mr. Bowen Flynn, and also Ms.

559
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:20,095
Zeckman.

560
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:21,295
And Mr. Bowen Flynn and Ms.

561
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:24,197
Zeckman are here tonight as well with their students.

562
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:37,782
probably the best way is just to read the names on the certificates, and huge congratulations to the students for putting themselves out there, putting their written work out there, as well as submitting it.

563
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:49,649
Additionally, pending approval, we will have the writing submissions on the website for those students who are comfortable sharing, and that will be coming up on the blog in the next week or so.

564
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:50,689
All right, thank you.

565
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:52,590
Do the teachers want to come up?

566
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:52,891
Come on.

567
00:38:53,691 --> 00:38:55,212
The kids wouldn't be here without the teachers.

568
00:39:12,902 --> 00:39:16,785
Alright, so for honorable mention in poetry, we have Pima Cho-Tung.

569
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:29,714
And if you guys want to line up, we can move it along.

570
00:39:29,754 --> 00:39:32,596
Maybe they create the line like we usually do over there when they come up.

571
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:36,382
We have Kayla Delano for Gold Key in Poetry.

572
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:52,486
Emily Gotti who received a Gold Key for Personal Essay and Memoir.

573
00:39:57,587 --> 00:40:01,628
We have Jacqueline Madigan who received a Silver Key for Personal Essay and Memoir.

574
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:24,957
We have Rachel Elliott who won an honorable mention in poetry.

575
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:36,271
Sumaya Orney who received an honorable mention for short story.

576
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:59,174
Alyssa Parzial for Honorable Mention and Short Story.

577
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:05,738
And Poetry.

578
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:06,559
And Poetry.

579
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:09,801
Nertha Richard for Honorable Mention and Short Story.

580
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:23,089
A double winner.

581
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,330
That's great.

582
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,231
Congratulations.

583
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:27,333
Thank you.

584
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:29,715
Margaret Zen, for Honorable Mention in Poetry.

585
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:44,045
Micah Vertilis, for Honorable Mention in Personal Essay and Memoir.

586
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,771
And that is it.

587
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,352
Congratulations for a well-written work.

588
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:03,463
Do the teachers want to say anything?

589
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:16,261
As you all know, our students work incredibly hard, and we have developed some remarkable writers over the years, and these are just more of the best.

590
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:17,103
Thank you.

591
00:42:32,144 --> 00:42:35,066
Motion to accept the report and place it on file?

592
00:42:36,546 --> 00:42:36,826
Yes.

593
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:40,848
Motion to accept the report on Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.

594
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:41,849
Second.

595
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:42,449
Yes.

596
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,351
I'm enthusiastic.

597
00:42:48,511 --> 00:42:48,591
OK.

598
00:42:49,112 --> 00:42:49,552
All right.

599
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:52,253
Thank you, students.

600
00:42:54,034 --> 00:42:56,255
Just to go back to, yes.

601
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:59,096
We're going back to the agenda item

602
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,062
Yes, we next have the Committee of the Whole Minutes for March 29, 2018.

603
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:07,425
Can I have a point of clarification?

604
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:07,825
You can.

605
00:43:08,406 --> 00:43:19,073
Even if there was a motion that had passed in the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee minutes, should there still be a motion to place the record on file?

606
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:20,534
That is a good question.

607
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:22,735
I wish I had to teach you, maybe.

608
00:43:22,755 --> 00:43:23,396
So motioned.

609
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:23,976
So motioned.

610
00:43:24,056 --> 00:43:25,897
I ask you to assume committee member.

611
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:26,758
We did sort of do that.

612
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:27,258
Yes.

613
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:27,979
OK.

614
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:28,399
Thank you.

615
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:32,107
So I, but no, to make it official.

616
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,469
No real call, but it's placed on file.

617
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:34,829
Aye.

618
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,431
All those in favor?

619
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,171
Aye.

620
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:38,312
Thank you so much.

621
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,974
I'm trying to follow along like this.

622
00:43:40,214 --> 00:43:41,635
I'm on the job learning.

623
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:44,857
So next is the committee of the whole minutes.

624
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:47,440
Make a motion to accept.

625
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,701
Motion to accept.

626
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:56,647
Yes, I'd like to make a motion to accept these, but at the same time, I'd like to add two motions.

627
00:43:56,827 --> 00:43:57,788
I'd like to define

628
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,151
how a new employee is hired within that rule.

629
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:12,754
I would like to change the rule and just define new employee as someone hired within the last six months so that it's interpreted by everybody on the same level.

630
00:44:12,774 --> 00:44:14,535
I'm not sure what you're saying.

631
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:19,997
Is there a paragraph that talks about a new employee in here?

632
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:25,758
Make a motion so that when the new contract is written, employees more definitely

633
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:28,907
stated.

634
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:32,368
Yes.

635
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:36,790
Just in reference to that, that's a negotiated contract language folks.

636
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,270
So that motion should is not appropriate.

637
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,071
And we don't have the authority to change the language of the contract.

638
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:43,792
No, not at this juncture.

639
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:47,613
That's a negotiated item that would need to be discussed in both parties.

640
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:53,235
So my second motion would be to receive a payroll report either by annually or annually.

641
00:44:53,682 --> 00:45:03,668
as of December 31st, just so we have a chance to review it, because we vote on payroll on a weekly, bi-weekly, at all of our meetings.

642
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:07,811
So I think that we should put our eyes on the data twice a year.

643
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:16,697
And I was thinking December 31st and June 31st, just to see how it falls within our budget book, and so we can compare the two items.

644
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,358
Does that mean two days?

645
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:19,418
For the two days?

646
00:45:19,438 --> 00:45:20,759
For the two days.

647
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:21,239
December 31st.

648
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:26,263
And the second day would be June.

649
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:32,405
We can do 15th rather than the end of the month, because it gets, you know, everybody's gone by then.

650
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:33,345
So a motion to report.

651
00:45:33,385 --> 00:45:34,145
June 1st.

652
00:45:35,906 --> 00:45:44,929
A payroll report with year-to-date information included on December 31st of every year and June 1st of every year.

653
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:46,449
Question.

654
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:48,529
Mr. Russo, a question?

655
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:48,749
Yes.

656
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,031
Do you mean as of those dates?

657
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:54,954
Because if you got it on December 31st, then if I wasn't there.

658
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:57,696
Yeah, payroll lending is close to December 31st.

659
00:45:57,736 --> 00:46:00,018
The next scheduled meeting following those dates.

660
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:01,018
Yes, thank you.

661
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:02,540
Thank you for clarifying.

662
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,741
Yeah, you knew exactly what I would mean.

663
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:04,801
Ms.

664
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:05,202
Vander Kloof.

665
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:10,626
Yes, so on the June 1st, I'm just concerned that it's at the very time that we're preparing budget.

666
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:16,410
I just want to understand what works best, whether it's that we do that

667
00:46:17,216 --> 00:46:19,037
at the year end, which would be June 30th?

668
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:27,920
We could add it to the year end, but it's just good to see before we wrote on budget how funds can be allocated.

669
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:42,826
If we're on track with payroll at the end of each year, or if we find a need for more stipends or more substitutes or more anything, we can incorporate that in and make those changes before we approve our next year's budget.

670
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,567
So I just want to pick a date that makes sense.

671
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:46,147
Me too.

672
00:46:47,173 --> 00:46:50,175
Point of clarification from the Department of Finance.

673
00:46:56,038 --> 00:46:56,819
Yes, through the chair.

674
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:03,623
So if I understand the intent of the report, it would be at the end of the year of a fiscal year.

675
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:09,367
So June 1st does not show you the entire year's payrolls.

676
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:16,551
So especially with the teachers and paras that are 10-month employees, there's a large summer payout at the end, which

677
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,994
Again, we do not know based on the number of snow days in a given year.

678
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:30,341
So identifying a middle of the month day specifically may not capture what you're asking for.

679
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:41,469
So the recommendation would be during the budget process, that's when we're identifying where people are in their given step and lane, and if the negotiated

680
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:47,949
contracts have provisions in for those COLAs, those are being incorporated within the budget.

681
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:50,971
So those would be seen as the budget process itself.

682
00:47:51,372 --> 00:47:56,636
For the year-end closeout, again, that would be after the final pays in June.

683
00:47:56,696 --> 00:48:05,563
And again, we have payroll accrual, which are paid in July, because we do have weekly workers that are going right up to June 31st.

684
00:48:05,703 --> 00:48:12,208
So if the intent of the report is to capture all of the payrolls, we would need to wait until the subsequent month.

685
00:48:12,662 --> 00:48:15,384
Okay, so would the motion be for July?

686
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:19,048
So maybe I can just add a little clarity.

687
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:21,710
I think that you're looking at a half year thing.

688
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,992
You said December 31st, but you're really looking at half year.

689
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:30,577
The half year, believe it or not, is not December 31st because teachers are generally on a 10 month year.

690
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:36,122
So why don't you say the half year whenever that falls, the next meeting, and then at the end of the fiscal year.

691
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:37,543
So February and July?

692
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:38,364
Is that more accurate?

693
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:38,624
Perfect.

694
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:40,246
And then you'll get a full picture.

695
00:48:40,938 --> 00:48:52,433
That's exactly what I would like to see a full picture I have to look at the schedule, but I'm not really sure we meet I

696
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:53,893
That's OK.

697
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,655
We can talk about it the next following meeting.

698
00:48:55,695 --> 00:49:01,379
As long as we get the report, we can then disseminate it and bring any questions forward from that point on.

699
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,320
I mean, it might be a couple of months.

700
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,442
I mean, we don't meet all summer long, right?

701
00:49:05,982 --> 00:49:06,302
Oh, no.

702
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:13,247
If they even email it to us, if we see concerns, we can email major concerns and then talk about it early September.

703
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:15,769
Is there a second for that motion?

704
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,910
Second.

705
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,308
I just, if I could have a point of clarification, I just want to make sure exactly what's going to be on the report.

706
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:25,409
Can you just walk us through that, what the particulars of that report would be?

707
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:25,549
Sure.

708
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:36,612
If you're looking for a payroll report, if it's the mid-year, you'll get the payroll report that falls at the mid-year, typically the end of January, beginning of February, typically is the mid-year for the teachers and everyone else.

709
00:49:36,632 --> 00:49:37,752
That's the bulk of the payroll.

710
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:43,555
The other report, you'll get a payroll, maybe the last payroll of the fiscal year.

711
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:47,976
And you'll see the, you know, all the payments that are made at the end.

712
00:49:48,176 --> 00:49:58,359
Now, because of the way we're, it's kind of interesting, because of the way we're, we deal with faculty and others, they get a balloon payment at the end of the year because we defer payments.

713
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:04,400
But some of the negotiation requests, which we'll talk about later, could alter some of that.

714
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:13,961
So this is a little tricky at this point in time, but I'm sure we can provide something that would give you a sufficient look at who's getting paid and what they're getting paid.

715
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:20,127
But you need to be careful how you try to translate it across the lines because it doesn't add

716
00:50:21,053 --> 00:50:22,113
just times this, times that.

717
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:24,294
Well, that's why we need more data on the report.

718
00:50:24,394 --> 00:50:30,817
So you just want to be careful that you don't try to infer things from it because it may not be exactly the case.

719
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:38,880
Each person's payroll may be slightly different because of the type of contract they're on and the type of payout that they get.

720
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,242
Would on that report as well also be the department they're a part of and the school that they're working at, whether it's elementary versus high school?

721
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:47,143
I'm not sure.

722
00:50:47,203 --> 00:50:48,463
Usually it's an alpha listing.

723
00:50:49,704 --> 00:50:50,424
An alpha listing.

724
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:56,567
So just being alphabetical.

725
00:50:56,907 --> 00:50:59,549
Would it be very difficult to add that information in addition?

726
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:06,794
Unfortunately, it is based on the limited capacity of the payroll system itself.

727
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:12,378
We don't have the ability to put out those descriptors in it.

728
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:13,719
They're limited fields.

729
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,263
It's not something that it's just an Excel file where we could go in and put that in.

730
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:29,305
It's based on job codes and it's not as easy to read as... So you could have someone working at two schools with the same code?

731
00:51:30,266 --> 00:51:33,388
They would be working with different codes but being split.

732
00:51:33,688 --> 00:51:38,292
So that is a possibility if they're working at multiple schools.

733
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:39,312
I see.

734
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:39,833
Okay.

735
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,933
I think you get a good picture of things, and obviously you'd see everything.

736
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:52,577
So there is a motion for a payroll report twice a year around the time of February and July.

737
00:51:52,657 --> 00:51:53,497
Is there a second?

738
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:54,258
Yes.

739
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:54,518
Ms.

740
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:54,678
Kretz.

741
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:54,878
Yes.

742
00:51:55,558 --> 00:51:56,259
Roll call vote.

743
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:57,740
Mrs. DeBette.

744
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,220
Yes.

745
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,221
Mrs. Kretz.

746
00:51:59,461 --> 00:51:59,681
Yes.

747
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:00,601
Mrs. Stone.

748
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:00,922
Yes.

749
00:52:01,362 --> 00:52:02,042
Mr. Ruggiero.

750
00:52:02,102 --> 00:52:02,322
Yes.

751
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:03,663
Mr. Russo.

752
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:04,003
Yes.

753
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:05,444
Mrs. Van de Koot.

754
00:52:05,564 --> 00:52:05,784
Yes.

755
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:06,505
Mayor Burke.

756
00:52:08,854 --> 00:52:16,617
And that's in addition to all the other recommendations that were placed in this report as well.

757
00:52:16,977 --> 00:52:20,699
And that report will now be online because it has been.

758
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,100
We have to accept it.

759
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:32,224
And, um, you know, I just, I just want to comment that I appreciated the reports coming forward from the finance department.

760
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:34,785
Um, I know it took a lot of work,

761
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:43,434
But it's important as a committee member to make sure that what I vote for, I get to see the background information.

762
00:52:43,454 --> 00:52:52,660
So I have a whole picture in my mind, and that way I'm confident in voting, especially when people's tax dollars are being allocated.

763
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,263
So thank you to the department for the time you invested.

764
00:52:57,097 --> 00:53:01,320
to provide me that information, and thank you for moving forward in a way.

765
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:23,936
Also, the list of, I thought that was really good that came out of that meeting, is the list of salary changes as which negotiations have been completed, being in the front of our budget book, so when we look back six months, a year from now, we know which

766
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:37,119
salary increases were in our budget book and which were left out, so that way we have a better understanding and an easier knowledge to just make sure that we're making the correct choices moving forward.

767
00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:47,024
And thank you for all of the committee for their time, adding another meeting.

768
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:51,747
And there's another piece of this report about the

769
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:53,484
four finalists.

770
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:57,567
I don't know if you want to comment on it before we accept it.

771
00:53:59,028 --> 00:53:59,628
Like an update.

772
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:01,089
Yes.

773
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:03,831
Volunteers update.

774
00:54:04,172 --> 00:54:04,592
Do you want me?

775
00:54:04,872 --> 00:54:05,433
I would love it.

776
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:07,014
All right.

777
00:54:07,094 --> 00:54:16,681
So the report also included information about the finalists that were brought to the school committee by the Superintendent Search Committee.

778
00:54:17,782 --> 00:54:21,485
Those four finalists were Dr Maurice and Ward Vincent.

779
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,327
Dr. Perrella, Dr. Straight, and Mr. Thomas Martelone.

780
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:39,034
Tonight, the committee met prior to this and voted to continue looking into the backgrounds and speaking with Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent and Mr. Thomas Martelone.

781
00:54:39,974 --> 00:54:40,375
Thank you.

782
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:44,016
Motion was to accept the report.

783
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:46,798
So motion to accept the committee of the whole.

784
00:54:47,558 --> 00:54:47,838
Second.

785
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:48,599
So moved.

786
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:49,139
So moved.

787
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,680
Roll call vote.

788
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,634
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

789
00:54:53,674 --> 00:54:53,934
Yes.

790
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:56,395
Mrs. Gretz?

791
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:57,235
Yes.

792
00:54:57,655 --> 00:54:58,236
Mrs. Stone?

793
00:54:58,316 --> 00:54:58,596
Yes.

794
00:54:59,236 --> 00:54:59,856
Mr. Ruggiero?

795
00:55:00,056 --> 00:55:00,256
Yes.

796
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:01,197
Mr. Russo?

797
00:55:01,337 --> 00:55:02,477
Yes.

798
00:55:02,577 --> 00:55:04,618
A motion for my new documents.

799
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:05,779
Yes.

800
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:07,540
And placed on file.

801
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,380
And Mayor Burke?

802
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,180
Absent.

803
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:12,041
And we voted on that.

804
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:15,683
So moving on to agenda item number six, community participation.

805
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:19,405
Cheryl Rodriguez is here to speak, and I do want to thank her for

806
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:25,320
letting the scholastic awards go before her on the agenda.

807
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:26,741
Thank you.

808
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:29,522
OK, Cheryl.

809
00:55:29,682 --> 00:55:37,046
Before Cheryl starts her report, I just wanted to also commend Cheryl for all the work that she's doing with the CPA report.

810
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:51,413
She's still continuing to provide the application process under CPA to get us a little more than $100,000 to redo the ground covering of our playground

811
00:55:51,994 --> 00:55:54,295
at the Roberts School.

812
00:55:54,535 --> 00:55:55,595
I said it right this time.

813
00:55:57,555 --> 00:56:01,816
And it's looking good, but we still have some more hoops to go through.

814
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:10,658
I think we have a meeting on April 24th in the evening that Cheryl's going to speak at.

815
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:12,838
And I'm going to go and root behind her.

816
00:56:13,198 --> 00:56:19,560
And anybody else on the committee that wants to come and root for that money, we could really use your support.

817
00:56:21,055 --> 00:56:22,076
But on a different topic.

818
00:56:22,676 --> 00:56:24,098
We'll get a report on that one, I'm sure.

819
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,141
That's April 24th, the CPA presentation.

820
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:31,203
But yeah, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

821
00:56:32,244 --> 00:56:34,927
I just wanted to bring up the topic of bullying.

822
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:40,591
I noticed that as the children get older, there's a little buzz here.

823
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:52,913
How do I do that one?

824
00:57:00,282 --> 00:57:00,623
It's on.

825
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:02,285
Okay.

826
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:05,689
So I just wanted to come in and bring up the topic of bullying.

827
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:06,850
I've noticed that as

828
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:12,906
As technology gets more prolific, bullying seems to get more severe.

829
00:57:14,026 --> 00:57:18,567
When I was a child, if there was a bully, they were at school and maybe on the bus.

830
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:20,067
But when you got home, you were safe.

831
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:34,610
And now it seems that bullying has extended beyond the school, schoolyard, buses, to your homes if your child is on any kind of social media, texting app, anything like that.

832
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:54,233
Even as a parent of a 22 year old, I didn't have to deal with this and I'm finding it difficult and I'm hoping that the school will be willing to implement some kind of a program, maybe something that the PTOs can help work with or we can work with the computer teachers.

833
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:03,522
the district works with the Michigan model and when I looked them up I found they have a bully free school circle of support type of program.

834
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:15,386
I think what's really important in this type of program would be not only to do the principals, the teachers, the students, but also the parents because we're in a position where we don't exactly know

835
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:28,081
how to guide our children, and if we're not guiding all the children in the same direction, it's great to tell your child to block somebody else, but if they then go on someone else's page and start harassing them.

836
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:38,930
We had a situation in my particular family, and I put a post on Facebook, and I was amazed at how many messages that I got from friends from different schools.

837
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,113
It's not a Medford unique problem,

838
00:58:43,262 --> 00:58:51,477
Things like that they had bullying and they went to their principal for help and the principal told them, you know, boys will be boys or it's your turn to get bullying.

839
00:58:52,062 --> 00:59:08,914
Children that were getting bullied so badly in their schools that they were going online and saying that they were going to commit suicide, or students that were harassed so heavily that they were scratching themselves or cutting themselves as young as elementary school.

840
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:11,836
So I'm really concerned about this problem.

841
00:59:11,856 --> 00:59:13,877
It's touched my family personally.

842
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:17,920
One of those stories is about someone in my family.

843
00:59:18,395 --> 00:59:20,476
but I prefer not to say which one.

844
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:23,698
So I'm hoping that we can have some kind of collaboration.

845
00:59:23,778 --> 00:59:34,103
I know that right now, most of our bullying issues go through either the adjustment counselor or the principal, and maybe it's not working for everyone.

846
00:59:34,343 --> 00:59:47,129
I know that the issue that we were having personally had gone through the adjustment counselor, and we didn't hear about it for a couple weeks later after a student reported an issue

847
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:50,243
My daughter wasn't spoken to for two additional weeks.

848
00:59:50,843 --> 00:59:54,265
And if that had escalated, that could have been a really serious problem.

849
00:59:54,865 --> 01:00:00,467
So I'm hoping that maybe we can set up a committee that has parents on it, or you can have a subcommittee.

850
01:00:00,907 --> 01:00:12,492
But bullying is something that we, anyone that was at that five hour meeting or watched it on television, probably about half of the people that spoke at that meeting talked about relentless bullying that their students were going through, their children.

851
01:00:13,052 --> 01:00:16,173
So I really just wanted to come here and say that I hope that

852
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:25,338
when you go to hire a new superintendent, maybe that's a question of what they want to do about bullying, and we can do something about it, because I need help.

853
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:31,905
I thank you for being here, and I know you said you looked into the Michigan model, because that is something that the school committee had adopted a few years back.

854
01:00:32,365 --> 01:00:35,829
Have you found any curriculums that are specific to social media bullying?

855
01:00:36,323 --> 01:00:37,484
Would you say that's the?

856
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:41,346
This was just the bully-free school circle of support.

857
01:00:41,566 --> 01:00:41,867
OK.

858
01:00:42,227 --> 01:00:46,750
And it just emphasized that you had to have people at all levels.

859
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,352
They had training for the teachers, but they also had training for the parents.

860
01:00:50,392 --> 01:00:51,973
This was on their website.

861
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:54,094
I just have one copy that you can have.

862
01:00:54,515 --> 01:00:56,156
Would you mind emailing us?

863
01:00:56,796 --> 01:00:57,997
Yeah, I can email it to you.

864
01:00:58,677 --> 01:01:03,820
So would you suggest each school set up their own committee for addressing

865
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:10,204
Is it bullying all around or would you say you're really pinpointing social media?

866
01:01:10,944 --> 01:01:12,084
I think it's all around.

867
01:01:12,104 --> 01:01:15,585
I think kids are treating each other horribly.

868
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:33,768
The only reason I suggested a committee is that maybe if a student doesn't feel comfortable talking to their principal, or doesn't have a relationship with that adjustment counselor, or if the parents have told me that they've gone to the principal and they've hit the wall and they don't know where to go next, so I'm hoping that we can set up the next step.

869
01:01:34,494 --> 01:01:34,654
Ms.

870
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:35,755
Vander Kloop.

871
01:01:36,076 --> 01:01:39,038
So this is one of those topics that goes around.

872
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:42,881
Many people don't remember this because they're around that long.

873
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:50,447
But when I first got involved, the first topic that I brought together a group of parents to talk about was called Leave My Child Alone.

874
01:01:51,027 --> 01:01:57,512
And that was the first forum that we had to discuss this issue.

875
01:01:57,793 --> 01:01:58,613
And it's come to that.

876
01:01:58,693 --> 01:02:03,517
I absolutely agree that now that the technology that's

877
01:02:03,517 --> 01:02:06,279
has just brought Atlanta to a whole new level.

878
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:20,190
Now, back in, I think it was around 2010, school committee, Anne Marie Pugnell, working with Representative Paul Donato, we did a couple of public forums as well around the topic of polling.

879
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:25,894
At that point, we did put together a rather extensive policy and some procedures.

880
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:30,797
It seems to me that what we need to do is we need to review those,

881
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,110
that everybody's on board.

882
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:53,428
And it's probably time again that we again do a public program about educating parents about bullying and how they can help their students.

883
01:02:53,628 --> 01:02:55,511
Was it under a subcommittee when

884
01:02:55,957 --> 01:02:57,399
You did it in 2010 with Ann Marie?

885
01:02:57,459 --> 01:03:00,603
At that particular point, Ann Marie was working with

886
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,455
Any other questions?

887
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:14,256
Mr. Ruggiero.

888
01:03:49,127 --> 01:03:58,333
If a person makes a complaint or brings it to the attention of the principal, if you look at the back of this thing, there are forms that a person needs to fill out and follow.

889
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:01,704
If they don't bring it to our attention, we may not know about it.

890
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:07,618
But if you do, we'd have a record of this forum and a resolution on what was done.

891
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:09,161
And it's pretty extensive.

892
01:04:10,035 --> 01:04:20,361
Now, every year when the administrators come back from the summer and they get ready for the year, part of our orientation is to go over these materials.

893
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,122
So we do go over them.

894
01:04:22,202 --> 01:04:32,048
And then, of course, it's building base to go over them with your people in the building to make sure that they are familiar and that they're willing to use these things when it's brought to their attention.

895
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:36,390
The incidence of cyberbullying has been out there for a while.

896
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,711
And social media, as you might imagine,

897
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:51,367
difficult because people are constantly commenting to each other and sometimes you're not sure when someone's aggravating a friend or they're actually bullying them.

898
01:04:53,403 --> 01:05:01,568
We've got to do more with that because it's very difficult to control that because it's so personalized by people calling each other up and doing things.

899
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,429
I think people are aware of it.

900
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:06,431
I think sometimes it doesn't hurt to refresh.

901
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:12,675
It doesn't hurt to go back over it again, make a bigger issue out of it, maybe hold a couple of forums on it.

902
01:05:13,156 --> 01:05:15,157
But clearly it's a shared responsibility.

903
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,039
School alone can't stop it.

904
01:05:18,339 --> 01:05:19,560
Parents have to be aware of it.

905
01:05:20,812 --> 01:05:25,176
Students have to be aware of it and report it when it's happening to them, especially the older ones.

906
01:05:25,857 --> 01:05:28,259
And we need to make it a shared responsibility.

907
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:30,081
Otherwise, it's going to happen.

908
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:37,187
And the important thing is that if it is reported to us that it's properly followed, we follow up on it.

909
01:05:37,587 --> 01:05:38,528
And people are brought in.

910
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:40,970
And if there are consequences, we deal with it.

911
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:45,595
The other factor is that we file discipline reports with the state every year.

912
01:05:46,626 --> 01:05:54,388
And if there was a situation where a person did something that rose to the level of requiring discipline, that would be part of the filing with the state.

913
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,408
And that's one of the categories.

914
01:05:56,428 --> 01:05:56,888
We have Ms.

915
01:05:56,928 --> 01:05:58,749
Kretz, then Sebastian, then Ms.

916
01:05:58,769 --> 01:06:01,589
DiBenedetto, and Mr. Musso.

917
01:06:02,009 --> 01:06:15,172
I know where I work, and I deal with a lot of different districts, they have hotlines where if I call the main number for my district, the line will pick up, if you're calling to report bullying, please dial number two.

918
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:22,924
and you can call directly, and you can leave a voicemail anonymously to report the bullying, and it gets documented.

919
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:31,427
And if the person doesn't feel comfortable, it could be the parent, it could be a friend, and it can be checked out.

920
01:06:32,267 --> 01:06:38,410
So I think that's a good suggestion, having a separate line to our Medford Public Schools number.

921
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,491
And it would just be recorded maybe by the secretaries

922
01:06:42,345 --> 01:06:46,187
you know, hopefully there wouldn't be a lot of incidents, you know, but.

923
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:53,350
And hopefully this, I think this issue is something that could be taken up on a subcommittee and that could be a suggestion that is flushed out.

924
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:54,970
Sebastian?

925
01:06:55,330 --> 01:07:00,853
Yeah, that certainly, it would be an interesting thing because I think that's the concern that some of these reports aren't getting heard.

926
01:07:01,293 --> 01:07:02,473
So it's a report that Ms.

927
01:07:02,493 --> 01:07:03,314
Rodriguez is bringing.

928
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:11,537
Um, and I would also say that I think that the policy is worth looking at over again, you know, in a, in a subcommittee setting.

929
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:16,894
just for the reason that social media is so much faster than even 2010.

930
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:30,182
And it just makes it so much easier for somebody to type something really quickly without thinking of it and without realizing that they're writing it to another human being.

931
01:07:31,562 --> 01:07:35,324
And so that reason I would recommend that the policy itself would be looked at again.

932
01:07:35,544 --> 01:07:35,865
Thank you.

933
01:07:37,142 --> 01:07:37,302
Ms.

934
01:07:37,322 --> 01:07:38,302
D. Benedetto.

935
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:38,802
Thank you.

936
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:45,544
I agree that we get a lot of emails and phone calls about bullying in our school district.

937
01:07:45,844 --> 01:08:00,407
I'm not sure that every principal or person in our district is really filling out these forms in an equal, you know, everybody might be doing it differently.

938
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:03,187
So I think it's something that needs to be redone.

939
01:08:03,767 --> 01:08:06,088
And maybe we can do an online form

940
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:21,674
similar to the PTO form so that way we can really see in the district if there is areas that need extra help and we can put extra people there to make those changes happen or like a crisis team if there's a need for that.

941
01:08:21,994 --> 01:08:28,458
But I don't believe that curriculum is the subcommittee I would pick and that's what I was on my phone doing trying to look at a subcommittee.

942
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:32,285
Groupings and which one this might fit in.

943
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:33,446
And I think rules.

944
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:38,269
We need to have rules in the school of how people treat each other and how people react.

945
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:44,353
And when people aren't following the rules, then we need to have policies and procedures in place that are very clear.

946
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:45,493
This is going to happen.

947
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:46,374
This is going to happen.

948
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:50,897
And once you pass this point, this is your discipline for it.

949
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:53,138
We need to go to that point.

950
01:08:57,261 --> 01:08:58,662
Do we want to make it a committee of the home?

951
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,506
I think it's a big enough issue.

952
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:24,871
But my other point is do we have staffs, these are from my notes from the paperwork earlier, do we have staffs of bullying completed for this year and do we collect them from the different schools and do we keep them in a central administration and how are they reviewed so that way the beginning of next year, last year's aren't just thrown away.

953
01:09:25,171 --> 01:09:26,511
Do we know that this child

954
01:09:26,851 --> 01:09:29,092
who is bullying is clearly needing help.

955
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:33,035
And are we getting them that help so that the bullying no longer continues?

956
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:34,836
Like, there's a need there.

957
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:37,798
And if we're not meeting that need, that the behavior is going to continue.

958
01:09:38,278 --> 01:09:43,281
So we need to track it not only yearly, but year to year.

959
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:44,402
I don't know.

960
01:09:44,422 --> 01:09:45,882
My brain's fried for words.

961
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:47,303
But you get what I mean.

962
01:09:48,804 --> 01:09:52,506
So I would suggest it goes to the rules committees instead.

963
01:09:52,586 --> 01:09:54,367
Or a full committee of the whole.

964
01:09:56,871 --> 01:10:02,196
I was just wondering if we could get a report on the rates of the forms being filled out for each of the schools.

965
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:07,200
I don't have any reason to believe that different schools have different rates of bullying.

966
01:10:07,821 --> 01:10:13,126
I just want to, not that I don't trust the principals, but I'd like to know that the principals are really filling

967
01:10:13,924 --> 01:10:17,145
They don't necessarily fill them out, but they're really getting these.

968
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:18,906
They're being used.

969
01:10:19,186 --> 01:10:19,406
Right.

970
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:20,847
This is being used.

971
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:26,229
I mean, it's the policy, but one school gives you 30 of these a year, and another school gives you two.

972
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:32,011
Either that school that gives you two is doing something very different that we need to replicate.

973
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:37,948
or we should have a conversation with the school about how they are actually doing the reporting.

974
01:10:38,248 --> 01:10:40,990
And both of those are things we would want to know and figure out.

975
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:48,575
So I just have a motion to get the rates, just like one year rates of that.

976
01:10:48,635 --> 01:10:57,981
So there's a motion to get the rates of these forms that are being, I don't know, where do the principals, do the principals send them somewhere once they fill them out?

977
01:10:58,301 --> 01:11:03,004
No, they're generally handled by them unless it's going to something more serious and reaches a point.

978
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:09,494
But Mr. Johnson's here, maybe he can give us a quick snapshot of what happens at the Roberts since Cheryl was here about the Roberts.

979
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:22,303
Sure, and I just while we wait for him to walk up, I want to make one point is I didn't come here to be like let's take all the bullies and suspend them out of the school because I think the issue is a lot more complicated than punishing the bully.

980
01:11:22,763 --> 01:11:29,828
I'd like more education around the socio and emotional about how to treat each other and that just because you're mad at your friend doesn't mean you

981
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:35,351
relentlessly torture them, and then three days later, they're best friends again, but they've done damage to each other.

982
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:36,251
So I just want to point that out.

983
01:11:36,271 --> 01:11:36,791
Thank you, Ms.

984
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:37,351
Rodriguez.

985
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:38,972
So Mr. Johnson's here.

986
01:11:38,992 --> 01:11:42,792
Maybe he can give us a snapshot as to his experience with the Robertsons.

987
01:11:43,573 --> 01:11:45,333
Good evening, Kirk Johnson, Roberts School Principal.

988
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:46,533
I think Ms.

989
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,394
Rodriguez has brought something to our attention.

990
01:11:48,894 --> 01:11:55,395
I think generally, I think listen to Sebastian, in 2010, the media and social media has changed a lot.

991
01:11:55,883 --> 01:11:59,826
I think as a principal, and all of our principals, we do take bullying seriously.

992
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:01,307
We follow the guidelines.

993
01:12:01,327 --> 01:12:06,591
We do have a detailed policy that's in our handbook that we follow.

994
01:12:07,092 --> 01:12:15,018
And I think that what we have to be careful of is that sometimes what might look like bullying is typical sometimes behavior that students just have towards each other.

995
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:16,519
And I think Ms.

996
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:22,984
Rodriguez brought a good point, is that they could be disputing today, but by Thursday, they're back to being best friends.

997
01:12:23,524 --> 01:12:25,466
And I think that's part of growing up.

998
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:33,261
But I think what's been added, just since I've been an administrator as a teacher, is the whole idea of technology.

999
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:38,784
And as Sebastian mentioned, it has grown immensely since 2010, or just since 2016.

1000
01:12:38,884 --> 01:12:41,386
So I think we have to take that into consideration.

1001
01:12:41,406 --> 01:12:49,350
If we're looking at parent training, I think we should look at the whole social media aspect of things for parents, because it is changing daily.

1002
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:53,633
We don't see a lot of it happening in the building, but it does happen outside of school.

1003
01:12:54,111 --> 01:12:55,292
and may trickle into the school.

1004
01:12:55,332 --> 01:12:58,294
Not as much at the elementary level, but maybe our middle and high school levels.

1005
01:12:58,674 --> 01:12:59,215
Sebastian?

1006
01:12:59,735 --> 01:13:06,419
Do you see the existing policy as appropriate to deal with social media?

1007
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,322
You know what, I think it could look, I've never looked at Sebastian.

1008
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:11,763
I think it has changed a little bit.

1009
01:13:11,863 --> 01:13:14,125
Only because I was talking to students, there's so many things.

1010
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:18,287
It's just not Snapchat, there's Twitter, there's something I learned today called,

1011
01:13:20,148 --> 01:13:22,309
that might be as well.

1012
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:26,411
Something to do with music.

1013
01:13:26,471 --> 01:13:35,095
So the kiddos are in a music app, but they can also, from that music app, go into private messaging.

1014
01:13:35,775 --> 01:13:39,177
So they start on the music end of things, but then it goes into a private messaging.

1015
01:13:39,237 --> 01:13:45,360
So it may start off as a really innocent way of communicating with their peers, then it goes into a more

1016
01:13:47,138 --> 01:13:50,919
a meaner sense where they might be doing some private messaging to each other.

1017
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,300
And that's just, I think, fairly new as well.

1018
01:13:53,701 --> 01:14:01,343
And every day, as an administrator, and teachers learning all these new things that our youngsters really know a lot more than the adults.

1019
01:14:01,744 --> 01:14:04,205
I don't want to be so admitted, but it's true.

1020
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:10,387
So we have, just to make the key points so far, so Ms.

1021
01:14:10,427 --> 01:14:13,088
Kratz had suggested the phone line.

1022
01:14:13,808 --> 01:14:14,989
Sebastian suggested,

1023
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:18,258
looking at the policy again and updating it.

1024
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:24,502
I mean, I think the policy has strong points, I would say, just for the social media.

1025
01:14:24,622 --> 01:14:25,083
Yes, OK.

1026
01:14:27,024 --> 01:14:29,486
Paul, Mr. Russo, did you have a suggestion?

1027
01:14:30,147 --> 01:14:37,252
Just to get a simple number of these that have been received by the principals at each of the schools for one year snapshot.

1028
01:14:38,513 --> 01:14:40,995
So just asking the principals how many forms they fill out a year.

1029
01:14:41,275 --> 01:14:41,435
Yeah.

1030
01:14:42,398 --> 01:15:04,183
And I mean, I honestly haven't spent enough time on the forms, probably should have, to know is there really more about these forms like do we, you know, I mean, I'm guessing at the elementary school there's not a lot of sexual harassment or stalking, but you know, I don't know what these things would look like.

1031
01:15:04,243 --> 01:15:09,004
But this form, this is a state form, correct?

1032
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:13,247
that is compatible with state requirements.

1033
01:15:13,307 --> 01:15:13,547
Okay.

1034
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:18,592
And, but this is, is this form just kept as a paper or is it put into a system?

1035
01:15:18,752 --> 01:15:20,774
No, that is, I believe on the district's website.

1036
01:15:20,894 --> 01:15:25,399
So I think if a parent is concerned, they can complete that and give it to the budding administrator.

1037
01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:29,523
So I believe they have, that's accessible to our, all of our parents.

1038
01:15:30,644 --> 01:15:33,507
But is this data presently coded and

1039
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:38,148
You know, can you just quickly say how many teasing incidents were there?

1040
01:15:38,589 --> 01:15:40,430
Or is this like a huge amount of effort to collate?

1041
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,290
I think we can.

1042
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:47,334
I think as a building principle, if we document teasing every day, we'd have volumes.

1043
01:15:48,695 --> 01:15:48,995
Right.

1044
01:15:49,015 --> 01:15:50,336
That's why I use that example.

1045
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:55,580
I think we really stick to what's really, really the more like the other ones.

1046
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,720
We don't have sexual harassment.

1047
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:00,203
But if there's things like that, that's what we would key in in our logs.

1048
01:16:00,983 --> 01:16:06,810
But a lot of our issues are just dealt with day-to-day interaction with students and teachers, administrators, staff members.

1049
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:16,681
I mean, just in the cafeteria alone, we probably have, I don't know how many interaction students that, if you look at it, it would be just, let's talk to your neighbor, do you talk about it.

1050
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:21,366
We kind of deal with it at our level more on the spot, as a teachable moment.

1051
01:16:22,835 --> 01:16:23,796
Mr. Ruggiero.

1052
01:16:24,196 --> 01:16:24,356
Yeah.

1053
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:28,339
I wanted to know, have you noticed like a spike or change in incidents of reporting?

1054
01:16:28,379 --> 01:16:30,160
I'm just speaking from your personal experience.

1055
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,781
Obviously you don't have the numbers in front of you.

1056
01:16:33,184 --> 01:16:36,805
Has the rate been consistent, or have you noticed a spike?

1057
01:16:37,345 --> 01:16:40,606
In terms of a school year, or in the past few years?

1058
01:16:40,746 --> 01:16:41,666
In the past few years.

1059
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:44,027
Have you noticed, like I'm just talking about the general trend.

1060
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:49,368
Would you say that the trend of bullying has increased, decreased, or remained about the same?

1061
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:51,288
I would say probably either decreased.

1062
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:58,410
But I think what we're seeing an uptick is in the social media, because a lot of our students have devices at home.

1063
01:17:00,002 --> 01:17:07,926
And they are sometimes doing a lot of interacting with their peers, either through games or through the social media parts of things.

1064
01:17:07,946 --> 01:17:13,749
So I would say the uptick has been more with youngsters having access to social media.

1065
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,451
Not to say it's been bullying parts of it, but the access to social media.

1066
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:26,316
It could just be that youngster said something to me yesterday on social media, but it might have been a bullying, but could have led up to bullying if they didn't deal with it right away.

1067
01:17:26,983 --> 01:17:32,847
Madam Speaker, I'd like to recommend that we have like to make a motion that we review this issue at a committee of the whole.

1068
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:41,933
I feel like there's enough here just there's we we have enough questions between us just and I would like to specifically look at cyber issues as well.

1069
01:17:43,294 --> 01:17:44,875
So hold on Mr. Nelson.

1070
01:17:45,515 --> 01:17:46,156
Mr. Russo.

1071
01:17:46,336 --> 01:17:47,036
Yes.

1072
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:54,081
I have sort of a technical question around bullying and the school systems responsibility.

1073
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:56,082
I certainly think that providing

1074
01:17:56,578 --> 01:18:18,443
educational opportunities for parents and how to handle this is important, but if we don't draw the line anywhere around social media bullying, then literally 365 days a year, we're on the hook for, a kid sends a nasty text to another kid in the middle of the summer, how is that any different than a weekend?

1075
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:21,023
And if we are going to

1076
01:18:26,082 --> 01:18:39,637
be responsible or, I guess responsible is the right word, for dealing with the bullying that may be happening, this is not going to be a free activity to do.

1077
01:18:40,999 --> 01:18:46,845
And we'd have budget implications and staffing, which if we want to do that, I'm

1078
01:18:47,403 --> 01:18:48,784
not necessarily against it.

1079
01:18:48,965 --> 01:18:53,629
But as Ms.

1080
01:18:53,649 --> 01:19:00,296
Rodriguez said before, when I went to school, bullying was on the bus and was in the school building.

1081
01:19:00,376 --> 01:19:01,837
And then thankfully, I went home.

1082
01:19:01,857 --> 01:19:02,778
I was a bullied kid.

1083
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:04,680
And I went home, and I was yay.

1084
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,082
I'm not back at school anymore.

1085
01:19:08,304 --> 01:19:10,706
But that doesn't happen anymore.

1086
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:23,831
But I would not expect my school administrators or my principal to trek to my house or help deal with my being bullied outside of the school setting.

1087
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:29,656
I think when it trickles back into the school day, that's the issue.

1088
01:19:29,676 --> 01:19:34,380
When it comes back into school, which of course, I mean, it's not like if you're bullied at home or on a weekend.

1089
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:37,891
and you show up on Monday, that experience doesn't go away.

1090
01:19:38,432 --> 01:19:40,152
So I'm not saying we don't deal with it then.

1091
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:47,456
But filling out an incident report of the bullying that took place over the weekend, or school vacation week, or the summer.

1092
01:19:49,737 --> 01:19:53,639
But I would expect that we respond very seriously to these kinds of reports.

1093
01:19:54,980 --> 01:20:01,183
But if we don't have any boundaries on this, then do we have a system that can really handle that?

1094
01:20:02,287 --> 01:20:03,688
should we have a system.

1095
01:20:03,728 --> 01:20:12,012
We do need a committee of the whole.

1096
01:20:12,792 --> 01:20:23,817
So I think the sleeping dog in the room is the fact that social media also brings out the worst in parents and citizens who bully each other on a regular basis.

1097
01:20:24,428 --> 01:20:33,853
You know, you don't have to go very far on social media to find out that adults are pounding each other on a regular basis, and they're certainly setting bad role models for their young people.

1098
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:44,698
And this is a bigger issue than schools, because social media has provided a forum for adults to insult each other on a regular basis.

1099
01:20:44,758 --> 01:20:47,079
I've seen it on recent months and weeks.

1100
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:52,442
You just people saying things that are really horrific, and then you expect kids not to do the same thing.

1101
01:20:53,537 --> 01:20:54,017
That's tough.

1102
01:20:54,077 --> 01:20:55,858
So it's a bigger issue than just the kids.

1103
01:20:56,499 --> 01:21:06,385
It's really something that has to come into the community and people have to say, social media provides opportunity, but it also provides a downside if it's not used properly.

1104
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:11,688
The lack of civility that seems to exist in these days is quite apparent.

1105
01:21:12,308 --> 01:21:16,571
We need to do something about that because we are the role models for our young people.

1106
01:21:17,512 --> 01:21:18,052
And if we're not

1107
01:21:18,672 --> 01:21:22,375
using that role model particularly well, what do you expect the young people to do?

1108
01:21:22,395 --> 01:21:24,076
They'll do exactly the same thing.

1109
01:21:25,357 --> 01:21:32,122
So Mr. Ruggiero made a motion to make this issue a committee of the whole for social media.

1110
01:21:32,322 --> 01:21:33,963
I think it's a wide net.

1111
01:21:34,484 --> 01:21:35,304
So is there a second?

1112
01:21:35,885 --> 01:21:38,266
I would just like to ask another question.

1113
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:38,787
No.

1114
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:42,529
I would just like to request that we not even consider a date.

1115
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:43,910
I mean,

1116
01:21:46,312 --> 01:21:53,819
I mean, we have to do this, and I'm not suggesting it's not critically important, but at some point, I should probably sleep this year.

1117
01:21:56,922 --> 01:22:03,668
And we have to, in my mind, this, while it's important, the priority is the superintendent search.

1118
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:10,614
And there's only so many nights a week, so let's get a name, and let's get somebody hired,

1119
01:22:13,405 --> 01:22:14,885
put it right on the list to do right away.

1120
01:22:15,886 --> 01:22:18,126
Usually we schedule or say within a week or two.

1121
01:22:18,806 --> 01:22:22,167
And if we try to... After the superintendent is hired.

1122
01:22:22,267 --> 01:22:22,407
Okay.

1123
01:22:22,467 --> 01:22:23,047
I'll accept that.

1124
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,248
Okay.

1125
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:30,649
So, we will have a committee of the whole... After the superintendent search is completed.

1126
01:22:31,349 --> 01:22:32,410
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

1127
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:32,650
Thank you.

1128
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:40,604
So next is a motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1129
01:22:41,265 --> 01:22:45,908
So moved.

1130
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:48,850
All those in favor, aye.

1131
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:51,332
All those opposed, none.

1132
01:22:52,573 --> 01:22:53,094
Let's go.

1133
01:22:54,515 --> 01:22:57,797
Next is the report on professional development, Alice Feedback.

1134
01:22:57,817 --> 01:23:01,000
I'm going to call on our assistant superintendent to read this report.

1135
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:11,916
So this is our report on professional development on March 21st.

1136
01:23:12,636 --> 01:23:21,504
As scheduled and planned, the mandated early release professional development program took place the afternoon of March 21st.

1137
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:27,248
All teachers and specialists in grades K through 12 participated in this program.

1138
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:32,092
The program for the high school and the middle school teachers began at 12.45 in the Karen Theater.

1139
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:41,097
and Lieutenant Paul Gavino and Detective Mark Giganti facilitated the meeting with an introduction to Alice.

1140
01:23:42,157 --> 01:23:48,159
There was an opportunity for teachers to ask questions before breaking into smaller groups for further discussion.

1141
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:58,220
The elementary program began at two o'clock with a repeat of the introduction to Alice, and elementary staff then remained in the theater for questions.

1142
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:01,501
Our intent in presenting this program

1143
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:10,516
was to introduce staff to the ALICE as well as obtain their feedback concerning moving forward with this program.

1144
01:24:11,217 --> 01:24:16,140
Teachers were asked to complete a brief questionnaire online after the program.

1145
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:21,964
The questions were, what were some of the points you learned about ALICE in the presentation?

1146
01:24:22,704 --> 01:24:25,546
What do you believe are some of the benefits of ALICE?

1147
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:30,089
What concerns do you have about implementing ALICE in the district?

1148
01:24:30,835 --> 01:24:36,578
And please list suggestions for future district trainings related to school safety and security.

1149
01:24:37,599 --> 01:24:45,783
We are currently collating some data from the breakout discussions and the surveys to determine how to continue to offer training to teachers.

1150
01:24:46,483 --> 01:24:57,729
Many teachers cited the fact that many of the ALICE, many of the parts of ALICE were already being implemented and they are already in place in the district.

1151
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:04,186
And once we have all the surveys collected and collated, we will share that information with you.

1152
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:05,067
Thank you.

1153
01:25:05,087 --> 01:25:06,148
Are there questions for Ms.

1154
01:25:06,168 --> 01:25:06,609
Caldwell?

1155
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:09,972
Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1156
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:10,673
Second.

1157
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:12,776
Oh, I see two hands first.

1158
01:25:13,236 --> 01:25:13,396
Ms.

1159
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:14,057
DiBenedetto?

1160
01:25:14,197 --> 01:25:14,377
Ms.

1161
01:25:14,397 --> 01:25:19,403
Caldwell, do you have a timeline for the presenting the survey results?

1162
01:25:19,423 --> 01:25:21,045
So we're collating all the information.

1163
01:25:22,103 --> 01:25:26,465
Michelle Bissell, who is my administrative assistant, is doing surveys that have been online.

1164
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:33,929
And then Dr. Rigodelli's secretary is collating some of the information that was done in the workshops.

1165
01:25:34,549 --> 01:25:36,390
We could probably have it done by the next meeting.

1166
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,851
That's fine.

1167
01:25:37,951 --> 01:25:42,253
I'll just add it to the reports list, and when you get a second to present it, that would be great.

1168
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:42,914
Thank you.

1169
01:25:43,254 --> 01:25:43,614
You're welcome.

1170
01:25:43,794 --> 01:25:44,274
Sebastian?

1171
01:25:44,294 --> 01:25:44,694
Good, thanks.

1172
01:25:44,795 --> 01:25:45,075
You're good?

1173
01:25:45,195 --> 01:25:45,495
OK.

1174
01:25:45,555 --> 01:25:47,416
So all those in favor of accepting this report?

1175
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:47,656
Aye.

1176
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:47,736
Aye.

1177
01:25:48,096 --> 01:25:48,236
Aye.

1178
01:25:48,396 --> 01:25:48,757
Aye.

1179
01:25:50,197 --> 01:25:51,398
Accepted and placed on file.

1180
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:59,657
So next is, we have pre-budget reports tonight for English language arts, social studies, science, and health services.

1181
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,240
Director of Humanities, Ms.

1182
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:06,323
Canieza, will report first.

1183
01:26:10,566 --> 01:26:12,008
Good evening again, how are you?

1184
01:26:13,358 --> 01:26:15,960
I believe I'm starting with the English Language Arts, correct?

1185
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,220
Yes.

1186
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,341
OK.

1187
01:26:17,361 --> 01:26:18,522
So I'm going to go through the bullets.

1188
01:26:18,562 --> 01:26:20,883
You have a fuller budget report.

1189
01:26:20,903 --> 01:26:21,704
You have a full report.

1190
01:26:21,744 --> 01:26:25,507
And then I'll look at the overall page.

1191
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:31,911
The English Language Arts Department is dedicated to supporting all teachers in the district who teach this core academic framework.

1192
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:37,555
We are aligned to the 2017 Massachusetts English Language Curriculum Framework.

1193
01:26:38,286 --> 01:26:45,309
At the elementary level, we have a variety of instructional materials, including the Journey's Common Core and additional trade books.

1194
01:26:45,869 --> 01:26:55,753
And at the middle and high school level, we focus on Houghton Mifflin anthologies, a variety of periodicals, fictional, informational texts, and e-readers.

1195
01:26:56,273 --> 01:26:59,314
There are 28 teachers in the department, grades 6 through 12.

1196
01:27:00,475 --> 01:27:05,417
The funding, thanks to the generosity of the school committee, was appropriated as the following for this year.

1197
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:09,700
Funding included supporting of our Amazon Kindle Fires.

1198
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:17,886
We have found that the use of Kindles allows for durability and also allows us to use some free books that are available on the public domain.

1199
01:27:18,827 --> 01:27:25,993
We had some additional needs for journeys due to an increase in a few different classroom numbers at a few different elementary schools.

1200
01:27:26,853 --> 01:27:35,080
We had instructional materials in the middle and high school, including periodicals as well as informational and fictional texts and general classroom supplies.

1201
01:27:36,467 --> 01:27:41,950
A few accomplishments, if I may, of the department this year is one thing is we updated the district curriculum.

1202
01:27:42,371 --> 01:27:45,633
The state did publish a new 2017 framework.

1203
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,534
Changes were not significant, but they were there.

1204
01:27:48,755 --> 01:27:56,099
And so we have worked hard to update our curriculum, our district curriculum, our units, and a variety of assessments on that.

1205
01:27:57,454 --> 01:28:04,621
We had high school students participate in Boston University's New Noises, which is a playwright's project festival.

1206
01:28:06,562 --> 01:28:08,804
We had strong scholastic writing award success.

1207
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:13,389
We had strong success on MCAS and advanced placement assessments at the high school.

1208
01:28:13,949 --> 01:28:22,217
And we continued as a department to continue collaborating with outside partnerships, presenting additional opportunities for students.

1209
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:33,367
In terms of the budget, I am requesting an additional $2,400 to support our Study Island, which is an assessment that we are using at both the McGlynn and the Andrews Middle School.

1210
01:28:33,867 --> 01:28:40,730
This year, we were able to fund that through a grant, and we're not 100% sure that the grant funding will be available for next year.

1211
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:42,911
Great.

1212
01:28:42,991 --> 01:28:43,332
Thank you.

1213
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:43,912
Thank you.

1214
01:28:44,072 --> 01:28:47,214
So the only ask is $2,400 for Study Island?

1215
01:28:47,454 --> 01:28:48,394
Additional, yes.

1216
01:28:48,714 --> 01:28:49,214
Thank you, Ms.

1217
01:28:49,254 --> 01:28:50,035
DeSoto.

1218
01:28:50,055 --> 01:28:52,056
Does anyone have questions for Director Jimenez?

1219
01:28:52,743 --> 01:29:00,088
Yes, just for the response to intervention, do we need any additional monies for planning for that?

1220
01:29:00,308 --> 01:29:00,928
Yes.

1221
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:07,092
We have already at the middle school implemented some additional, we used some funding to implement that.

1222
01:29:07,492 --> 01:29:12,415
We are still assessing the different assessments in terms of next year for the elementary schools.

1223
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:18,039
So that is in my head, but I think that we will be OK with that, and Ms.

1224
01:29:18,059 --> 01:29:18,819
Caldwell and I have

1225
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,741
been talking a little bit more.

1226
01:29:20,801 --> 01:29:22,662
But for now, I'm comfortable with what we have.

1227
01:29:23,102 --> 01:29:26,403
But the study island helps for the RTI at the middle school.

1228
01:29:26,443 --> 01:29:31,445
So I definitely think we would need that in terms of placement for the kids.

1229
01:29:32,606 --> 01:29:33,026
OK.

1230
01:29:33,106 --> 01:29:33,306
Right.

1231
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:36,147
So I'm just wondering whether we're going to need to build in more money for that.

1232
01:29:37,448 --> 01:29:40,329
It just seemed earlier that when we talked about that.

1233
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:42,290
Thank you.

1234
01:29:43,271 --> 01:29:44,111
Excuse me, Dr. Kaye.

1235
01:29:44,867 --> 01:29:45,187
Yes.

1236
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:48,849
We are continuing to have conversations about RTI.

1237
01:29:48,869 --> 01:29:50,169
We're looking at different models.

1238
01:29:50,729 --> 01:29:59,553
We are using some of grant monies to purchase some assessments that we will need for next year, but we still have grant money to do that with.

1239
01:29:59,573 --> 01:30:04,315
That's the Fountas-Pinnell that I had mentioned before and words their way.

1240
01:30:05,635 --> 01:30:12,438
I think Dr. Chiesi and I are going to look at the models of RTI, and when we finish that,

1241
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,201
there may be personnel that we'd like to hire.

1242
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:21,124
So that's really what I was getting at, because I know some systems do have paid tutors.

1243
01:30:21,404 --> 01:30:21,704
That's right.

1244
01:30:21,724 --> 01:30:32,168
And I don't know whether it's something which we can get volunteer tutors or whether we are going to need, because of consistency, to have paid tutors and how much that might cost us.

1245
01:30:32,228 --> 01:30:37,611
So I guess I just thought that might be a budget item.

1246
01:30:37,851 --> 01:30:42,413
It is important for us to consider this, because we want to make sure that the people that we hire

1247
01:30:43,158 --> 01:30:50,063
our educators and not just someone we're going to train off the street to work with our kiddos.

1248
01:30:50,104 --> 01:30:54,807
So we have to look carefully at the resumes of people that we hire.

1249
01:30:55,187 --> 01:30:55,448
OK.

1250
01:30:56,428 --> 01:30:56,809
Thank you.

1251
01:30:57,309 --> 01:30:58,210
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

1252
01:30:59,111 --> 01:31:07,397
I think at one point we possibly talked about hiring retired teachers to come back because they have the skill set already and because it's part time.

1253
01:31:07,855 --> 01:31:18,162
But by making them employees, they hold to, rather than volunteers, they hold to a set schedule.

1254
01:31:18,303 --> 01:31:23,106
It's a job and not just, oh, I can't make it today, when the children need these services.

1255
01:31:23,846 --> 01:31:30,611
So it's a win-win situation for us if we can hire retired people if they want to come back and do some work for us in ELA and or MAP.

1256
01:31:31,252 --> 01:31:35,275
And maybe even hiring students from

1257
01:31:36,313 --> 01:31:48,163
some of the local colleges that have majors in elementary that are also trying to afford to live in our area might also be a good way to look at that as well.

1258
01:31:49,304 --> 01:31:59,332
So, yeah, and I really, I spoke last year at budget time over the importance of RTI and offered, you know, and you said you would track it this year.

1259
01:31:59,372 --> 01:32:04,636
I appreciate all the work that is going into this and I hope to see

1260
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:15,031
you know, maybe a number that you need us to help you with to move forward and really help our students raise their scores in their learning ability as well.

1261
01:32:15,051 --> 01:32:16,373
That's the key more than anything else.

1262
01:32:16,413 --> 01:32:16,713
We'll do it.

1263
01:32:16,733 --> 01:32:17,454
That's the plan.

1264
01:32:18,014 --> 01:32:18,355
You know.

1265
01:32:18,695 --> 01:32:19,115
Thank you.

1266
01:32:19,256 --> 01:32:19,596
Thanks.

1267
01:32:19,836 --> 01:32:22,719
Dr. Keyes, do you want to stay and do social studies?

1268
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:22,799
Yes.

1269
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:23,420
That'd be great.

1270
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:23,740
Thank you.

1271
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,465
And if I may add, even just today with RTI, I was at three different elementary schools observing

1272
01:32:29,622 --> 01:32:31,723
what they were doing within the classroom.

1273
01:32:31,763 --> 01:32:35,865
So it's been quite a lot of work and appreciate all the support as well from all of you.

1274
01:32:37,126 --> 01:32:38,327
Okay, moving to social studies.

1275
01:32:41,068 --> 01:32:45,790
The Medford Public Schools is committed to providing all students with academic and problem-solving skills.

1276
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:53,494
Here at the social studies department, we look at the personal development, we focus on responsible citizenship, and also lifelong learning.

1277
01:32:54,134 --> 01:32:58,016
There are 26 teachers, grades 6 through 12, in the social studies department.

1278
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:10,964
This year, thanks to your generosity once again, we were able to purchase new 11th grade social studies textbooks which were essential as the other ones were outdated and certainly were due for that.

1279
01:33:11,064 --> 01:33:14,585
So that was a wonderful piece that we funded.

1280
01:33:14,986 --> 01:33:22,788
We also were able to purchase some additional online subscriptions, replacement textbooks, some additional grade eight textbooks.

1281
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:27,410
We had new textbooks for them a few years back and there was an additional need based on enrollment.

1282
01:33:28,038 --> 01:33:39,362
periodicals, and also some additional books for some classes that we added at the high school, which included advanced placement human geography and a standard economics class.

1283
01:33:39,422 --> 01:33:46,824
If you recall a few years ago, we added in honors economics to the curriculum for grade 12 as the social studies elective.

1284
01:33:47,444 --> 01:33:53,746
And this year we were able to also offer a standard section of that, which obviously required some additional books.

1285
01:33:53,806 --> 01:33:55,547
So we appreciate your support.

1286
01:33:56,183 --> 01:34:06,886
Funding has also supported numerous authentic learning opportunities that our department is always involved in, including our model United Nations, which is at both the high school and the middle school.

1287
01:34:08,066 --> 01:34:10,206
Our mock trial registration costs.

1288
01:34:11,887 --> 01:34:15,988
We have an upcoming visit to the Royal House for our grade five students.

1289
01:34:16,488 --> 01:34:22,949
We are participating on Day on the Hill, which I hope that we will see some of you there as well, on April 25th.

1290
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:24,810
And we have Law Day as another

1291
01:34:26,132 --> 01:34:28,894
authentic learning opportunity that students will be participating in.

1292
01:34:29,254 --> 01:34:31,295
So your funding has helped support that as well.

1293
01:34:32,096 --> 01:34:37,499
In terms of accomplishments for this school year, we have continued to increase our community and partnerships.

1294
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:53,850
Excuse me, we had Veterans Day, National History Day, again, Mock Trial, as I mentioned, Model UN, a lot of different partnerships and support have gone into creating these learning experiences for the students that go beyond the classroom walls.

1295
01:34:55,549 --> 01:34:57,991
We also have had an increase in the senior classes.

1296
01:34:58,111 --> 01:35:01,573
We, as I just mentioned, added the advanced placement human geography.

1297
01:35:01,633 --> 01:35:03,174
We added standards economics.

1298
01:35:03,634 --> 01:35:13,381
And actually, over the past four years, we have added or reinstated eight additional social studies classes, which is an elective for grade 12.

1299
01:35:13,481 --> 01:35:17,223
And we're looking at adding a few other classes next year for our seniors.

1300
01:35:17,263 --> 01:35:24,268
Because again, grade 12 allows us the opportunity to kind of go beyond what the basic standard curriculum allows us to.

1301
01:35:25,188 --> 01:35:28,591
And also, Global Scholars was a huge success once again.

1302
01:35:29,191 --> 01:35:39,379
Chromebooks have continued to support this program, and that allows for greater collaboration across the grade levels, but also country to country, as you know and as you've seen with this amazing program.

1303
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:48,927
This year, our social studies teacher, Mr. Frank Zizzo, had the opportunity to attend the Global Cities Paris Symposium, representing Medford Public Schools.

1304
01:35:50,925 --> 01:36:02,208
This year, in terms of requests for budget, what I am asking for is an additional $3,000 to support curriculum work that will be needed once the new social studies framework is released.

1305
01:36:02,568 --> 01:36:05,789
There is a new social studies framework that is currently in draft form.

1306
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:07,069
It has been for several months.

1307
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:11,951
And it creates considerable change to many of the grade levels.

1308
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:19,993
So looking forward to when it will be adopted, I do think we're going to need some additional support in terms of making that

1309
01:36:20,673 --> 01:36:24,196
a real change into the district once it is accepted.

1310
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:25,456
That's it.

1311
01:36:25,476 --> 01:36:26,297
Thank you, Dr. Piazza.

1312
01:36:26,317 --> 01:36:26,977
Any questions?

1313
01:36:27,137 --> 01:36:27,718
Oh, thank you.

1314
01:36:27,738 --> 01:36:28,959
That was thoughtful.

1315
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:29,379
Thank you.

1316
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:36,244
Does anyone have questions about social studies, achievements, funding?

1317
01:36:37,524 --> 01:36:37,865
All right.

1318
01:36:38,565 --> 01:36:39,045
Thank you, Dr. Piazza.

1319
01:36:39,065 --> 01:36:40,026
I appreciate your time.

1320
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:40,827
Thank you very much.

1321
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:42,007
Mr. Bellson has a question.

1322
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:42,468
Oh, thank you.

1323
01:36:42,488 --> 01:36:43,468
I don't have a question so much.

1324
01:36:43,528 --> 01:36:44,769
I just want to make a comment.

1325
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:48,672
Oh.

1326
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:50,431
I just want to point something out.

1327
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:58,295
As these reports come up, these reports are really great transition reports for my successor because they talk about what's going on.

1328
01:36:58,555 --> 01:37:00,056
They talk about what we're going to do.

1329
01:37:00,637 --> 01:37:09,482
So just so you're aware, these are the kinds of reports that I would forward to the person you select going forward so they can actually see what the departments are doing.

1330
01:37:10,612 --> 01:37:18,538
as they come in, so put them over because it also may inform questions you may want to ask as you continue to go through the process.

1331
01:37:19,179 --> 01:37:26,725
Because these are the kinds of things that are really specific to the school that a person coming in might not know off the top.

1332
01:37:27,466 --> 01:37:28,386
And so I just want to mention it.

1333
01:37:28,807 --> 01:37:29,988
And by the way, Nicole did a great job.

1334
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:30,688
Thank you.

1335
01:37:30,728 --> 01:37:31,129
Thank you.

1336
01:37:31,149 --> 01:37:32,250
Thank you very much.

1337
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:32,630
Thank you.

1338
01:37:33,019 --> 01:37:40,765
Next up, we have Director of Science, Mr. Cieri, to talk about both the science pre-budget and the report on the science fair.

1339
01:37:40,805 --> 01:37:49,732
Can I just make a motion to accept the reports that Dr. Kaye has brought forward?

1340
01:37:51,373 --> 01:37:54,095
All those in favor of accepting the pre-budget report?

1341
01:37:54,415 --> 01:37:55,216
Aye.

1342
01:37:56,076 --> 01:37:56,937
All those in favor?

1343
01:37:57,477 --> 01:37:57,898
Aye.

1344
01:37:58,198 --> 01:38:00,500
The motion passed, placed on file.

1345
01:38:04,106 --> 01:38:07,292
Good evening Madam Chairperson, school committee members.

1346
01:38:07,633 --> 01:38:12,502
I'm very excited to be able to bring the pre-budget report this evening to you.

1347
01:38:14,778 --> 01:38:24,386
The summary is that in our Medford Public School District, we provide students with the acquisition of knowledge and skills in the area of general science and technology.

1348
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:38,078
In 2016 and 17, the Science Department began aligning the school district's curriculum program with the 2016 Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for Science and Technology Engineering.

1349
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:50,668
The 2016 framework represents some important shifts in content and performance expectations, or from content attainment to performance expectations.

1350
01:38:51,208 --> 01:39:02,158
At the K to 8 level in particular, that means that there'll be a multi-year effort to realign the curriculum in terms of time and funds and resources.

1351
01:39:04,184 --> 01:39:12,789
So at this point, I just want to quickly go through some of the highlights that are found in your report and not sort of read verbatim what you have in front of you.

1352
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:18,293
And then have for your consideration a couple of different things.

1353
01:39:19,313 --> 01:39:28,519
First of all, at the middle school, we have 14 teachers, seven at the McGlynn and seven at the Andrews.

1354
01:39:28,959 --> 01:39:31,561
That includes two grade level teachers per

1355
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:36,774
per school and the additional technology engineering teacher.

1356
01:39:37,755 --> 01:39:43,844
At the high school we have 14 staff members that cover all of the courses and the electives.

1357
01:39:45,246 --> 01:39:50,713
All of the funding from the 17-18 school year was used to support

1358
01:39:52,046 --> 01:39:59,489
the elementary school program as well as some of the general supplies and consumables that were mentioned in that original document.

1359
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:07,852
We have also sort of worked with, or the faculty has worked with the Medford Educational Foundation

1360
01:40:08,532 --> 01:40:11,774
to write some grants that have been supported for science.

1361
01:40:12,915 --> 01:40:29,385
One in particular continues to fund one of the projects that we've been working on for several years, which we sort of grow salamanders from their early state to the adult stage and then release them into the fells.

1362
01:40:29,845 --> 01:40:36,649
We also have a turtle head starting program where the turtles are grown to a significant size so that they wouldn't be crushed by

1363
01:40:37,187 --> 01:40:42,548
traffic or other things, and then those get released into the Assavit Valley National Wildlife Refuge.

1364
01:40:42,668 --> 01:40:52,711
So the organisms spend a little time at Hotel Medford and then move on to go to their natural habitats in the hopes that they'll continue to survive.

1365
01:40:54,031 --> 01:40:58,272
Those things are being researched by Zoo New England at this point.

1366
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:07,196
Zoo New England has absorbed the once non-governmental association that existed.

1367
01:41:07,716 --> 01:41:15,739
They found that they needed a conservation group, and this particular group was preserving species right in our backyard.

1368
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:19,281
So they found some way to incorporate that.

1369
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:21,701
So the partnership has somewhat shifted.

1370
01:41:21,721 --> 01:41:23,322
It actually

1371
01:41:24,058 --> 01:41:37,582
increases our presence and it's good that it started here in Medford, but we always tend to reach out to see if other communities in the surrounding areas would like to participate.

1372
01:41:37,662 --> 01:41:43,984
So it's not Medford exclusively, we always continually reach out to see what other communities would like to do.

1373
01:41:45,184 --> 01:41:48,225
In grade eight, this past year at the McGlynn,

1374
01:41:49,243 --> 01:41:54,227
Teachers participated in a NSF-funded research project that looked at weather.

1375
01:41:54,848 --> 01:42:06,297
It is a new topic in grade eight, and the tools that we were using to teach it were somewhat outdated.

1376
01:42:06,377 --> 01:42:09,560
We could make a more robust approach.

1377
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:14,924
And Concord Consortium, along with myself and Ms.

1378
01:42:14,964 --> 01:42:20,329
Joy, had spoken about making a collaborative effort to write the grant.

1379
01:42:20,769 --> 01:42:21,450
It was funded.

1380
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,631
This was the first year of implementation.

1381
01:42:24,552 --> 01:42:27,475
The teachers are very heavily involved in continuing that work.

1382
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:28,435
It's a 20-day unit.

1383
01:42:30,794 --> 01:42:36,237
And it really looks at the technology that's in what we call now casting.

1384
01:42:36,577 --> 01:42:51,405
And now casting is trying to predict the weather, the immediate weather, which seems like it would be an easy thing to do, but it's far more difficult than predicting sort of like climate patterns and overall seasonal weather.

1385
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:57,509
So it's a pretty interesting project and looks at data that's accumulated through the Argonne National Labs.

1386
01:42:59,069 --> 01:42:59,950
At the science fair,

1387
01:43:01,505 --> 01:43:03,646
Our students participated regionally.

1388
01:43:04,427 --> 01:43:06,548
There were four students that went, three projects.

1389
01:43:07,108 --> 01:43:12,051
Sarah Abdul-Karim from grade 12, and Mary Neguse, who performed one project.

1390
01:43:13,111 --> 01:43:16,533
Subhesha Durali, who's in grade 11, and Albert Farah, who's in grade 10.

1391
01:43:17,273 --> 01:43:20,615
All three of them qualified for the 2018 state fair.

1392
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:26,838
And they will be having that fair at the end of this month.

1393
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:29,619
I believe it's, actually it's the beginning of next month.

1394
01:43:31,853 --> 01:43:35,295
I think it's the 4th through the 6th of May.

1395
01:43:36,396 --> 01:43:39,018
It's in the science fair report, just so you know.

1396
01:43:39,939 --> 01:43:41,500
It's a little more detailed in that report.

1397
01:43:42,901 --> 01:43:45,022
Tufts University continues to support us.

1398
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:59,733
They provide a reverse science fair, which is where graduate students come in with their research projects from a variety of labs, and our students at the high school are able to ask them about the research that's going on

1399
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:04,032
in a science fair-ish kind of environment.

1400
01:44:04,913 --> 01:44:06,474
Those students present a project.

1401
01:44:07,395 --> 01:44:15,000
They are supposed to provide a scientific presentation.

1402
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:18,422
However, it needs to be tailored to a high school audience.

1403
01:44:19,243 --> 01:44:21,624
So for them, it's about scientific communication.

1404
01:44:22,064 --> 01:44:25,587
And for our students, it's to see the relevance of the research that goes on.

1405
01:44:26,935 --> 01:44:38,408
Many of the graduate students that participate in the reverse science fair in the fall then return to us and serve as judges for our high school fair.

1406
01:44:39,089 --> 01:44:47,359
So the partnership is, they take on two roles, which is presenting their research and then returning to judge the students in the science fair.

1407
01:44:49,922 --> 01:44:57,704
We also have an additional project called the STEM Ambassadors and that's targeted exclusively at the introductory physics students in grade 9.

1408
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:08,187
Two times a year, undergraduate students from underrepresented groups are first generation students in college.

1409
01:45:09,525 --> 01:45:14,289
are trained to provide lessons to students in grade nine.

1410
01:45:14,529 --> 01:45:16,010
It's really a phenomenal program.

1411
01:45:16,691 --> 01:45:30,402
A lot of students are exposed to sort of the near peer rather than the teacher or a graduate student and they connect very well and provide really well thought out lessons for our students in grade nine.

1412
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:36,386
Hopefully encouraging other students to continue to pursue STEM as they move forward.

1413
01:45:37,567 --> 01:45:38,188
So this year,

1414
01:45:40,474 --> 01:45:51,101
On the budget request sheet, you'll notice that I'm asking for half, a .5 for grades 9 through 12 of high school.

1415
01:45:51,761 --> 01:45:54,463
And the reason for that is that the vocational school students

1416
01:45:54,943 --> 01:46:05,531
that take chemistry, there'll be an increase in those students, which means our current capacity won't be covered by the current number of faculty that we have.

1417
01:46:06,972 --> 01:46:12,556
So we'd like to put that on as a request, specific request for the upcoming year.

1418
01:46:14,877 --> 01:46:19,160
We'd like to continue to fund the other positions as they have been.

1419
01:46:20,853 --> 01:46:25,275
We can fund the textbooks as they have been in the past.

1420
01:46:26,135 --> 01:46:36,599
And the instructional, we would like to fund it at the 217 level, because last year we included a special amount of monies to cover elementary schools.

1421
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:45,335
And that will actually position us to continue our forward movement in program adoption.

1422
01:46:46,136 --> 01:46:56,822
Now, many of you are probably curious where that process is, so I can tell you what the teachers have done so far and then provide you with some information about what they've been able to share with me.

1423
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:03,433
We piloted two programs, FOSS and McGraw-Hills Inspire Science.

1424
01:47:04,033 --> 01:47:08,837
Inspire Science was by far the largest pilot that we ran.

1425
01:47:09,798 --> 01:47:16,743
It included hands-on material kits for groups, as well as the text and the online support.

1426
01:47:17,523 --> 01:47:21,406
And the FOSS program was a smaller, more targeted

1427
01:47:23,075 --> 01:47:27,259
pilot, and that is really due to what the vendor was able to provide for us.

1428
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:38,209
And we really wanted to keep teachers that were piloting a program as close to one another as possible so they could communicate with one another as they were going through it.

1429
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:43,054
And so the Brooks was one of the places where we piloted the FOSS program.

1430
01:47:44,813 --> 01:48:00,299
What I have for you in terms of information is that the McGraw-Hill Inspire Science Program was described by the teachers as having some challenges with the hands-on materials, that they weren't well vetted because it is a new program.

1431
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:07,782
And so there was some disconnect there between what they had written and what they had for hands-on activities.

1432
01:48:11,104 --> 01:48:19,466
They also found that some of the materials, the literature that was provided, was at a higher level than what the students were able to do.

1433
01:48:20,847 --> 01:48:30,469
And so they were supplementing those particular components to the program as they implemented it, or as they piloted the materials.

1434
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:35,971
So with those challenges, and with the feedback from the teachers,

1435
01:48:36,642 --> 01:48:45,649
I would not recommend at this time to adopt the McGraw-Hill program, but we do want to move forward and continue to pilot FOSS.

1436
01:48:46,289 --> 01:48:55,136
And given what we've been able to do with the budget from last year, we should be able to pilot in other schools.

1437
01:48:55,776 --> 01:49:01,618
the FOSS program to have teachers see exactly what that program has for the upcoming year.

1438
01:49:02,238 --> 01:49:24,445
In addition to that, as teachers pilot FOSS in their classrooms, we can evaluate how to sort of target and implement this moving forward if this were the program that they would provide feedback as the correct one for our district.

1439
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,121
All right, it looks like we have some questions.

1440
01:49:27,341 --> 01:49:27,622
Sure.

1441
01:49:28,122 --> 01:49:31,144
So right around two, three, just have your hands up.

1442
01:49:31,164 --> 01:49:33,766
So Mrs. DiBenedetto, Mr. Rousseau, and then Mrs. Vanden Heuvel.

1443
01:49:34,086 --> 01:49:35,167
Just a quick question.

1444
01:49:35,447 --> 01:49:44,794
Would you consider bringing in another program as well as FOSS, moving FOSS to a different school, see if you get the same kind of information, and then

1445
01:49:47,422 --> 01:49:59,772
So I will, when we began the process last year, we brought in six vendors that had programs that we thought would be able to be implemented.

1446
01:49:59,932 --> 01:50:08,238
Of those, the two that were ready to go were the FOSS program and the McGraw-Hill Inspired Science Program.

1447
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:10,480
The teachers had identified that

1448
01:50:12,368 --> 01:50:16,449
Pearson was another sort of like second place runner in the group.

1449
01:50:16,909 --> 01:50:24,152
Pearson just recently completed their work, but they are very similar in my opinion to what McGraw-Hill has.

1450
01:50:24,572 --> 01:50:38,496
We can certainly sort of share out what they have with the teachers so that they can look at them in parallel to see the quality, but I don't know whether I would run a pilot with that particular program given the responses that I'm getting about

1451
01:50:38,976 --> 01:50:42,819
McGraw-Hill, at least in terms of how the program is designed.

1452
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:53,908
If there's another program that is as equally vetted as the FOSS program, I'd entertain finding more out about that program.

1453
01:50:54,209 --> 01:51:04,517
I don't know whether that program exists at that point, because it takes a great deal of time and effort to produce a product like what FOSS produces.

1454
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:07,900
So I can look into it.

1455
01:51:08,686 --> 01:51:09,086
And find out?

1456
01:51:09,106 --> 01:51:09,387
It's OK.

1457
01:51:09,607 --> 01:51:10,428
Good to know.

1458
01:51:10,708 --> 01:51:13,791
We respect what you bring forward to us.

1459
01:51:14,872 --> 01:51:15,432
Mr. Russo.

1460
01:51:16,273 --> 01:51:17,494
Yes, thank you for the report.

1461
01:51:19,476 --> 01:51:29,145
Can we make sure that the Brooks teachers that piloted this year, I mean, I don't know if we'll have enough to be able to do this.

1462
01:51:29,305 --> 01:51:33,930
But one of the things that I'm concerned about, and I'm sure everybody is,

1463
01:51:34,611 --> 01:51:39,554
is the first year doing anything is probably not really any fun.

1464
01:51:42,376 --> 01:51:54,143
But what you don't know and you can't learn from that first year is that our subsequent years equally as challenging or is it really wasn't the first year we learned it and now it's like we can drive the car.

1465
01:51:55,034 --> 01:52:00,017
Or is it every time we get going, it's completely a lot of work?

1466
01:52:00,758 --> 01:52:05,841
And I'm sure that this BOSS program probably has reviews out there.

1467
01:52:05,881 --> 01:52:07,922
And you probably have a sense of that.

1468
01:52:08,422 --> 01:52:11,905
But it would be really good to have the teachers that piloted this year.

1469
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:15,227
I mean, I guess it's still officially piloting.

1470
01:52:15,287 --> 01:52:21,711
But to run it again next year, at least with a couple of the teachers, and get their feedback that says, oh, wow, this year was so much easier.

1471
01:52:23,361 --> 01:52:33,470
Our plan is to keep the materials that they currently have in their hands for the upcoming school year and add to the other buildings.

1472
01:52:34,043 --> 01:52:40,087
And so given what we've been able to do with the funds this year, we should be able to do that.

1473
01:52:40,207 --> 01:52:45,470
And that's included in the amount that I'm requesting for instructional materials, even for next year.

1474
01:52:45,811 --> 01:52:58,298
So my goal is to just replenish the consumable supplies that were used for last year in those kits, and then have new kits available for the teachers that are going to pilot in the other schools.

1475
01:52:58,819 --> 01:52:59,959
So we should.

1476
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:10,704
Given the request that I'm making, we should be able to do that and also return back to FOSS to see what they're able to do for us as we move forward.

1477
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:24,230
So I'm pretty confident that we can get at least a classroom of each grade level at each school to run a FOSS pilot.

1478
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:30,272
and then have the teachers that had done it before continue with a FOSS pilot next year.

1479
01:53:31,053 --> 01:53:34,274
So that would give us some good data, at least across the schools.

1480
01:53:34,314 --> 01:53:37,936
They're each a bit unique, so it's good to try it out in the other schools.

1481
01:53:38,596 --> 01:53:39,937
Mrs. Anderson?

1482
01:53:40,157 --> 01:53:44,939
So if I understood, you just said a classroom per grade in each school?

1483
01:53:45,479 --> 01:53:45,679
Right.

1484
01:53:45,799 --> 01:53:51,742
So for the kids who aren't piloting the program, we were concerned about our science curriculum overall.

1485
01:53:53,075 --> 01:53:56,600
And also the ability of kids to do hands-on stuff.

1486
01:53:57,141 --> 01:54:09,597
So as we're piloting programs, how are we making sure that the other students who are not piloting the programs have the same

1487
01:54:10,618 --> 01:54:13,961
opportunities as those who are getting the new materials.

1488
01:54:14,682 --> 01:54:23,289
We've included additional materials at several grade levels in the rest of the schools to be able to support that.

1489
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:29,034
I still have to speak to McGraw-Hill to see what they want us to do with what we currently have.

1490
01:54:30,235 --> 01:54:37,101
And also, we can try to incorporate that if you feel it's necessary for

1491
01:54:38,334 --> 01:54:41,938
additional sort of consumable supplies moving forward.

1492
01:54:42,518 --> 01:54:50,846
But my guess is we should be okay given the budget that I'm requesting to be able to continue to support teachers.

1493
01:54:51,246 --> 01:54:52,847
It's not going to be an equivalent program.

1494
01:54:53,953 --> 01:55:11,743
to the FOSS program, because what the teachers currently use is very different from FOSS, but it will provide equivalent content instruction and experiences to the kids based on what the teachers use.

1495
01:55:12,123 --> 01:55:18,606
So is your plan to make a new recommendation for whatever program we're going to go with by next year?

1496
01:55:18,626 --> 01:55:19,767
Next year, yes.

1497
01:55:20,147 --> 01:55:23,229
That's my hope, is that in the next few years we'll have a program.

1498
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,361
It can't be too long.

1499
01:55:25,982 --> 01:55:26,282
Correct.

1500
01:55:26,322 --> 01:55:31,607
So it would be next year's next year's recommendation for the academic year 2019-20.

1501
01:55:32,669 --> 01:55:36,513
We're not ready to go now.

1502
01:55:36,533 --> 01:55:44,181
I would hesitate to do that given all the schools have not been able to properly vet a FOSS program.

1503
01:55:44,521 --> 01:55:46,443
We've only seen a small sampling

1504
01:55:46,955 --> 01:56:00,441
of what the teachers have seen and it would be best to continue the pilot in the other schools so that they have a clear sense of whether it works with their students and whether this is the program that we definitely want to invest our money in.

1505
01:56:01,798 --> 01:56:19,664
I understand the hesitation at times and the need to move forward, but I worry investing a huge amount of money into a program that may be completely aligned, may not be used if not implemented correctly.

1506
01:56:20,164 --> 01:56:28,106
And I really want to make sure we make that judgment call by next year with what we're proposing.

1507
01:56:30,603 --> 01:56:37,169
Something you just said, though, about the timing.

1508
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:45,596
I guess my colleague's question made me think about this.

1509
01:56:48,178 --> 01:56:50,500
If one of the options really is that

1510
01:56:51,717 --> 01:57:00,705
one of the buildings could decide this isn't for us, then we are years away from them having something that is for them.

1511
01:57:02,307 --> 01:57:13,857
And so I'm certainly not suggesting we just rush in without knowing, but I mean, FOSS is a, you know, my understanding is a pretty respected program and

1512
01:57:15,283 --> 01:57:19,604
has lots of research to support it and where wouldn't be the first district to actually use it.

1513
01:57:20,884 --> 01:57:34,768
So I guess I just worry a bit about, I'm fine with waiting another year to pilot to make sure that there's buy-in at the individual schools and everybody's kind of is, you know, like this September they aren't surprised by it.

1514
01:57:37,225 --> 01:57:42,908
I just want to make sure that when we are saying we're piloting it, we're not saying, what do you think?

1515
01:57:42,968 --> 01:57:44,128
Should we consider this?

1516
01:57:44,589 --> 01:57:55,294
Because if that's their option, then that means at the end of 2019, we can decide to find some new programs to pilot.

1517
01:57:55,474 --> 01:58:00,997
And then we're years and years before we have data curriculum for the sciences.

1518
01:58:01,237 --> 01:58:05,659
And I'm guessing that's not anybody's desire.

1519
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:32,590
Based upon the feedback that I've received from the teachers, and we used a rubric that was sort of designed with what the NGSS sort of evaluates programs with, the feedback is that they are interested in finding a hands-on program for science, and not necessarily another literacy program

1520
01:58:33,783 --> 01:58:38,864
And so the direction we really want to go is to ensure that we move in that direction.

1521
01:58:39,504 --> 01:58:49,486
Of the programs that are hands-on, this is probably one of the, as a program, this is probably one of the premier ones that they would be looking at.

1522
01:58:51,647 --> 01:58:59,929
To reject something like that would be tough, I would think.

1523
01:59:00,529 --> 01:59:01,989
It's going to be a real stretch.

1524
01:59:03,567 --> 01:59:04,588
So I just have one more question.

1525
01:59:04,648 --> 01:59:14,374
So this is sort of a question, I guess, for policy is that, I mean, is it the school committee's decision whether to reject?

1526
01:59:14,454 --> 01:59:20,438
I mean, could the principals decide to reject it and we come back here next year and say, well, that's too bad.

1527
01:59:20,478 --> 01:59:21,398
This is what we're doing.

1528
01:59:21,578 --> 01:59:23,540
Or who can make that decision?

1529
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:30,544
So normally you would take the recommendation of these experts in the field, your department heads,

1530
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:37,551
unless you had such a severe difference of opinion.

1531
01:59:38,352 --> 01:59:42,074
I mean, obviously, they're working every day with the teachers, they're working in the classrooms.

1532
01:59:42,634 --> 01:59:48,597
Science is a hands-on learning experience, and that's experimentation and inquiry is the heart of science.

1533
01:59:49,097 --> 01:59:58,482
In fact, the great criticism of a lot of the standardized tests that our young people have to take is that they're paper and pencil, and they're not inquiry-based.

1534
02:00:00,259 --> 02:00:08,763
The fact that the elementary program is going to become much more inquiry-based and much more hands-on should be a plus in everyone's mind.

1535
02:00:09,403 --> 02:00:13,465
The difficulty has always been getting publishers to do that because it requires a lot more work.

1536
02:00:14,085 --> 02:00:15,485
It requires a lot more planning.

1537
02:00:16,306 --> 02:00:20,147
And what they've always tried to do is just simply give us something and say, we've covered the material.

1538
02:00:22,183 --> 02:00:29,510
From what I can see, dealing with Rocco and the science faculty so far, is that hands-on is the way to go.

1539
02:00:30,110 --> 02:00:34,414
And right now, the premier program, as Rocco has identified, is false.

1540
02:00:35,155 --> 02:00:38,377
So I would not want you to move away from it.

1541
02:00:38,457 --> 02:00:46,184
But the decision is ultimately yours, because we make a recommendation, and you either accept or reject our recommendations for curriculum.

1542
02:00:46,204 --> 02:00:47,806
Mr. Jarrell.

1543
02:00:48,778 --> 02:00:57,344
Yeah, when I was on the campaign trail, I was really surprised at the number of really brilliant professors at local institutions that live in Medford.

1544
02:00:58,565 --> 02:01:00,586
While I was campaigning, I knocked on one man's door.

1545
02:01:00,606 --> 02:01:06,551
And when I told him I taught mathematics, he quizzed me on a bunch of questions, because he was one of the developers of the MRI.

1546
02:01:08,992 --> 02:01:16,318
After sort of talking to these people, some of them said that they would enjoy actually coming into Medford High School and maybe making brief presentations.

1547
02:01:17,867 --> 02:01:30,882
If we could, obviously we don't want to interrupt curriculum because we have state mandated priorities that we have to do, but if we found you these volunteer professors, would we be able to fit them into our schools?

1548
02:01:31,269 --> 02:01:33,731
We have a lot of mechanisms where we do that.

1549
02:01:33,811 --> 02:01:42,039
Some of the things that I sort of gloss over when I don't speak of this is a different program called the Science Career Program.

1550
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:55,392
We've brought in experts from a wide variety of careers and fields for students that are part of the Yale population and minority populations.

1551
02:01:55,873 --> 02:01:57,294
And they come in on a monthly basis.

1552
02:01:57,334 --> 02:02:03,999
This was started by one of our alumni, Hawasudu Dumbaya, from 2009.

1553
02:02:04,099 --> 02:02:06,080
It's a phenomenal program.

1554
02:02:09,418 --> 02:02:24,491
And we certainly can find ways in which we can match what the topic of the speaker is to the class that a teacher may teach or the classes that they teach.

1555
02:02:24,971 --> 02:02:29,455
And that can be from grades 6th through 12th.

1556
02:02:30,656 --> 02:02:49,749
There are other programs that we've done even in grade 6 and 7 that I haven't really spoken about this evening that are trying to make inroads in things like you're mentioning that are local scientists and engineers that come into classrooms and provide hands-on sort of experiences for kids and also do presentations.

1557
02:02:49,809 --> 02:02:54,613
So depending on the audience, certainly I'd be a good point of contact.

1558
02:02:55,428 --> 02:03:06,397
yourself, and then we can find a forum for them that actually matches students and expert in the field to be able to hear what one another have to say.

1559
02:03:07,018 --> 02:03:07,938
We do that pretty often.

1560
02:03:08,319 --> 02:03:11,962
Thank you.

1561
02:03:12,963 --> 02:03:20,749
So I just had one more question, and that is, when we do implement FOSS, what is the approximate budget amount that you anticipate?

1562
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:23,551
Most programs are

1563
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:27,261
are pretty high, I'm guessing.

1564
02:03:28,642 --> 02:03:36,424
And this is really, and I'm like, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm just using my numbers somewhere between 300 and $400,000.

1565
02:03:37,085 --> 02:03:45,007
So I just, we are not moving forward this year because we want to vet it more.

1566
02:03:45,308 --> 02:03:45,608
Correct.

1567
02:03:45,768 --> 02:03:48,109
Not because we're not, we can't afford it.

1568
02:03:48,609 --> 02:03:48,889
Correct.

1569
02:03:49,389 --> 02:03:49,629
Okay.

1570
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:51,830
Just making sure.

1571
02:03:53,643 --> 02:03:54,543
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1572
02:03:54,884 --> 02:03:55,224
Thank you.

1573
02:03:55,964 --> 02:04:02,927
A few of our programs that we did for math and writing, we were able to spread out that cost for two years.

1574
02:04:03,027 --> 02:04:05,749
So that way the district could afford to do that.

1575
02:04:06,989 --> 02:04:10,791
I'm sure you're negotiating with Voss and going to work us a really good deal.

1576
02:04:10,811 --> 02:04:11,551
I hope so.

1577
02:04:12,251 --> 02:04:14,112
That's the plan, is to work a deal.

1578
02:04:14,452 --> 02:04:21,996
Are there any surrounding districts that are also interested in it that we could marry together and get a better deal?

1579
02:04:22,725 --> 02:04:26,208
It's interesting as a concept I've never pursued it, but I'll find out.

1580
02:04:26,328 --> 02:04:31,772
I know that there are districts that are currently implementing or in year one or year three or year 10 of FOSS.

1581
02:04:31,812 --> 02:04:34,754
I mean, FOSS is a well-documented program.

1582
02:04:35,075 --> 02:04:39,738
It continually updates with the standards, but it is a program that's extremely well-vetted.

1583
02:04:39,838 --> 02:04:46,303
So if there are districts that are going to be implementing soon, we certainly can have that conversation.

1584
02:04:46,744 --> 02:04:47,644
I'm not sure whether I can leverage it.

1585
02:04:47,704 --> 02:04:49,466
And I know that buy-in bulk works usually.

1586
02:04:49,526 --> 02:04:49,806
Right.

1587
02:04:50,603 --> 02:04:52,885
especially with hands-on materials as well.

1588
02:04:54,086 --> 02:04:58,930
So sometimes districts have to do that in order to afford the best that we can offer our students.

1589
02:04:59,591 --> 02:05:07,998
But my other question is, how is DESE done with changing the curriculum requirements for

1590
02:05:09,024 --> 02:05:11,986
For 2006 with the 2016 frameworks.

1591
02:05:12,286 --> 02:05:12,546
Yes.

1592
02:05:12,626 --> 02:05:12,866
Yeah.

1593
02:05:12,946 --> 02:05:14,027
The changes have been made.

1594
02:05:14,067 --> 02:05:18,029
They're still implementing questions from grades five and eight.

1595
02:05:18,049 --> 02:05:24,493
They've moved to an online format versus a paper test at the high school level.

1596
02:05:25,393 --> 02:05:41,197
they are still using the 2006 framework because those students, you know, it's a legacy MCAS and also the legacy framework because they haven't started developing questions and give some lag time to districts to be able to adapt to those new programs.

1597
02:05:41,817 --> 02:05:46,979
My only goal is to make sure that we get the most recent program to go.

1598
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:50,880
We don't want to buy a program and then them come out with changes.

1599
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:51,360
Correct.

1600
02:05:52,612 --> 02:05:53,173
Thank you.

1601
02:05:53,213 --> 02:05:54,474
Thank you very much.

1602
02:06:16,826 --> 02:06:26,328
On April 12, 2018, Medford High School will, the students of Medford High School will be participating in our annual science fair from 8.30 to 11.45 in the science lecture hall.

1603
02:06:28,009 --> 02:06:36,931
The participants are invited to, from grades 9 through 12, from any program, whether it's a science or technical class, vocational technical,

1604
02:06:38,832 --> 02:06:41,493
In addition, students from the Curtis Tufts are invited.

1605
02:06:42,494 --> 02:06:50,078
If they choose to participate and have carried out a project, we will find ways to have them be present at the event.

1606
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:58,233
In some cases, the students that are invited may be presenting the work of a team from the class.

1607
02:06:58,273 --> 02:07:08,899
So a class may have a class-wide project, but they did a subtopic in it, and they're gonna be presenting that on behalf of the class for their particular project.

1608
02:07:10,179 --> 02:07:15,802
I wanna thank Tufts for providing so much support in judges.

1609
02:07:15,862 --> 02:07:20,905
They volunteer their time and come in to judge in addition to the Reverse Science Fair.

1610
02:07:21,597 --> 02:07:32,701
And I also wanted to sort of mention that at the last science fair, our four students went on from over 100 student projects.

1611
02:07:33,982 --> 02:07:35,882
They scored in the top 40.

1612
02:07:36,863 --> 02:07:40,264
Our highest scorer was Albert Farah.

1613
02:07:40,864 --> 02:07:41,364
He was number 12.

1614
02:07:41,444 --> 02:07:47,066
He's a 10th grader, so we expect great things moving forward from Albert in 11th and 12th grade.

1615
02:07:49,269 --> 02:07:54,095
The grade 12 students have also participated in the past and continue to do so.

1616
02:07:55,117 --> 02:07:58,561
You'll notice that we've reversed the event.

1617
02:07:58,641 --> 02:08:03,487
Our event comes after the regional, and that was based on feedback from the faculty.

1618
02:08:03,988 --> 02:08:07,152
What we really wanted to do was to make sure that our students got

1619
02:08:08,033 --> 02:08:20,497
an opportunity to carry out a project across the board, not only kids that participate in the fair, in the regional fair, but also great wide, 9 through 12, and be a much more inclusive fair.

1620
02:08:20,897 --> 02:08:24,979
And so that's what you will likely recognize and that will continue in years moving forward.

1621
02:08:25,579 --> 02:08:28,100
For the students that want to participate in regional fairs,

1622
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:42,249
The advantage is that we provide, as faculty, some very close mentoring and feedback to the students who are going to move on so that they get prepared for that fair.

1623
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:52,016
And then the students that qualify for those fairs, it's the only qualifying event for both the International Science and Engineering Fair and

1624
02:08:53,715 --> 02:08:54,536
the state fair.

1625
02:08:54,996 --> 02:09:11,247
So we want students to participate, but we know that it is not a, it's not like a, not everybody is interested school wide in participating in a regional fair, but everybody is interested in participating in it, potentially in a high school fair.

1626
02:09:11,567 --> 02:09:13,629
We wanted to preserve both mechanisms.

1627
02:09:14,069 --> 02:09:20,514
And that's the reason for the new report and the new mechanism for our, for our particular fair.

1628
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:22,075
Thank you.

1629
02:09:23,084 --> 02:09:23,368
So it's.

1630
02:09:24,312 --> 02:09:27,433
What time should we show up?

1631
02:09:27,453 --> 02:09:27,513
8.30 to 11.45.

1632
02:09:27,713 --> 02:09:29,614
The awards assembly will happen.

1633
02:09:29,634 --> 02:09:36,076
I always try to target it as a start time from 11.30 to 11.45.

1634
02:09:36,537 --> 02:09:40,018
And the award ceremony happens in the science lecture hall.

1635
02:09:40,058 --> 02:09:52,143
We just kind of take down the posters, find a place to stand, and announce the winners of our fair at that event, and then come back with additional sort of like public release

1636
02:09:54,242 --> 02:09:57,264
public announcements, PSAs for that, once it's done.

1637
02:09:57,384 --> 02:09:57,805
Thank you.

1638
02:09:59,005 --> 02:10:00,046
Thank you very much, Mr. Ciaran.

1639
02:10:00,086 --> 02:10:01,127
You're welcome.

1640
02:10:02,808 --> 02:10:04,389
Motion to accept the report.

1641
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:07,552
All those in favor?

1642
02:10:07,672 --> 02:10:08,892
Aye.

1643
02:10:09,033 --> 02:10:09,953
Just a quick comment.

1644
02:10:10,033 --> 02:10:11,314
Rocco's done a terrific job.

1645
02:10:11,594 --> 02:10:13,436
You can tell how thorough it is.

1646
02:10:14,276 --> 02:10:16,338
And we're very pleased to have him in that role.

1647
02:10:19,585 --> 02:10:21,266
There's a lot of good people in these roles.

1648
02:10:21,826 --> 02:10:29,308
There's a lot of good people in Rocco and, you know, and... Nicole, Dr. Chiesa.

1649
02:10:29,328 --> 02:10:32,109
Dr. Chiesa, you know, both did a great job in Tony World, too.

1650
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:36,971
And this forms the basis for succession and transition.

1651
02:10:37,571 --> 02:10:41,713
I want you to see this, because when you're listening to interviews, sometimes people don't know all the things going on.

1652
02:10:42,753 --> 02:10:47,454
Tonight, I bet you the person interviewing the other night probably didn't remember half, didn't know half these things.

1653
02:10:48,435 --> 02:10:48,595
Right.

1654
02:10:49,655 --> 02:10:50,996
And there's quite a bit going.

1655
02:10:51,016 --> 02:10:53,897
And talk about partnerships, they're all over the place.

1656
02:10:54,578 --> 02:10:55,698
So just keep that in mind.

1657
02:10:55,758 --> 02:11:06,284
As you go through these things, keep this in mind that a lot of people are doing some terrific things that the next superintendent will inherit and build on, hopefully.

1658
02:11:07,504 --> 02:11:08,445
Just important to know that.

1659
02:11:09,225 --> 02:11:09,645
Thank you.

1660
02:11:10,606 --> 02:11:12,967
I would also just like to thank Mr. Cieri for the

1661
02:11:13,908 --> 02:11:18,592
several hours we spent together last week getting up to speed on everything going on.

1662
02:11:18,732 --> 02:11:31,581
Well, I didn't get up to speed on everything going on in two hours, but I really appreciated the time and getting to know you and also getting to look at the FOSS as well as the other curriculums.

1663
02:11:32,162 --> 02:11:38,767
That's why I'm like, I really hope we are just going to get going on this FOSS thing, because it's really quite an impressive looking program.

1664
02:11:38,827 --> 02:11:42,610
And we talked about a lot of the details on why it's

1665
02:11:43,882 --> 02:11:44,963
the premier program.

1666
02:11:45,523 --> 02:11:48,865
So I'm very excited for my own children as well.

1667
02:11:48,966 --> 02:11:49,986
So thank you.

1668
02:11:50,246 --> 02:11:50,507
Thanks.

1669
02:11:50,747 --> 02:11:51,507
Thank you, Mr. Sierra.

1670
02:11:51,968 --> 02:11:52,228
All right.

1671
02:11:52,288 --> 02:11:56,991
Next, we have Tony Vento for the School Health Services Pre-Budget Report.

1672
02:11:57,011 --> 02:11:58,232
God bless you.

1673
02:12:00,413 --> 02:12:02,675
Good evening, superintendent and school committee members.

1674
02:12:03,436 --> 02:12:09,720
So the mission of the health department is to provide accessible health care to students and staff members.

1675
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:15,682
And our goal is to promote academic success by optimizing student health and wellness.

1676
02:12:17,322 --> 02:12:29,046
We are staffed by 12.6 full-time employees and the staffing assignments are based upon the enrollment at the schools as well as the acuity of the student health needs.

1677
02:12:29,846 --> 02:12:31,967
So as you can see from the list, we have

1678
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:53,894
three nurses at Medford High School, we have a nurse at the Honors Middle School, one and a half nurses at McGlynn Middle School, one and a half nurses at McGlynn Elementary School, 1.6 at the Columbus, two nurses at the Brooks, 1.6 at the Roberts, and a .4 position at the Curtis-Tufts.

1679
02:12:53,934 --> 02:12:59,295
The use of funding for school year 2017 to 18 was consistent with how it was appropriated.

1680
02:12:59,655 --> 02:13:00,275
We were able to

1681
02:13:01,145 --> 02:13:08,289
add one full-time employee, and that position was split between the Roberts and the Curtis-Tufts schools.

1682
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:14,192
Some of the accomplishments that the department achieved this school year.

1683
02:13:14,833 --> 02:13:18,795
We were able to maintain a 96.6 return to class rate.

1684
02:13:19,215 --> 02:13:26,299
That was in the context of over 5,000 student visits to the health services offices per month.

1685
02:13:28,065 --> 02:13:35,268
We completed SBIRT training for middle school adjustment and guidance counselors, school nurses, and school psychologists.

1686
02:13:35,768 --> 02:13:45,332
And that, we were able to implement the substance abuse risk behavior assessment screening to grade seven and grade nine students for this year.

1687
02:13:45,972 --> 02:13:53,475
That totaled over 600 students were screened by a student instructional support team member.

1688
02:13:55,217 --> 02:13:58,358
We had a generous donation from Armstrong Ambulance Company.

1689
02:13:58,718 --> 02:14:17,182
They provided 16 AEDs, or automatic defibrillators, and that allowed us to maintain compliance with the new Massachusetts general law about expanding AED accessibility to athletic events both on and off campus.

1690
02:14:17,722 --> 02:14:20,863
And we were able to do that with this donation.

1691
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:26,192
We hired Dr. Patrick Sabia as our school physician.

1692
02:14:26,252 --> 02:14:30,753
He replaced Dr. Kristen Goodell when she resigned to assume another position.

1693
02:14:32,593 --> 02:14:40,915
And collaborating with the Partnership for Success and the Behavioral Clinical Services from Medford High School, we put on two parent forums.

1694
02:14:41,695 --> 02:14:48,997
One was about vaping, and that was in February, and the other one will be about dealing with student anxiety, and that's scheduled for May.

1695
02:14:51,302 --> 02:14:54,025
So special requests for the budget for next year.

1696
02:14:54,045 --> 02:14:58,110
I would like to add a .5 FTE position.

1697
02:14:58,691 --> 02:15:01,554
This would allow me to reorganize the nursing positions.

1698
02:15:02,375 --> 02:15:07,161
I'd like to take the .4 that's presently assigned to the Curtis Tufts and move that.

1699
02:15:07,601 --> 02:15:21,507
to augment the Andrews Middle School and provide equity amongst all the schools and then use the .5 position so that I have a nurse at the Curtis Tufts School every day for at least half of the school day.

1700
02:15:22,328 --> 02:15:25,409
We have found this year we had somebody there two days a week and

1701
02:15:26,513 --> 02:15:32,157
On the days that the nurse wasn't there, students were seeking health services.

1702
02:15:32,257 --> 02:15:37,420
I had to pull nurses from different buildings to go over to meet the student need.

1703
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:45,384
And it just provided a delay in meeting the student need as well as a disruption of the service at the other buildings.

1704
02:15:50,552 --> 02:15:54,697
Thank you.

1705
02:15:55,879 --> 02:16:01,887
Tony, you let us know when we confirm a date for the presentation on anxiety.

1706
02:16:02,567 --> 02:16:03,008
That's May 9th.

1707
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:10,251
So it is posted on the MPS Advantage website.

1708
02:16:10,312 --> 02:16:11,312
Is that a Monday?

1709
02:16:11,392 --> 02:16:12,312
No, it's a Wednesday.

1710
02:16:12,412 --> 02:16:12,852
Wednesday.

1711
02:16:13,052 --> 02:16:23,155
And it's going to be held at the McGlynn Auditorium from 6.30 to 8.30 by some of the inquiries to

1712
02:16:24,365 --> 02:16:31,868
To the schools, we're expecting about 450 families have expressed interest in attending.

1713
02:16:32,308 --> 02:16:35,749
So we will be packing the McGlynn Auditorium.

1714
02:16:36,330 --> 02:16:37,070
That's in the evening?

1715
02:16:37,530 --> 02:16:37,810
Evening.

1716
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:39,791
Do we need to let you know that we want to come?

1717
02:16:40,271 --> 02:16:40,451
Yeah.

1718
02:16:41,271 --> 02:16:42,272
We want to come.

1719
02:16:43,965 --> 02:16:44,706
Mr. Ruggiero.

1720
02:16:44,966 --> 02:16:48,168
I'm sorry for my ignorance of this, but what is SBIRT?

1721
02:16:48,268 --> 02:16:55,312
So SBIRT screening is a substance abuse risk behavior assessment tool.

1722
02:16:56,013 --> 02:16:59,095
It is a verbal screening.

1723
02:16:59,175 --> 02:17:05,319
It's done on a one-to-one interaction with a student by a trained screener.

1724
02:17:05,839 --> 02:17:10,502
The SBIRT stands for Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment.

1725
02:17:11,108 --> 02:17:18,540
It's a prevention and education model used to identify students who are high risk for substance use.

1726
02:17:24,542 --> 02:17:27,464
It's really a preventive and education model.

1727
02:17:27,504 --> 02:17:30,125
So we'll have a, we use a screening tool.

1728
02:17:30,185 --> 02:17:31,726
It's 10 questions long.

1729
02:17:32,887 --> 02:17:39,611
And tier one intervention is a positive reinforcement to students for making healthy choices.

1730
02:17:40,191 --> 02:17:46,235
The tier two intervention is a conversation with a guidance counselor or a school adjustment counselor.

1731
02:17:46,735 --> 02:17:53,337
about identified risk behaviors and a tier 3 would be a referral to a substance abuse counselor.

1732
02:17:54,677 --> 02:17:57,318
Last year we screened 325 grade 9 students.

1733
02:17:57,338 --> 02:17:57,838
39 of those had a

1734
02:18:05,354 --> 02:18:05,694
level 2.

1735
02:18:07,235 --> 02:18:10,736
They tested positive and went on to have a level 2 motivational interview.

1736
02:18:11,216 --> 02:18:17,819
And out of those 7, 7 out of the 39 were referred to a school adjustment counselor in-house.

1737
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:25,562
We had no referrals to the SAFE project, which is our collaborators for substance abuse counseling.

1738
02:18:25,983 --> 02:18:26,923
So that was last year.

1739
02:18:27,683 --> 02:18:30,024
This year we have not completed the screening yet.

1740
02:18:30,044 --> 02:18:32,205
We still have to screen at one middle school.

1741
02:18:34,466 --> 02:18:43,635
Looking at the data, we have had no, so far to date, we've had no referrals on for even a level two type intervention.

1742
02:18:44,215 --> 02:18:45,497
Great, thank you very much.

1743
02:18:46,277 --> 02:18:48,179
Any other questions?

1744
02:18:48,299 --> 02:18:52,904
Thank you for the report, and I motion to place the report and put it on file.

1745
02:18:53,064 --> 02:18:53,864
All those in favor?

1746
02:18:54,425 --> 02:18:55,566
Aye.

1747
02:18:55,766 --> 02:18:58,449
I have a budget question or request.

1748
02:18:59,369 --> 02:19:13,071
through you to the superintendent, do you think that you could prepare for us a list of known retirements coming up so we have an idea of staffing changes so that we don't get them so close to the budget?

1749
02:19:13,905 --> 02:19:15,266
book coming forward.

1750
02:19:15,906 --> 02:19:19,007
I know that we all know of some retirements happening soon.

1751
02:19:19,568 --> 02:19:27,932
And as a committee, we need to add an item to the agenda like who is going to be the interim superintendent and those types of questions.

1752
02:19:28,012 --> 02:19:33,194
So I'm making a request that that be added to the agenda for our next meeting.

1753
02:19:34,535 --> 02:19:37,776
We have several people that have known, told us they're retiring.

1754
02:19:37,796 --> 02:19:38,977
There are other people who haven't.

1755
02:19:41,257 --> 02:19:44,899
made it formal yet and yet there are other people who don't want to talk about it.

1756
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:49,121
So if they've made it formal and they've told us, we'll give you that.

1757
02:19:49,281 --> 02:19:54,244
If they haven't, we may suspect it, but I can't, I'm not going to preempt anyone.

1758
02:19:54,464 --> 02:19:58,887
No, I just mean known, meaning known to us as a district.

1759
02:19:59,768 --> 02:20:04,851
Also the motion to add that agenda item for our next meeting.

1760
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:06,992
So we know steps moving forward.

1761
02:20:09,598 --> 02:20:12,599
So I want to clarify your motion to get a second.

1762
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:26,343
My motion is to add an agenda item to discuss next steps as the superintendent retires on April 30th.

1763
02:20:26,363 --> 02:20:28,324
I'm not sure what you're saying.

1764
02:20:29,187 --> 02:20:31,369
Who's stepping in as you retire?

1765
02:20:31,569 --> 02:20:33,491
Who's going to step up for the rest of the school year?

1766
02:20:33,531 --> 02:20:35,012
That's up to the mayor and the committee.

1767
02:20:35,392 --> 02:20:35,572
Right.

1768
02:20:35,632 --> 02:20:40,977
No, I'm adding, I'm asking it to be added to the agenda so that way we can discuss it with the mayor.

1769
02:20:43,199 --> 02:20:44,100
That's my, uh, yeah.

1770
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:44,420
Thank you.

1771
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:45,221
A transition plan.

1772
02:20:45,241 --> 02:20:45,861
Thank you.

1773
02:20:45,881 --> 02:20:46,241
Yes, I would.

1774
02:20:53,602 --> 02:20:58,925
So the motion is for the next agenda, which our meeting, our next meeting is May.

1775
02:20:59,966 --> 02:21:00,506
May.

1776
02:21:01,607 --> 02:21:02,467
No, no.

1777
02:21:02,768 --> 02:21:03,128
In May.

1778
02:21:03,268 --> 02:21:03,668
In May.

1779
02:21:04,108 --> 02:21:06,770
We will put on the agenda transition plan.

1780
02:21:07,090 --> 02:21:08,711
All those in favor.

1781
02:21:09,912 --> 02:21:11,393
Aye.

1782
02:21:11,493 --> 02:21:11,613
Aye.

1783
02:21:11,633 --> 02:21:11,973
Aye.

1784
02:21:12,453 --> 02:21:21,099
Also, some emails were going back and forth with regards to an update on the gun clip at the mayor.

1785
02:21:21,928 --> 02:21:23,529
Suggested I ask the question.

1786
02:21:23,589 --> 02:21:34,753
I know she's not here so I can wait to ask it But then we got an email today as a committee also asking us to add it to the agenda So that way the community knows about it.

1787
02:21:35,093 --> 02:21:36,434
I know the mayor's not here.

1788
02:21:36,914 --> 02:21:42,036
I'm making an official request whether or not it will be on the agenda is

1789
02:21:44,058 --> 02:21:49,462
So make a motion that if there is a police report that's finished, that it will be shared at our next meeting.

1790
02:21:49,662 --> 02:22:02,412
Any reports, any financials that are available that we can, or any timeline, any information that we can provide this committee as well as our community on updates would be appreciated.

1791
02:22:03,193 --> 02:22:05,095
And I'd like that added to the agenda.

1792
02:22:05,335 --> 02:22:07,677
So I guess I just want to make sure I'm understanding this.

1793
02:22:07,777 --> 02:22:11,580
I mean, I'm fine with having it on the agenda in perpetuity.

1794
02:22:13,258 --> 02:22:16,960
to simply ask the question out loud, are the reports available yet?

1795
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:18,281
That's all I asked.

1796
02:22:18,421 --> 02:22:20,042
That was my total intent.

1797
02:22:20,082 --> 02:22:27,867
But I don't like, I don't think we should be dragging, you know, chiefs that go in here every week to say, is it ready?

1798
02:22:28,147 --> 02:22:37,533
The administration from the school district, someone representing the committee or the school district, just making a phone call and say, is, is it completed yet?

1799
02:22:37,553 --> 02:22:38,254
Do you have,

1800
02:22:38,773 --> 02:22:44,276
a problem, an estimated time frame is more than what I anticipated.

1801
02:22:44,496 --> 02:22:57,904
Just so we can give the community an update, because everywhere I go, whatever room I walk in, I was at an event for Representative Donato the other night, and six people, the first thing they said to me was, do we have an idea of the reports?

1802
02:22:58,204 --> 02:22:58,784
Just transparency.

1803
02:23:01,292 --> 02:23:08,735
for the May agenda to have a report, if there is one, or whatever update, there might be no update on the agenda for our May meeting.

1804
02:23:09,495 --> 02:23:10,256
Who's to second?

1805
02:23:11,256 --> 02:23:12,417
Mr. Russo seconded.

1806
02:23:12,497 --> 02:23:13,397
All those in favor?

1807
02:23:13,837 --> 02:23:14,137
Aye.

1808
02:23:14,738 --> 02:23:15,378
Placed on five.

1809
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:21,554
So coming to the end is report on Metro Public Schools after school programs.

1810
02:23:21,914 --> 02:23:29,359
That was, I think we all received the same email that a mom rightfully concerned that the after school program is full.

1811
02:23:29,479 --> 02:23:38,244
But I looked quickly at the books and she wanted to see how the school committee could help improve the numbers or the capacity for after school programs.

1812
02:23:38,924 --> 02:23:43,547
So the same thing, I've given you an updated report from early childhood.

1813
02:23:44,265 --> 02:23:50,188
which Diane and I worked with Shelly Gross earlier today to go over details.

1814
02:23:50,208 --> 02:23:52,449
And you've got some numbers and the like.

1815
02:23:53,069 --> 02:24:02,494
But in a nutshell, essentially, it really depends on what is the number of people at each school that want it.

1816
02:24:02,514 --> 02:24:08,837
It also depends on the ability to us to retain qualified staff.

1817
02:24:10,269 --> 02:24:17,594
to create the right space arrangements and have some predictability, because in most instances, these are second jobs for people that are a few hours a day.

1818
02:24:21,238 --> 02:24:23,039
and we need qualified staff to be there.

1819
02:24:23,459 --> 02:24:26,820
We also have some challenges with regard to who is in the program.

1820
02:24:27,241 --> 02:24:43,467
In some cases, we're open to everybody, but if in fact a student has need based on special needs, based on other kinds of things that may require some additional assistance that may be different, it's professional development.

1821
02:24:44,196 --> 02:24:48,740
There's program development in order to make the programs attractive.

1822
02:24:49,341 --> 02:24:54,025
But we recognize that at two schools, the Brooks and the Columbus, the demand is growing.

1823
02:24:54,866 --> 02:24:59,910
And that we're beginning to work very hard to expand it so we can accommodate those things.

1824
02:25:00,270 --> 02:25:05,055
We're not against doing it, but it's very important to make sure that we can service people effectively.

1825
02:25:05,075 --> 02:25:08,578
Because if you can't get the right staff and you can't get the right setup,

1826
02:25:09,893 --> 02:25:19,459
You know, you don't want to open the door and then have the wrong numbers, because there are quotas based on early education and care rules that we have to follow.

1827
02:25:19,579 --> 02:25:21,280
So we believe we can do it.

1828
02:25:23,181 --> 02:25:24,642
You've got some numbers in front of you.

1829
02:25:24,682 --> 02:25:27,004
You've got some staffing patterns in front of you.

1830
02:25:27,664 --> 02:25:29,225
And we'll keep you informed.

1831
02:25:29,325 --> 02:25:36,870
But I think it's premature until we get a little bit more to actually tell you what you will and won't do.

1832
02:25:38,986 --> 02:25:44,808
There's a need to plan this out a little bit in each school and make sure the demand is there, and make sure the staffing can be met.

1833
02:25:45,428 --> 02:25:51,931
But I think it's reasonable to assume that we won't be able to accommodate anybody that wants it.

1834
02:25:51,951 --> 02:25:54,012
Mr. Ruggiero, I have a question.

1835
02:25:54,252 --> 02:25:57,353
Thank you, Superintendent, for putting together this report.

1836
02:25:57,493 --> 02:25:58,333
I was just curious.

1837
02:25:58,953 --> 02:26:01,594
So on this page right here, when you say 122 children, that's the current

1838
02:26:03,775 --> 02:26:05,396
number of students applying that program.

1839
02:26:05,936 --> 02:26:09,837
Do we have a sense of how many students have applied to be a part of that program?

1840
02:26:09,957 --> 02:26:10,597
At the Brooks?

1841
02:26:10,837 --> 02:26:12,278
Yeah, or all of them.

1842
02:26:12,318 --> 02:26:15,038
Well, at the Brooks, there's probably going to get up to 150.

1843
02:26:15,159 --> 02:26:15,799
Okay.

1844
02:26:16,059 --> 02:26:19,740
You know, and like the Columbus will grow slightly, but it'll grow.

1845
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:22,741
The other places appear to be fairly stable right now.

1846
02:26:23,771 --> 02:26:28,335
Is it possible you could just put in the information of how many students have applied for these programs?

1847
02:26:28,695 --> 02:26:29,415
We can get that for you.

1848
02:26:29,756 --> 02:26:29,916
Thanks.

1849
02:26:30,156 --> 02:26:34,559
It's still coming, though, because, you know, it's obviously people are starting to say, well, what am I going to do in the fall?

1850
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:35,480
Yeah, yeah.

1851
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:40,544
And other people are saying, well, I don't need that anymore because I'm doing something else.

1852
02:26:40,584 --> 02:26:42,446
So, you know, it's fluid.

1853
02:26:42,606 --> 02:26:46,168
But we can project that at the Brooks, the numbers are going to be very strong.

1854
02:26:46,188 --> 02:26:47,870
At the Columbus, they're growing.

1855
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:51,433
And at the Roberts and the McGlynn, they seem to be stable right now.

1856
02:26:51,873 --> 02:26:52,173
Thank you.

1857
02:26:52,533 --> 02:26:52,653
OK.

1858
02:26:57,216 --> 02:27:06,879
At a certain point, if we can't meet staffing needs, we need to be able to come together as a community and maybe bring in, outsource it.

1859
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:10,701
I know that at my district, that's what we came to.

1860
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:17,643
We were having trouble with just finding people to come in two or three days a week, so the Boys and Girls Club,

1861
02:27:18,268 --> 02:27:23,152
came in and ran the program in our buildings and did it in that form.

1862
02:27:23,452 --> 02:27:29,237
If we can't meet the need, I mean, it's something to look at in the future if we're having trouble meeting the need.

1863
02:27:30,578 --> 02:27:31,319
Just an idea.

1864
02:27:31,739 --> 02:27:37,164
When we originally planned these programs, we looked to outsource them at the time.

1865
02:27:37,884 --> 02:27:40,767
We found that the reliability of the outsourcing was not good.

1866
02:27:41,944 --> 02:27:47,247
that they had the same issues in getting people and getting people trained the way we wanted them to.

1867
02:27:48,387 --> 02:27:54,310
We also recognized that their costs were much higher and we would have to transmit that.

1868
02:27:54,350 --> 02:27:56,891
We can control costs a lot better by keeping it inside.

1869
02:27:56,911 --> 02:28:10,978
The real issue is to take a look at the staffing, to make it attractive, what kind of incentives can we give to employees who are only working four hours a day or five hours a day to stay with us and to be trained.

1870
02:28:12,118 --> 02:28:16,442
and to go on from there, because that's really the trick, to get them to move on.

1871
02:28:17,102 --> 02:28:19,984
So we'll work on it.

1872
02:28:20,285 --> 02:28:20,885
We'll come up with it.

1873
02:28:20,925 --> 02:28:29,552
We've done pretty well so far, just that it is a difficult thing when people are working four or five hours and they want to get another job, or they can get something that pays a little better.

1874
02:28:30,413 --> 02:28:36,397
We have to decide, you know, how much we're willing to pay based on what we're willing to charge as well.

1875
02:28:38,163 --> 02:28:42,925
It's also a revenue source for the school district, which offsets the cost of other things you're looking for.

1876
02:28:42,945 --> 02:28:50,107
So just for clarification, will we get an update by the end of the school year, so we'll have something in place, or at least be able to talk to parents?

1877
02:28:50,127 --> 02:28:51,528
I'll certainly give you another report.

1878
02:28:51,548 --> 02:28:52,428
We'll get you another report.

1879
02:28:52,668 --> 02:28:53,468
Thank you, I appreciate that.

1880
02:28:53,508 --> 02:29:00,251
Whether we have all the answers by June, I don't know, but we certainly will give you another report, because a lot of recruitment takes place over the summer.

1881
02:29:01,051 --> 02:29:06,614
as people are looking for employment or making decisions about what they will do in the fall.

1882
02:29:07,615 --> 02:29:09,696
Move to approve.

1883
02:29:10,937 --> 02:29:12,598
Place on file.

1884
02:29:12,678 --> 02:29:14,599
All those in favor?

1885
02:29:14,619 --> 02:29:14,679
Aye.

1886
02:29:14,919 --> 02:29:19,902
Madam Speaker for the next item on our agenda I'd like to move that we go into executive session.

1887
02:29:20,854 --> 02:29:28,961
Okay, can we hold just for just condolences and congratulations?

1888
02:29:29,501 --> 02:29:34,805
I put two papers in your folder, didn't put them on the agenda because they're really just informational.

1889
02:29:35,306 --> 02:29:40,870
The report on the last day of school, which is June 20th right now based on the fact that we're not going to have another snow day.

1890
02:29:42,431 --> 02:29:50,635
And then a little bit of information on the student walkout, because it's been a little while since, I feel like, you know, just enough to give you information on what took place.

1891
02:29:50,735 --> 02:29:51,176
Thank you.

1892
02:29:51,276 --> 02:29:51,656
Thank you.

1893
02:29:52,416 --> 02:29:54,577
So we will start with happy news.

1894
02:29:54,617 --> 02:30:04,422
Congratulations to Denise Chiesa, the school committee executive assistant on the marriage of her daughter Alexandra to Arthur Turani this past weekend.

1895
02:30:04,462 --> 02:30:05,243
Congratulations.

1896
02:30:08,677 --> 02:30:16,879
And we do have two condolences, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Shirley Carr.

1897
02:30:17,479 --> 02:30:23,821
Mrs. Carr was a former account clerk at the vocational school and the wife of retired Medford Police Detective Patrick Carr.

1898
02:30:24,601 --> 02:30:30,683
Also be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Robert Harrington.

1899
02:30:31,338 --> 02:30:34,804
Mr. Harrington was a long time teacher at the Curtis Tough School.

1900
02:30:34,864 --> 02:30:38,610
If we could take a moment of silence for these two individuals.

1901
02:31:03,754 --> 02:31:05,956
And I have to make the announcement we are not going back out.

1902
02:31:05,976 --> 02:31:06,697
Thank you.

1903
02:31:06,917 --> 02:31:08,258
So good night and God bless.
