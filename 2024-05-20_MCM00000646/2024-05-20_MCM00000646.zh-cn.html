 所以，是的，感谢董事会成员今晚聆听我们的讲话。
 再次感谢您允许我们将 2 月 27 日的听证会推迟到今天下午，以便就交通问题进行适当的讨论。
 我们期待今晚的表演。
 当我们转到下一张幻灯片时，我将在这里进行快速开始和介绍。
 只是向大家介绍今晚将参加电话会议的团队。
 来自戴维斯公司的迈克·坎塔卢帕和我在这里。
 我们有来自 Bowler 的 Bill Lucas。
 我们请来了范·内斯的斯科特·桑顿。
 他们将分别就民用和交通问题发表演讲。
 正如我提到的，我们有来自威尔逊的帕特·加拉格尔。
 今天下午他将代表法律团队。
 谭律师不能
 呃，来到这里，通知大家，因为我不相信加拉格尔先生今晚之前曾公开说过话。
 嗯，所以只是一个快速议程，回顾一下，嗯，之前的正式听证会的一些进展。
 嗯，呃，我们，呃，在会议开始时，嗯，讨论了场地规划，嗯，相当详细。
 呃，我们继续致力于这个，嗯，改进它，推进这个设计。
 你会听到，嗯，关于这件事，嗯，
 Bowler 的 Bill Lucas 今晚演讲的土木设计部分。
 作为其中的一部分，我们与民用测试团队进行了初步的同行评审会议。
 我们希望继续这些讨论，但我们仍在继续前进，并很高兴在那里发布一些更新。
 当然，由于自上次听证会以来今晚的主题一直是流量，因此我们能够最终确定 TIA 并正式表示，我们本周还与 Beta 同行评审团队就流量问题举行了初步会议。
 这些对话就是这样进展的。
 我希望继续这样做，并且今晚显然会表演这些材料。
 最后，我们继续推进架构方面，推进那里的设计，我们做到了。
 谈话开始组织与戴维斯广场的轰炸机先生和规划团队成员进行后续同行评审会议。
 所以我觉得我们在设计的各个方面以及与团队和同行评审团队的协调中继续取得进展。
 然后。
 只是为大家提供一个快速更新，因为我们上次见面已经有几个星期了，我不会在这里详细介绍所有要点。
 我会让斯科特真正发言，但显然我们今晚的总体议程是。
 斯科特·桑顿讨论了瓦妮莎研究的方法和结果。
 因此，主席先生，正如休会听证会上所讨论的那样，如果时间允许，我们可以就民事方面进行尽可能深入的讨论。
 正如我所提到的，我们将能够对场地规划进行一些更新，并讨论我们能够提供的一些停车需求信息。
 以及卡车和紧急车辆的最新动态。
 然后我们就准备好展示了。
 现在我要把电话转给 Scott Thornton，哦，抱歉，在此之前，先回顾一下公共流程。
 再次强调，我已经提到了其中一些问题，不会逐条讨论，只是想强调自上次听证会以来我们已经取得了进展
 我们将继续使用民用和交通数据进行同行评审会议，并将在此跟进。
 这样，每个人都知道正在举行的会议和正在进行的对话。
 因此，我会将电话转给斯科特。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=465.548s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Great, thank you very much.
 Pat.
 Mr. Chairman members of the board for the record.
 My name is Scott Thornton with Vanessa associates.
 We prepared the traffic assessment for the projects working with the Davis companies, bowler and cube 3 studios.
 We think that the TIA, just as an initial statement, we think that the TIA shows that the project can be accommodated by the road network and the street system.
 And I will get into the reasons why during my presentation.
 But as noted, we're calling this a supplemental traffic study.
 The initial TIA was submitted in November of last year, and that was a study that had been prepared previously with older data.
 We think that while the findings are generally consistent between the two documents, we understand that with passage of time, the study required an update.
 The scope for that document, the initial TIA was determined with the director of traffic and transportation for the city.
 This supplemental TIA used the same scope.
 We left the supplemental TIA as a draft because we know that city staff will review the document.
 As Pat mentioned, we've had an initial meeting with BETA, the city's peer reviewer.
 So we anticipate there may be some changes to the TIA before it becomes
 sort of memorialized as a completely final document and ready for the file.
 So the Supplemental TIA was based on the revised site plan that was presented last month.
 The TIA was submitted on March 5th.
 So the supplemental TIA reviewed impacts during the critical weekday morning and weekday evening time periods, looking at 14 intersections in the study area.
 And I'll get into the explanation of that in a minute.
 TIA considered the transit, pedestrian, bicycle facilities, as well as vehicle impacts and safety considerations in the identification of impacts for the project.
 The next slide shows the site in context to the study area.
 As I mentioned, 14 intersections in total, four signalized intersections really on the corners of the study area, a couple
 intersections with Fellsway, a couple intersections with Spring Street that are the signalized locations.
 And then we have 10 un-signalized intersections located on the periphery of the site and also in the neighborhood.
 We did an extensive field inventory out in the study area.
 We noted that all streets have sidewalks on both sides.
 There's generally parking on one or both sides of the streets in the neighborhood.
 In terms of facilities, we noted that DCR modified the Fellsway with bike lanes on each side and last year put in curb extensions at the Myrtle Street intersection.
 We conducted traffic counts in January between the hours of 7 and 9 in the morning weekday and 4 to 6 p.m.
 Those were done on January 11th, which was a Thursday.
 We would expect that, you know, we try to do those counts for weekday time periods between Tuesday and Thursday.
 That's generally when traffic is consistent at a consistent level.
 In general, the peak hours start in the morning around 7.45, go from 7.45 to 8.45.
 There's a few outliers, some start at 7, some start at 7.15, but in general, that's about the time period for the morning.
 And in general, in the evening, the peak hour time period occurs between 5 and 6.
 We adjusted the volumes to raise them to the average month conditions, which is consistent with MassDOT standards.
 We counted pedestrians, bicycles, buses, trucks, and vehicles.
 There's actually separate exhibits in the TIA depicting the pedestrians and bicycle movements that were observed at each intersection.
 And on average, there's between 10 and 20 pedestrians during the peak hours at each location.
 Some locations have a little more.
 I think the intersection of Riverside with Fellsway actually has a few more.
 It's in the 20 to 35.
 pedestrians range during the peak hour.
 But in terms of bicycles, there's not a lot of bicycle usage that showed up in the counts.
 But again, January, although it hasn't been a typical January, we would expect that those bicycle volumes to increase during the more seasonal months.
 So the next slide, we start to get into some of the detail with regard to the transit availability.
 I know in one of the meetings, ZBA members were curious to know the status of the 100 bus, which stops really right in front of the site at Myrtle Street.
 So this slide shows the public transportation availability in the area.
 There's the 100 bus, there's the 108, there's the 101, the 134, but 100 really is the one that stops, that would most likely see the majority of usage from the project residents.
 Wellington Station and Malden Center are each about 1.4 miles, about a 30 minute walk from the site.
 So we think that usage would really focus around the 100 bus to get to Wellington Station or other locations.
 We requested and received data from the MBTA on the ridership.
 They've really improved their ridership survey information and program.
 100Bus has 42 trips per direction on a daily basis between 5 a.m.
 and 1240 a.m., which averages about 1,256 passengers a day.
 And this is based on ridership surveys that were conducted in spring, summer, and fall of 2023 by MBTA.
 At the Myrtle Street stop, on average, 2 to 3 passengers per bus trip were observed to get on the bus.
 And that's
 That ranges between the inbound bus in the morning and the outbound bus in the evening.
 Peak hours for the T are 6.30 to 9.30 in the morning and 3.30 to 6.30 in the afternoon.
 That's when the bus frequency goes up to three buses per hour.
 Other than that, the rest of the day, it's typically one to two buses per hour.
 So these riderships also match our observations.
 We were out there actually this morning and noticed between one and three passengers getting on three buses in the morning, or in the inbound direction, and that was between
 Roughly between 7 and a little before 7 and about quarter of 8.
 In terms of the outbound buses, it was about 1 to 3 passengers that were there.
 Actually, there was no 1 waiting to get on the bus to travel outbound, but there were 1 to 3 passengers on the bus.
 during that same time period.
 And actually, the inbound bus, we observed about eight to 14 passengers on the bus, depending on which of the inbound buses it was.
 So it shows adequate capacity for the additional riders that are expected.
 For the site, given that these buses have a 53 passenger capacity.
 As noted by the by the.
 The next slide, we get into some bicycle facilities.
 And so the slide on the graphic on the left shows, this shows existing facilities.
 It comes from the MassDOT bike trail, ArcGIS data.
 Indicates bike lanes on the Fells Way and Revere Beach Parkway.
 It's kind of hard to see at the scale, but it's the bluish, purplish lines showing where those bike lanes are.
 It also indicates the area of the Wellington circle improvements, which are conceptually shown in the upper graphic.
 There is a preferred alternative that has been identified, which improves pedestrian and bicycle connectivity through the circle.
 I think it's still in the planning stages, so I don't know that there's a timeframe that's been identified yet.
 But that is a project that is in the background.
 Also shown is the Malden River Greenway Wellington connector segment that would connect to the bike facilities on Commercial Street.
 This is the potential rail line or multi-use path that passes behind the site, and I think Bill Lucas from Bowler will touch on that in his description of the site plan.
 But, but again, you know, there's these future conditions.
 These are future conditions and projects that will improve conditions for pedestrians and bicycles, not just for our project, but for for everyone in the area.
 The next slide, we start to get into some of the project specific data, looking at existing and projected future mode split data.
 This data comes from the 2022 American commuter survey.
 It indicates percentages
 shown in the columns.
 And the darker numbers represent the data that's from that survey.
 The lighter numbers, lighter columns, represent what we anticipate the project mode split to be.
 We think that because of the Wellington Connector and the Wellington Circle improvements, we think pedestrian and bicycle usage will increase.
 So we've adjusted the census data to move some of the
 some of the single occupant and the high occupant vehicle, which are basically carpool trips, we moved 5% from those categories into the bike category.
 And we'd like to say that that's a very conservative estimate because of the
 the increasing number of facilities that'll be promoted and provided, as well as the TDM measures for the project, which I'll get into towards the end of my presentation.
 But in general, what we wound up with was a 23% non-automobile travel mode that was expected.
 Well, then we've got 65% automobile travel.
 That's the combination of SOV, you know, somebody in their car driving alone, and HOV is somebody carpooling.
 And then there's 12% that is working from home or commutes using some other form of transportation.
 Those last two categories, the 65% and the 12%, we lump those together to result in 77% auto usage, just to provide a conservative analysis scenario.
 So, you know, it's a little bit of a factor of safety that's built into the mode split and the vehicle trip generations and assumptions, which is what we're going to get into on the next slide.
 So the trip generation information is based on the ITE trip generation manual.
 And this is standard protocol and required by MassDOT and Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR, for a source to estimate trip generation.
 So these are resulting vehicle trips after mode split adjustments for the residential uses only.
 The trips in the column labeled existing storage facility, those are trips that we counted and are presently there, presently existing at the site.
 So in terms of the time periods, we look at the weekday daily, the weekday morning, and the weekday evening peak hour.
 The two peak hour numbers are used for the analysis.
 The daily numbers, that's the total entering and exiting.
 So of the 1,038, that's 519 trips entering and exiting over the course of a 24-hour day.
 In terms of the traffic increase through the neighborhood, on the outside edge of the neighborhood, we're looking at four to 14 trips during the peak hours.
 On the Fellsway, we're looking at 18 to 41 trips with higher numbers if we include both directions.
 In the morning, I think we've got something like 47 trips at the Fellsway and Riverside intersection.
 In the evening at the Fells Way and Central Street intersection with Medford Street, we've got 46.
 So those numbers, they vary depending on the direction.
 You can see there's a higher split with exiting traffic in the morning and entering traffic in the evening.
 And I know that when Bill gets into the site plan, which you've seen already, there's site access to Amaranth and to Myrtle and to Fellsway.
 because of the location of the access there, would be expected to see a larger increase right on the street before it's dispersed.
 But again, in general, we think that the trips are manageable, which I'll get into when we get into the level of service and the analysis results.
 23% of commuters using non-automobile modes of transportation, we expect that to be a low number.
 And we expect to put measures into place to increase the transit percentage as well as the other forms of sustainable transportation.
 So the next slide, we start to get into the traffic analysis.
 And let me just back up.
 We use the existing counts to develop future conditions.
 We look at a seven-year projection.
 And then we add background projects or traffic from background projects that are on the books that are proposed or that are approved and not yet constructed or constructed and not yet occupied.
 And we also include a background growth rate.
 That scenario is called the no build conditions, basically the future condition without the project.
 And then we add the project traffic to that, that gives us the future conditions with the project called the build condition.
 So as I mentioned, we used a 1% growth rate for general background growth.
 We included traffic from 11 background projects, including the expansion of the Encore Casino and the Assembly Row expansions.
 This gives us the no-build condition, which is a base to compare the impacts of the project in the build condition.
 So, we added the trips that you saw in the previous slide into the network to identify the delay increases due to the project.
 And a summary is that in terms of the level of service or LOS, which
 Again, backing up a little bit, assigns letters to delay ranges.
 So for unsignalized intersections, for instance, a level of service A is an average delay per vehicle less than 10 seconds.
 A level of service B is an average delay of between 10 and 15 seconds.
 A level of service C, like what we're talking about here, is an average delay of between 15 and 25 seconds.
 So, you know, we're not talking about huge delays at these locations.
 In fact, the project, when we add the project traffic into the network, what we find is that there's really no change in level of service at 13 of the 14 locations.
 There's level of service C or better at nine intersections.
 The two Fellsway locations, which are on this graphic, locations one at Riverside and
 Location 4 at Central and Medford Street, those are operating at level of service F or greater than an 80 second delay with or without the project.
 We also did a supplemental analysis of the operations at those 2 intersections.
 There's a pedestrian phase that's not to get too deep into the weeds on traffic.
 signal timing but if we if we remove the if we discount the pedestrian phase it gives an idea of what the what the what the impact of the project is and and again the the level of service didn't change with that supplemental analysis that's in the that's in the
 In the TIA, in general, delays are less than 2 seconds as a result of the project.
 So, the next slide, we start to get into transportation demand management.
 And I mentioned previously that we plan to improve on that 23% non-auto transportation component.
 And one way we do that is with the TDM measures.
 So these consist of a number of proven principles and measures to encourage the use of more sustainable transportation instead of personal vehicles.
 Things like a transportation coordinator or a TC would be designated for the project.
 It's probably somebody in the leasing office or the on-site maintenance.
 Somebody that residents can go to, someone that will coordinate with the lower Mystic TMA, for instance, can provide information on transit, biking, walking, what other options are available.
 There'll be support for telecommuting with high-speed internet and other options.
 Secure bicycle parking is proposed, and we're still working through the details on those, but we're looking at also providing space for e-bikes to be charged in the facility.
 We're also looking at EV charging facilities on site.
 Again, these are things that are still
 still being worked through the details on, but this is part of the proposal for the project.
 And coordination with Blue Bikes in order to potentially set up a Blue Bikes kiosk that would be able to be used by not just the residents of the project, but residents of the neighborhood as well.
 And as I meant, I believe I mentioned previously that Bill Lucas will also indicate how the site plan is proposed to have access to the potential Wellington connector.
 So all of these measures are in use, they're proven strategies, they're in use in Medford to some extent, but also in Boston and in Cambridge and Somerville and Everett and Malden, and that's because they work there.
 And some cities, you have to develop a TDM plan.
 And Davis is taking the charge or taking the lead on this to implement this plan.
 So, you know, just to summarize, I think the last slide just shows the conclusions.
 And, you know, this TIA indicates a minimal impact on peak hour traffic delays and vehicle queuing with no change in level of service at 13 or 14 intersections and less than a two-second increase in delay at most locations.
 Uh, the project is improving circulation and.
 I'm really doing a great preview for Bill, but the project is improving circulation in the neighborhood by introducing new on-street parking on Myrtle Street and Amaranth Ave.
 And this improves the accommodation and circulation for two-way traffic flow on both of those streets.
 The project is enhancing operations through the closure of two curb cuts, construction of a multi-modal sidewalk on Amaranth Ave.
 And there's no sidewalk there now, but the project includes the addition of that sidewalk.
 As I mentioned, eliminating curb cuts at the intersection of Myrtle, Amaranth, and Lawrence Street and at the corner of Myrtle Street and the Fellsway.
 And again, promoting alternative modes of transportation.
 It did another way to support the use of bicycles as an inclusion of a bicycle repair shop, as I mentioned, the secure storage and e-bike charging, as well as a tie-in to the Wellington connector.
 So we know that we still have the city and peer review process to work through, but we feel that all of these conclusions and points reinforce the
 the idea that the project can be accommodated as designed.
 With that, that's the end of my presentation.
 I'll turn it over to Bill Lucas from Bowler.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2036.759s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: 大家晚安。
 如果您听不到我的声音，请告诉我。
 但除此之外，我会继续前进。
 简单总结一下我今晚的谈话要点。
 快速的网站设计更新。
 我们对停车需求分析的回顾，斯科特可能会再次作为本次演讲的一部分。
 消防车在设施内的出入和循环。
 最后，公用事业和排水系统升级。
 请下一张幻灯片。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2068.952s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 抱歉，打扰一下，我之前可能误解了帕特。
 是打算将所有内容放在一起，然后董事会提出问题，还是分成两个不同的部分？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2083.02s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 抱歉，我们的目的是将它们全部展示在一起。
 这里只有几张简短的幻灯片。
 我们觉得一切都联系在一起，并通过更新的场地规划完成。
 看起来很棒，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2094.687s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: 迈克，此外，主席先生，从公民的角度来看，本次演讲的想法是将网站周围的流量元素与网站本身联系起来。
 我通常就是这样处理的。
 我们面前的场地规划与上次听证会上显示的略有不同。
 为了澄清起见，我只想回顾其中的一些观点。
 大部分项目和设计本身没有改变，建筑位置的大小保持不变。
 但我们所做的是尝试审查这个计划。
 从内部角度来看，从车辆和行人安全的角度来看，并且基于相同的主要因素之一。
 审查要点是查看紧急通道，我将在以后的一些幻灯片中介绍这一点，但现场本身周围的紧急通道车辆可确保我们通过现场周围和建筑物周围的通道从公共道路提供足够的通道。
 就已发生的其他一些计划更改而言，我们对前端入口点配置进行了小幅调整。
 这是由于几个原因造成的。
 再次，确保我们能够充分容纳紧急车辆，并努力增强这座新建筑和这个新项目进入社区本身的美观性和入口性。
 另一项小的设计调整是针对 Fellsway 方向的车站前部进行的。
 我们有机会审查了进出该设施的所有卡车、它们的转弯运动、入口走廊的布局以及与该设施相关的小型停车场的布局。
 此外，正如斯科特所说，我们对默特尔街和苋菜大道沿线的现场停车场​​进行了一些改动，但本质上也是小改动。
 主要是在 Amaranth，我们拓宽了街道以供车辆通行。
 后来在其正面提供了停车场和公共人行道。
 众所周知，目前，由于建筑物、电线杆的位置以及现有人行道的大切口，停车位受到限制。
 现在我们将沿着这个立面提供近 12 个停车位和人行道。
 此外，正如我所指出的，我们在现场审查和调整了由于车辆和行人流通而导致的场地的一些特征，包括一些进出建筑物的路径以及电动汽车和电动汽车无障碍停车位。
 我们目前正在展出一些无障碍车辆和电动车辆的展位。
 建筑物东北角附近的地面上，其余无障碍电动车停车位目前拟位于裙楼停车场内。
 请下一张幻灯片。
 Scott，您愿意进来谈谈这张幻灯片吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2327.881s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 当然，当然。
 因此，我们对 TIA 的部分需求进行了估计，并根据 ITE 的数据进行了计算，就像他们对行程生成手册所做的那样，他们进行了计算。
 就存储设施和拟议住宅开发项目的工作日和周末需求而言，考虑对与此处拟议和/或现有设施类似的设施的停车需求。
 这些需求费率、这些平均停车费适用于任何适用土地用途的特定单元或单元数量或建筑面积。
 这使得我们在一个工作日内平均需要 276 个停车位，252 个
 周末的停车位，所以，你知道，停车位供应量，一方面是大于的。
 估计最大停车需求，但是。
 但我知道，但是比尔，我会让你转到下一张幻灯片，因为我认为那是另一部分。
 对不起，我想我并不后悔。</p>

 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2440.872s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2441.172s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: 所以，我不知道你是否想直接去，我想你想从停车场看滑梯。
 斯科特，这是正确的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2451.76s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2457.18s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 我要快点跳进去。
 如果你回去，比尔，我认为停车幻灯片被浓缩到这张幻灯片中，以快速总结分区法。
 我们在底部有带星号的评论，只是我们认为与产品相比需要什么，我们想请你们讨论一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2484.263s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: 是的，目前根据您在上面看到的场地规划，我们正在考虑 324 个停车位，包括供实际住宅使用的现场和裙楼停车位。
 对于仓库，我们建议额外增加 22 个停车位。
 再次强调，这是目前的情况，也许会发生变化。
 但根据我们迄今为止所看到的一切，我们感受到了这一点。
 建议我们为这两个设施提供足够的停车位并予以考虑。
 我们过去从分区委员会得到的想法是不要在这个位置过度停车，而是尝试根据每种可用用途适当地停车。
 请下一张幻灯片。
 这张幻灯片提供了对
 前往梅德福的消防车及其从默特尔街到大楼前位置的路线。
 可能有点难以看见，但这是一辆消防车，向东驶向 Fellsway，右转朝主入口方向行驶，继续行驶到建筑物的前面。
 在任何紧急情况下您都可以访问的地方。
 然后我们只在右上角显示朝向街道的向外运动。
 这是我们用于此表示的消防车模型。
 据我所知，这符合梅德福消防队长的要求。
 请下一张幻灯片。
 这为消防车提供了从 Fellsway 到现场的循环，消防车右转，经过消防站，然后顺时针绕着大楼后面，驶入 Amaranth 大道。
 同样，这是我们必须对场地布局进行一些小调整的另一个原因，以确保我们能够容纳该尺寸的车辆。
 我们办公室的下一步是将这些材料提供给梅德福消防队长供其审查以及我们将来可能考虑的任何其他意见。
 我们可以转到下一张幻灯片。
 我想这些就是问题，但只是为了提供土建项目其余部分的最新情况，我们目前正在进行该项目，并希望向梅德福提交完整的、修订后的场地规划包，并处于测试阶段以供同行评审。
 我们目前正在审查现场公用设施和雨水管理。
 我们预计不会再有任何重要的事情发生。
 这些要素与我们一月份提出的一揽子计划有所不同。
 此时只需进行细化，以确认所有链接应位于建筑物本身的位置。
 此后，这座建筑进行了略微不同的调整和规划。
 同时，场地本身也有很多移动部件，因此我们需要将地下雨水管理系统放置在适当的位置，以确保它们与建筑物有足够的距离，然后我们可以与下游街道的下水道系统进行适当的连接。
 也就是说，我可能会把它还给帕特，或者在我们进行过程中打开它来提问。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2752.071s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 帕特，还有其他事吗？我们可以打开它吗？好的，太好了。
 所以此时，我将向董事会开放提问和评论。
 谁愿意先走？
 安德烈，请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2777.201s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 出色的。
 谢谢。
 感谢您的介绍。
 我想知道您是否可以更多地解释一下有关停车需求的假设，特别是在工作室和一间卧室周围。
 0.68 似乎有点低。
 我知道我不太喜欢过度停车，但我想知道它是如何计算的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2803.309s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，该数据完全基于 ITE 开发的现有设施的数量以及其他地点的数量。
 或多或少按单位类型分类并了解最新值。看看我们的六点八四一居室工作室和一点二三四两居室，但这些和那些比较，我的意思是，到底是什么样的项目？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2845.682s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 你知道
 与交通、其他模式有关。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2852.977s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我认为没有那么详细。
 我可以对此进行调查，但我不认为在这个特定类别中存在与这些用途的交通接近的详细程度。
 我知道我们做了一些初步的事情。
 嗯，MAPC 的完美停车报告包含大量数据，表明总体而言，该地区的许多多户住宅开发项目有大量未使用的停车位。
 但我可以进一步调查这个数字并给你一个答案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2906.403s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 好的，论坛上还有其他问题或评论吗？
 好吧，那我可以继续下一步了。
 所以我想当我们这样做时，我想更好地理解
 与停车需求相比，合理的停车余量是多少？
 所以我从这张幻灯片中了解到，法令要求 361 个职位空缺。
 申请人已经根据提案请求减少，适度减少 30。
 停车位需求
 整个工作日似乎是 276。
 那么这是什么？
 大约有 55 个额外职位空缺。
 在这 55 个空间中，我猜有 11 个额外空间用于存储。
 所以大约有44个
 缓冲区空间，这个数字正确吗？
 应该是更小还是更大的数字？
 我对这里的平常情况并没有很好的直觉。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3007.257s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 主席先生，我可以解决这个问题，我也可以让斯科特就技术要素进行权衡。
 古尔斯顿 (Goulston) 的帕特·加拉格尔 (Pat Gallagher) 和商店。
 因此，我认为我们正在努力平衡这样一个事实：一方面，我们拥有分区法的要求。
 我想澄清的是，数字 361 正是该项目所需要的。
 因此，这不包括剩余存储设施所需的空间数量。
 因此，我们正在尝试根据分区来平衡所需的内容。
 嗯，我们在这里展示的仍然需要停车豁免。
 用于设计以及共享停车审批。
 呃,在项目和相邻仓库之间。
 嗯，但也要平衡这与之间的担忧。
 住在邻近地区的人。
 溢出的停车位延伸到了社区本身。
 我认为我们正在努力在这里找到平衡，并且保持一点保守。
 这也是亨特总监在我们昨天谈话时也提到的，只是我们显示的估计峰值需求与我们将包含的需求之间的差值。
 但我认为这就是它的全部内容。
 您知道这些是估计值，我们必须考虑它们。
 由于所有这些不同的考虑，它可能会高于这个数字。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3104.82s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的，谢谢您，戈登先生，您还有什么要补充的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3110.571s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 不，我认为帕特总结得很好。
 我们发现，对许多抵达的这些单位的需求减少了
 他们开始上网，预订的停车位减少了，前往该地点的人可能来自其他地点并且不带车辆。
 因此，对个人交通的需求减少，从而对停车位的需求减少。
 但我同意这里的目的是在两者之间找到平衡
 您知道该法令的规定以及需求表明的供应量应该是多少。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3162.476s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 那么，需要明确的是，这些计数是否包括建筑物前面的 12 个路边停车位？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3174.226s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 不。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3175.247s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 出色地。
 在某些情况下，我的以下几组问题在演示文稿中被引用，在一种情况下，它们没有被具体引用，而是来自对补充 TIA 本身的仔细阅读。
 嗯，我只是想确保我了解公共交通部分。
 嗯，据我了解，MBTA 有关于当前高峰时段客流量的数据。
 我认为早上返回是最糟糕的情况。
 容量约为 29%。
 那呢？
 从这一站开始还是到最后？
 是稍后填满还是整条路线填满 29%？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3234.424s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，所以我必须就此回复你。
 我认为每天最多使用1256。
 容量级别为 5,088，约为已利用容量的 25%。
 但我会通过该具体号码与您联系。
 我认为就在那时，但我会就此回复您。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3276.771s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 好的，谢谢。
 迈克，请原谅我提出这个问题，如果你能插话澄清一下。
 是的，很高兴知道是否有办法
 一天中的高峰时间，对吗？
 如果一整天都是公交车，我想，你知道，深夜它们几乎是空的，但我很好奇高峰时段的容量是多少，你知道，它们在高峰时段满员吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3302.921s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的。
 安德烈，这就是我的意思。
 所以报告中有高峰时段的数字，
 我认为，当你早上到达时，在高峰时段，它仍然是 29%。
 但这分布在三辆公交车上，并不能表明其中一些公交车是否比其他公交车更满。
 然后，到了晚上，在回来的路上，我认为它接近 25%。
 是的，我很想知道答案，尤其是在回来的路上。
 因此，如果我们有居民使用公共交通工具，并且公交车一开始就满员，即使它们在停车前已经空了，我只是想确保那里没有问题。
 你要说点什么吗，斯科特？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3351.636s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，当然，
 从这一站到达。
 这就是乘客数量所在。
 你知道，那里有很多座位。
 到达这个折返点的巴士上有很多座位。
 到了这里之后，他就可以康复了。
 我们有这些信息。
 我们或许可以设计某种每站乘客表。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3381.533s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的。
 总的来说，我喜欢数据，但我认为要尽量保持数据有形，如何输入它是可以的，因为它是
 也许在线的中间是 29%。
 当这个地区的居民，无论是这个地点的居民，还是邻近物业的居民，都必须有能力前进。
 我想议会想知道我们是否会回来。
 因此，如果您去惠灵顿，您可能会稍后从惠灵顿返回。
 如果有任何运力问题，如果我猜测这些乘客数量，可能不会有问题，但如果能确定的话那就太好了。
 嘿，
 与此相关的是，我想我理解这里所有的详细报告。
 假设产生的出行中有 13% 是专门针对过境的。
 我查看了数字，高峰时段好像有 12 到 13 人。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3454.077s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，完全正确。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3456.298s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3457.627s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 出色地。
 如果分布在三辆公共汽车上，你知道，那就是三到四个人。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3463.23s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的。
 所以是的。
 最坏的情况是如果每个人都上公共汽车，如果公共汽车已满，但这不太合理。
 所以是的，乘坐三辆巴士会很有趣。
 看来是这样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3474.196s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的。
 我的意思是，所以我认为默特尔街仍然是静止的。
 嗯，大约已经走了三分之二了。
 所以，你知道，
 显然，随着距离惠灵顿越来越近，人口密度也在增加。
 因此，可能会有更多的骑手爬得更低。
 但同样，在这一点上，在这个位置，我理解你的问题，但在这一点上，看起来进出的巴士上会有很多座位。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3513.648s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 太好了，谢谢。
 然后是一组不同的问题，只是一个澄清。
 然后我在报告中看到了一些计数设备被破坏的令人遗憾的情况。
 然后有两个交叉点，因此使用了较旧的数据。
 我认为是中央和平克顿、中央和肯缪尔。
 是的。
 在邻近的十字路口，2020 年和现在的计数有很大差异，或者您认为这些是当前数字的合理近似值吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3550.355s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我们做到了，它们有点不同，但我们利用了两个十字路口两侧的位置并平衡了交通量。
 然后我们根据我们掌握的数据对进出这两条街道的流量进行了调整，我认为是 2019 年或 2020 年。
 所以，你知道，确实如此。
 我的意思是，你知道，这很不幸，但我对我们调整音量以解决这一问题的方式非常有信心。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3593.313s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 一切都好。
 谢谢。
 这些是我的问题。
 那么我们还有其他董事会成员想提出问题或发表评论吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3608.523s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 我们还有一个澄清：最后你描述了这个计划。
 你能再提醒我一下吗？
 现在，规划人员被告知，最有可能执行的计划是安排一名负责运输管理的人员并列出该名单。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3628.466s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我认为这就是计划的结构。
 我希望市政府以及可能的同行评审员添加或修改它，但目前这就是计划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3647.002s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3649.144s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 很好，谢谢。
 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？
 好吧，没有看到任何消息，现在主席正在等待一项动议，以开放有关补充交通影响评估的听证会的公开部分。
 非常感慨。
 我还有第二个吗？
 第二。
 好吧，我们打电话吧。
 艾维特？
 是的。
 安德鲁？
 是的。
 吉姆？
 是的。
 杰米？
 是的。
 迈克，是的。
 好的，大家好，听证会的公开部分现在开始。
 如果您是公众，并想对今晚提出的补充交通影响评估发表公开评论，请在 Zoom 上举手。
 打开相机并举起手。
 您可以在聊天中输入内容或向 dmcdougall 的 Dennis 发送电子邮件（网址为 medford-ma.gov）。
 我看到我们有一位公众想要就这个话题发言。
 Allison D.，请提供您的姓名和地址以供注册。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3737.295s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: 大家好，大家晚上好。
 艾莉森·达戈斯蒂诺。
 我代表丰多·达戈斯蒂诺。
 我们是 1022-1024 Fellsway 的业主。
 非常感谢您抽出时间。
 谢谢您的介绍。
 只是一些快速的事情。
 据我了解，流量评估似乎只是一天捕获的流量。
 也许这就是标准。
 我想指出的是，这是假期周末前的星期四。
 所以这可能不是最好的记录。
 典型的交通。
 还有一个评论也是关于高峰时段的，我不太同意。
 我当然看到了一种演变，我在这里已经 12 年了，我的岳母也在这里 50 多年了，在同一所房子里。
 然后我们绕Fellsway转一圈，景色很美。
 我想说的是，由于疫情的发展，下午的通勤高峰时间会提前一些。
 而且开始时间比指定的要早一些。
 所以要拿走一些东西。
 开场白：我认为我以数据为生，所以我知道数据可以代表你想要它显示的任何内容。
 我觉得把车的视点从早高峰时段的4辆增加到14辆，再增加到289辆，看起来确实很不合理。
 虽然我再次尊重精彩的演讲，
 关于平均停车费补偿从何而来的详细程度似乎是您在这样的会议中所期望的。
 也许这发生在幕后，我特别指的是停车需求分析幻灯片。
 如果您支持用源数据来表示道路上的汽车数量，则您需要了解源数据。
 上下。
 我的最后一个评论是街道规模的增加。
 我很欣赏阿玛丽斯。
 我确信这些人也这样做。
 如果默特尔街现在规模还没有扩大，我建议你去这个地方游览一下。
 如果您还没有这样做，您将无法超越两辆车。
 在默特尔街来回走动，没有人停下来，也没有人放过任何人。
 所以，你知道，我担心的肯定是这一点被忽视了。
 而默特尔仍然是一面倒的，劳伦斯也是一面倒的。
 你写下这个拥堵点在哪里，计划在哪里建设这个房产。
 对我来说，这并没有真正被谈论。
 但我也想快速地说：戴维斯公司，听着，你们创造了伟大的财产。
 河边很漂亮。
 我知道在交通评估中他们提到了Encore和Assembly。
 我想我们都可以就那里的不同之处达成一致。
 它不在任何这些房产的附近。
 非常分离。
 再说一遍，我的岳母在这里已经 50 多年了。
 你知道，我们只是想保护我们的社区。
 所以，谢谢你的时间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3938.629s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 我只是想确保在其中一些观点上存在共同的理解。
 然后是高峰时间。
 据我了解，这是通过计数来衡量的。
 这是正确的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3956.89s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，这是正确的。
 因此，就继续这一点而言，你知道，我们，我们，我们，我们计数，我们得到这些高峰时间，无论它们发生在哪里，如果它们是，如果它们是七到八，如果它们是七，15到八，15，如果它们是，你知道，八到八到九，无论最高峰时间是什么，这就是我们在分析中使用的。
 就是这样，这正是数据中显示的内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3986.686s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 总统先生，请允许我说。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3988.323s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3990.745s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 我可以请比尔·卢卡斯澄清有关默特尔街宽度的最后一点，并谈谈我们的提议吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4002.035s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，看起来很棒。
 请继续，比尔。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4005.096s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: 太好了，谢谢艾莉森。
 感谢您对演示文稿本身提出的问题和评论。
 而且，你知道，我很抱歉没有回应有关默特尔街的具体评论。
 话又说回来，也许我也这么做了。
 我们的目的是扩建默特尔街。
 这是一条现有的 26 英尺宽的路缘石，非常狭窄，因为我亲自去过那里并了解了那里的情况。
 但作为其中的一部分，我们要做的就是努力确保实现这一目标。
 我们将调整沿我们房产正面的现有人行道线，以提供沿默特尔街平行停车的额外宽度，作为其中的一部分，我们将改善人行道的状况，并实际上为城市提供一些土地
 既适合行人，也适合路边停车。
 因此，作为其中的一部分，戴维斯将放弃土地来拓宽默特尔街，并实现每个人都在寻求的更好的交通流量。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4081.991s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 还有另一个因素。
 提到了这一点。
 首先，对交通影响进行补充评估，这是公开记录。
 它要么已经在文件夹中，要么在会议结束后立即出现。
 阅读本报告的表六，我了解到在工作日早高峰期间，
 新车净车次90辆，进站21辆，出车69辆，下午高峰时段89辆，进站55辆，出车34辆。
 所以不是 14，而是 90 和 89。
 好的，登录和退出该网站，是的。
 好的。
 出色的。
 我认为这涵盖了问题。
 因此，如果还有其他公众想就这个话题发言，请发言。
 好吧，我们开始吧。
 我看见你。
 当我看到克里斯蒂娜时，我总是忘记如何发音她的姓氏。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4162.167s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 甚至不要尝试。
 让我告诉你。
 采取。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4166.609s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 只是为了记录，请。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4168.323s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 克里斯蒂娜·卡赫（Christina Kach），默特尔街 130 号。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4173.086s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4174.847s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 好的。
 因此，我想在艾莉森关于周四长周末之前进行的交通研究的评论中添加一个简短的说明。
 那周的星期一我们还遭遇了暴风雪。
 雪情紧急，学校关闭，停车限制。
 然后我们度过了一个漫长的周末，并在交通研究的那一周遇到了雪灾紧急情况。
 所以我有一些问题。
 所以今天我很幸运有时间从头到尾阅读了整个62页的文档。
 我有一些可能与此和演示直接相关的评论。
 但我的第一个问题是，收集数据后，
 你是如何进行分析的？
 您使用 Minitab 统计软件吗？
 你用的是模拟模型吗？
 数据从哪里得到这个结果？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4231.123s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 抱歉，我想打断一下，我想确保我们不会陷入对话。
 这些应该是公众意见。
 克里斯蒂娜，也许你可以列出你的问题。
 因此，总的来说，我打算如果我们没有这些信息，我们肯定会要求提供。
 但我只是想避免谈话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4253.085s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 当然。
 我将对其进行全部审查。
 所以这是第一。
 第二，我在您今天的 PowerPoint 演讲和完整的 Word 文档中都看到，将有一个关于路边停车的新报价，以及一个关于提供更多关于路边停车的报价。
 是否有一张地图我没有看到它在哪里或是什么样子？
 所以如果有的话
 他们将如何增加更多路边停车位的新计划已经在某个地方，请让我知道它在哪里，以便我可以看到它。
 然后我的最后一个问题是：您在结论和摘要中提到，特别是在第七页，如果您想知道我在看什么，随着工业用途的消除，空间、交通繁忙、重型车辆和卡车将会更小。
 我在报告正文中没有看到您进行此分析的任何地方。
 当然，现在很明显，您将摆脱活动艺术和丘吉尔家具，因此它们将不再存在。
 然而，当你在房产中添加 300 个、几乎 300 个单位，并且我面前有一条可供送货车辆使用的车道时，我很难相信卡车实际上会更少。
 在默特尔街苋菜社区，只需在默特尔街增加一个送货卡车入口就可以消除两家企业。
 我必须意识到，我必须推理，即使不是更多，至少是同一件事。
 而且我没有看到这个分析发生在哪里，对于少说的声明。
 这是我的三个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4366.302s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 很好，很棒。
 我正在做笔记。
 我想确保我们没有错过任何事情。
 一切都好。
 所以我想我可以谈谈第二个问题。
 我认为我们现在所看到的代表的是路边停车。
 所以我知道放大这个可见的东西并不容易。
 但如果你看看苋菜和香桃木，
 放置这些小绿色碎片，它们实际上分隔了街道上的一些停车位，这些停车位位于房产内，并用于扩大空间。
 会是这样的，我不记得Amaranth和Myrtle之间的分离，但它在照片中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4407.723s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 是的，总统先生。
 更深入地研究一下这条街。
 所以，你知道，我再次认为
 致力于减少人行道并通过拓宽街道创造新空间。
 我认为这对于这个团队来说是一个非常独特的承诺，也是我在此类项目中从未遇到过的事情。
 我认为重要的是要认识到这是团队对社区做出的真正让步。
 授予该停车场地役权。
 默特尔的结果是拥有大约，比尔·卢卡斯可以更多地谈论这一点，但拥有与今天大约相同数量的空间。
 这样做的方式是因为它正在关闭拐角处的一条非常大的人行道。
 然后，在苋菜大道上增加了一个现在不存在的新停车场。
 而这一切都注定会成为公共停车场。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4480.586s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 好吧，所以对于苋菜市默特尔街的居民来说，这并不能得到保证。
 好的，谢谢您的澄清。
 因此，我们将不再为默特尔地区的居民提供停车位。
 这只是增加了一个新的停车场。
 我明白。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4495.718s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的。
 是的。
 据我了解，该空间的使用规则将受梅德福条例管辖。
 而且它很复杂，因为它是私有财产。
 所以我不会假装我知道细节。
 但目前我将它们解释为该地区任何有权在这些街道上停车的人都可以停车的空间。
 加拉格尔律师，对吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4525.355s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 这是正确的。
 同样，我们的目的是让它成为一个公共停车场。
 他们可能是附近的居民，也可能是该项目的访客。
 这就是目前的意图。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4539.667s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 很好，谢谢。
 现在，另外两个问题，我认为它们都是斯科特的问题。
 然后是关于统计软件或用于生成这些报告的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4552.693s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，然后对计数数据进行处理和平衡。
 正如我所提到的，我们会关注高峰时段、高峰时段的流量，并进行具体的流量分析。
 它是工业中使用的随机分析模型。
 而且它是一个标准软件包，是国家审查机构要求的软件包之一。
 它的使用在该行业的顾问中相当广泛。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4601.04s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 很好，谢谢。
 最后一个问题与重型车辆和卡车的计数有关。
 所以我尝试自己对文档进行关键字搜索。
 我不知道除了结论中的陈述之外，补充中是否有任何内容讨论了这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4621.971s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，不，我认为这更多的是对我们在那里看到的操作的回顾，在那里我们看到卡车在停车场周围行驶。
 我认为送货车辆、亚马逊车辆、UPS、快递公司，这些车辆现在无处不在。
 我认为交付方式是针对特定区域的，而且很可能
 他们可能已经在那里了。
 许多送货车辆可能已经出现在该地点周围社区的街道上。
 我们认为，一旦开发完成，他们就会进入网站，而不是像他们中的一些人那样浏览网站。
 但我不知道它们是否真的代表了附近现有设施的增加。
 然而我认为，通过消除那里存在的一些工业用途，这些大型车辆将不再进入该地点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4713.671s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 好吧，你有没有想过澄清一下你说话时的语言
 重型车辆和卡车，不包括送货车辆。
 因为当我看到卡车时，我说我放了送货车辆。
 这就是为什么我想我要澄清这段文字以避免进一步的混乱。
 但您也与 UPS、FedEx 和 DHL 讨论了他们对多少费用的预测
 你的增加将会是。
 因此，如果您谈论供应链以及他们如何确定路线，他们会根据模式以及在特定时间向特定区域交付的数量按区域进行。
 因此，如果您有近 300 个单位、近 300 人，那么可能不止一辆卡车。
 还有 UPS，我特别知道他们每天运送不止一辆卡车。
 那么，您是否研究过有关流量的运筹学原则？
 适用于需要运送更多货物的卡车。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4772.401s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 我们不讨论运载工具的任何运筹学原则。
 这在某种程度上超出了标准流量研究的范围。
 但是，我的意思是，如果市政府和同行评审顾问表示这是我们需要审查的事情，我们可以努力做到这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4800.84s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，到目前为止，我的目的是让董事会有同行评审顾问来做这件事。
 凭经验审查这一点并审查此类报告。
 因此，董事会当然打算考虑公众的意见和要求以及同行评审顾问的专家指导。
 所以我只是说一个建议，而不是要求，但总的来说，我相信一个原则，即最终报告不应该做出没有得到某些人支持的声明。
 那里的表或数据。
 所以我认为也许结论应该非常清楚地说明为什么我们认为是这种情况，或者也许只是不具体提及这一点。
 但至于进一步分析的可能性，我认为董事会打算等待同行评审反馈，届时做出决定。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4866.412s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 明白了。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4867.273s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 一切都好。
 所以我们有里士满居民的食物。提供您的姓名和地址进行注册。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4873.717s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 大家好，我的名字是日本料理。
 我是业主，住在街对面的 1 26128 Myrtle Street。
 在此图中，建筑物的新开口或主入口。
 我也有独特的视角，因为我暂时住在梅德福的 RE150，我认为这是一个与拟议区域类似的开发项目。
 我想我有自己独特的看法
 交通、送货以及居民进出这座大楼所发生的一切。
 我想我将从我的第一个评论开始，轮到。
 比如汽车使用自行车的比例，我认为不是这样的。
 你知道，完全合理。
 我知道。
 每个人都在尝试增加自行车并增加容量，但是，你知道，今天我们看，到处都没有骑自行车的人。
 嗯，至少半年吧。
 好的？
 所以，嗯。
 我想看看这个数字是否应该减少一些。
 我还有一个关于计算数量的问题。
 建筑物内司机的额外行程或影响，对吗？
 这些数据是否仅代表产生出行的居民，还是考虑了门卫、送餐人员、优步、包裹和访客，所有这些也将前往这座大楼的出行？
 你知道，生活在 150 岁，有送餐、Uber 接送，还有 24 小时包裹递送。
 亚马逊每天来这里四次、五次、六次。
 UPS 和联邦快递也是如此。
 所以这不仅仅是一日达。
 你知道，送货源源不断。
 卡车，也有人从这里来来去去。
 他们不会停留太久。人们有1年的租约。
 他们来了又走。
 因此，搬家卡车不断地来来去去，而且是直接的。
 我认为。
 嗯，就在拟议的新入口前面。
 我想看看有关的数据。
 每小时进出的班次是多少？
 这条街就是那个入口，对吗？
 为什么。
 现在是0了，我可以，我可以住在街对面，我可以住在我的房子里，而不用担心汽车。
 在我家内外，尤其是因为，你知道，我知道你正在增加公园、街道停车位和街道宽度。
 左转和右转的两车道街道不一定足够，这取决于人们如何驾驶，特别是如果他们是卡车或缺乏经验的司机或因为要送食物或送人而匆忙的人，对吧？
 他们不一定住在那里。
 所以我对这个切入点非常担心并且没有和他交谈。
 你知道，你提到了80次旅行、90次旅行。
 在高峰时段进出场所，但是。
 每小时和全天多少钱？
 我认为出行次数增加了 0 到 90 次。
 你知道，嗯，一直在那个、那个、那个位置、那个、那个、那个、那个入口之外，目前什么都不存在。
 所以这是我最关心的问题，你知道，在我家前面有一个直接入口。
 那么好吧。
 我要说的就是这些。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5123.054s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 是的。
 所以我认为，在详细的报告中，有一些针对单位本身的预测。
 嗯，我要请斯科特帮我审阅一下，但我认为是第九、十和十一，是的，我想是九、十和十一。
 是的。
 确切地。
 是的。
 然后，嗯，
 如果我理解正确的话，我相信 Chow 先生位于该网站的 C 盘上，该盘预计占容量的 5%，或者总共 10%。
 因此，5% 左转，5% 右转。
 这是离开然后进入。
 也是5%。
 我说得对吗？
 我在读这个吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5190.935s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，是的，没错。
 我的意思是，大多数行程预计会使用 Fellsway 和 Fellsway 访问，一小部分将使用 Amaranth，而 Myrtle 访问的目的实际上是为了获得一小部分
 项目流量，但是，是的，它有效。
 事实证明这件事发生在一天之内。
 即将进行 50 次行程，还有 50 次行程。
 出来后，这已经超过24小时了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5238.729s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 很好，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5240.25s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 嗯，我们还有其他成员吗？
 抱歉，我可以这样做吗？
 要求澄清这一假设。
 是的，我想是的。
 我们似乎假设 10% 的出行都来自于此。
 那，嗯，我想，呃，这很有趣。
 你在旅行期间离开，对吗？
 是的，我不确定。
 为什么是10%？
 为什么应该是10%？
 我的意思是，如果那是主入口的话。
 我认为 60-70% 的人会停下来。
 人们开车，到达大楼最简单、最方便的方法就是穿过默特尔街，朝这个出口走。
 这不是菲尔斯的方式。
 您从该地区面向 Fells Way 的街道进入。
 我的意思是，走进大楼，如果我从西边过来，
 他没有来，他走进了我家前面的大楼。
 我不会去，我不会去大楼的后面，我也不会去Fellsway朝那个方向走。
 所以，我的意思是，10% 似乎不太合理。
 至少有 33% 的时间，而且我认为这个比例要多得多，因为当你可以开车到大楼前面时，为什么还要开车到大楼后面呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5329.225s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 所以，如果我理解正确的话，
 Fellsway 上有人向北走，因为他们无法进入 Fellsway 入口，你说是的，你的观察是他们会使用默特尔街，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5352.307s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，我是说现在人们进入这个地区的方式是很多交通来自西部。
 所以下面，我认为是劳伦斯街，或者他们穿过这条街。
 如果有人是，
 城北，他们将从那里出发。
 这是入口并向西走。
 如果他们来了，回家了，他们也会从西边来。
 在 93 号公路上，因为这样可以更轻松地穿过那些小巷。
 为了对抗沿着菲尔斯路而来的交通。
 我想，如果你在高峰时段在那里，你会看到有多少汽车在这些小巷里来来往往，以避免 Fellsway，因为你会被困在掉头或其他需要绕行的地方。
 从北向南向西走比沿着 Fellsway 任何一个方向走都容易。
 我明白。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5426.144s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 是的。
 斯科特，如果您能澄清百分比是如何确定的，我将不胜感激。
 然后我也在复习我的笔记，忘记问出行生成是否考虑了送货车辆。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5445.82s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 当然。
 因此，重要的是要记住
 通往车库的通道是，有一条穿过 Amaranth 的通道，然后还有另一个通道穿过该入口。
 是的，你可以准确地看到帕特在哪里。
 所以，你知道，我们预计会有一些流量出现或消失。
 向西行驶并从西边到达，我们认为交通更有可能使用 Amaranto 接入点而不是 Myrtle Street 接入点，因为
 你知道，默特尔的访问实际上是为，你知道的，而不是居民设计的。
 它是供游客使用的区域。
 以便进行这些交付。
 从默特尔（Myrtle）出发，绕过内部环形交叉路口，经过排屋，然后到达入口处，确实不是一条容易的路。
 如果您已经来自西方，我认为您更有可能选择使用 Amaranth 热点。
 因此，Fellsway 上的流量可能会使用此 Fellsway 接入点。
 这是项目其余流量的所在
 来吧。
 至于周先生的其他问题，骑自行车，我认为是旅行中相对较小的组成部分。
 再说一次，基本上，如果你看看现有的数据，
 交通、步行和在家工作以及人们使用的其他模式，这大约代表
 如果不考虑自行车的比例，它似乎占使用量的 30% 左右。
 因此，我们已经假设 77% 的出行使用车辆。
 因此，这已经是一个保守的假设。
 如果我们撤退，
 如果我们去掉 5% 的自行车百分比并像人口普查数据中那样在家工作，并像人口普查数据中那样使用其他人的交通方式，那么我们将只使用分配给车辆出行的交通量的 70%。
 所以我认为从这个意义上来说这已经是一个保守的假设。
 计算或预计的行程包括所有用户，因为它们是站点访问行程。
 所以它们包括送货车辆，包括垃圾车，还包括回家的旅程。
 你知道，我明白人们来来去去。
 在综合体中，你知道，就是这样，他们正在移动卡车，这些是我们继续研究场地规划并评估它们的事情。
 这些类型的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5704.542s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 主席先生，请允许我谢谢您。
 是的，继续吧，加拉格尔律师。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5711.503s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 我只是想在 Scott 所说的基础上补充一些内容，正如 Pat 提到的，我们昨天与测试团队进行了一次非常富有成效的会议。
 作为其中的一部分，我们讨论了 TDM 措施和其他策略，我们可以使用这些策略来减轻我们正在讨论的额外旅行的影响。
 我认为随着我们的推进，我知道测试版仍在接受审查。
 并将提供书面意见。
 但是，例如，我们肯定会考虑将交通平静等措施视为鼓励朝某个方向（例如 Fellsway）行驶的一种方式。
 因此，这些是我们已经讨论过的、我们肯定会关注的事情类型，我们将关注测试版以及董事会对此的建议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5761.856s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 如果5%的出行是从这个入口出发，那还有必要吗？
 关闭此条目是可选的吗？
 如果你说 5% 的行程来自那里，那么它对于这座建筑来说似乎是无用的资源。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5781.484s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 据我了解，这最初是作为一种交付方式添加的，但并没有
 呃，依靠，嗯，其他入口，那将靠近建筑物的前面，并且，嗯，我想也许是租赁办公室停车场的一部分或类似的东西已经在那里提议了。
 现在有点改变了，因为我认为这就是北行消防车必须进入的方式
 西区物业。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5815.379s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 这是正确的吗？
 这是正确的。
 这是我们目前正在制定的场地规划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5820.56s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 出色地。
 好的。
 斯科特，最后需要澄清的一点是。
 因此，在 Fellsway 以北，要使用 Fellsway 入口的居民将在该位置以北掉头，然后下车。
 是这样吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5839.375s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我们知道那里很拥堵，但与想要左转然后从中间下车的交通相比，这似乎仍然是一个更好的选择。
 我们预计会有一些流量这样做，但与这种类型的移动相关的延误可能比返回的延误还要多。
 我们有一些流量
 同样，这些流量来自西部，部分流量来自 Riverside 和 Central，部分流量来自 Amaranth，大部分流量来自 Fells Way。
 由于 Fells Way 的位置和通道的性质，交通将在这两个十字路口掉头。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5919.241s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 海梅，你有什么问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5922.274s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的，我想在上次会议上我提到了退货问题并开车经过该地区。
 我的意思是，实际上，上 Fellsway 的选择是到路口，掉头，沿着 Fellsway 走，进入 Fellsway 的入口，上到路口，左转，沿着 Kenmare 走，或者可能有些人可能会选择沿着 Fellsway 走到 Riverside，沿着 Riverside 走，再上
 斯普林街，然后是劳伦斯街。
 但我认为这比上 Fellsway 复杂得多。
 我认为这种情况发生的可能性较小。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5964.428s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我明白。
 好吧，谢谢。
 一切都好。
 我们还有其他公众愿意就这个话题发言吗？
 我没有看到任何。
 卡泰德拉 (Cátedra) 等待一段时间才向公众关闭。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5984.235s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 等待。
 有人在说话。
 有人无语了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5988.339s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，他就是一个不断激活沉默的人。
 我会检查他们是否真的想谈谈还是只是技术问题。
 还有其他公众想要发言还是这只是一个意外的取消静音？
 是的，我认为这是一场无声的事故。

 非常感慨。
 我还有第二个吗？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6049.932s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 下一个。
 我认为伊薇特介入了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6053.515s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 是的，我道歉。
 你能打开要掉头的地图吗？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6076.468s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的。
 然后是位置四，即中心和 Fellsway，以及位置一，即 Riverside 和 Fellsway。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6086.44s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 当时有没有讨论过改进这一点的可能性？
 因为我记得回程线可能会很长，而且我认识到这已经是一个糟糕的十字路口，而且不一定会变得更好。
 但有没有讨论过？能否讨论一下有时以不同方式改善周围街道的其他开发项目？
 我想，这是可能发生的事情吗？
 我不知道那会是什么样子，但是，你知道，延长那个左转，那个左转，你的车道或者什么，但是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6128.905s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，当我们进行分析时，我们发现确实存在很多延误，四个登机口处有很多队列以及登机口内的所有移动。
 所以，你知道，如果你知道，你可能会看看
 你知道，信号时序修改，但你实际上是在优先考虑一个动作而不是另一个动作。
 至于修改中间带以可能延长它或延长左转车道，我们还没有考虑过。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6183.348s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 如果我可以再补充一件事，我想，我们的立场和所处的位置，我们在这里试图考虑的是如何最大程度地减轻我们的影响。
 好的。
 但这两个路口已经处于最低服务水平。
 嗯，所以我想我们会进行这些对话并做
 我们可以在第 40B 章要求的范围内合理采取哪些行动。
 但我只是想现实一点，因为我认为我们对 Fells Way 进行任何物理改变的能力都存在一些真正的限制。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6231.436s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 需要明确的是，那些
 限制是否包括需要与 MassDOT 进行讨论和接受？
 实际上，使用 DCR。
 就是这样。
 出色地。
 好的。
 好吧，伊薇特，如果你问完了问题，下一个是安德烈。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6254.77s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的，我还有一些问题和意见。
 其中之一与停车管理本身很接近。
 我没有听到你谈到空缺职位将如何分配。
 我会这么做，因为你不是一切
 我没听你说如何分配，居民会付停车费吗？
 访客空间是如何管理的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6292.296s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 我认为，拉鲁先生，这些都是
 我们仍然没有给你答案。
 我认为我们肯定正在考虑所有这些问题。
 我会问帕特是否有什么要补充的，但我认为现在的答案是我们会跟进你，但我们正在经历这个过程，这也将成为我们与审稿人对话的一部分。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6322.029s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 好的，太好了。
 另一个，
 我的另一个评论问题是：
 我觉得交通需求管理计划有点薄弱。
 我希望看到一些额外类型的激励措施来激励您的居民使用公交系统，以便我们能够超越公共交通的拼车数量。
 我想知道你是否可以对此进行一些创造性的思考，如果这意味着
 你知道，帮助居民获得补贴通行证或自己补贴通行证或类似的事情。
 我确信那里有一些创造性的想法。
 我不是这个领域的专家。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6375.676s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 我想昨天我们在与贝塔和亨特导演的谈话中提到了这一点。
 我想，这也是我们一定会看到的。
 我也会把那个桶放进去，你知道，我们对尝试建立一个蓝色自行车站非常感兴趣。
 我认为如果这看起来可行的话，我认为这对于推广自行车运动也会有很大帮助。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6409.432s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。

 似乎有一些最初的东西
 与候选人的对话。
 我只想注册。
 我只是看一下名单。
 例如，我看杰夫。
 从时间顺序来看，根据您今天获得的信息和讨论，您认为我们什么时候会在同行评审信方面获得更多细节？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6465.702s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 主席先生、董事会成员们晚上好。
 是的，我们对报告进行了初读。
 所以，你知道，我现在已经确定了更多信息、澄清之类的事情。
 但我们没有深入检查计算，你知道，附录，那种类型的信息。
 而且，你知道，在实地考察时，我们必须去现场观察。
 交通状况，采取一些措施。
 你知道，我们还需要几周的时间。
 我想。
 事实上我下周就要去度假了，所以这是死气沉沉的一周。
 所以也许几周后，我们只需要一些时间来制作一个。
 你知道，彻底检修。
 我们昨天进行了很好的讨论，议员们提出了很多问题，就像安德烈刚才提到的停车和 TDM，我们最初的反应或疑虑是一样的。
 我们对此已经有所了解，但我们必须深入细节，这需要更多时间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6551.084s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 嗯，是的，感谢您的更新。
 所以我知道这是因为
 按照事物呈现的顺序，我们无论如何都没有遵循原始的时间线。
 但我认为，初衷是为了完成我们尚未完成的事情。
 因此，委员会希望看到的下一件事是更新的建筑规划。
 然后我认为下次会议理想情况下我们会审查更新的工程和交通计划以及同行评审意见。
 需要明确的是，我们的下一次听证会定于 3 月 26 日星期二举行，距现在不到两周。
 所以这就是那个地方
 如果一切按计划进行，下一步将是更新建筑计划。
 这意味着 4 月 11 日星期四将是工程和交通出现的日子。
 所以我只是想和候选人沟通一下，协调一下接下来的话题。
 您认为我们跟得上吗？
 或者下次听证会我们应该做什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6642.127s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 谢谢总统先生。我认为我们同意这种做法。
 目前，我们希望向市政府、议会和我们在戴维斯广场的审阅者提供更新的建筑包。
 我想在本周晚些时候或下周初，目标是下周与我们的评审员进行后续会议，并能够在 26 日的下一次听证会上介绍这一点。
 嗯，然后进入 4 月 11 日的下一次听证会。
 我同意，只要测试版有机会提供反馈，我们肯定能够进行讨论。
 运输分析和更多细节。
 我想我还要补充一点，我可以将其交给比尔·卢卡斯（Bill Lucas），但我认为我们将能够对更新的民用系列进行更深入的讨论。
 你知道，如果我们不一定有书面意见，至少我们可以在 4 月 11 日提交完整的土建计划。
 比尔，我说话是否不合时宜，或者这是正确的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6714.468s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: 你这话并没有不合时宜。
 这是正确的。
 我们的计划是在下周末之前交付一套更新的土建图纸。
 希望这能让 Bede 有足够的时间来解决这个问题，并在 11 号及时给我们提供良好的反馈。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6737.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 很好，很棒。
 所以这听起来像是一个计划。
 今晚在继续之前我们还应该讨论其他话题吗？
 我认为我们讨论了当晚计划的主要主题，只是检查是否还有其他需要讨论的内容，无论是后勤方面的还是其他方面的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6759.369s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: 主席先生，我认为这都是从候选人的角度来看的，我们再次非常感谢董事会和我们的评审员所花费的时间，我们认为我们已经进行了一些非常好的对话，我们期待着继续进行这些对话。
 我们对该项目感到非常兴奋。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6779.407s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 非常好，精彩。
 嗯，谢谢您的更新。

 非常感慨。
 我还有第二个吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6803.907s">[Unidentified]</a>: 第二。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6804.627s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，我们打电话吧。
 安德鲁？
 是的。
 吉姆？
 是的。
 艾维特？
 是的。
 杰米？
 是的。
 迈克，是的。
 一切都好。
 这件事一直持续到今天。
 所以，谢谢朋友们。
 祝你晚安。
 我们的议程上还有另外两个项目，只是行政更新和会议。
 今晚我们有任何行政更新吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6840.788s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 我不认为我能想到任何关于它的事情。
 唯一的另一件事就是两周后我们的会议的讨论。
 我们想在会议的这一部分期间做一些事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6852.076s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，我认为你只是指协调。
 这是安排我们例行会议的问题。
 是这样吗？
 是的。
 是的。
 所以这是我们不需要做的事情。
 我们也可以离线进行，但是是的，我们会离线进行。
 好的，一切都很好。
 看起来不错。
 一切都好。
 然后是会议一分钟。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6874.404s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 嗯，我知道我给你发了一些，但我正在努力记住我给你发了哪些。
 所以我道歉。
 嗯，我有很多次看到 Rachel 做了很多事情，而且他们真的很棒。
 所以我不记得哪些是我发给你的，哪些是我没有发给你的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6885.986s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我有1月25号。
 1 月 11 日，我认为这是例行会议。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6902.314s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 我没有给你寄二月份的，所以我为此道歉。
 我可以在下次之前把这个给你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6906.097s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 另外，是的，就雷切尔而言，我认为我们还必须批准特别会议纪要。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6918.652s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 是的，这就是我主要指的，特别会议，我派给你们的那些。
 我想我不记得了。
 会议记录很多。
 所以我想回去看看我发送的电子邮件是什么。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6932.943s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 看起来不错。
 但是，是的，我认为我们不需要批准今晚的会议记录。
 所以这听起来像是一个计划。
 您将它们发送给我们，然后我们将在下次会议上批准它们。
 看起来不错？
 出色的。
 很好，很棒。
 我们的议程到此结束。
 总统正在等待结束会议的动议。
 关闭会议的动议。
 我还有第二个吗？
 第二。
 好吧，我们必须参加考试。
 杰米？
 吉姆？
 是的。
 贝丝？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6967.823s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6968.784s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 安德鲁？
 是的。
 微？
 是的。
 好了，会议结束了。</p>
