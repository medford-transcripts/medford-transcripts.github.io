    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=465.548s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Great, thank you very much.
 Pat.
 Mr. Chairman members of the board for the record.
 My name is Scott Thornton with Vanessa associates.
 We prepared the traffic assessment for the projects working with the Davis companies, bowler and cube 3 studios.
 We think that the TIA, just as an initial statement, we think that the TIA shows that the project can be accommodated by the road network and the street system.
 And I will get into the reasons why during my presentation.
 But as noted, we're calling this a supplemental traffic study.
 The initial TIA was submitted in November of last year, and that was a study that had been prepared previously with older data.
 We think that while the findings are generally consistent between the two documents, we understand that with passage of time, the study required an update.
 The scope for that document, the initial TIA was determined with the director of traffic and transportation for the city.
 This supplemental TIA used the same scope.
 We left the supplemental TIA as a draft because we know that city staff will review the document.
 As Pat mentioned, we've had an initial meeting with BETA, the city's peer reviewer.
 So we anticipate there may be some changes to the TIA before it becomes
 sort of memorialized as a completely final document and ready for the file.
 So the Supplemental TIA was based on the revised site plan that was presented last month.
 The TIA was submitted on March 5th.
 So the supplemental TIA reviewed impacts during the critical weekday morning and weekday evening time periods, looking at 14 intersections in the study area.
 And I'll get into the explanation of that in a minute.
 TIA considered the transit, pedestrian, bicycle facilities, as well as vehicle impacts and safety considerations in the identification of impacts for the project.
 The next slide shows the site in context to the study area.
 As I mentioned, 14 intersections in total, four signalized intersections really on the corners of the study area, a couple
 intersections with Fellsway, a couple intersections with Spring Street that are the signalized locations.
 And then we have 10 un-signalized intersections located on the periphery of the site and also in the neighborhood.
 We did an extensive field inventory out in the study area.
 We noted that all streets have sidewalks on both sides.
 There's generally parking on one or both sides of the streets in the neighborhood.
 In terms of facilities, we noted that DCR modified the Fellsway with bike lanes on each side and last year put in curb extensions at the Myrtle Street intersection.
 We conducted traffic counts in January between the hours of 7 and 9 in the morning weekday and 4 to 6 p.m.
 Those were done on January 11th, which was a Thursday.
 We would expect that, you know, we try to do those counts for weekday time periods between Tuesday and Thursday.
 That's generally when traffic is consistent at a consistent level.
 In general, the peak hours start in the morning around 7.45, go from 7.45 to 8.45.
 There's a few outliers, some start at 7, some start at 7.15, but in general, that's about the time period for the morning.
 And in general, in the evening, the peak hour time period occurs between 5 and 6.
 We adjusted the volumes to raise them to the average month conditions, which is consistent with MassDOT standards.
 We counted pedestrians, bicycles, buses, trucks, and vehicles.
 There's actually separate exhibits in the TIA depicting the pedestrians and bicycle movements that were observed at each intersection.
 And on average, there's between 10 and 20 pedestrians during the peak hours at each location.
 Some locations have a little more.
 I think the intersection of Riverside with Fellsway actually has a few more.
 It's in the 20 to 35.
 pedestrians range during the peak hour.
 But in terms of bicycles, there's not a lot of bicycle usage that showed up in the counts.
 But again, January, although it hasn't been a typical January, we would expect that those bicycle volumes to increase during the more seasonal months.
 So the next slide, we start to get into some of the detail with regard to the transit availability.
 I know in one of the meetings, ZBA members were curious to know the status of the 100 bus, which stops really right in front of the site at Myrtle Street.
 So this slide shows the public transportation availability in the area.
 There's the 100 bus, there's the 108, there's the 101, the 134, but 100 really is the one that stops, that would most likely see the majority of usage from the project residents.
 Wellington Station and Malden Center are each about 1.4 miles, about a 30 minute walk from the site.
 So we think that usage would really focus around the 100 bus to get to Wellington Station or other locations.
 We requested and received data from the MBTA on the ridership.
 They've really improved their ridership survey information and program.
 100Bus has 42 trips per direction on a daily basis between 5 a.m.
 and 1240 a.m., which averages about 1,256 passengers a day.
 And this is based on ridership surveys that were conducted in spring, summer, and fall of 2023 by MBTA.
 At the Myrtle Street stop, on average, 2 to 3 passengers per bus trip were observed to get on the bus.
 And that's
 That ranges between the inbound bus in the morning and the outbound bus in the evening.
 Peak hours for the T are 6.30 to 9.30 in the morning and 3.30 to 6.30 in the afternoon.
 That's when the bus frequency goes up to three buses per hour.
 Other than that, the rest of the day, it's typically one to two buses per hour.
 So these riderships also match our observations.
 We were out there actually this morning and noticed between one and three passengers getting on three buses in the morning, or in the inbound direction, and that was between
 Roughly between 7 and a little before 7 and about quarter of 8.
 In terms of the outbound buses, it was about 1 to 3 passengers that were there.
 Actually, there was no 1 waiting to get on the bus to travel outbound, but there were 1 to 3 passengers on the bus.
 during that same time period.
 And actually, the inbound bus, we observed about eight to 14 passengers on the bus, depending on which of the inbound buses it was.
 So it shows adequate capacity for the additional riders that are expected.
 For the site, given that these buses have a 53 passenger capacity.
 As noted by the by the.
 The next slide, we get into some bicycle facilities.
 And so the slide on the graphic on the left shows, this shows existing facilities.
 It comes from the MassDOT bike trail, ArcGIS data.
 Indicates bike lanes on the Fells Way and Revere Beach Parkway.
 It's kind of hard to see at the scale, but it's the bluish, purplish lines showing where those bike lanes are.
 It also indicates the area of the Wellington circle improvements, which are conceptually shown in the upper graphic.
 There is a preferred alternative that has been identified, which improves pedestrian and bicycle connectivity through the circle.
 I think it's still in the planning stages, so I don't know that there's a timeframe that's been identified yet.
 But that is a project that is in the background.
 Also shown is the Malden River Greenway Wellington connector segment that would connect to the bike facilities on Commercial Street.
 This is the potential rail line or multi-use path that passes behind the site, and I think Bill Lucas from Bowler will touch on that in his description of the site plan.
 But, but again, you know, there's these future conditions.
 These are future conditions and projects that will improve conditions for pedestrians and bicycles, not just for our project, but for for everyone in the area.
 The next slide, we start to get into some of the project specific data, looking at existing and projected future mode split data.
 This data comes from the 2022 American commuter survey.
 It indicates percentages
 shown in the columns.
 And the darker numbers represent the data that's from that survey.
 The lighter numbers, lighter columns, represent what we anticipate the project mode split to be.
 We think that because of the Wellington Connector and the Wellington Circle improvements, we think pedestrian and bicycle usage will increase.
 So we've adjusted the census data to move some of the
 some of the single occupant and the high occupant vehicle, which are basically carpool trips, we moved 5% from those categories into the bike category.
 And we'd like to say that that's a very conservative estimate because of the
 the increasing number of facilities that'll be promoted and provided, as well as the TDM measures for the project, which I'll get into towards the end of my presentation.
 But in general, what we wound up with was a 23% non-automobile travel mode that was expected.
 Well, then we've got 65% automobile travel.
 That's the combination of SOV, you know, somebody in their car driving alone, and HOV is somebody carpooling.
 And then there's 12% that is working from home or commutes using some other form of transportation.
 Those last two categories, the 65% and the 12%, we lump those together to result in 77% auto usage, just to provide a conservative analysis scenario.
 So, you know, it's a little bit of a factor of safety that's built into the mode split and the vehicle trip generations and assumptions, which is what we're going to get into on the next slide.
 So the trip generation information is based on the ITE trip generation manual.
 And this is standard protocol and required by MassDOT and Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR, for a source to estimate trip generation.
 So these are resulting vehicle trips after mode split adjustments for the residential uses only.
 The trips in the column labeled existing storage facility, those are trips that we counted and are presently there, presently existing at the site.
 So in terms of the time periods, we look at the weekday daily, the weekday morning, and the weekday evening peak hour.
 The two peak hour numbers are used for the analysis.
 The daily numbers, that's the total entering and exiting.
 So of the 1,038, that's 519 trips entering and exiting over the course of a 24-hour day.
 In terms of the traffic increase through the neighborhood, on the outside edge of the neighborhood, we're looking at four to 14 trips during the peak hours.
 On the Fellsway, we're looking at 18 to 41 trips with higher numbers if we include both directions.
 In the morning, I think we've got something like 47 trips at the Fellsway and Riverside intersection.
 In the evening at the Fells Way and Central Street intersection with Medford Street, we've got 46.
 So those numbers, they vary depending on the direction.
 You can see there's a higher split with exiting traffic in the morning and entering traffic in the evening.
 And I know that when Bill gets into the site plan, which you've seen already, there's site access to Amaranth and to Myrtle and to Fellsway.
 because of the location of the access there, would be expected to see a larger increase right on the street before it's dispersed.
 But again, in general, we think that the trips are manageable, which I'll get into when we get into the level of service and the analysis results.
 23% of commuters using non-automobile modes of transportation, we expect that to be a low number.
 And we expect to put measures into place to increase the transit percentage as well as the other forms of sustainable transportation.
 So the next slide, we start to get into the traffic analysis.
 And let me just back up.
 We use the existing counts to develop future conditions.
 We look at a seven-year projection.
 And then we add background projects or traffic from background projects that are on the books that are proposed or that are approved and not yet constructed or constructed and not yet occupied.
 And we also include a background growth rate.
 That scenario is called the no build conditions, basically the future condition without the project.
 And then we add the project traffic to that, that gives us the future conditions with the project called the build condition.
 So as I mentioned, we used a 1% growth rate for general background growth.
 We included traffic from 11 background projects, including the expansion of the Encore Casino and the Assembly Row expansions.
 This gives us the no-build condition, which is a base to compare the impacts of the project in the build condition.
 So, we added the trips that you saw in the previous slide into the network to identify the delay increases due to the project.
 And a summary is that in terms of the level of service or LOS, which
 Again, backing up a little bit, assigns letters to delay ranges.
 So for unsignalized intersections, for instance, a level of service A is an average delay per vehicle less than 10 seconds.
 A level of service B is an average delay of between 10 and 15 seconds.
 A level of service C, like what we're talking about here, is an average delay of between 15 and 25 seconds.
 So, you know, we're not talking about huge delays at these locations.
 In fact, the project, when we add the project traffic into the network, what we find is that there's really no change in level of service at 13 of the 14 locations.
 There's level of service C or better at nine intersections.
 The two Fellsway locations, which are on this graphic, locations one at Riverside and
 Location 4 at Central and Medford Street, those are operating at level of service F or greater than an 80 second delay with or without the project.
 We also did a supplemental analysis of the operations at those 2 intersections.
 There's a pedestrian phase that's not to get too deep into the weeds on traffic.
 signal timing but if we if we remove the if we discount the pedestrian phase it gives an idea of what the what the what the impact of the project is and and again the the level of service didn't change with that supplemental analysis that's in the that's in the
 In the TIA, in general, delays are less than 2 seconds as a result of the project.
 So, the next slide, we start to get into transportation demand management.
 And I mentioned previously that we plan to improve on that 23% non-auto transportation component.
 And one way we do that is with the TDM measures.
 So these consist of a number of proven principles and measures to encourage the use of more sustainable transportation instead of personal vehicles.
 Things like a transportation coordinator or a TC would be designated for the project.
 It's probably somebody in the leasing office or the on-site maintenance.
 Somebody that residents can go to, someone that will coordinate with the lower Mystic TMA, for instance, can provide information on transit, biking, walking, what other options are available.
 There'll be support for telecommuting with high-speed internet and other options.
 Secure bicycle parking is proposed, and we're still working through the details on those, but we're looking at also providing space for e-bikes to be charged in the facility.
 We're also looking at EV charging facilities on site.
 Again, these are things that are still
 still being worked through the details on, but this is part of the proposal for the project.
 And coordination with Blue Bikes in order to potentially set up a Blue Bikes kiosk that would be able to be used by not just the residents of the project, but residents of the neighborhood as well.
 And as I meant, I believe I mentioned previously that Bill Lucas will also indicate how the site plan is proposed to have access to the potential Wellington connector.
 So all of these measures are in use, they're proven strategies, they're in use in Medford to some extent, but also in Boston and in Cambridge and Somerville and Everett and Malden, and that's because they work there.
 And some cities, you have to develop a TDM plan.
 And Davis is taking the charge or taking the lead on this to implement this plan.
 So, you know, just to summarize, I think the last slide just shows the conclusions.
 And, you know, this TIA indicates a minimal impact on peak hour traffic delays and vehicle queuing with no change in level of service at 13 or 14 intersections and less than a two-second increase in delay at most locations.
 Uh, the project is improving circulation and.
 I'm really doing a great preview for Bill, but the project is improving circulation in the neighborhood by introducing new on-street parking on Myrtle Street and Amaranth Ave.
 And this improves the accommodation and circulation for two-way traffic flow on both of those streets.
 The project is enhancing operations through the closure of two curb cuts, construction of a multi-modal sidewalk on Amaranth Ave.
 And there's no sidewalk there now, but the project includes the addition of that sidewalk.
 As I mentioned, eliminating curb cuts at the intersection of Myrtle, Amaranth, and Lawrence Street and at the corner of Myrtle Street and the Fellsway.
 And again, promoting alternative modes of transportation.
 It did another way to support the use of bicycles as an inclusion of a bicycle repair shop, as I mentioned, the secure storage and e-bike charging, as well as a tie-in to the Wellington connector.
 So we know that we still have the city and peer review process to work through, but we feel that all of these conclusions and points reinforce the
 the idea that the project can be accommodated as designed.
 With that, that's the end of my presentation.
 I'll turn it over to Bill Lucas from Bowler.
 Thank you.

 នោះហើយជារបៀបដែលខ្ញុំដោះស្រាយវា។
 ផែនការគេហទំព័រនៅចំពោះមុខយើងគឺខុសគ្នាបន្តិចពីអ្វីដែលបានបង្ហាញនៅសវនាការមុន។
 ដើម្បីបញ្ជាក់ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ពិនិត្យឡើងវិញនូវចំណុចទាំងនេះមួយចំនួន។

 ជាពិសេសនៅ Amaranth យើងបានពង្រីកផ្លូវដើម្បីសម្រួលចរាចរណ៍។

 لذلك قمنا بتقييم الطلب على قسم TIA، واستنادًا إلى بيانات ITE، كما هو الحال بالنسبة لمجلة السفر، قمنا بإجراء الحسابات.
 قم بمراجعة متطلبات مواقف السيارات للعقارات المشابهة لتلك المقترحة و/أو الموجودة هنا فيما يتعلق بمتطلبات أيام الأسبوع وعطلة نهاية الأسبوع للمستودعات والمشاريع السكنية المقترحة.
 تنطبق متطلبات متوسط ​​تكلفة مواقف السيارات على وحدة معينة أو عدد من الوحدات أو الكثير من استخدامات الأراضي المطبقة.
 وهذا يمنحنا متوسط ​​276 مكانًا لوقوف السيارات يوميًا، مع 252 مكانًا عاملاً.
 وقوف السيارات في عطلة نهاية الأسبوع، لذلك تفهم، من ناحية، هناك موقف سيارات احتياطي أكبر.

 أعتقد أنه عندما نفعل هذا أريد أن أفهم بشكل أفضل
 ما هو هامش وقوف السيارات المعقول مقارنة بالطلب على مواقف السيارات؟
 أفهم من هذه الشريحة أن القانون يتطلب 361 منصبًا شاغرًا.
 وتم تخفيض عدد المتقدمين بمقدار 30 طلباً استجابةً لطلب تقديم العروض.
 طلب وقوف السيارات
 أعتقد 276 ليوم عمل كامل.
 إذن ما هو؟
 ما يقرب من 55 وظيفة إضافية متاحة.
 من بين تلك المساحات الـ 55، أعتقد أن هناك 11 مساحة تخزين إضافية.
 لذلك هناك حوالي 44 منهم
 سعة المخزن المؤقت، هل هذا الرقم صحيح؟
 هل يجب أن يكون رقمًا أصغر أم أكبر؟
 ليس لدي فكرة جيدة عما هو طبيعي هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3007.257s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، يمكنني التعامل مع هذا أو أن أطلب من سكوت تقييم العوامل الفنية.
 بات غالاغر ومتجر جولستون.
 لذلك أعتقد أننا نحاول تحقيق التوازن بين حقيقة أن لدينا متطلبات رمز المنطقة.
 أريد التأكيد على أن الرقم 361 هو ما يحتاجه هذا المشروع.
 ولذلك، فإن هذا لا يشمل مقدار المساحة المطلوبة لمساحة التخزين المتبقية.
 لذلك نحن نحاول تحقيق التوازن بين ما هو مطلوب على أساس تقسيم المناطق.
 حسنًا، ما نعرضه هنا لا يزال يتطلب التخلي عن ركن السيارة.
 للتصميم المشترك وتنسيق مواقف السيارات.
 أوه، بين المشروع والمستودع المجاور.
 نعم، ولكن هناك توازن بين هذه الأسئلة وهذه المشاكل.
 الناس الذين يعيشون في مكان قريب.
 تمتد منطقة وقوف السيارات المكتظة إلى المجتمع نفسه.
 أعتقد أننا نحاول إيجاد توازن هنا وأن نكون أكثر حذراً.
 وهذا شيء ذكره المدير هانتر أيضًا خلال محادثتنا بالأمس: إنه مجرد الفرق بين أعلى تقديرات الطلب التي نعرضها والاحتياجات التي ندرجها.
 ولكن أعتقد أن هذه هي النقطة.
 كما تعلمون، هذه تقديرات وعلينا أن نأخذها بعين الاعتبار.
 وقد يكون هذا الرقم أعلى من هذا الرقم لأسباب مختلفة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3104.82s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، شكرا لك، جوردون. هل هناك أي شيء آخر تود إضافته؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3110.571s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: لا، أعتقد أن بات عرض الأمر بشكل جيد للغاية.
 ونحن نرى أن الطلب على العديد من هذه الوحدات قد انخفض.
 إنهم يسافرون عبر الإنترنت، وهناك عدد أقل من مواقف السيارات، ويمكن لأولئك الذين يأتون إلى الموقع أن يأتوا من مكان آخر ولا يأخذوا سيارة معهم.
 ونتيجة لذلك، ينخفض ​​الطلب على السفر الشخصي، وبالتالي ينخفض ​​عدد أماكن وقوف السيارات.
 لكنني أوافق على أن الهدف هنا هو إيجاد التوازن بينكما.
 أنتم تعلمون ما يقوله هذا المرسوم وما سيكون العرض حسب الاحتياجات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3162.476s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 وللتوضيح، هل تشمل هذه الأرقام مواقف السيارات الـ 12 الموجودة أمام المبنى؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3174.226s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: مُطْلَقاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3175.247s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: مثالي.
 في بعض الحالات، تم طرح هذه الاستبيانات في العرض التقديمي، وفي إحدى الحالات لم يتم ذكرها على وجه التحديد ولكن تم أخذها من القراءة الكاملة لـ TIA.
 حسنًا، أريد فقط التأكد من أنني أفهم وسائل النقل العام.
 حسنًا، بقدر ما أفهم، لدى MBTA بيانات حول السفر في ساعة الذروة.
 أعتقد أن العودة في الصباح هو السيناريو الأسوأ.
 القدرة حوالي 29%.
 وماذا؟
 هل أبدأ من هذه المحطة أم أنتهي عند الأخيرة؟
 هل سيتم ملؤها لاحقًا أم تصل إلى 29٪؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3234.424s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: حسنًا، يجب أن أعود إليك بشأن هذا الأمر.
 أعتقد أن الحد الأقصى للاستهلاك اليومي هو 1256.
 مستوى الطاقة هو 5088 وهو 25% من الطاقة القابلة للاستخدام.
 لكن سأتصل بك على هذا الرقم المحدد.
 أعتقد ذلك، ولكنني سأعود إليك في هذا الشأن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3276.771s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 مايك ، أنا آسف لطرح هذا السؤال وهل يمكنك التوضيح.
 نعم، من الجيد معرفة ما إذا كانت هناك طريقة.
 هل هذه هي ساعة الذروة في اليوم؟
 إذا كانت الحافلة تعمل طوال اليوم، أعتقد، كما تعلمون، في وقت متأخر من الليل أنها تكون فارغة تقريبًا، لكني أريد أن أعرف ما الذي يوجد عليها خلال ساعة الذروة، كما تعلمون، هل هي ممتلئة خلال ساعة الذروة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3302.921s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 أندري، هذا ما أعنيه.
 لذلك، يظهر التقرير وقت الذروة.
 أعتقد أنه عندما تأتي في الصباح، فإن ساعة الذروة لا تزال تبلغ 29٪.
 لكن زيادة عدد هذه الحافلات الثلاث لا يعني أن بعض الحافلات أكثر ازدحاما من غيرها.
 في الليل في طريقي إلى المنزل أعتقد أن ما يصل إلى 25٪.
 لذلك أريد أن أعرف الإجابة، وخاصة في طريق العودة.
 لذا، إذا كان لدينا سكان محليون يستخدمون وسائل النقل العام وكانت الحافلة ممتلئة عند البداية، حتى لو كانت فارغة قبل التوقف، أريد فقط التأكد من عدم وجود مشاكل هناك.
 ماذا تحاول أن تقول يا سكوت؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3351.636s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم بالطبع
 النزول في هذه المحطة.
 ومن هنا عدد الركاب.
 كما تعلمون، هناك الكثير من المقاعد.
 هناك مقاعد كافية في الحافلة للوصول إلى هذا المكان.
 مرة واحدة هنا، يمكن استعادتها.
 لدينا هذه المعلومات.
 يمكننا إنشاء نوع من الجدول الزمني لكل محطة ركاب.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3381.533s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 بشكل عام، تعجبني البيانات، ولكن أعتقد أنه يمكنك محاولة جعلها واقعية قدر الإمكان عند إدخالها.
 ربما يكون الخط المتوسط ​​29%.
 عندما يعيش الناس في المنطقة، سواء كانوا يعيشون في المنطقة أو الأشخاص الذين يعيشون في المنازل المجاورة، يجب أن يكونوا قادرين على المضي قدمًا.
 أعتقد أن مجلس الإدارة يريد معرفة ما إذا كنا سنعود.
 لذا، إذا ذهبت إلى ولنجتون، فمن المحتمل أن تعود من ولنجتون لاحقًا.
 إذا كانت هناك أي مشاكل في السعة، إذا خمنت عدد الركاب، فقد لا يكون الأمر كذلك، ولكن من المفيد جدًا معرفة ذلك بالتأكيد.
 مرحبًا!
 وحتى الآن، أعتقد أنني أفهم جميع البيانات التفصيلية الواردة هنا.
 وتشير التقديرات إلى أن 13% من الرحلات تتم بواسطة وسائل النقل العام.
 ألقي نظرة على الأرقام وأرى أن هناك 12 أو 13 شخصًا في الأعلى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3454.077s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم فعلا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3456.298s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3457.627s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: مثالي.
 إذا مرت ثلاث حافلات، فكما تعلم، ثلاثة أو أربعة أشخاص.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3463.23s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا
 لذا نعم.
 السيناريو الأسوأ هو أن يصعد الجميع إلى الحافلة إذا كانت ممتلئة، لكن هذا أمر لا يصدق.
 نعم، ركوب ثلاث حافلات سيكون أمرًا ممتعًا.
 يبدو ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3474.196s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 أعني، أعتقد أن الوضع لا يزال هادئًا في شارع ميرتل.
 لذلك، حوالي 2/3 من الطريق إلى هناك.
 إذن أنت تعلم
 من الواضح أن الكثافة السكانية تزداد كلما اقتربت من ويلينغتون.
 لذلك قد يكون هناك المزيد من الركاب يصعدون وينزلون.
 لكن مرة أخرى، في الوقت الحالي أفهم سؤالك، ولكن في الوقت الحالي يبدو أن هناك الكثير من المقاعد في الحافلة، سواء في الداخل أو الخارج.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3513.648s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: جيد جدا، شكرا لك.
 ثم سلسلة أخرى من الأسئلة فقط للتأكيد.
 ثم رأيت في التقرير عدة حالات مزعجة عندما تعطل العداد.
 ثم هناك تقاطعان، لذلك سيتم استخدام البيانات القديمة.
 أعتقد أن سنترال وبينكرتون وسنترال وكينموير.
 هذا صحيح.
 وبشكل أقرب، هل هناك اختلافات كبيرة بين عام 2020 والإحصائيات الحالية، أم تعتقد أن هذا تقدير معقول للأرقام الحالية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3550.355s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، أعني أننا فعلنا ذلك بشكل مختلف قليلاً، لكننا استفدنا من وجودنا على جانبي التقاطع وقمنا بموازنة تدفق حركة المرور.
 وبعد ذلك قمنا بتعديل الدخول والخروج على هذين المسارين بناءً على البيانات المتوفرة لدينا، وأعتقد أنه كان في عام 2019 أو 2020.
 إذن، كما تعلمون، تحدث هذه الأشياء.
 أعني، كما تعلمون، إنه أمر مؤسف، لكنني واثق جدًا من كيفية التحكم في مستوى الصوت لحل هذه المشكلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3593.313s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 شكرا لك
 هذه هي أسئلتي.
 هل لدينا أي أعضاء آخرين في مجلس الإدارة يرغبون في طرح الأسئلة أو الإدلاء بالتعليقات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3608.523s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: لدينا تفسير آخر: في النهاية تصف الخطة.
 هل يمكنك أن تفعل هذا مرة أخرى بالنسبة لي؟
 الآن يقول المخطط إن أفضل خطة هي تعيين شخص مسؤول عن إدارة التسليم وإعداد تلك القائمة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3628.466s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، أعني، أعتقد أن هذا هو هيكل الخطة.
 آمل أن تضيف المدينة وربما المقيم إليها أو تغيرها، لكن هذه هي الخطة في الوقت الحالي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3647.002s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.</p>

 Alison D'Agostino ។
 ខ្ញុំតំណាងឱ្យ Fundo D'Agostino ។
 យើងជាម្ចាស់នៃ 1022-1024 Fellsway ។
 អរគុណច្រើនសម្រាប់ពេលវេលារបស់អ្នក។
 សូមអរគុណចំពោះការណែនាំរបស់អ្នក។
 គ្រាន់តែជារឿងរហ័ស។
 តាមអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំយល់ ចំណាត់ថ្នាក់ចរាចរណ៍ហាក់ដូចជាគ្រាន់តែជាចរាចរណ៍ដែលត្រូវបានកត់ត្រាទុកសម្រាប់មួយថ្ងៃប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ប្រហែលជានេះជាបទដ្ឋាន។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​បញ្ជាក់​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ថ្ងៃ​ព្រហស្បតិ៍​មុន​ថ្ងៃ​ឈប់​សម្រាក​ចុង​សប្តាហ៍។
 ដូច្នេះ វា​ប្រហែល​ជា​មិន​មែន​ជា​កំណត់ត្រា​ល្អ​បំផុត​នោះ​ទេ។
 ចរាចរណ៍ធម្មតា។
 មានមតិមួយទៀតអំពីម៉ោងប្រញាប់ដែលខ្ញុំមិនយល់ស្របទាំងស្រុង។
 ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ឃើញ​ការ​វិវត្តន៍​មួយ ខ្ញុំ​មាន​អាយុ ១២​ឆ្នាំ ហើយ​ម្តាយ​ខ្ញុំ​មាន​អាយុ​ជាង ៥០​ឆ្នាំ រស់​នៅ​ផ្ទះ​តែ​មួយ។
 បន្ទាប់មកយើងទៅ Fellsway ហើយទេសភាពក៏ស្អាត។
 អ្វី​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​និយាយ​គឺ​ថា​ពេល​រសៀល​ម៉ោង​ភ្ញៀវ​ទេសចរ​នឹង​មាន​មុន​នេះ​ដោយសារ​ស្ថានភាព​ជំងឺ​រាតត្បាត​កំពុង​វិវត្ត។
 ហើយពេលវេលាចាប់ផ្តើមគឺលឿនជាងការបញ្ជាក់។
 ដូច្នេះ ចូរ​យើង​យក​អ្វី​មួយ​ចេញ។
 កំណត់សម្គាល់បើក៖ ខ្ញុំគិតថាខ្ញុំធ្វើការជាមួយទិន្នន័យសម្រាប់ការរស់នៅ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំដឹងថាទិន្នន័យអាចតំណាងឱ្យអ្វីដែលអ្នកចង់ឱ្យវាតំណាង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ហាក់​ដូចជា​មិន​សម​ហេតុផល​ក្នុង​ការ​បង្កើន​ចំនួន​រថយន្ត​ពី 4 ទៅ 14 ក្នុង​ម៉ោង​ប្រញាប់ប្រញាល់​ពេល​ព្រឹក បន្ទាប់​មក​ដល់ 289 ។
 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតខ្ញុំគោរពពាក្យល្អ
 កម្រិតនៃព័ត៌មានលម្អិតអំពីប្រភពដើមនៃសំណងថ្លៃចតរថយន្តជាមធ្យមហាក់ដូចជាអ្វីដែលអ្នកចង់បានពីការប្រជុំដូចនេះ។
 ប្រហែលជាវាកើតឡើងនៅពីក្រោយឆាក ខ្ញុំកំពុងសំដៅជាពិសេសទៅលើស្លាយការវិភាគតម្រូវការចំណត។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកគាំទ្រទិន្នន័យប្រភពដែលតំណាងឱ្យចំនួនយានជំនិះនៅលើផ្លូវ អ្នកត្រូវយល់ពីទិន្នន័យប្រភព។
 ឡើងចុះ។
 មតិចុងក្រោយរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺការកើនឡើងនៃទំហំផ្លូវ។
 ខ្ញុំកោតសរសើរ Amarys ។
 ខ្ញុំប្រាកដថាមនុស្សទាំងនេះក៏ធ្វើដែរ។
 ប្រសិនបើផ្លូវ Myrtle មិនទាន់ធំឡើងទេឥឡូវនេះ ខ្ញុំណែនាំអ្នកឱ្យទៅកន្លែងនេះ។
 បើ​មិន​ធ្វើ​បែប​នេះ អ្នក​នឹង​មិន​អាច​ឆ្លង​កាត់​ឡាន​ពីរ​បាន​ទេ។
 ឡើងចុះតាមផ្លូវ Myrtle គ្មាននរណាម្នាក់ឈប់ គ្មាននរណាម្នាក់អនុញ្ញាតឱ្យនរណាម្នាក់ទៅ។
 ដូច្នេះ អ្នកដឹងទេ ការព្រួយបារម្ភរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺច្បាស់ណាស់ថា នេះត្រូវបានគេមើលរំលង។
 ហើយ Myrtle គឺតែងតែម្ខាង ហើយ Lawrence ក៏ដូចគ្នាដែរ។

 សម្រាប់​ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​មិន​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​និយាយ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​ចង់​និយាយ​យ៉ាង​រហ័ស​ដែរ​ថា​៖ ក្រុមហ៊ុន Davis ស្តាប់​អ្នក​បាន​សាង​សំណាង​ដ៏​អស្ចារ្យ។
 ទន្លេគឺស្រស់ស្អាត។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថានៅក្នុងការត្រួតពិនិត្យចរាចរណ៍ពួកគេបានលើកឡើងពី Encore និង Assembly ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងទាំងអស់គ្នាអាចយល់ស្របលើភាពខុសគ្នានៅទីនោះ។
 វាមិននៅជិតទ្រព្យសម្បត្តិទាំងនេះទេ។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3938.629s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 أريد فقط التأكد من وجود فهم مشترك لبعض هذه النقاط.
 ثم وصلت ساعة الذروة.
 بقدر ما أفهم، يتم قياس هذا كميا.
 هذا صحيح؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3956.89s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم هذا صحيح.
 لذلك عندما يتعلق الأمر بمواصلة هذا السؤال، كما تعلمون، نحن، نعتقد، أننا نجد أوقات الذروة هذه عندما يحدث، إذا كان، إذا كان من 7 إلى 8، إذا كان 7، 15 إلى 8، 15، إذا كنت تعلم، من 8 إلى 8 إلى 9، مهما كان وقت الذروة، فهذا ما نستخدمه في التحليل.
 وإليك ما تظهره البيانات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3986.686s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، أود أن أقول هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3988.323s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، يرجى الاستمرار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3990.745s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: هل يمكنني أن أطلب من بيل لوكاس توضيح تلك النقطة الأخيرة بشأن ميت ستريت والتحدث عن اقتراحنا؟</p>

 شكرًا لك على أسئلتك وتعليقاتك حول العرض التقديمي.
 وكما تعلمون، أعتذر عن عدم الرد على التعليقات المحددة في شارع ميرتل.
 ثم مرة أخرى، ربما أنا أيضًا.
 هدفنا هو توسيع طريق ميرتل.
 إنه رصيف بعرض 26 قدمًا، وهو ضيق جدًا لأنني مشيت هناك وعرفت الظروف هناك.
 ولكن في إطار ذلك، كل ما يتعين علينا القيام به هو محاولة التأكد من حدوث ذلك.
 سنقوم بتسوية الرصيف الحالي أمام موقعنا لتوفير مساحة إضافية لوقوف السيارات الموازية على طريق ميرتل، وكجزء من هذا سنقوم بتحسين حالة الرصيف والتبرع فعليًا ببعض الأراضي للمدينة.
 مناسبة لكل من الأرصفة ومواقف السيارات في الشوارع.
 ومن خلال القيام بذلك، سيوفر ديفيس بعض الأراضي لتوسيع طريق ميرتل وتوفير التحسينات المرورية التي تشتد الحاجة إليها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4081.991s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 هناك عامل آخر.
 وقد سبق ذكر هذا.
 أولاً، يتم إجراء تقييمات إضافية لتأثير حركة المرور وتكون متاحة للجمهور.
 إنه موجود بالفعل في المجلد أو يظهر مباشرة بعد الاجتماع.
 من خلال قراءة الجدول 6 في هذا التقرير، أفهم أن ساعات الذروة تكون خلال صباح أيام الأسبوع.
 وفي المجمل، وصلت 90 سيارة جديدة إلى المحطة، و21 سيارة وصلت إلى المحطة، و69 سيارة غادرت. وقد وصلت إلى المحطة بعد ظهر اليوم 89 مركبة، منها 55 مركبة دخلت المحطة و34 مركبة غادرت المحطة.
 أي أنه بدلاً من 14 سيكون هناك 90 و89.
 حسنًا، تسجيل الدخول والخروج من الموقع، نعم.
 حسنا
 رائع.
 أعتقد أن هذا يحل المشكلة.
 لذا، إذا كان أفراد آخرون من الجمهور يرغبون في التحدث عن هذا الأمر، فيرجى القيام بذلك.
 حسنًا، لنبدأ.
 أراك.

 لذا، أردت أن أضيف ملاحظة سريعة إلى تعليقات أليسون بخصوص المسح المروري الذي تم إجراؤه قبل عطلة نهاية الأسبوع الطويلة يوم الخميس.
 هذا الاثنين كان لدينا أيضًا عاصفة ثلجية.
 تساقط الثلوج، وإغلاق المدارس، والقيود على مواقف السيارات.
 ثم قضينا عطلة نهاية أسبوع طويلة وخلال أسبوع دراسة المرور تعرضنا لعاصفة ثلجية.
 لذلك لدي بعض الأسئلة.
 لذا فقد كنت محظوظًا اليوم بما يكفي لقراءة هذه الوثيقة المكونة من 62 صفحة بالكامل من البداية إلى النهاية.
 لدي بعض التعليقات التي يمكن أن تكون ذات صلة مباشرة بهذه السلسلة.
 لكن سؤالي الأول هو بعد جمع البيانات.
 كيف تقوم بالتحليل؟
 هل تستخدم البرنامج الإحصائي Minitab؟
 هل تستخدم نموذج محاكاة؟
 ومن أين جاءت البيانات للحصول على هذه النتيجة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4231.123s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: آسف، أريد المقاطعة، أريد التأكد من أننا لن نتعثر في المحادثة.

 لكني أريد فقط تجنب المحادثة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4253.085s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 سوف أنظر إليهم جميعا.
 هذا هو رقم واحد.
 ثانيًا، رأيت في عرض PowerPoint التقديمي الخاص بك اليوم وفي مستند Word الكامل أنه سيكون هناك مزاد جديد لوقوف السيارات في الشارع ومزاد لوقوف السيارات في الشارع.
 هل هناك خريطة لا أستطيع رؤيتها أو كيف تبدو؟
 لذلك إذا كان هناك أي
 الخطة الجديدة لإضافة مواقف للسيارات في الشارع موجودة هنا في مكان ما، من فضلك أخبرني بمكانها حتى أتمكن من رؤيتها.
 إذن سؤالي الأخير هو أنك ذكرت في الخاتمة والملخص، خاصة في الصفحة السابعة إذا كنت تتساءل عما أبحث عنه لأنه تم التخلص من الاستخدام الصناعي، وهناك مساحة أقل، وحركة مرور أكثر، والمزيد من المركبات والشاحنات الأثقل.
 لا أرى ذلك في أي مكان في نص التقرير الذي تقوم بتحليله.
 بالطبع، ستتخلص الآن بالتأكيد من أعمال تشرشل الفنية وأثاثه المنقول حتى لا تكون موجودة بعد الآن.
 ومع ذلك، عندما تضيف 300 إلى 300 شقة تقريبًا إلى عقار ما ولدي باب أمامي للشاحنة، أجد صعوبة في الاعتقاد بأنه سيكون هناك عدد أقل من الشاحنات.
 وفي منطقة شارع ميرتل في أمارانتي، فإن إضافة مدخل شاحنة في شارع ميرتل من شأنه أن يلغي شركتين تجاريتين.
 يجب أن أعلم أنه سيتعين علي التفكير، إن لم يكن أكثر، فعلى الأقل أكثر.
 ولا أفهم ما إذا كان هذا التحليل قد تم إجراؤه لمزيد من التأكيد.
 هذا هو والدي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4366.302s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: جيد جدا، عظيم.
 لقد قدمت ملاحظة.
 أريد التأكد من أننا لا نفوت أي شيء.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 لذلك أعتقد أنه يمكنني التحدث عن السؤال الثاني.
 أعتقد أن ما نراه الآن هو وقوف السيارات في الشوارع.
 لذلك أعلم أن جذب هذا الشيء المادي ليس بالأمر السهل.
 ولكن إذا نظرت إلى الياسمين والياسمين
 ومن خلال وضع هذه المساحات الخضراء، فإنها في الواقع تفصل بعض مواقف السيارات عن الشوارع الموجودة في العقار وتساعد في تحرير المساحة.
 لا يبدو أنني أتذكر الانقسام بين أمارانث وميرتل، لكنه موجود في الصورة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4407.723s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: نعم سيدي الرئيس.
 انظر إلى هذا الطريق للحظة.
 كما تعلمون، أنا أفكر مرة أخرى
 تقليل الأرصفة وإنشاء مساحات جديدة على طول الطريق.
 أعتقد أن هذا التزام خاص لهذا الفريق ولم أختبر هذا من قبل في مشروع مثل هذا.
 أعتقد أنه من المهم معرفة أن هذا يعد حقًا تنازلًا تقدمه المجموعة للمجتمع.
 يوجد ارتفاق لوقوف السيارات.
 والنتيجة بالنسبة لميرتل هي أن بيل لوكاس لديه الكثير ليقوله عنها اليوم، ولكن بنفس القدر تقريبًا.
 يفعلون ذلك لأنه يسد الرصيف الواسع عند الزاوية.
 تمت إضافة موقف سيارات جديد لاحقًا في شارع أمارانث البائد الآن.
 ومن المقرر أن يصبح موقف سيارات عام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4480.586s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: حسنًا، بالنسبة لسكان شارع ميرتل في أمارانث، هذا ليس ضمانًا.
 حسنًا، شكرًا على التفسير.
 ونتيجة لذلك، لن نوفر بعد الآن أماكن لوقوف السيارات لسكان ميرتل.
 إنه ببساطة يضيف مواقف جديدة للسيارات.
 أفهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4495.718s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا
 نعم.
 أدرك أن استخدام هذا المبنى سيخضع لقانون ميدفورد.
 وهذا صعب لأنه مملوك للقطاع الخاص.
 لذلك لن أتظاهر بمعرفة التفاصيل.
 لكنني الآن أفهم أن هذه الأماكن مخصصة لكل من يُسمح له بالوقوف على هذه الطرق.
 محامي غالاغر، أليس كذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4525.355s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: هذا صحيح
 مرة أخرى، أتمنى أن يكون هذا موقف سيارات عام.
 يمكن أن يكونوا من سكان المنطقة أو ضيوف المشروع.
 هذه هي النية الحقيقية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4539.667s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 الآن، السؤالان الآخران، أعتقد أنهما يخصان سكوت.
 ثم تطرح أسئلة حول برنامج الإحصاء أو البرنامج المستخدم لإنشاء هذه التقارير.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4552.693s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، تتم معالجة بيانات العد ومتوازنة.
 كما قلت، نحن ننظر إلى ساعات الذروة وساعات الذروة ونحلل حركة المرور على وجه الخصوص.
 وهو نموذج تحليلي عشوائي يستخدم في الصناعة.
 وهذه حزمة قياسية، إحدى الحزم المطلوبة من قبل تفتيش الدولة.
 استخدامه على نطاق واسع بين مستشاري الصناعة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4601.04s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 السؤال الأخير يتعلق بعدد الشاحنات والشاحنات الصغيرة.
 لذلك حاولت العثور على الكلمات الرئيسية في الملف بنفسي.
 ولا أعلم في الملحق أي شيء يناقش هذه القضية غير البيان الختامي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4621.971s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، لا، أعتقد أنه كان بمثابة ارتداد للحدث الذي رأيناه هناك عندما رأينا الشاحنة متوقفة.
 أعتقد أن سيارات أمازون، وسيارات UPS، وهذه الناقلات موجودة في كل مكان الآن.
 أعتقد أن طريقة التسليم تعتمد على المنطقة المحددة وهي ممكنة تمامًا.
 ربما كانوا هناك بالفعل.
 قد يكون هناك عدد كبير من المركبات الموجودة على الطرق المحلية المحيطة بالموقع مباشرة.
 نعتقد أنه بمجرد اكتمال التطوير، سيذهبون إلى هذا الموقع بدلاً من تصفحه كما يفعل البعض منهم.
 لكنني لا أعرف ما إذا كانت تكمل بالفعل العقارات الموجودة القريبة.
 ومع ذلك، أعتقد أنه بمجرد إلغاء بعض التطبيقات الصناعية الحالية، لن تتمكن هذه الآلات الكبيرة من الوصول إلى هذه المنشأة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4713.671s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: حسنًا، هل فكرت يومًا في الإشارة إلى لغتك؟
 الشاحنات والشاحنات بخلاف الشاحنات.
 لأنني عندما رأيت السيارة طلبت منه النزول من الشاحنة.
 ولهذا السبب أعتقد أنني سأوضح هذه المقالة لتجنب المزيد من الالتباس.
 ولكنك ناقشت أيضًا مع UPS وFedEx وDHL تقديرًا للتكاليف المحتملة.
 نموك سيكون.
 لذلك، إذا كنت تتحدث عن سلاسل التوريد وكيفية تحديد المسارات، فإنها تفعل ذلك محليًا بناءً على النموذج والكمية التي يتم تسليمها إلى منطقة معينة في وقت معين.
 لذلك، إذا كان لديك حوالي 300 سيارة، فيمكن أن يمتلك 300 شخص تقريبًا أكثر من سيارة واحدة.
 بخصوص UPS، أعلم جيدًا أنهم ينقلون أكثر من طرد في اليوم.
 إذًا، هل سبق لك أن درست مبادئ أبحاث التدفق المتعلقة بالتدفق؟
 مناسبة للشاحنات التي تحتاج إلى نقل كمية كبيرة من البضائع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4772.401s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نحن لا نناقش أي مبادئ لأبحاث أداء السيارة.
 وهذا يتجاوز قليلاً أبحاث حركة المرور القياسية.
 لكن وجهة نظري هي أنه إذا قالت المدينة وزملاؤها الاستشاريون أننا بحاجة إلى رؤية ذلك، فيمكننا القيام بذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4800.84s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، أعتزم في هذه المرحلة أن يكون لدى مجلس الإدارة مستشار نظير يمكنه القيام بذلك.
 فكر في الأمر وراجع هذه التقارير.
 وبالتالي، ينوي المجلس أن يأخذ في الاعتبار التعليقات والاقتراحات المقدمة من الجمهور، بالإضافة إلى مشورة الخبراء من الاستشاريين الذين يراجعهم النظراء.
 لذا، أنا أقدم اقتراحا وليس بيانا، ولكن بشكل عام أؤمن بمبدأ أن التقرير النهائي لا ينبغي أن يتضمن تصريحات لا يؤيدها البعض.
 هناك جدول أو بيانات.
 لذا أعتقد أنه ربما يشرح الاستنتاج سبب تفكيرنا بهذه الطريقة، أو ربما لن يتم ذكر هذه النقطة على وجه التحديد.
 ولكن فيما يتعلق بالقدرة على إجراء المزيد من التحليل، أعتقد أن مجلس الإدارة ينوي انتظار تعليقات النظراء واتخاذ القرار الآن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4866.412s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: يفهم.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4867.273s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 لذلك لدينا طعام لشعب ريتشموند. أدخل اسمك وعنوانك للتسجيل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5123.054s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 نعم.
 لذلك أعتقد أن التقرير التفصيلي يحتوي على بعض التوقعات بالنسبة للقسم نفسه.
 حسنًا، سأطلب من سكوت أن يفحصها من أجلي، لكنني أعتقد أنها التاسعة، العاشرة والحادية عشرة، نعم، أعتقد أنها التاسعة، الحادية عشرة، الحادية عشرة.
 هذا صحيح.
 بالضبط.
 هذا صحيح.
 وبعد ذلك هم
 إذا فهمت بشكل صحيح، فأعتقد أن Zhou يقع على محرك الأقراص C الخاص بالموقع، وتقدر سعته بحوالي 5% أو 10% من السعة الإجمالية.
 إذن، 5% إلى اليسار و5% إلى اليمين.
 يبقى ثم يتم استيراده.
 5% أيضاً.
 هل أنا على حق؟
 هل قرأت هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5190.935s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، نعم، هذا صحيح.
 أعني أنه من المتوقع أن تستخدم معظم الرحلات مدخل فيلسواي، وسيستخدم جزء صغير من فيلسواي أمارانث، ونقطة ميرتل تستحق ذلك بالتأكيد.
 تقدم المشروع، ولكن نعم، إنه يعمل.
 يبدو أنه حدث في يوم واحد.
 50 رحلة أخرى، 50 رحلة أخرى.
 لقد مرت أكثر من 24 ساعة منذ أن غادرت.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5238.729s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5240.25s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: أوه، لدينا المزيد من الأعضاء؟
 آسف، هل يمكنني أن أفعل هذا؟
 طلب توضيح حول هذا الافتراض.
 نعم، أعتقد ذلك.
 أعتقد أننا نفترض أن 10٪ من السفر يحدث بسبب هذا.
 أعتقد أنه، نعم، مثير للاهتمام.
 هل غادرت خلال رحلتك؟
 حسنا، لست متأكدا.
 لماذا 10%؟
 لماذا يجب أن تكون 10٪؟
 أعني إذا كان المدخل الرئيسي.
 أعتقد أن 60-70% من الناس سيغادرون.
 بالنسبة للسائقين، الطريقة الأسهل والأكثر ملاءمة للوصول إلى المبنى هي عبور طريق ميرتل والتوجه نحو المخرج.
 ليس سانت فيل.
 تخرج إلى الشارع المقابل لطريق Fells المحلي.
 أعني أنني سأدخل المبنى إذا أتيت من الغرب.
 وعندما لم يأت، دخل إلى المبنى أمام منزلي.
 أنا لا أذهب، ولا أذهب إلى الجزء الخلفي من المبنى ولا أذهب إلى فيلسواي في ذلك الاتجاه.
 أعني أن نسبة 10% تبدو غير معقولة للغاية.
 على الأقل 33% من الوقت، وأعتقد أنه أكثر من ذلك، فلماذا تقود السيارة إلى الجزء الخلفي من المبنى بينما يمكنك القيادة إلى الأمام؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5329.225s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: لذلك إذا فهمت بشكل صحيح
 لديك أشخاص في فيلسواي شمالًا لأنهم لا يستطيعون الوصول إلى مدخل فيلسواي وقلت نعم، هل تعتقد أنهم سيستخدمون شارع ميرتل بشكل صحيح؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5352.307s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: نعم، أود أن أقول إن الطريق الذي يستخدمه الناس الآن للدخول إلى المنطقة يشهد حركة مرور كثيفة من الغرب.
 في الأسفل، أعتقد أنه كان شارع لورانس، أو أنهم عبروا هذا الطريق.
 إذا كان أي شخص
 شمال المدينة وهم في طريقهم إلى.
 وهذا أيضًا المدخل الغربي.
 وإذا عادوا إلى ديارهم، فهم من الغرب.
 على الطريق السريع 93 لأنه من الأسهل التجول فيه.
 للتعامل مع حركة المرور القادمة على طريق Fells.
 أتخيل أنك إذا كنت في عجلة من أمرك، فسوف ترى العديد من السيارات تتجه صعودًا وهبوطًا في هذه الممرات، وتهرب من فيلسواي لأنك ستكون عالقًا في المنعطف أو المنعطف.
 من الأسهل السير من الشمال إلى الجنوب أو الغرب بدلاً من السير على طول Fellsway في أي من الاتجاهين.
 أفهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5426.144s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك
 نعم.
 سكوت، سأكون ممتنًا حقًا إذا تمكنت من توضيح كيفية تحديد الأسعار.
 ثم نظرت إلى ملاحظاتي مرة أخرى ونسيت أن أسأل هل هذه الرحلة تشمل جيل السيارة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5445.82s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 ولذلك فمن المهم أن نتذكر
 عند مدخل الجراج يوجد مدخل قطيفة ثم مدخل آخر.
 نعم، يمكنك أن ترى بوضوح مكان بات.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، نتوقع أن تأتي حركة المرور وتذهب.
 نعتقد أنه في الغرب والغرب، من المرجح أن تستخدم حركة المرور نقطة دخول أمارانتو أكثر من نقطة دخول ميرتل لأن
 كما تعلم، أنت، وليس السكان المحليين، من تحتاج إلى معرفة زيارة ميرتل.
 هذه منطقة سياحية.
 لإجراء هذه التسليمات.
 إنها حقًا مسافة قصيرة سيرًا على الأقدام من ميرتل حول الدائرة الداخلية، عبر صف المقاعد ثم إلى المدخل.
 إذا كنت من الغرب، فأعتقد أنك ستختار على الأرجح نقطة أمارانث الساخنة.
 وبالتالي، يمكن لحركة المرور على Fellsway استخدام نقطة وصول Fellsway هذه.
 بقية حركة المشروع تذهب هنا
 تعال
 أما بالنسبة لسؤال آخر من تشو، أعتقد أن ركوب الدراجات جزء صغير من الرحلة.
 مرة أخرى، في الغالب إذا نظرت إلى البيانات المتاحة.
 السفر والمشي والعمل من المنزل والاستخدامات البشرية الأخرى تمثل تقريبًا.
 إذا لم تأخذ أبعاد العجلات بعين الاعتبار، فيبدو أن هذا يمثل حوالي 30% من الطلب.
 ولذلك نفترض أن 77% من الرحلات تتم بالسيارة.
 لذلك هذا بالفعل افتراض محافظ.
 إذا عدنا
 إذا طرحنا حصة ركوب الدراجات والعمل من المنزل البالغة 5% كما ورد في بيانات التعداد، واستخدام وسائل النقل الأخرى كما ورد في بيانات التعداد، فسننتهي بـ 70% من حركة المرور المرتبطة بالسفر بالسيارة.
 لذلك أعتقد بهذا المعنى أنه افتراض محافظ بالفعل.
 تشمل الرحلات المحسوبة أو المخططة جميع المستخدمين لأنهم الوجهة.
 وهذا يشمل وسائل النقل، بما في ذلك شاحنات القمامة ورحلات العودة إلى المنزل.
 كما تعلمون، أنا أفهم أن الناس يأتون ويذهبون.
 في المجمع، كما تعلمون، كل شيء، تقوده الشاحنات، وهذا ما ننظر إليه طوال الوقت للتخطيط والتقييم.
 مثل هذه الأسئلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5704.542s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، اسمحوا لي أن أشكركم.
 نعم، أمام المحامي جالاهاري.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5711.503s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: أريد فقط أن أضيف قليلاً إلى ما قاله سكوت: كما ذكر بات، عقدنا اجتماعًا مثمرًا مع فريق الاختبار أمس.
 في هذا السياق، ناقشنا تدابير TDM والاستراتيجيات الأخرى التي يمكننا استخدامها للتخفيف من السفر الإضافي الذي ناقشناه.
 أعتقد أننا نمضي قدمًا وأدرك أن الإصدار التجريبي لا يزال تحت السيطرة.
 وسوف نقدم تعليقات مكتوبة.
 ومع ذلك، سننظر بالتأكيد إلى تدابير مثل القيود المرورية كوسيلة لتشجيع السفر إلى وجهة معينة، مثل فيلسواي.
 هذه هي المشكلات التي ذكرناها والتي سننظر فيها وننظر أيضًا إلى النسخة التجريبية وتوصيات مجلس الإدارة بشأنها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5761.856s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 وإذا كان 5% من السفر يأتي من هذا المدخل فهل لا تزال هناك حاجة إليه؟
 هل من الممكن إغلاق هذا القسم؟
 إذا، على سبيل المثال، انتقل 5٪ من هناك، فسيبدو ذلك بمثابة مورد ضائع للمبنى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5781.484s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أعتقد أنه تمت إضافة هذا في الأصل كطريقة توزيع، لكنه ليس كذلك.
 حسنًا، بالطبع، نعم، أعلم ذلك، لسبب ما، إنه معروف مسبقًا.
 الآن تغيرت الأمور قليلاً لأنني أعتقد أن هذه هي الطريقة التي تتجه بها سيارات الإطفاء شمالًا.
 العقارات الغربية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5815.379s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: هذا صحيح؟
 هذا صحيح
 هذه هي خطة الموقع التي نعمل عليها حاليًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5820.56s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: مثالي.
 حسنا
 سكوت. النقطة الأخيرة تتطلب التوضيح.
 ولذلك، فإن سكان Fellsway الذين يسافرون شمالًا ويعتزمون استخدام مدخل Fellsway سوف يتجهون شمال الموقع ويتركون سيارتهم.
 لذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5839.375s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، نعلم أن هناك حركة مرور هنا، ولكن لا يزال يبدو خيارًا أفضل من حركة المرور التي تريد الانعطاف يسارًا والنزول إلى وسط المدينة.
 نتوقع أن تقوم بعض وسائل النقل بذلك، لكن التأخير المرتبط بهذا النوع من السفر من المرجح أن يكون أكبر من تأخير العودة.
 لدينا حركة المرور
 مرة أخرى، تأتي هذه التدفقات من الغرب، وبعضها من ريفرسايد وسنترال، وبعضها من أمارانث ومعظمها من طريق فيلز.
 نظرًا لموقع طريق Fells Way وأنماط حركة المرور، سيتم تغيير المداخل عند كلا التقاطعين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5919.241s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 خايمي هل لديك أي أسئلة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5922.274s">[Unidentified]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنني أثرت في الاجتماع الأخير إمكانية العودة والقيادة عبر المنطقة.
 أعني أن خيار الصعود إلى الطائرة في Fellsway هو الالتفاف حول الدوار، أو صعود Fellsway إلى مدخل Fellsway إلى التقاطع، أو الانعطاف يسارًا إلى Kenmare، أو ربما قد يقرر بعض الأشخاص الصعود إلى Fellsway إلى Riverside وإلى Riverside.
 شارع الربيع، ثم شارع لورانس.
 لكنني أعتقد أن الأمر أصعب من الذهاب إلى فيلسواي.
 لا أعتقد أن هذا يمكن أن يحدث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5964.428s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أرى
 حسنا، شكرا.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 هل لدينا أي أفراد آخرين من الجمهور يريدون التحدث عن هذا؟
 أنا لا أرى.
 انتظرت كاثيدرا لحظة قبل أن تغلق أبوابها علنًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5984.235s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: انتظر
 شخص ما يتحدث.
 بعض الناس لا يستطيعون التحدث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5988.339s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم هو الذي يصمت دائماً.
 سأتحقق لمعرفة ما إذا كانوا يريدون التحدث حقًا أم أنها مجرد مشكلة فنية.
 هل يريد أي شخص آخر في الأماكن العامة التحدث أم أن هذه مجرد مفاجأة؟
 نعم، أعتقد أنها كانت حادثة هادئة.
 بعد ذلك، ينتظر الرئيس طلب إغلاق الجزء العلني من الجلسة.
 مؤثر جدا.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟
 الاثنين.
 حسنا، دعونا نتصل
 ايفرت؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6024.528s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6026.029s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: جيم؟
 هذا صحيح.
 أندرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 جيمي؟
 هذا صحيح.
 وبذلك، انتهى الجزء العام من جلسة الاستماع.
 أعضاء مجلس الإدارة. هل لديك أي أسئلة أو تعليقات أخرى قبل أن ننتقل إلى الخطوة التالية: ما هو قطاع الخدمات اللوجستية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6049.932s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: التالي.
 أعتقد أن إيفيت قد وصلت.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6053.515s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: نعم، أنا آسف جدا.
 هل يمكنك الكشف عن البطاقة التي تريد طيها؟
 لأنني أعتقد أن هذا مفترق طرق، أليس كذلك؟
 ساطع</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6076.468s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 ثم يأتي المركز الرابع، سنتر وفيلسواي، والمركز الأول، ريفرسايد وفيلسواي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6086.44s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: هل كان هناك أي نقاش في ذلك الوقت حول إمكانية هذا التحسن؟
 لأنني أتذكر أن طريق العودة يمكن أن يكون طويلاً، وكنت أعلم أن هذا الطريق كان بالفعل تقاطعاً سيئاً، ولا يمكن أن يكون أفضل.
 ولكن هل تتم مناقشة هذا الأمر؟ هل يمكنك مناقشة التطورات الأخرى التي تعمل أحيانًا على تحسين الوضع بطرق مختلفة؟
 وأتساءل ماذا يمكن أن يحدث؟
 لا أعرف كيف يبدو الأمر، لكن كما تعلم، انعطف يسارًا، انعطف يسارًا، في طريقك أو أيًا كان.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6128.905s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم أعني أننا عندما نحلل ذلك نرى أن هناك تأخيرًا كبيرًا متعدد الخطوط على جميع البوابات الأربع وجميع الحركات عند البوابة.
 لذا، كما تعلم، إذا كنت تعرف، يمكنك الوصول.
 كما تعلمون، إنها علامة على العصر، لكنك في الواقع تعطي الأولوية لنشاط ما على الآخر.
 لم نفكر بعد في تعديل المسار الأوسط لتوسيع أو توسيع المنعطف الأيسر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6183.348s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: أعتقد أنه إذا كان بإمكاني أن أقول شيئًا آخر، أين نحن وأين نحن، فإننا نحاول التفكير في كيفية تقليل تأثيرنا.
 حسنا
 لكن هذين التقاطعين وصلا بالفعل إلى الحد الأدنى من مستويات الخدمة.
 حسنًا، بالطبع، نعم، أعلم ذلك، لسبب ما، إنه معروف مسبقًا.
 ما هي الإجراءات التي يمكننا اتخاذها والتي تعتبر معقولة بموجب الفصل 40ب؟
 لكني أريد فقط أن أكون واقعيًا لأنني أعتقد أن هناك بعض الحدود الحقيقية لقدرتنا على إجراء أي تغييرات مادية على مسار فيلز.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6231.436s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: لتوضيح هذه
 هل تتضمن القيود متطلبات المناقشة والاتفاق مع MassDOT؟
 في الواقع استخدم DCR.
 هذا كل شيء.
 مثالي.
 حسنا
 حسنًا، إيفيت، إذا كنت قد طرحت سؤالك بالفعل، فإن أندريه هو التالي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6254.77s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: نعم، لا يزال لدي أسئلة وتعليقات.
 يقع أحدهم بالقرب من إدارة ساحة انتظار السيارات.
 لم أسمعك تتحدث عن كيفية مكافأة المراكز المفتوحة.
 سأفعل ذلك لأنك لست كل شيء
 لا أسمعك تتحدث عن كيفية توزيعها. هل سيدفع الناس مقابل ركن السيارة؟
 كيفية تنظيم مساحة الضيوف؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6292.296s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: أعتقد أنه السيد لارو.
 ما زلنا لا نملك إجابة لك.
 أعتقد أننا فكرنا حقًا في كل هذه الأسئلة.
 سأسأل بات إذا كان لديه أي شيء يضيفه، ولكن أعتقد أن الإجابة الآن هي أننا سنعود إليك، ولكننا سنتابع العملية وسيكون ذلك جزءًا من محادثة المراجعة لدينا أيضًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6322.029s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: حسنًا، عظيم.
 أخرى
 أسئلتي الأخرى:
 أعتقد أن خطة إدارة العرض والطلب ضعيفة.
 أود أن أرى بعض الأشكال الإضافية من الحوافز لتشجيع السكان على استخدام وسائل النقل العام حتى نتمكن من تحقيق المزيد من الرحلات المشتركة في وسائل النقل العام.
 أتساءل عما إذا كان بإمكانك وضع أي أفكار إبداعية في هذا إذا كان ذلك منطقيًا؟
 كما تعلمون، مساعدة الناس في الحصول على الإعانات أو الدعم الذاتي أو شيء من هذا القبيل.
 أنا متأكد من أن هناك بعض الأفكار الإبداعية هناك.
 أنا لست خبيرا في هذا المجال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6375.676s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: أعتقد أننا تطرقنا إلى هذا الموضوع بالأمس في محادثة مع مديري Beta وHunter.
 أعتقد أن هذا شيء سنراه بوضوح.
 سأضع هذا الدلو هناك، كما تعلمون، نحن مهتمون جدًا بمحاولة بناء محطة دراجات صديقة للبيئة.
 أعتقد أنه إذا كان هذا ممكنًا، فإنه سيساعد أيضًا كثيرًا في الترويج لركوب الدراجات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6409.432s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا، كل شيء على ما يرام.
 هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 أنا لا أرى.
 أعلم أن لدينا مراجعة تجريبية.
 يبدو أن هناك بعض الاختصارات
 التواصل مع المرشحين.
 أريد فقط التسجيل.
 أنا فقط أنظر إلى القائمة.
 على سبيل المثال، أنظر إلى جيف.
 بالترتيب الزمني، واستنادًا إلى المعلومات والمناقشات التي أجريتها اليوم، متى تعتقد أنه سيكون لدينا المزيد من المعلومات حول مراجعة النظراء؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6465.702s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: مرحباً، رئيس مجلس الإدارة.
 نعم، قرأنا التقرير الأول.
 إذن، كما تعلمون، فقد وجدت الآن المزيد من المعلومات والتفسيرات الأكثر وضوحًا وأشياء من هذا القبيل.
 لكننا لم ننظر عن كثب إلى الحسابات، كما تعلمون، هذا النوع من تطبيقات المعلومات.
 وكما تعلمون، عندما نسافر إلى الخارج، علينا أن نخرج ونراقب.
 حالة المرور يرجى اتخاذ الإجراءات اللازمة.
 كما تعلمون، لدينا بضعة أسابيع متبقية.
 أعتقد
 سأذهب بالتأكيد في إجازة الأسبوع المقبل، لذا فقد كان أسبوعًا ميتًا.
 لذلك ربما سنحتاج في غضون أسابيع قليلة إلى بعض الوقت لإعداد كل شيء.
 أنت تعرف المراجعة الكاملة.
 لقد أجرينا مناقشة حية بالأمس وأثار أعضاء المجلس قضايا مثل مواقف السيارات وTDM التي ذكرها أندرو للتو وكان رد فعلنا أو قلقنا الأولي هو نفسه.
 نحن نعلم بالفعل بعضًا من هذا، ولكننا بحاجة إلى الخوض في التفاصيل، الأمر الذي سيستغرق وقتًا أطول.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6551.084s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم نعم شكرا على الخبر
 لذلك أنا أعرف هذا لأنه
 لإظهار القصة، نحن لا نتبع الجدول الزمني الأصلي بأي شكل من الأشكال.
 لكنني أعتقد أن الهدف الأصلي كان إكمال ما لم نكمله.
 لذا، فإن الشيء التالي الذي تريد اللجنة رؤيته هو خطة بناء محدثة.
 وأعتقد أنه من الأفضل أن ننظر في الاجتماع القادم في الخطط الهندسية واللوجستية المحدثة بالإضافة إلى التعليقات التي راجعها النظراء.
 لكي نكون واضحين، ستكون جلسة الاستماع القادمة يوم الثلاثاء 26 مارس، في أقل من أسبوعين.
 هذا هو المكان
 إذا سارت الأمور وفقًا للخطة، فستكون الخطوة التالية هي تحديث خطة البناء.
 وهذا يعني أن الخميس 11 أبريل هو يوم فني ومروري.
 لذلك أريد فقط الدردشة مع المرشحين والاتفاق على الموضوع التالي.
 هل تعتقد أنه يمكننا الاستمرار؟
 أو ماذا يجب أن نفعل في الجلسة القادمة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6642.127s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: شكرا سيدي الرئيس. وأعتقد أننا نتفق مع هذا النهج.
 نحن نتطلع الآن إلى تقديم حزمة البناء المحدثة إلى مجلس المدينة ومقيمي ديفيس سكوير.
 أعتقد أن هدفنا في نهاية هذا الأسبوع أو أوائل الأسبوع المقبل هو عقد اجتماع متابعة مع قادتنا الأسبوع المقبل وأن نكون قادرين على تقديم ذلك في جلسة الاستماع التالية يوم 26.
 حسنًا، جلسة الاستماع القادمة ستكون في 11 أبريل.
 أوافق على ذلك، طالما أن Beta لديها القدرة على تزويدنا بالتعليقات، يمكننا بالفعل مناقشة الأمر.
 تحليل التسليم ومعلومات أكثر تفصيلا.
 أعتقد أنه من الجدير الإضافة أنه يمكنني ترك هذا الأمر لبيل لوكاس، ولكن أعتقد أنه يمكننا مناقشة السلسلة المدنية الجديدة بمزيد من التفصيل.
 كما تعلمون، إذا لم نكن بحاجة إلى طلب مكتوب، فيمكننا على الأقل تقديم خطة المواطنة الكاملة بحلول 11 أبريل.
 بيل، هل أنا في حيرة من أمري أم على حق؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6714.468s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: ما قلته غير مناسب.
 هذا صحيح
 خطتنا هي تقديم مجموعة محدثة من الرسومات المدنية في نهاية الأسبوع المقبل.
 نأمل أن يمنح هذا Bede وقتًا كافيًا لحل المشكلة ويمنحنا ردًا إيجابيًا في الوقت المناسب بحلول اليوم الحادي عشر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6737.968s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: جيد جدا، عظيم.
 لذلك يبدو هذا وكأنه خطة.
 هل هناك أي شيء آخر يجب أن نناقشه الليلة قبل أن نمضي قدمًا؟
 أعتقد أننا ناقشنا الموضوعات الرئيسية للخطة الليلة وتحققنا فقط لمعرفة ما إذا كان هناك أي شيء آخر للمناقشة أو التسليم أو أي شيء آخر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6759.369s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: سيدي الرئيس، أعتقد أن الأمر يعتمد على ما يعتقده المرشحون، ومرة ​​أخرى، نحن ممتنون جدًا لمجلس الإدارة والمديرين التنفيذيين على وقتهم، ونعتقد أننا أجرينا بعض المحادثات الجيدة، ونتطلع إلى مواصلة تلك المحادثات.
 نحن متحمسون جدًا لهذا المشروع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6779.407s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: جيد جدا ورائع.
 نعم، شكرا على التحديث.
 حسنًا، تحقق من التقدم هنا.
 حسنًا، ينتظر الرئيس طلبًا لمواصلة مناقشة هذه القضية في اجتماعنا الخاص يوم الثلاثاء 26 مارس الساعة 6:30 مساءً. أرز
 مؤثر جدا.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6803.907s">[Unidentified]</a>: الاثنين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6804.627s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، دعونا نتصل
 أندرو؟
 هذا صحيح.

 هذا صحيح.
 ايفرت؟
 هذا صحيح.
 جيمي؟
 هذا صحيح.
 مايك، نعم.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 وهذا مستمر حتى يومنا هذا.
 لذا شكرا لكم أيها الأصدقاء.
 ليلة سعيدة
 لدينا بندان آخران على جدول الأعمال: التحديثات والاجتماعات الإدارية فقط.
 هل لدينا تحديث من الرئيس التنفيذي هذا المساء؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6840.788s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: لا أعتقد أنني أستطيع التفكير في أي شيء.
 الشيء الوحيد كان المناقشة في اجتماعنا الذي استمر لمدة أسبوعين.
 هناك شيء نريد القيام به في هذا القسم من الاجتماع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6852.076s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنك تقصد مجرد حل وسط.
 إنها مسألة جدولة اجتماعاتنا العادية.
 لذا؟
 هذا صحيح.
 هذا صحيح.
 لذلك هذا شيء لا ينبغي لنا أن نفعله.
 يمكننا أيضًا القيام بذلك بدون الإنترنت، لكن نعم، سنفعل ذلك بدون الإنترنت.
 حسنًا، لا بأس.
 تبدو جيدة.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 ثم هناك اجتماع دقيق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6874.404s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: نعم، أعلم أنني أرسلت بعضًا منها، لكني أحاول أن أتذكر الرسائل التي أرسلتها إليك.
 لذلك أعتذر.
 لقد رأيت راشيل تفعل أشياء كثيرة وهي رائعة حقًا.
 لذلك لا أتذكر أي واحد أرسلته إليك وأي واحد لم أفعله.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6885.986s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: إنه 25 يناير بالنسبة لي.
 11 يناير. أعتقد أنه كان اجتماعا عاديا.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6902.314s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: لم أرسل لك شهر فبراير، لذا أعتذر عن ذلك.
 أستطيع أن أعطي قبل وبعد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6906.097s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنًا، نعم، فيما يتعلق براشيل، أعتقد أننا بحاجة أيضًا إلى الموافقة على محضر الاجتماع الخاص.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6918.652s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: نعم، هذا بالضبط ما أتحدث عنه، الحلقات الخاصة التي أرسلتها لك.
 لا أعتقد أنني أتذكر.
 هناك العديد من محاضر الاجتماعات.
 لذلك أريد العودة وإلقاء نظرة على البريد الإلكتروني الذي أرسلته.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6932.943s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: تبدو جيدة.
 لكن نعم، لا أعتقد أننا بحاجة إلى موافقة اليوم.
 لذلك يبدو هذا وكأنه خطة.
 ترسلها إلينا ونوافق عليها في الاجتماع التالي.
 هل تبدو جميلة؟
 مثالي.
 جيد جدا، عظيم.
 بهذا نختتم جدول أعمالنا.
 ينتظر الرئيس اقتراحًا بإنهاء الاجتماع.
 يرجى إنهاء الاجتماع.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟
 الاثنين.
 حسنا، نحن بحاجة للاختبار.
 جيمي؟
 جيم؟
 هذا صحيح.
 بيث؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6967.823s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>
