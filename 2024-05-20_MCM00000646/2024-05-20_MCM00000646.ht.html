    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=465.548s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Great, thank you very much.
 Pat.
 Mr. Chairman members of the board for the record.
 My name is Scott Thornton with Vanessa associates.
 We prepared the traffic assessment for the projects working with the Davis companies, bowler and cube 3 studios.
 We think that the TIA, just as an initial statement, we think that the TIA shows that the project can be accommodated by the road network and the street system.
 And I will get into the reasons why during my presentation.
 But as noted, we're calling this a supplemental traffic study.
 The initial TIA was submitted in November of last year, and that was a study that had been prepared previously with older data.
 We think that while the findings are generally consistent between the two documents, we understand that with passage of time, the study required an update.
 The scope for that document, the initial TIA was determined with the director of traffic and transportation for the city.
 This supplemental TIA used the same scope.
 We left the supplemental TIA as a draft because we know that city staff will review the document.
 As Pat mentioned, we've had an initial meeting with BETA, the city's peer reviewer.
 So we anticipate there may be some changes to the TIA before it becomes
 sort of memorialized as a completely final document and ready for the file.
 So the Supplemental TIA was based on the revised site plan that was presented last month.
 The TIA was submitted on March 5th.
 So the supplemental TIA reviewed impacts during the critical weekday morning and weekday evening time periods, looking at 14 intersections in the study area.
 And I'll get into the explanation of that in a minute.
 TIA considered the transit, pedestrian, bicycle facilities, as well as vehicle impacts and safety considerations in the identification of impacts for the project.
 The next slide shows the site in context to the study area.
 As I mentioned, 14 intersections in total, four signalized intersections really on the corners of the study area, a couple
 intersections with Fellsway, a couple intersections with Spring Street that are the signalized locations.
 And then we have 10 un-signalized intersections located on the periphery of the site and also in the neighborhood.
 We did an extensive field inventory out in the study area.
 We noted that all streets have sidewalks on both sides.
 There's generally parking on one or both sides of the streets in the neighborhood.
 In terms of facilities, we noted that DCR modified the Fellsway with bike lanes on each side and last year put in curb extensions at the Myrtle Street intersection.
 We conducted traffic counts in January between the hours of 7 and 9 in the morning weekday and 4 to 6 p.m.
 Those were done on January 11th, which was a Thursday.
 We would expect that, you know, we try to do those counts for weekday time periods between Tuesday and Thursday.
 That's generally when traffic is consistent at a consistent level.
 In general, the peak hours start in the morning around 7.45, go from 7.45 to 8.45.
 There's a few outliers, some start at 7, some start at 7.15, but in general, that's about the time period for the morning.
 And in general, in the evening, the peak hour time period occurs between 5 and 6.
 We adjusted the volumes to raise them to the average month conditions, which is consistent with MassDOT standards.
 We counted pedestrians, bicycles, buses, trucks, and vehicles.
 There's actually separate exhibits in the TIA depicting the pedestrians and bicycle movements that were observed at each intersection.
 And on average, there's between 10 and 20 pedestrians during the peak hours at each location.
 Some locations have a little more.
 I think the intersection of Riverside with Fellsway actually has a few more.
 It's in the 20 to 35.
 pedestrians range during the peak hour.
 But in terms of bicycles, there's not a lot of bicycle usage that showed up in the counts.
 But again, January, although it hasn't been a typical January, we would expect that those bicycle volumes to increase during the more seasonal months.
 So the next slide, we start to get into some of the detail with regard to the transit availability.
 I know in one of the meetings, ZBA members were curious to know the status of the 100 bus, which stops really right in front of the site at Myrtle Street.
 So this slide shows the public transportation availability in the area.
 There's the 100 bus, there's the 108, there's the 101, the 134, but 100 really is the one that stops, that would most likely see the majority of usage from the project residents.
 Wellington Station and Malden Center are each about 1.4 miles, about a 30 minute walk from the site.
 So we think that usage would really focus around the 100 bus to get to Wellington Station or other locations.
 We requested and received data from the MBTA on the ridership.
 They've really improved their ridership survey information and program.
 100Bus has 42 trips per direction on a daily basis between 5 a.m.
 and 1240 a.m., which averages about 1,256 passengers a day.
 And this is based on ridership surveys that were conducted in spring, summer, and fall of 2023 by MBTA.
 At the Myrtle Street stop, on average, 2 to 3 passengers per bus trip were observed to get on the bus.
 And that's
 That ranges between the inbound bus in the morning and the outbound bus in the evening.
 Peak hours for the T are 6.30 to 9.30 in the morning and 3.30 to 6.30 in the afternoon.
 That's when the bus frequency goes up to three buses per hour.
 Other than that, the rest of the day, it's typically one to two buses per hour.
 So these riderships also match our observations.
 We were out there actually this morning and noticed between one and three passengers getting on three buses in the morning, or in the inbound direction, and that was between
 Roughly between 7 and a little before 7 and about quarter of 8.
 In terms of the outbound buses, it was about 1 to 3 passengers that were there.
 Actually, there was no 1 waiting to get on the bus to travel outbound, but there were 1 to 3 passengers on the bus.
 during that same time period.
 And actually, the inbound bus, we observed about eight to 14 passengers on the bus, depending on which of the inbound buses it was.
 So it shows adequate capacity for the additional riders that are expected.
 For the site, given that these buses have a 53 passenger capacity.
 As noted by the by the.
 The next slide, we get into some bicycle facilities.
 And so the slide on the graphic on the left shows, this shows existing facilities.
 It comes from the MassDOT bike trail, ArcGIS data.
 Indicates bike lanes on the Fells Way and Revere Beach Parkway.
 It's kind of hard to see at the scale, but it's the bluish, purplish lines showing where those bike lanes are.
 It also indicates the area of the Wellington circle improvements, which are conceptually shown in the upper graphic.
 There is a preferred alternative that has been identified, which improves pedestrian and bicycle connectivity through the circle.
 I think it's still in the planning stages, so I don't know that there's a timeframe that's been identified yet.
 But that is a project that is in the background.
 Also shown is the Malden River Greenway Wellington connector segment that would connect to the bike facilities on Commercial Street.
 This is the potential rail line or multi-use path that passes behind the site, and I think Bill Lucas from Bowler will touch on that in his description of the site plan.
 But, but again, you know, there's these future conditions.
 These are future conditions and projects that will improve conditions for pedestrians and bicycles, not just for our project, but for for everyone in the area.
 The next slide, we start to get into some of the project specific data, looking at existing and projected future mode split data.
 This data comes from the 2022 American commuter survey.
 It indicates percentages
 shown in the columns.
 And the darker numbers represent the data that's from that survey.
 The lighter numbers, lighter columns, represent what we anticipate the project mode split to be.
 We think that because of the Wellington Connector and the Wellington Circle improvements, we think pedestrian and bicycle usage will increase.
 So we've adjusted the census data to move some of the
 some of the single occupant and the high occupant vehicle, which are basically carpool trips, we moved 5% from those categories into the bike category.
 And we'd like to say that that's a very conservative estimate because of the
 the increasing number of facilities that'll be promoted and provided, as well as the TDM measures for the project, which I'll get into towards the end of my presentation.
 But in general, what we wound up with was a 23% non-automobile travel mode that was expected.
 Well, then we've got 65% automobile travel.
 That's the combination of SOV, you know, somebody in their car driving alone, and HOV is somebody carpooling.
 And then there's 12% that is working from home or commutes using some other form of transportation.
 Those last two categories, the 65% and the 12%, we lump those together to result in 77% auto usage, just to provide a conservative analysis scenario.
 So, you know, it's a little bit of a factor of safety that's built into the mode split and the vehicle trip generations and assumptions, which is what we're going to get into on the next slide.
 So the trip generation information is based on the ITE trip generation manual.
 And this is standard protocol and required by MassDOT and Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR, for a source to estimate trip generation.
 So these are resulting vehicle trips after mode split adjustments for the residential uses only.
 The trips in the column labeled existing storage facility, those are trips that we counted and are presently there, presently existing at the site.
 So in terms of the time periods, we look at the weekday daily, the weekday morning, and the weekday evening peak hour.
 The two peak hour numbers are used for the analysis.
 The daily numbers, that's the total entering and exiting.
 So of the 1,038, that's 519 trips entering and exiting over the course of a 24-hour day.
 In terms of the traffic increase through the neighborhood, on the outside edge of the neighborhood, we're looking at four to 14 trips during the peak hours.
 On the Fellsway, we're looking at 18 to 41 trips with higher numbers if we include both directions.
 In the morning, I think we've got something like 47 trips at the Fellsway and Riverside intersection.
 In the evening at the Fells Way and Central Street intersection with Medford Street, we've got 46.
 So those numbers, they vary depending on the direction.
 You can see there's a higher split with exiting traffic in the morning and entering traffic in the evening.
 And I know that when Bill gets into the site plan, which you've seen already, there's site access to Amaranth and to Myrtle and to Fellsway.
 because of the location of the access there, would be expected to see a larger increase right on the street before it's dispersed.
 But again, in general, we think that the trips are manageable, which I'll get into when we get into the level of service and the analysis results.
 23% of commuters using non-automobile modes of transportation, we expect that to be a low number.
 And we expect to put measures into place to increase the transit percentage as well as the other forms of sustainable transportation.
 So the next slide, we start to get into the traffic analysis.
 And let me just back up.
 We use the existing counts to develop future conditions.
 We look at a seven-year projection.
 And then we add background projects or traffic from background projects that are on the books that are proposed or that are approved and not yet constructed or constructed and not yet occupied.
 And we also include a background growth rate.
 That scenario is called the no build conditions, basically the future condition without the project.
 And then we add the project traffic to that, that gives us the future conditions with the project called the build condition.
 So as I mentioned, we used a 1% growth rate for general background growth.
 We included traffic from 11 background projects, including the expansion of the Encore Casino and the Assembly Row expansions.
 This gives us the no-build condition, which is a base to compare the impacts of the project in the build condition.
 So, we added the trips that you saw in the previous slide into the network to identify the delay increases due to the project.
 And a summary is that in terms of the level of service or LOS, which
 Again, backing up a little bit, assigns letters to delay ranges.
 So for unsignalized intersections, for instance, a level of service A is an average delay per vehicle less than 10 seconds.
 A level of service B is an average delay of between 10 and 15 seconds.
 A level of service C, like what we're talking about here, is an average delay of between 15 and 25 seconds.
 So, you know, we're not talking about huge delays at these locations.
 In fact, the project, when we add the project traffic into the network, what we find is that there's really no change in level of service at 13 of the 14 locations.
 There's level of service C or better at nine intersections.
 The two Fellsway locations, which are on this graphic, locations one at Riverside and
 Location 4 at Central and Medford Street, those are operating at level of service F or greater than an 80 second delay with or without the project.
 We also did a supplemental analysis of the operations at those 2 intersections.
 There's a pedestrian phase that's not to get too deep into the weeds on traffic.
 signal timing but if we if we remove the if we discount the pedestrian phase it gives an idea of what the what the what the impact of the project is and and again the the level of service didn't change with that supplemental analysis that's in the that's in the
 In the TIA, in general, delays are less than 2 seconds as a result of the project.
 So, the next slide, we start to get into transportation demand management.
 And I mentioned previously that we plan to improve on that 23% non-auto transportation component.
 And one way we do that is with the TDM measures.
 So these consist of a number of proven principles and measures to encourage the use of more sustainable transportation instead of personal vehicles.
 Things like a transportation coordinator or a TC would be designated for the project.
 It's probably somebody in the leasing office or the on-site maintenance.
 Somebody that residents can go to, someone that will coordinate with the lower Mystic TMA, for instance, can provide information on transit, biking, walking, what other options are available.
 There'll be support for telecommuting with high-speed internet and other options.
 Secure bicycle parking is proposed, and we're still working through the details on those, but we're looking at also providing space for e-bikes to be charged in the facility.
 We're also looking at EV charging facilities on site.
 Again, these are things that are still
 still being worked through the details on, but this is part of the proposal for the project.
 And coordination with Blue Bikes in order to potentially set up a Blue Bikes kiosk that would be able to be used by not just the residents of the project, but residents of the neighborhood as well.
 And as I meant, I believe I mentioned previously that Bill Lucas will also indicate how the site plan is proposed to have access to the potential Wellington connector.
 So all of these measures are in use, they're proven strategies, they're in use in Medford to some extent, but also in Boston and in Cambridge and Somerville and Everett and Malden, and that's because they work there.
 And some cities, you have to develop a TDM plan.
 And Davis is taking the charge or taking the lead on this to implement this plan.
 So, you know, just to summarize, I think the last slide just shows the conclusions.
 And, you know, this TIA indicates a minimal impact on peak hour traffic delays and vehicle queuing with no change in level of service at 13 or 14 intersections and less than a two-second increase in delay at most locations.
 Uh, the project is improving circulation and.
 I'm really doing a great preview for Bill, but the project is improving circulation in the neighborhood by introducing new on-street parking on Myrtle Street and Amaranth Ave.
 And this improves the accommodation and circulation for two-way traffic flow on both of those streets.
 The project is enhancing operations through the closure of two curb cuts, construction of a multi-modal sidewalk on Amaranth Ave.
 And there's no sidewalk there now, but the project includes the addition of that sidewalk.
 As I mentioned, eliminating curb cuts at the intersection of Myrtle, Amaranth, and Lawrence Street and at the corner of Myrtle Street and the Fellsway.
 And again, promoting alternative modes of transportation.
 It did another way to support the use of bicycles as an inclusion of a bicycle repair shop, as I mentioned, the secure storage and e-bike charging, as well as a tie-in to the Wellington connector.
 So we know that we still have the city and peer review process to work through, but we feel that all of these conclusions and points reinforce the
 the idea that the project can be accommodated as designed.
 With that, that's the end of my presentation.
 I'll turn it over to Bill Lucas from Bowler.
 Thank you.

 Men, sa nou te fè se eseye revize plan an.
 Soti nan yon pèspektiv entèn, nan yon pèspektiv sekirite machin ak pyeton, epi ki baze sou youn nan menm faktè prensipal yo.
 Pwen kle nan revizyon an se gade nan aksè ijans, ki mwen pral kouvri nan kèk diapositives nan lavni, men veyikil aksè ijans alantou sit la li menm pou asire ke nou bay aksè adekwa soti nan wout piblik atravè aksè alantou sit la ak alantou bilding nan.
 An tèm de kèk nan lòt chanjman ki te planifye ki te fèt, nou te fè ti ajisteman nan konfigirasyon pwen antre devan an.
 Sa a se akòz plizyè rezon.
 Ankò, asire nou ke nou kapab byen akomode machin ijans ak travay pou amelyore estetik ak aksè nan nouvo bilding sa a ak nouvo pwojè sa a nan kominote a li menm.
 Yon lòt ti ajisteman konsepsyon te fè devan estasyon an nan direksyon Fellsway.
 Nou te gen opòtinite pou revize tout kamyon k ap antre ak sòti nan etablisman an, mouvman yo vire yo, layout koridò antre a, ak layout ti pakin ki asosye ak etablisman an.
 Anplis de sa, jan Scott te mansyone, nou te fè kèk chanjman nan pakin sou plas la nan Myrtle Street ak Amaranth Avenue, men yo piti nan lanati.
 Sitou nan Amaranth, nou te elaji lari pou akomode trafik machin.
 Pakin ak yon pasaj piblik yo te bay pita sou fasad li yo.
 Kòm nou tout konnen, pakin gen restriksyon kounye a akòz kote bilding yo, poto sèvis piblik yo, ak gwo koupe nan twotwa ki egziste deja.
 Kounye a nou pral bay prèske 12 espas pakin ak pasaj pyeton sou fasad sa a.
 Anplis de sa, jan mwen te remake, nou sou sit la pou revize ak ajiste kèk karakteristik nan sit la akòz sikilasyon machin ak pyeton, ki gen ladan kèk chemen antre ak soti nan bilding nan ak espas pakin aksesib pou EV ak EV.
 Kounye a nou ap montre yon kantite ti izolwa ak machin aksesib ak machin elektrik.
 Yo pwopoze kounye a rès espas pakin aksesib pou machin elektrik yo sou tè a toupre kwen nòdès bilding lan nan pakin Podium la.
 Pwochen glise tanpri.
 Scott, ou ta renmen antre epi pale sou glise sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2327.881s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Natirèlman, nan kou.
 Se konsa, nou te pran yon estimasyon nan demann lan pou yon pati nan TIA a epi baze li sou done ki soti nan ITE a, menm jan yo te fè pou manyèl jenerasyon vwayaj la, yo te fè kalkil yo.
 Konsidere egzijans pakin pou enstalasyon ki sanble ak sa yo pwopoze ak/oswa ki egziste isit la anrapò ak bezwen lasemèn ak nan wikenn pou enstalasyon depo ak devlopman rezidansyèl yo pwopoze a.
 Pousantaj demann sa yo, to pakin mwayèn sa yo, aplike nan yon inite espesifik oswa kantite inite oswa zòn etaj pou nenpòt itilizasyon tè ki aplikab.
 Sa a ban nou an mwayèn 276 espas pakin nan yon jou travay, 252
 Pakin nan wikenn, kidonk, ou konnen, rezèv pakin, sou yon bò, pi gran pase.
 Kondisyon pou pakin maksimòm yo estime, sepandan.
 Men, mwen konnen, men Bill, mwen pral kite ou ale nan pwochen diapositive la paske mwen panse ke se lòt pati a.
 Mwen dezole, mwen devine mwen pa regrèt sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2438.591s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: Gen 2 glisad k ap desann.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2440.872s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2441.172s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: Kidonk, mwen pa konnen si ou vle ale dirèkteman, mwen panse ke ou vle wè glise a soti nan pakin nan.
 Scott, èske sa kòrèk?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2451.76s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2457.18s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Mwen pral sote byen vit.
 Si ou tounen, Bill, mwen panse ke glisad pakin yo te kondanse nan glisad sa a pou bay yon rezime rapid sou lwa dekoupaj an zòn.
 Nou gen kòmantè ak yon asterisk anba a, jis sa nou panse ki nesesè konpare ak pwodwi a epi nou ta renmen mande w diskite sou li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2484.263s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: Wi, kounye a baze sou plan sit ou wè pi wo a n ap gade 324 espas pakin, ki gen ladan pakin sou plas ak podium pou rezidans aktyèl yo.
 Pou depo a, nou pwopoze yon lòt 22 espas pakin.
 Yon fwa ankò, sa a se sitiyasyon aktyèl la epi li ka chanje.
 Men, baze sou tout sa nou te wè jiska prezan, nou santi li.
 Li rekòmande ke nou bay pakin adekwa pou tou de enstalasyon yo epi yo dwe konsidere.
 Lide nou te resevwa nan men Komisyon Konsèy dekoupaj an zòn nan nan tan lontan an se pa twò pake nan kote sa a men pou eseye pake kòmsadwa pou chak itilizasyon ki disponib.
 Pwochen glise tanpri.
 Slide sa a bay yon apèsi sou
 Kamyon ponpye kap dirije Medford ak wout yo soti nan Myrtle Street pou rive nan kote ki devan bilding lan.
 Li ka yon ti kras difisil yo wè men sa a se yon kamyon ponpye, ale bò solèy leve nan direksyon Fellsway, vire adwat nan direksyon antre prensipal la epi kontinye nan devan bilding lan.
 Yon kote ou ka vizite nan ka ta gen nenpòt ijans.
 Lè sa a, nou sèlman montre mouvman an deyò nan direksyon lari a nan kwen anwo dwat.
 Sa a se modèl kamyon ponpye nou te itilize pou reprezantasyon sa a.
 Jan mwen konnen, sa a nan liy ak kondisyon Medford Fire Marshal la.
 Pwochen glise tanpri.
 Sa a te bay yon bouk pou kamyon ponpye a nan sèn nan soti nan Fellsway, kote kamyon an te vire adwat, pase estasyon ponpye a, epi answit nan sens goch alantou dèyè bilding lan sou Amaranth Avenue.
 Ankò, sa a se yon lòt rezon ki fè nou dwe fè kèk ti ajisteman nan layout sit la pou asire nou ka akomode machin nan gwosè sa a.
 Pwochen etap la pou biwo nou an se bay materyèl sa yo bay Medford Fire Marshal pou li revize ak nenpòt kòmantè adisyonèl nou ka konsidere alavni.
 Nou ka ale nan pwochen glise a.
 Mwen devine sa yo se kesyon yo, men jis bay yon mizajou sou rès pwojè sivil la, ki kounye a nou ap travay sou ak espere soumèt yon pake plan sit konplè, revize bay Medford ak nan faz tès la pou revizyon kanmarad.
 Kounye a n ap revize sèvis piblik sou plas yo ak jesyon dlo lapli.
 Nou pa atann anyen enpòtan pou rive ankò.
 Eleman sa yo diferan de pake nou te pwopoze an janvye a.
 Jis rafine li nan pwen sa a pou konfime kote tout lyen yo ta dwe sou bilding nan tèt li.
 Depi lè bilding lan te adapte ak planifye yon ti kras diferan.
 An menm tan, sit la li menm tou gen anpil pati k ap deplase, kidonk nou bezwen mete sistèm jesyon dlo lapli anba tè yo an plas pou asire w ke yo se yon distans ase ak bilding yo ak Lè sa a, nou ka fè koneksyon apwopriye ak sistèm egou nan lari yo anba.
 Sa te di, mwen pral pwobableman remèt li bay Pat, oswa ouvri li pou poze kesyon pandan n ap kontinye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2752.071s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 Pat, yon lòt bagay? Èske nou ka ouvri li? Oke, gwo.
 Se konsa, nan moman sa a, mwen pral louvri li jiska kesyon ak kòmantè nan tablo a.
 Ki moun ki vle ale an premye?
 Andre, tanpri ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2777.201s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Ekselan.
 Mèsi.
 Mèsi pou entwodiksyon an.
 Mwen t ap mande si ou ta ka eksplike yon ti kras plis sou sipozisyon ou konsènan kondisyon pakin, espesyalman alantou estidyo a ak yon chanm.
 0.68 sanble yon ti jan ba.
 Mwen konnen mwen pa yon gwo fanatik sou pakin, men mwen ta renmen konnen ki jan li kalkile?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2803.309s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, done sa yo baze sèlman sou kantite enstalasyon ki egziste deja devlope pa ITE ansanm ak kantite lòt sit.
 Plis oswa mwens klase pa kalite inite epi konnen dènye valè yo. Gade nan estidyo sis pwen uit kat yon chanm nou yo ak yon estidyo de twa kat de chanm nou an, men konpare sa yo ak sa yo, mwen vle di, ki kalite pwojè sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2845.682s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: ou konnen
 Ki gen rapò ak transpò ak lòt mòd.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2852.977s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, mwen pa panse ke li detaye.
 Mwen te kapab mennen ankèt sou sa, men mwen pa panse nivo detay ki pwoche bò kote trafik pou itilizasyon sa yo egziste nan kategori patikilye sa a.
 Mwen konnen nou te fè kèk bagay preliminè.
 Oke, Rapò pakin pafè MAPC a gen anpil done ki montre ke an jeneral, anpil nan devlopman plizyè fanmi nan zòn nan gen anpil espas pakin ki pa itilize.
 Men, mwen ka envestige nimewo sa a plis epi ba ou yon repons.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=2906.403s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 OK, nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè sou fowòm nan?
 Oke, Lè sa a, mwen ka ale nan pwochen etap la.
 Se konsa, mwen devine lè nou fè sa, mwen vle pi byen konprann
 Ki sa ki yon maj pakin rezonab konpare ak demann pakin?
 So sa ki mon konpran dan sa slide se ki lalwa i demann 361 vacancy.
 Aplikan yo te redwi pa yon modès 30 an repons a demann lan pou pwopozisyon.
 Demann espas pakin
 Li sanble 276 pou tout jounen travay la.
 Se konsa, ki sa sa a?
 Apeprè 55 pozisyon adisyonèl ki disponib.
 Nan 55 espas sa yo, mwen ta devine 11 espas siplemantè se pou depo.
 Se konsa, gen apeprè 44
 Espas tanpon, èske nimewo sa a kòrèk?
 Èske li ta dwe yon nimewo ki pi piti oswa pi gwo?
 Mwen pa gen yon bon entwisyon sou sa ki nòmal isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3007.257s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: Msye Chairman, mon kapab adres sa, oubyen mon kapab demann Scott pour peser lo bann eleman teknik.
 Pat Gallagher ak magazen, Goulston.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke nou ap eseye balanse lefèt ke sou yon bò, nou gen kondisyon kòd dekoupaj an zòn.
 Mwen vle klarifye ke nimewo 361 la se egzakteman sa pwojè sa a mande.
 Se poutèt sa, sa a pa enkli kantite espas ki nesesè pou enstalasyon depo ki rete yo.
 Se konsa, nou ap eseye balanse sa ki nesesè ki baze sou patisyon.
 Oke, sa n ap montre la a toujou mande pou yon egzanpsyon pakin.
 Pou konsepsyon ak apwobasyon pakin pataje.
 Uh, ant pwojè a ak depo adjasan a.
 Oke, men gen tou yon balans ant sa a ak enkyetid yo.
 Moun ki abite nan zòn imedya a.
 Pakin debòde pwolonje nan kominote a li menm.
 Mwen panse ke nou ap eseye jwenn yon balans isit la epi yo dwe yon ti kras konsèvatif.
 Sa a se yon bagay ke Direktè Hunter te mansyone tou lè nou te pale yè, se jis diferans ki genyen ant demann nan pik estime ke nou ap montre ak demann lan ke nou pral enkli.
 Men, mwen panse ke se sa ki tout bagay sou.
 Ou konnen sa yo se estimasyon e nou dwe pran yo an kont.
 Li ta ka pi wo pase nimewo sa a akòz tout konsiderasyon sa yo diferan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3104.82s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, mèsi, mesye Gordon. Èske gen yon lòt bagay ou ta renmen ajoute?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3110.571s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Non, mwen panse Pat byen rezime li.
 Nou te jwenn ke demann pou anpil nan inite sa yo te rive redwi
 Yo ale sou entènèt, mwens espas pakin yo rezève, epi moun ki pral ale nan lokal la ka soti nan lòt kote epi yo pa pote yon machin.
 Kòm yon rezilta, gen mwens bezwen pou transpò pèsonèl epi kidonk mwens bezwen pou espas pakin.
 Men, mwen dakò objektif la isit la se jwenn yon balans ant de la
 Ou konnen ki sa dekrè a di ak sa ki rezèv la ta dwe kòm demann endike.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3162.476s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Donk, pou nou klè, èske konte sa yo enkli 12 espas pakin nan lari ki devan bilding lan?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3174.226s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Non.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3175.247s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Briyan.
 Nan kèk ka, yo te fè referans a seri kesyon sa yo nan prezantasyon an, e nan yon ka yo pa t refere yo espesyalman men yo te soti nan yon lekti konplè TIA siplemantè a li menm.
 Oke, mwen jis vle asire w ke mwen konprann pati nan transpò piblik.
 Oke, daprè sa mwen konprann, MBTA a gen done sou kantite moun ki sèvi nan lè pik yo.
 Mwen panse ke retounen nan maten an se senaryo ki pi move.
 Kapasite se apeprè 29%.
 E sa?
 Kòmanse nan estasyon sa a oswa fini nan fen a?
 Èske li ranpli pita oswa èske tout wout la ranpli jiska 29%?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3234.424s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Yeah, donk mwen dwe retounen sou ou sou sa.
 Mwen panse ke itilizasyon maksimòm chak jou se 1256.
 Nivo kapasite a se 5,088, ki se apeprè 25% nan kapasite itilize.
 Men, mwen pral kontakte ou nan nimewo espesifik sa a.
 Mwen panse ke se sou li, men mwen pral tounen vin jwenn ou sou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3276.771s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: OK, mèsi.
 Mike, tanpri, padone m pou m poze kesyon sa a e si w ta ka klarifye.
 Wi, li ta bon pou konnen si gen yon fason
 Lè pik nan jounen an, dwa?
 Si bis yo tap kouri tout lajounen, mwen ta imajine, ou konnen, ta nan mitan lannwit yo ta prèske vid, men mwen se kirye ki kapasite a nan lè pik yo, ou konnen, yo plen nan lè pik yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3302.921s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi.
 Andre, se sa mwen vle di.
 Se konsa, gen nimewo lè pik nan rapò a,
 Mwen panse ke lè ou rive nan maten, nan lè pik, li toujou 29%.
 Men, sa a gaye nan twa otobis pa endike si kèk nan otobis yo pi plen pase lòt.
 Lè sa a, nan mitan lannwit, sou wout la tounen, mwen panse ke li te pi pre 25%.
 Wi, mwen ta renmen konnen repons lan, sitou sou wout la tounen.
 Kidonk, si nou gen rezidan ki sèvi ak transpò piblik epi bis yo plen pou kòmanse, menmsi yo vid anvan yo sispann, mwen jis vle asire ke pa gen okenn pwoblèm la.
 Ou vle di yon bagay, Scott?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3351.636s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, nan kou,
 Rive soti nan arè sa a.
 Se la nimewo pasaje yo ye.
 Ou konnen, gen anpil chèz la.
 Gen anpil plas nan otobis la pou rive nan pwen sa a.
 Yon fwa isit la, li ka refè.
 Nou gen enfòmasyon sa a.
 Nou ta ka kapab elabore kèk sòt de orè pou chak arè pasaje yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3381.533s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi.
 An jeneral, mwen renmen done, men mwen panse ke li se oke eseye kenbe done yo byen mèb jan li ye, ki jan ou antre li.
 Petèt mitan liy lan se 29%.
 Lè moun ki abite nan zòn nan, kit moun ki abite nan sit sa a oswa moun ki abite nan pwopriyete vwazen yo, yo dwe kapab avanse pou pi devan.
 Mwen panse ke konsèy la vle konnen si nou pral tounen.
 Se konsa, si ou ale nan Wellington ou pral pwobableman tounen soti nan Wellington pita.
 Si gen nenpòt pwoblèm kapasite, si mwen ta devine nan nimewo pasaje sa yo, li pwobableman pa ta dwe yon pwoblèm, men li ta bèl konnen pou asire w.
 Hey,
 An rapò, mwen panse mwen konprann tout rapò detaye isit la.
 Yo sipoze ke 13% nan vwayaj yo pwodwi yo dedye a transpò piblik.
 Mwen te gade nimewo yo e te sanble gen 12 oswa 13 moun nan moman pik yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3454.077s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, egzakteman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3463.23s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: OK
 Donk wi.
 Pi move senaryo a se si tout moun monte nan bis la, si bis la plen, men sa pa trè rezonab.
 Se konsa, wi, pran twa otobis ta dwe plezi.
 Li sanble se konsa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3474.196s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi.
 Mwen vle di, kidonk mwen panse Myrtle Street toujou estatik.
 Oke, apeprè de tyè nan wout la.
 Se konsa, ou konnen,
 Klèman, dansite popilasyon an ap ogmante pandan w ap pwoche pi pre Wellington.
 Se poutèt sa, ka gen plis pasaje k ap grenpe pi ba.
 Men, ankò, nan pwen sa a, nan pozisyon sa a, mwen konprann kesyon ou a, men nan pwen sa a, li sanble ke pral gen anpil chèz nan bis ki pral antre ak soti.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3513.648s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Gwo, mèsi.
 Lè sa a, yon seri diferan nan kesyon, jis yon klarifikasyon.
 Lè sa a, mwen te wè nan rapò a kèk ka malere nan ekipman konte kase.
 Lè sa a, gen de entèseksyon, kidonk yo itilize done ki pi gran yo.
 Mwen panse ke Central ak Pinkerton, Central ak Kenmuir.
 Wi.
 Nan entèseksyon vwazen yo, èske gen diferans enpòtan ant konte yo nan 2020 ak kounye a, oswa èske ou panse sa yo se apwoksimasyon rezonab nan nimewo aktyèl yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3550.355s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di, nou te fè, yo te yon ti kras diferan, men nou te pwofite kote ki sou chak bò nan tou de entèseksyon ak balanse volim trafik la.
 Apre sa, nou te fè ajisteman nan trafik ki t ap antre ak soti nan de lari sa yo baze sou done nou te genyen yo, mwen panse ke se te 2019 oswa 2020.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, li fè sa.
 Mwen vle di, ou konnen, li se malere, men mwen trè konfyans nan fason nou ap ajiste volim nan abòde sa a.</p>

 Nou se pwopriyetè 1022-1024 Fellsway.
 Mèsi anpil pou tan ou.
 Mèsi pou entwodiksyon ou.
 Jis yon bagay rapid.
 Dapre sa mwen konprann, evalyasyon trafik la sanble se sèlman trafik la te kaptire nan yon sèl jou.
 Petèt sa a se estanda a.
 Mwen ta renmen fè remake ke sa a se Jedi a anvan fen semèn nan jou ferye.
 Se konsa, li se pwobableman pa pi bon dosye a.
 Trafik tipik.
 Gen yon lòt kòmantè tou sou pik èdtan, ki mwen pa byen dakò ak.

 Si ou poko fè sa, ou p'ap ka pase de machin.
 Mache moute ak desann Myrtle Street, pèsonn pa sispann, pèsonn pa kite pèsonn ale.
 So, ou konnen, mon konsern se definitivman ki sa i ganny neglize.
 Ak Myrtle toujou yon sèl-side, ak Lawrence tou.
 Ou ekri kote pwen anbouteyaj sa a ye ak ki kote ou planifye pou konstwi pwopriyete sa a.
 Pou mwen, li pa vrèman pale de.
 Men, mwen vle di tou byen vit: Konpayi Davis, koute, ou te bati yon gwo pwopriyete.
 Rivyè a bèl.
 Mon konnen dan trafik assessment zot in mansyonn Encore ek Assembly.
 Mwen panse ke nou tout ka dakò sou diferans lan la.
 Li pa nan vwazinaj nenpòt nan pwopriyete sa yo.
 Trè separe.
 Ankò, bèlmè mwen te isit la pou plis pase 50 ane.
 Ou konnen, nou jis vle pwoteje kominote nou an.
 Se konsa, mèsi pou tan ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3938.629s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen jis vle asire w ke gen yon konpreyansyon pataje sou kèk nan pwen sa yo.
 Lè sa a, vini lè rush.
 Jan mwen konprann li, sa a se mezire pa konte.
 Èske sa kòrèk?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=3956.89s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, sa kòrèk.
 Se konsa, an tèm de kontinye sou pwen sa a, ou konnen, nou, nou, nou, nou konte, nou jwenn tan sa yo pik kèlkeswa kote yo rive, si yo ye, si yo se sèt a uit, si yo se sèt, 15 a uit, 15, si yo se, ou konnen, uit a uit a nèf, kèlkeswa tan ki pi wo a se, se sa nou itilize nan analiz nou an.
 Sa a, se egzakteman sa done yo montre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4005.096s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: Bon, mèsi Alison.
 Mèsi pou kesyon ou yo ak kòmantè sou prezantasyon an li menm.
 Epi, ou konnen, mwen regrèt mwen pa reponn a kòmantè espesifik sou Myrtle Street.
 Lè sa a ankò, petèt mwen te fè tou.
 Entansyon nou se agrandi Myrtle Street.
 Sa a se yon twotwa ki egziste deja 26 pye lajè ki trè etwat kòm mwen te la mwen menm ak konnen kondisyon yo ki la.
 Men, kòm yon pati nan sa, sa nou dwe fè se eseye asire w ke sa rive.
 Nou pral reyaji liy twotwa ki egziste deja sou devan pwopriyete nou an pou bay plis lajè pou pakin paralèl sou Myrtle Street epi kòm yon pati nan sa nou pral amelyore kondisyon twotwa a epi aktyèlman bay vil la kèk tè.
 Apwopriye pou tou de pyeton ak pakin nan lari.
 Se konsa, kòm yon pati nan sa, Davis pral bay tè pou elaji Myrtle Street epi reyalize pi bon sikilasyon tout moun ap chèche.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4081.991s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 Gen yon lòt faktè.
 Sa a te mansyone.
 Premyèman, yon evalyasyon siplemantè nan enpak trafik yo fèt, ki se dosye piblik.
 Li swa deja nan katab la oswa li parèt imedyatman apre reyinyon an fini.
 Lekti Tablo 6 nan rapò sa a, mwen konprann ke pandan lè rush maten nan jou lasemèn yo,
 Te gen 90 machin nèf nèt, 21 k ap antre nan estasyon an, ak 69 kite. Pandan peryòd pik apremidi a, te gen 89 machin, 55 antre nan estasyon an, ak 34 kite.
 Se konsa, olye pou yo 14, li nan 90 ak 89.
 Oke, konekte ak soti nan sit la, wi.
 OK
 Ekselan.
 Mwen panse ke sa a kouvri pwoblèm nan.
 Donk, si gen lòt manm piblik la ki ta renmen pale sou sijè sa a, tanpri fè sa.
 Oke, ann kòmanse.
 Mwen wè ou.
 Lè mwen wè Christina, mwen toujou bliye kòman yo pwononse siyati li.</p>

 Kidonk, mwen te vle ajoute yon nòt rapid nan kòmantè Alison sou etid trafik la ki te fèt avan wikenn long Jedi a.
 Nou te gen yon tanpèt nèj tou lendi semèn sa a.
 Ijans nèj, fèmti lekòl, restriksyon pakin.
 Lè sa a, nou te gen yon wikenn long e te gen yon ijans nèj semèn etid la trafik.
 Se konsa, mwen gen kèk kesyon.
 Kidonk jodi a mwen te gen chans pou m te gen tan pou m li tout dokiman 62 paj la de kouvèti rive jouk nan vant.
 Mwen gen kèk kòmantè ki ka dirèkteman gen rapò ak sa a ak prezantasyon an.
 Men, premye kesyon mwen an se, apre kolekte done yo,
 Ki jan ou te fè analiz la?
 Èske w itilize lojisyèl estatistik Minitab?
 Èske w ap itilize yon modèl simulation?
 Ki kote done yo soti pou jwenn rezilta sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4231.123s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Padon, mwen vle entèwonp, mwen vle asire w ke nou pa jwenn anbourbe nan yon konvèsasyon.
 Sa yo ta dwe kòmantè piblik.
 Christina, petèt ou ta ka lis kesyon ou yo.
 Donk, an jeneral, mwen ta planifye ke si nou pa gen enfòmasyon sa yo, definitivman nou pral mande pou li.
 Men, mwen jis te vle evite konvèsasyon an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4253.085s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: sètènman.
 Mwen pral revize li tout.
 Se konsa, sa se nimewo en.
 Dezyèmman, mwen te wè nan tou de prezantasyon PowerPoint ou jodi a ak dokiman konplè Word la ke pral gen yon nouvo òf sou pakin nan lari ak youn sou bay plis pakin nan lari.
 Èske gen yon kat mwen pa wè kote li ye oswa ki jan li sanble?
 Se konsa, si genyen
 Nouvo plan sou fason yo pral ajoute plis pakin nan lari a deja deyò yon kote, tanpri fè m 'konnen ki kote li ye pou mwen ka wè li.
 Lè sa a, dènye kesyon mwen an se: Ou mansyone nan konklizyon an ak rezime, espesyalman nan paj sèt, si w ap mande sa m ap gade, ke kòm itilizasyon endistriyèl yo elimine, pral gen mwens espas, gwo trafik, machin lou ak kamyon.
 Mwen pa wè okenn kote nan tèks rapò a kote ou fè analiz sa a.
 Natirèlman, kounye a li evidan ke ou pral debarase m de atizay mobil ak mèb Churchill, kidonk yo pa pral la ankò.
 Sepandan, lè ou ajoute 300, prèske 300 inite nan yon pwopriyete, epi mwen gen yon antre devan mwen pou machin livrezon, li difisil pou mwen kwè ke pral aktyèlman gen mwens kamyon.
 Nan katye Myrtle Street Amaranth, tou senpleman ajoute yon antre kamyon livrezon nan Myrtle Street ta elimine de biznis.
 Mwen dwe reyalize ke mwen dwe rezone, si se pa plis, omwen menm bagay la.
 E mwen pa wè kote analiz sa a fèt, pou yon deklarasyon ki di mwens.
 Men twa mwen yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4366.302s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Trè bon, gwo.
 Mwen pran nòt.
 Mwen te vle asire nou pa manke anyen.
 Tout se byen.
 Se konsa, mwen devine mwen ka pale sou dezyèm kesyon an.
 Mwen panse ke sa nou wè kounye a reprezante pakin nan lari.
 Se konsa, mwen konnen li pa fasil pou rale sou bagay vizib sa a.
 Men, si w gade amaranth ak jasmen,
 Lè yo mete ti moso vèt sa yo, yo aktyèlman separe kèk nan espas pakin yo ak lari ki sitiye nan pwopriyete a epi sèvi pou elaji espas la.
 Li ta tankou, mwen pa sonje separasyon ki genyen ant Amaranth ak Myrtle, men li nan foto a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4407.723s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: Wi, mesye Prezidan.
 Pran yon gade pi pre nan lari sa a.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, ankò mwen panse
 Travay sou rediksyon twotwa yo ak kreye nouvo espas nan laj lari yo.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon angajman trè inik pou ekip sa a ak yon bagay mwen pa janm rankontre nan yon pwojè tankou sa a.
 Mwen panse ke li enpòtan pou rekonèt ke sa a se yon konsesyon reyèl ekip la ap fè nan kominote a.
 Yo te akòde yon servitud pou pakin nan.
 Rezilta a pou Myrtle se te gen apeprè, Bill Lucas ka pale plis sou sa, men gen apeprè menm kantite espas ak jodi a.
 Fason li fè se paske li fèmen yon twotwa ki trè gwo nan kwen an.
 Lè sa a, yo te ajoute yon nouvo pakin sou Amaranth Avenue ki pa egziste kounye a.
 Epi li nan tout destine yo vin pakin piblik.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4480.586s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Oke, kidonk pou moun ki abite Myrtle Street nan Amaranth, sa pa yon garanti.
 OK, mèsi pou klarifikasyon an.
 Kòm rezilta, nou p ap bay rezidan zòn Myrtle espas pakin ankò.
 Sa a tou senpleman ajoute yon nouvo pakin.
 Mwen wè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4495.718s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: OK
 Wi.
 Mwen konprann règ yo pou itilize espas sa a pral gouvène pa Òdonans Medford.
 Epi li konplike paske se pwopriyete prive.
 Kidonk mwen pa pral pran pòz mwen konnen detay yo.
 Men, kounye a mwen entèprete yo kòm espas ki disponib pou nenpòt moun ki nan zòn nan ki gen dwa pakin nan lari sa yo.
 Avoka Gallagher, pa vre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4525.355s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: se vre.
 Ankò, entansyon an se pou li vin yon pakin piblik.
 Yo ka rezidan nan katye a oswa vizitè nan pwojè a.
 Sa a se entansyon aktyèl la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4539.667s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: bon mèsi.
 Kounye a, de lòt kesyon yo, mwen panse ke yo tou de se kesyon Scott.
 Lè sa a, gen kesyon an sou lojisyèl estatistik oswa lojisyèl ki itilize pou jenere rapò sa yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4552.693s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, done konte yo trete epi balanse.
 Parey mon’n mansyonnen, nou regard bann peak hours, trafik dan peak hours, e nou fer analiz trafik spesifik.
 Li se yon modèl analiz stochastic yo itilize nan endistri.
 Epi li se yon pake estanda, youn nan pakè ajans sansi leta yo mande yo.
 Itilizasyon li se byen gaye nan mitan konsiltan nan endistri an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4601.04s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: bon mèsi.
 Kesyon final la gen rapò ak konte machin lou ak kamyon.
 Se konsa, mwen te eseye fè yon rechèch mo kle nan dokiman an tèt mwen.
 Mwen pa konnen si anyen nan sipleman an diskite sou sa a pi lwen pase deklarasyon an nan konklizyon an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4621.971s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Yeah, non, mwen panse ke li se plis nan yon callback nan operasyon yo nou te wè la, kote nou te wè kamyon ap kondwi nan pakin nan.
 Mwen panse ke machin livrezon, machin Amazon, UPS, konpayi livrezon, machin sa yo toupatou kounye a.
 Mwen panse ke metòd livrezon an se rejyon espesifik ak gen plis chans
 Yo ka deja la.
 Anpil machin livrezon ka deja nan lari nan katye ki antoure kote a.
 Nou panse ke yon fwa devlopman an fini, yo pral ale nan sit entènèt la olye pou yo navige sou sit wèb la tankou kèk nan yo fè.
 Men, mwen pa konnen si yo aktyèlman reprezante yon adisyon nan enstalasyon ki egziste toupre.
 Sepandan mwen panse ke lè nou elimine kèk nan itilizasyon endistriyèl ki egziste la, gwo machin sa yo p ap gen aksè a sit la ankò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4713.671s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Bon, èske w janm panse pou w klarifye lang w ap pale a?
 Machin lou ak kamyon, eksepte machin livrezon.
 Paske lè mwen wè kamyon an, mwen di mwen mete nan machin livrezon an.
 Se poutèt sa mwen te panse mwen ta klarifye pasaj sa a pou evite plis konfizyon.
 Men, ou te diskite tou ak UPS, FedEx, ak DHL pwojeksyon yo sou konbyen li ta koute
 Ogmantasyon ou pral.
 Se konsa, si ou pale sou chèn ekipman ak fason yo detèmine wout yo, yo fè li pa rejyon ki baze sou modèl ak konbyen lajan yo delivre nan yon rejyon an patikilye nan yon moman patikilye.
 Se konsa, si ou gen prèske 300 inite, prèske 300 moun, gen pwobableman plis pase yon kamyon.
 Ak UPS, mwen espesyalman konnen ke yo bato plis pase yon kamyon pa jou.
 Se konsa, èske ou janm etidye prensip rechèch operasyon konsènan koule?
 Ideyal pou kamyon ki bezwen transpòte plis kago.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4772.401s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Nou pa diskite sou okenn prensip rechèch operasyonèl pou machin livrezon yo.
 Sa a se yon ti jan pi lwen pase sijè ki abòde lan nan etid trafik estanda.
 Men, mwen vle di, si vil la ak konsiltan yo revizyon parèy yo di sa a se yon bagay nou bezwen revize, nou ka travay pou fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4800.84s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi, mon lentansyon ziska prezan se ki sa board i annan bann konsiltan peer review pou fer sa.
 Revize sa anpirik epi revize rapò sa yo.
 Kidonk, Konsèy la sètènman gen entansyon konsidere kòmantè ak demann piblik la ansanm ak konsèy ekspè nan konsiltan revizyon parèy yo.
 Alor mon pe dir en sigjesyon, pa en egzijans, me an zeneral mon krwar dan prensip ki sa rapor final pa devret fer bann deklarasyon ki pa ganny siporte par serten dimoun.
 tab oswa done la.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke petèt konklizyon an ta dwe fè li trè klè poukisa nou panse ke sa a se ka a, oswa petèt jis pa mansyone sa a espesyalman.
 Me konsernan posibilite pour fer plis analiz, mon krwar sa board i annan lentansyon pour tann feedback peer review e pran en desizyon a sa moman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=4873.717s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Bonjou tout moun, non mwen se Cuisine Japonè.
 Mwen se pwopriyetè a epi mwen abite lòtbò lari a nan 1 26128 Myrtle Street.
 Nan imaj sa a, nouvo ouvèti a oswa antre prensipal nan bilding lan.
 Mwen gen yon pèspektiv inik tou paske mwen viv tanporèman nan RE150 nan Medford, ke mwen konsidere kòm yon devlopman ki sanble ak zòn yo pwopoze a.
 Mwen panse mwen gen pwòp pèspektiv inik mwen
 Trafik, livrezon, tout sa k ap pase pandan rezidan yo ap antre ak soti nan bilding lan.
 Mwen devine mwen pral kòmanse ak premye kòmantè mwen an, Vire.
 Pou egzanp, rapò a nan machin ak bisiklèt, mwen pa panse se ka a.
 Ou konnen, totalman rezonab.
 Mwen konnen.
 Tout moun ap eseye ajoute bisiklèt ak ogmante kapasite, men, ou konnen, jodi a nou gade, pa gen okenn siklis nenpòt kote.
 Oke, omwen mwatye nan yon ane.
 OK?
 Se konsa, um.
 Mwen vle wè si nimewo sa a ta dwe redwi kèk.
 Mwen gen yon kesyon tou sou konte kantite.
 Vwayaj siplemantè oswa enpak pou chofè andedan bilding nan, pa vre?
 Èske done yo reprezante sèlman rezidan yo ki jenere vwayaj, oswa èske li pran an kont konsyèn, moun k ap fè livrezon manje, Ubers, pakè ak vizitè yo, tout moun ki pral fè vwayaj tou nan bilding lan?
 Ou konnen, k ap viv nan 150, ak livrezon manje, pickup Uber, ak livrezon pakè 24 èdtan.
 Amazon vini isit la kat, senk, sis fwa pa jou.
 Menm bagay la tou ale pou UPS ak FedEx.
 Se konsa, li pa jis livrezon yon sèl jou.
 Ou konnen, livrezon yo kontinye ap vini.
 Kamyon ak moun vini e ale soti isit la.
 Yo pa rete lontan. Moun yo gen 1 ane lwaye.
 Yo vini e yo ale.
 Se konsa, kamyon k ap deplase yo toujou ap vini ak ale, epi li dirèk.
 Mwen panse.
 Oke, dwat devan pwopoze a nouvo antre.
 Mwen ta renmen wè done ki enpòtan.
 Ki kantite vòl k ap rantre ak vòl pou chak èdtan?
 Lari sa a se antre, pa vre?
 Poukisa.
 Kounye a li nan 0, mwen kapab, mwen ka viv lòtbò lari a, mwen ka viv lakay mwen epi mwen pa bezwen enkyete sou yon machin.
 Anndan ak deyò lakay mwen, sitou paske, ou konnen, mwen konnen w ap ajoute pak, pakin lari, lajè lari.
 De lari liy ak vire agòch ak dwa pa nesesèman adekwat, sa depann de jan moun kondwi, sitou si yo se kamyon oswa chofè san eksperyans oswa moun ki prese paske yo dwe delivre manje oswa livre yon moun, pa vre?
 Yo pa nesesèman ap viv la.
 Se konsa, mwen te trè enkyete sou pwen antre sa a epi yo pa t 'pale avè l'.
 Ou konnen, ou mansyone 80 vwayaj, 90 vwayaj.
 Lè w antre ak soti nan pidevan a pandan lè gwo, sepandan.
 Konbyen li koute pou chak èdtan ak pou tout jounen an?
 Mwen panse ke kantite vwayaj yo te monte nenpòt kote soti nan 0 a 90 fwa.
 Ou konnen, um, tout tan an deyò sa a, sa, kote sa a, sa, sa, sa, antre sa a, pa gen anyen ki egziste kounye a.
 Se konsa, sa se pi gwo enkyetid mwen an, ou konnen, gen yon antre dirèk devan kay mwen an.
 Oke lè sa a.
 Se tout sa mwen gen pou di.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5123.054s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 Wi.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke, nan rapò a detaye, gen kèk pwojeksyon pou inite yo tèt yo.
 Bon, mwen pral mande Scott pou revize li pou mwen, men mwen panse ke li nan nèf, dis, ak onz, wi, mwen panse ke li nan nèf, dis, ak onz.
 Wi.
 Egzakteman.
 Wi.
 Apre sa, um,
 Si mwen byen konprann, mwen kwè Mesye Chow se sou C drive nan sit la, ki estime a 5% nan kapasite a, oswa 10% nan total.
 Kidonk, 5% ale goch ak 5% ale dwat.
 Sa a se kite ak Lè sa a, antre.
 Epitou 5%.

 Èske mwen li sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5190.935s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, wi, se vre.
 Mwen vle di, pi fò nan vwayaj la espere sèvi ak aksè Fellsway ak Fellsway, yon ti pòsyon pral sèvi ak Amaranth la, ak objektif vizit Myrtle la se reyèlman jwenn yon ti kras.
 Pwojè koule, men wi, li travay.
 Li sanble ke li te rive nan yon sèl jou.
 50 vwayaj k ap vini, 50 vwayaj plis pou ale.

 Padon, èske mwen ka fè sa?
 Mande klarifikasyon sou sipozisyon sa a.
 Wi, mwen panse sa.
 Nou sanble yo dwe asepte ke 10% nan vwayaj soti nan sa a.
 Sa, um, mwen te panse, uh, sa a enteresan.
 Ou te kite pandan vwayaj ou, pa vre?
 Wi, mwen pa sèten.
 Poukisa 10%?
 Poukisa li ta dwe 10%?
 Mwen vle di, si sa a se antre prensipal la.
 Mwen panse ke 60-70% moun ap sispann.
 Pou moun k ap kondwi, fason ki pi fasil ak pi pratik pou rive nan bilding lan se travèse Myrtle Street epi ale nan direksyon sòti sa a.
 Se pa fason Phils la.
 Ou antre nan lari a fè fas a Fells Way nan zòn nan.
 Mwen vle di, antre nan bilding lan, si mwen soti nan lwès la,
 Lè li pa vini, li antre nan bilding nan devan kay mwen an.
 Mwen pa ta ale, mwen pa ta ale nan dèyè bilding lan, epi mwen pa ta ale nan Fellsway nan direksyon sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen vle di, 10% pa sanble trè rezonab.
 Omwen 33% nan tan an, e mwen panse ke li se yon anpil plis, paske poukisa kondwi nan dèyè bilding lan lè ou ka kondwi nan devan an?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5329.225s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Se konsa, si mwen byen konprann,
 Ou gen moun sou Fellsway ki pral nan nò paske yo pa ka jwenn aksè nan antre nan Fellsway epi ou di wi, obsèvasyon ou se ke yo ta itilize Myrtle Street, pa vre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5352.307s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di fason moun ap antre nan zòn nan kounye a se anpil trafik ki soti nan lwès la.
 Se konsa, anba a, mwen panse ke se Lawrence Street, oswa yo ale atravè lari sa a.
 Si yon moun se,
 Nan nò vil la, kote yo pral ale.
 Sa a se antre a epi ale nan lwès.
 Si yo vini epi yo ale lakay yo, yo soti nan lwès la.
 sou Route 93 paske li fè li pi fasil pou pase nan lari bò sa yo.
 Pou konbat trafik k ap vini sou Fells Road.
 Mwen imajine si ou te la nan lè rush ou ta wè konbyen machin ap monte desann ale sa yo pou evite Fellsway kòm ou ta dwe bloke fè U-vire oswa lòt detou.
 Li pi fasil pou mache nan nò ale nan sid oswa nan lwès pase pou swiv Fellsway nan nenpòt direksyon.
 Mwen wè.</p>

 Lè sa a, mwen te revize nòt mwen yo tou e mwen bliye mande si jenerasyon vwayaj la pran machin livrezon an kont.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5445.82s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: sètènman.
 Se poutèt sa, li enpòtan sonje
 Aksè nan garaj la se ke gen yon pasaj nan Amaranth la ak Lè sa a, gen yon lòt pasaj nan antre sa a.
 Wi, ou ka wè egzakteman ki kote Pat ye.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, nou espere kèk trafik vini ak ale.
 Vwayaje nan lwès epi rive soti nan lwès la, nou kwè trafik gen plis chans pou yo itilize pwen aksè Amaranto olye ke pwen aksè Myrtle Street la paske
 Ou konnen, vizit Myrtle a aktyèlman fèt pou, ou konnen, pa rezidan yo.
 Li se yon zòn pou touris.
 pou fè livrezon sa yo.
 Li vrèman se pa yon chemen fasil soti nan Myrtle, alantou wonn nan enteryè, pase ranje yo ak Lè sa a, nan papòt la.
 Si ou deja soti nan lwès la, mwen panse ke ou gen plis chans chwazi yo sèvi ak otspo Amaranth la.
 Kidonk, trafik sou Fellsway ka itilize pwen aksè Fellsway sa a.
 Sa a se kote rès trafik pwojè a ale
 Vini non.
 Kòm pou lòt kesyon Mesye Zhou a, monte bisiklèt, mwen panse, se yon eleman relativman ti nan vwayaj.
 Ankò, fondamantalman, si ou gade nan done ki egziste deja,
 transpò, mache ak travay nan kay ak lòt mòd moun itilize, ki reprezante apeprè
 San yo pa pran an kont pwopòsyon an nan bisiklèt, li sanble kont pou anviwon 30% nan itilizasyon.
 Se poutèt sa, nou te sipoze ke 77% nan vwayaj yo se pa machin.
 Se poutèt sa, sa a se deja yon sipozisyon konsèvatif.
 Si nou fè bak,
 Si nou retire 5% pousantaj bisiklèt la epi travay nan kay tankou nan done resansman an, epi sèvi ak mòd transpò lòt moun tankou nan done resansman an, nou ta sèlman sèvi ak 70% nan trafik ki afekte nan vwayaj machin.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke li deja yon sipozisyon konsèvatif nan sans sa a.
 Vwayaj kalkile oswa pwojte yo enkli tout itilizatè paske yo se vwayaj vizit sit.
 Se konsa, yo gen ladan machin livrezon, ki gen ladan kamyon fatra, men tou, vwayaj la lakay ou.
 Ou konnen, mwen konprann ke moun vini epi ale.
 Nan konplèks la, ou konnen, se li, yo ap deplase kamyon ak sa yo se bagay ke nou kontinye gade nan plan yo sit ak evalye yo.
 Kalite kesyon sa yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5704.542s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mr Chairman silvouple permet mwan remersye ou.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5711.503s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: Mwen jis te vle ajoute yon ti kras nan sa Scott te di, jan Pat mansyone, nou te gen yon reyinyon trè pwodiktif ak ekip tès la yè.
 Nan kad sa a, nou te diskite sou mezi TDM ak lòt estrateji ke nou ka itilize pou diminye enpak vwayaj adisyonèl ke n ap diskite a.
 Mwen panse ke pandan n ap avanse, mwen konnen beta a toujou anba revizyon.
 epi yo pral bay kòmantè alekri.
 Sepandan, nou ta sètènman konsidere mezi tankou kalme trafik kòm yon fason pou ankouraje vwayaj nan yon sèten direksyon, tankou Fellsway, pa egzanp.
 Se konsa, sa yo se kalite bagay sa yo ke nou te pale sou ke nou ap definitivman pral gade, epi nou pral gade nan beta a ak rekòmandasyon konsèy la sou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5761.856s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Si 5% nan vwayaj yo soti nan antre sa a, èske li toujou nesesè?
 Èske fèmen antre sa a opsyonèl?
 Si ou di 5% nan vwayaj soti nan la, li sanble tankou yon resous initil pou bilding nan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5781.484s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mwen konprann ke sa a te orijinèlman te ajoute kòm yon metòd livrezon men li pa t '
 Uh, konte sou, um, lòt antre, ki ta toupre devan bilding lan epi, um, mwen panse ke petèt yon pati nan pakin biwo lokasyon an oswa yon bagay tankou sa yo te pwopoze la.
 Sa chanje yon ti jan kounye a paske mwen te panse se konsa kamyon ponpye ki nan direksyon nò a te dwe antre

 OK
 Scott, yon pwen final ki bezwen klarifikasyon.
 Kidonk, rezidan ki nan nò Fellsway ki vle sèvi ak antre Fellsway yo pral vire nan nò kote sa a epi yo desann.
 se konsa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5839.375s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, nou konnen li anboutey, men li toujou sanble yon pi bon opsyon pase trafik la ki vle vire agoch ​​epi desann nan mitan an.
 Nou espere pral gen kèk trafik ki fè sa, men reta ki asosye ak kalite mouvman sa a ka pi gran pase reta yo retounen.
 nou gen kèk trafik
 Yon fwa ankò, koule sa yo soti nan lwès la, ak kèk soti nan Riverside ak Santral, kèk soti nan Amaranth ak pifò soti nan Fells Way.
 Akòz kote Fells Way ak nati aksè a, yo pral vire trafik nan tou de entèseksyon yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5919.241s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Jaime, ou gen kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5922.274s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ke nan dènye reyinyon an mwen te pote pwoblèm nan nan retounen ak kondwi nan zòn nan.
 Mwen vle di, reyèlman, opsyon yo pou monte Fellsway se ale nan junction a, vire toutotou, monte Fellsway, ale nan antre nan Fellsway, ale nan junction a, vire agoch, desann Kenmare, oswa petèt kèk moun ka chwazi monte Fellsway rive Riverside, ale bò Riverside, monte.
 Spring Street, Lè sa a, Lawrence Street.
 Men, mwen panse ke li pi konplike pase ale nan Fellsway.
 Mwen panse ke sa a gen mwens chans rive.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=5964.428s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mwen wè.
 Oke, mèsi.

 Èske gen nenpòt lòt moun nan piblik la ki vle pale oswa èske sa a jis yon inatandi unmute?
 Wi, mwen panse se te yon aksidan an silans.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6086.44s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Èske te gen okenn diskisyon nan moman an sou posiblite pou amelyore sa a?
 Paske mwen te sonje ke liy retounen an te kapab long, e mwen te rekonèt ke sa a te deja yon move entèseksyon epi li pa t nesesèman pral vin pi bon.
 Men, èske li te diskite? Èske w ka diskite sou lòt devlopman ki pafwa amelyore lari ki antoure yo nan diferan fason?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6322.029s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Oke, gwo.

 Lòt kesyon kòmantè mwen an se:
 Mon santi Plan Management Demand Transport i enpe feb.
 Mwen ta renmen wè kèk kalite ankourajman adisyonèl pou motive rezidan ou yo pou yo itilize sistèm transpò piblik la pou nou ka ale pi lwen pase kantite vwayaj pataj sou transpò piblik.
 Mwen t ap mande si ou ta ka mete kèk panse kreyatif nan sa a si li vle di
 Ou konnen, ede rezidan yo jwenn pas sibvansyone oswa pas sibvansyone tèt yo oswa bagay konsa.
 Mwen sèten gen kèk lide kreyatif deyò.
 Mwen pa yon ekspè nan domèn sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6375.676s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: Mwen panse ke nou te pote sa a yè nan konvèsasyon nou an ak Direktè Beta ak Hunter.

 Mwen pral mete bokit sa la tou, ou konnen, nou trè enterese nan eseye bati yon estasyon bisiklèt ble.

 Kwonolojikman, dapre enfòmasyon ak diskisyon ou te fè jodi a, ki lè ou panse nou pral jwenn plis detay sou lèt revizyon parèy yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6465.702s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Bonswa Msye Chairman, manm Konsèy Administrasyon.
 Wi, nou te fè yon premye lekti nan rapò a.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, kounye a mwen te idantifye plis enfòmasyon, klarifikasyon ak bagay konsa.
 Men, nou pa t egzamine kalkil yo an pwofondè, ou konnen, apendis, ki kalite enfòmasyon.
 Epi, ou konnen, nan pwomnad, nou te oblije ale deyò epi obsève.
 Kondisyon trafik yo, pran kèk mezi.
 Ou konnen, nou toujou nan kèk semèn ale.
 Mwen panse.
 Mwen aktyèlman ale nan vakans semèn pwochèn, kidonk li se yon semèn mouri.
 Se konsa, petèt nan kèk semèn, nou jis bezwen kèk tan fè youn.
 Ou konnen, yon revizyon konplè.
 Nou te fè yon bon diskisyon yè e konseye yo te soulve anpil pwoblèm, tankou pakin ak TDM ke Andre jis mansyone, ak premye reyaksyon nou yo oswa enkyetid yo se menm bagay la.
 Nou deja konnen yon bagay sou sa, men nou dwe antre nan detay yo, ki pral pran plis tan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6551.084s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, wi, mèsi pou aktyalizasyon a.
 Se konsa, mwen konnen se paske
 Nan lòd yo prezante bagay yo, nou pa swiv delè orijinal la nan okenn fason.
 Men, mwen panse ke entansyon orijinal la se te fini sa nou poko fini.
 Kidonk, pwochen bagay komite a ta renmen wè se yon plan bilding aktyalize.
 Apre sa, mwen panse ke depreferans nan pwochen reyinyon an nou pral revize ajou jeni ak plan transpòtasyon yo ak kòmantè revizyon parèy yo.
 Pou nou klè, pwochen odyans nou an pwograme pou madi 26 mas, mwens pase de semèn nan kounye a.
 Se konsa, sa a se plas la

 Ou panse nou ka kenbe?
 Oswa kisa nou ta dwe fè nan pwochen odyans lan?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6642.127s">[Patrick Gallagher]</a>: Mèsi Mesye Prezidan. Mwen panse ke nou dakò ak apwòch sa a.
 Kounye a nou espere bay Vil la, Konsèy la ak evalyatè nou yo nan Davis Square yon pake bilding ajou.
 Mwen panse ke pita nan semèn sa a oswa kòmansman semèn pwochèn, objektif la se gen yon reyinyon swivi ak evalyatè nou yo semèn pwochèn epi yo dwe kapab prezante sa a nan pwochen odyans lan sou 26th la.
 Um, epi answit nan pwochen odyans lan le 11 avril.
 Mwen dakò, osi lontan ke vèsyon beta a gen yon chans bay fidbak, nou ka definitivman diskite sou li.
 Analiz anbake ak plis detay.
 Mwen devine mwen ta ajoute tou ke mwen ka remèt li bay Bill Lucas, men mwen panse ke nou pral kapab gen yon diskisyon pi apwofondi sou seri sivil ki pi nouvo an.
 Ou konnen, si nou pa nesesèman gen yon soumisyon ekri, omwen nou ka soumèt yon plan sivil konplè le 11 avril.
 Bill, èske m ap pale pa vire, oswa èske sa kòrèk?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000646&t=6714.468s">[Bill Lucas]</a>: Sa w di a pa t pa apwopriye.
 se vre.
 Plan nou an se bay yon seri desen sivil aktyalize nan fen semèn pwochèn.
