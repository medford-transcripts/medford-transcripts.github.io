[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Mary Lee is absent.

12
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:28,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I see we have Chris D'Avetta who just joined.

13
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris is one of our associate members.

14
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,209
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not voting in this case.

15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,351
[SPEAKER_05]: He was appointed after it started, but welcome, Chris.

16
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mike Caldera, present.

17
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:40,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a quorum.

18
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:42,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get started.

19
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:43,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, can you please kick us off, please?

20
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:55,830
[SPEAKER_08]: On March 2920 23 governor Haley signed into law, a supplemental budget bill which among other things extends to temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting on March 31st 2025.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:06,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Typically this further extension allows public bodies to holding meetings remotely got a call the public body physically present at the location and read adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

22
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:16,223
[SPEAKER_08]: The language is not any substantive change to the Open Meeting Law, other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

23
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:16,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

24
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:20,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And can you read the first matter?

25
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:27,030
[SPEAKER_08]: 970 Felsway, case number 40B-2023-01.

26
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:36,937
[SPEAKER_08]: The resumption of consideration of the petition of DIV Felsway LLC, the Davis Company, is for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40B.

27
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:45,215
[SPEAKER_08]: for multifamily six-story apartment development located in approximately 3.4 acres of land at 970 Felsway, property ID 7-02-10.

28
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:58,180
[SPEAKER_08]: This proposal will be developed as an approximately 289 units, consisting of 278 units of multifamily housing and 11 townhomes, with 73, 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low- or moderate-income households.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,522
[SPEAKER_08]: This hearing will include a discussion on the traffic impact assessment, including the recent supplement.

30
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dennis.

31
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:06,835
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, folks.

32
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those unaware, this is a multi-session hearing.

33
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:13,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had multiple meetings to date.

34
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: The focus today is the applicant intends to present an update to the transportation impact assessment.

35
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:26,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that will be the focus of today's meeting.

36
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:33,029
[SPEAKER_05]: We will take public comment on transportation in this meeting at the appropriate time.

37
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:36,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And this will not be the last meeting either.

38
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:41,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be a number of other sessions to address other aspects of the project.

39
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:46,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I see we have Mr. Pat Noon for the applicant.

40
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:47,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

41
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Chair, members of the board, thank you for having us this evening.

43
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to confirm, can everyone hear me?

44
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,460
[SPEAKER_09]: We can, yes.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

46
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:08,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I will ask Pat Gallagher, if you don't mind, if you could bring up the presentation.

47
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis, could you allow me to share, please?

48
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:15,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

49
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:18,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

50
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,801
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, thank you members of the board for hearing us this evening.

51
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:36,048
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you again for granting the continuance from the hearing on February 27th to this evening to have a proper discussion on traffic.

52
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,970
[SPEAKER_09]: We are looking forward to presenting this evening.

53
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:47,355
[SPEAKER_09]: As we get into the next slide and just I'll do a quick kickoff and introduction here.

54
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:53,680
[SPEAKER_09]: just orienting everyone to the team that's on the call this evening.

55
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:58,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself and Mike Cantalupa from the Davis Companies are here.

56
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:02,727
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Bill Lucas from Bowler.

57
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,949
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Scott Thornton from Van Ness.

58
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,512
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be presenting on civil and traffic, respectively.

59
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:12,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have Pat Gallagher, as I mentioned, from Wilson.

60
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:16,197
[SPEAKER_09]: He is representing the legal team this evening.

61
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Attorney Tam could not

62
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:26,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, be here, so just making everybody aware as I don't believe Mr Gallagher has spoken publicly prior to this evening.

63
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:36,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so just quick agenda, um, recapping, uh, some progress from the, from the previous, um, formal hearing.

64
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:44,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, uh, we have, uh, at the outset of that meeting, um, where site plan was discussed, um, pretty thoroughly.

65
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:51,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we have continued to work on that, um, and improving that and moving that design forward.

66
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:54,338
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll hear, um, some about that in the, um,

67
00:04:55,238 --> 00:05:00,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Civil design section of the presentation this evening from Bill Lucas from Bowler.

68
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:10,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a part of that, we have had an initial kickoff peer review session with the civil team from beta.

69
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:19,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we look forward to continuing those discussions, but are continuing to make progress here and happy to be presenting some updates there.

70
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:35,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, with the main topic this evening being traffic since our last hearing, we were able to finalize our TIA and formally submit that we held a kickoff session with the peer review team from beta on traffic as well this week.

71
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:39,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So have advanced those conversations.

72
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:44,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And look forward to continuing to do so, and obviously presenting the material this evening.

73
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:53,551
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, in the background, we have continued to move forward on the architectural side of things, advancing the design there and have.

74
00:05:55,272 --> 00:06:05,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Started the conversation for setting up a follow up peer review session with Mr bomber from Davis square and members of planning staff.

75
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:15,329
[SPEAKER_09]: So feel like we are continuing to move forward on all fronts of the design and coordinating with staff and and the peer review team.

76
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:15,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

77
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:24,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a quick update there for everybody, since it has been several weeks since since we last met, I won't get into all the bullet points here.

78
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:31,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let Scott really do the talking on the on the, but obviously just our general agenda for this evening is to have.

79
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:39,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Scott Thornton discussed the methodology and the findings from the study that Vanessa performed.

80
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:52,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Mr. Chair, as was discussed at the continuance request hearing, if time permits, we can have as deep of a discussion on civil as possible.

81
00:06:53,185 --> 00:07:00,428
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be able to do, as I mentioned, some site plan updates, discuss some of the parking demand information that we were able to provide.

82
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:04,511
[SPEAKER_09]: and a truck and emergency vehicle circulation update there.

83
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:08,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are ready to present.

84
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:15,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I will turn it over to Scott Thornton to, oh, sorry, before I do that, just recapping the public process.

85
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:27,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I touched on some of this already, and I won't go through these bullet by bullet, but just noting since the last hearing, we have advanced with

86
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:33,770
[SPEAKER_09]: The peer review sessions with data on civil and traffic, and we'll continue to do that and continue to track them here.

87
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody is aware of of the meetings that are that are taking place and the conversations that are ongoing.

88
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:43,115
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with that, I will now turn it over to Scott.

89
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you very much.

90
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Pat.

91
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chairman members of the board for the record.

92
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,619
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Scott Thornton with Vanessa associates.

93
00:07:52,699 --> 00:08:00,050
[SPEAKER_07]: We prepared the traffic assessment for the projects working with the Davis companies, bowler and cube 3 studios.

94
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:14,446
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that the TIA, just as an initial statement, we think that the TIA shows that the project can be accommodated by the road network and the street system.

95
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:19,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will get into the reasons why during my presentation.

96
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:25,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But as noted, we're calling this a supplemental traffic study.

97
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:36,086
[SPEAKER_07]: The initial TIA was submitted in November of last year, and that was a study that had been prepared previously with older data.

98
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:52,854
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that while the findings are generally consistent between the two documents, we understand that with passage of time, the study required an update.

99
00:08:53,414 --> 00:09:00,896
[SPEAKER_07]: The scope for that document, the initial TIA was determined with the director of traffic and transportation for the city.

100
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:04,357
[SPEAKER_07]: This supplemental TIA used the same scope.

101
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:15,059
[SPEAKER_07]: We left the supplemental TIA as a draft because we know that city staff will review the document.

102
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:22,581
[SPEAKER_07]: As Pat mentioned, we've had an initial meeting with BETA, the city's peer reviewer.

103
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:28,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So we anticipate there may be some changes to the TIA before it becomes

104
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:36,550
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of memorialized as a completely final document and ready for the file.

105
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:44,079
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Supplemental TIA was based on the revised site plan that was presented last month.

106
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,844
[SPEAKER_07]: The TIA was submitted on March 5th.

107
00:09:50,517 --> 00:10:00,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So the supplemental TIA reviewed impacts during the critical weekday morning and weekday evening time periods, looking at 14 intersections in the study area.

108
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll get into the explanation of that in a minute.

109
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:17,055
[SPEAKER_07]: TIA considered the transit, pedestrian, bicycle facilities, as well as vehicle impacts and safety considerations in the identification of impacts for the project.

110
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:23,695
[SPEAKER_07]: The next slide shows the site in context to the study area.

111
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:32,119
[SPEAKER_07]: As I mentioned, 14 intersections in total, four signalized intersections really on the corners of the study area, a couple

112
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:40,003
[SPEAKER_07]: intersections with Felsway, a couple intersections with Spring Street that are the signalized locations.

113
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:48,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have 10 un-signalized intersections located on the periphery of the site and also in the neighborhood.

114
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:54,310
[SPEAKER_07]: We did an extensive field inventory out in the study area.

115
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:58,813
[SPEAKER_07]: We noted that all streets have sidewalks on both sides.

116
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:04,015
[SPEAKER_07]: There's generally parking on one or both sides of the streets in the neighborhood.

117
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:22,492
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of facilities, we noted that DCR modified the Fellsway with bike lanes on each side and last year put in curb extensions at the Myrtle Street intersection.

118
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:36,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We conducted traffic counts in January between the hours of 7 and 9 in the morning weekday and 4 to 6 p.m.

119
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:39,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were done on January 11th, which was a Thursday.

120
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:48,552
[SPEAKER_07]: We would expect that, you know, we try to do those counts for weekday time periods between Tuesday and Thursday.

121
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:53,596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's generally when traffic is consistent at a consistent level.

122
00:11:55,498 --> 00:12:02,544
[SPEAKER_07]: In general, the peak hours start in the morning around 7.45, go from 7.45 to 8.45.

123
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:13,774
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few outliers, some start at 7, some start at 7.15, but in general, that's about the time period for the morning.

124
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:19,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And in general, in the evening, the peak hour time period occurs between 5 and 6.

125
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:30,465
[SPEAKER_07]: We adjusted the volumes to raise them to the average month conditions, which is consistent with MassDOT standards.

126
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:35,229
[SPEAKER_07]: We counted pedestrians, bicycles, buses, trucks, and vehicles.

127
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:44,155
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually separate exhibits in the TIA depicting the pedestrians and bicycle movements that were observed at each intersection.

128
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:51,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And on average, there's between 10 and 20 pedestrians during the peak hours at each location.

129
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:54,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Some locations have a little more.

130
00:12:54,446 --> 00:13:01,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the intersection of Riverside with Felsway actually has a few more.

131
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:01,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the 20 to 35.

132
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:09,402
[SPEAKER_07]: pedestrians range during the peak hour.

133
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:18,629
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of bicycles, there's not a lot of bicycle usage that showed up in the counts.

134
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:31,720
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, January, although it hasn't been a typical January, we would expect that those bicycle volumes to increase during the more seasonal months.

135
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:45,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next slide, we start to get into some of the detail with regard to the transit availability.

136
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:57,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I know in one of the meetings, ZBA members were curious to know the status of the 100 bus, which stops really right in front of the site at Myrtle Street.

137
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:03,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So this slide shows the public transportation availability in the area.

138
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:21,132
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the 100 bus, there's the 108, there's the 101, the 134, but 100 really is the one that stops, that would most likely see the majority of usage from the project residents.

139
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:30,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Wellington Station and Malden Center are each about 1.4 miles, about a 30 minute walk from the site.

140
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:42,179
[SPEAKER_07]: So we think that usage would really focus around the 100 bus to get to Wellington Station or other locations.

141
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:49,759
[SPEAKER_07]: We requested and received data from the MBTA on the ridership.

142
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:57,542
[SPEAKER_07]: They've really improved their ridership survey information and program.

143
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:05,986
[SPEAKER_07]: 100Bus has 42 trips per direction on a daily basis between 5 a.m.

144
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,767
[SPEAKER_07]: and 1240 a.m., which averages about 1,256 passengers a day.

145
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:20,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is based on ridership surveys that were conducted in spring, summer, and fall of 2023 by MBTA.

146
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:30,814
[SPEAKER_07]: At the Myrtle Street stop, on average, 2 to 3 passengers per bus trip were observed to get on the bus.

147
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:32,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's

148
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:40,760
[SPEAKER_07]: That ranges between the inbound bus in the morning and the outbound bus in the evening.

149
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:49,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Peak hours for the T are 6.30 to 9.30 in the morning and 3.30 to 6.30 in the afternoon.

150
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:54,349
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when the bus frequency goes up to three buses per hour.

151
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, the rest of the day, it's typically one to two buses per hour.

152
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:04,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So these riderships also match our observations.

153
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:19,770
[SPEAKER_07]: We were out there actually this morning and noticed between one and three passengers getting on three buses in the morning, or in the inbound direction, and that was between

154
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:26,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Roughly between 7 and a little before 7 and about quarter of 8.

155
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:35,489
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the outbound buses, it was about 1 to 3 passengers that were there.

156
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:41,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there was no 1 waiting to get on the bus to travel outbound, but there were 1 to 3 passengers on the bus.

157
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: during that same time period.

158
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:58,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, the inbound bus, we observed about eight to 14 passengers on the bus, depending on which of the inbound buses it was.

159
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:06,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So it shows adequate capacity for the additional riders that are expected.

160
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:13,882
[SPEAKER_07]: For the site, given that these buses have a 53 passenger capacity.

161
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,023
[SPEAKER_07]: As noted by the by the.

162
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:21,768
[SPEAKER_07]: The next slide, we get into some bicycle facilities.

163
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:30,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the slide on the graphic on the left shows, this shows existing facilities.

164
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:35,282
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes from the MassDOT bike trail, ArcGIS data.

165
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:40,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Indicates bike lanes on the Fells Way and Revere Beach Parkway.

166
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:51,412
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to see at the scale, but it's the bluish, purplish lines showing where those bike lanes are.

167
00:17:53,556 --> 00:18:00,480
[SPEAKER_07]: It also indicates the area of the Wellington circle improvements, which are conceptually shown in the upper graphic.

168
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:10,445
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a preferred alternative that has been identified, which improves pedestrian and bicycle connectivity through the circle.

169
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:16,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's still in the planning stages, so I don't know that there's a timeframe that's been identified yet.

170
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,253
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is a project that is in the background.

171
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:33,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Also shown is the Malden River Greenway Wellington connector segment that would connect to the bike facilities on Commercial Street.

172
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:50,090
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the potential rail line or multi-use path that passes behind the site, and I think Bill Lucas from Bowler will touch on that in his description of the site plan.

173
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:55,614
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but again, you know, there's these future conditions.

174
00:18:55,694 --> 00:19:04,781
[SPEAKER_07]: These are future conditions and projects that will improve conditions for pedestrians and bicycles, not just for our project, but for for everyone in the area.

175
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:16,738
[SPEAKER_07]: The next slide, we start to get into some of the project specific data, looking at existing and projected future mode split data.

176
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:21,943
[SPEAKER_07]: This data comes from the 2022 American commuter survey.

177
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It indicates percentages

178
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,809
[SPEAKER_07]: shown in the columns.

179
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:35,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And the darker numbers represent the data that's from that survey.

180
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:43,734
[SPEAKER_07]: The lighter numbers, lighter columns, represent what we anticipate the project mode split to be.

181
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:59,130
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that because of the Wellington Connector and the Wellington Circle improvements, we think pedestrian and bicycle usage will increase.

182
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've adjusted the census data to move some of the

183
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:21,040
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the single occupant and the high occupant vehicle, which are basically carpool trips, we moved 5% from those categories into the bike category.

184
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'd like to say that that's a very conservative estimate because of the

185
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:41,790
[SPEAKER_07]: the increasing number of facilities that'll be promoted and provided, as well as the TDM measures for the project, which I'll get into towards the end of my presentation.

186
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:48,954
[SPEAKER_07]: But in general, what we wound up with was a 23% non-automobile travel mode that was expected.

187
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:58,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then we've got 65% automobile travel.

188
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:05,024
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the combination of SOV, you know, somebody in their car driving alone, and HOV is somebody carpooling.

189
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:16,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's 12% that is working from home or commutes using some other form of transportation.

190
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:31,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Those last two categories, the 65% and the 12%, we lump those together to result in 77% auto usage, just to provide a conservative analysis scenario.

191
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:46,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's a little bit of a factor of safety that's built into the mode split and the vehicle trip generations and assumptions, which is what we're going to get into on the next slide.

192
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:57,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So the trip generation information is based on the ITE trip generation manual.

193
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:12,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is standard protocol and required by MassDOT and Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR, for a source to estimate trip generation.

194
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:21,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are resulting vehicle trips after mode split adjustments for the residential uses only.

195
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:33,264
[SPEAKER_07]: The trips in the column labeled existing storage facility, those are trips that we counted and are presently there, presently existing at the site.

196
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:42,689
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of the time periods, we look at the weekday daily, the weekday morning, and the weekday evening peak hour.

197
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,713
[SPEAKER_07]: The two peak hour numbers are used for the analysis.

198
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:53,775
[SPEAKER_07]: The daily numbers, that's the total entering and exiting.

199
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:58,177
[SPEAKER_07]: So of the 1,038, that's 519 trips entering and exiting over the course of a 24-hour day.

200
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:15,666
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the traffic increase through the neighborhood, on the outside edge of the neighborhood, we're looking at four to 14 trips during the peak hours.

201
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:24,830
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Felsway, we're looking at 18 to 41 trips with higher numbers if we include both directions.

202
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,833
[SPEAKER_07]: In the morning, I think we've got something like 47 trips at the Felsway and Riverside intersection.

203
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:38,020
[SPEAKER_07]: In the evening at the Fells Way and Central Street intersection with Medford Street, we've got 46.

204
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So those numbers, they vary depending on the direction.

205
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:50,653
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see there's a higher split with exiting traffic in the morning and entering traffic in the evening.

206
00:23:52,214 --> 00:24:07,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that when Bill gets into the site plan, which you've seen already, there's site access to Amaranth and to Myrtle and to Fellsway.

207
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:21,432
[SPEAKER_07]: because of the location of the access there, would be expected to see a larger increase right on the street before it's dispersed.

208
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:34,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, in general, we think that the trips are manageable, which I'll get into when we get into the level of service and the analysis results.

209
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:47,563
[SPEAKER_07]: 23% of commuters using non-automobile modes of transportation, we expect that to be a low number.

210
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:59,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And we expect to put measures into place to increase the transit percentage as well as the other forms of sustainable transportation.

211
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:04,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next slide, we start to get into the traffic analysis.

212
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me just back up.

213
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:11,287
[SPEAKER_07]: We use the existing counts to develop future conditions.

214
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:12,788
[SPEAKER_07]: We look at a seven-year projection.

215
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:30,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we add background projects or traffic from background projects that are on the books that are proposed or that are approved and not yet constructed or constructed and not yet occupied.

216
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:33,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also include a background growth rate.

217
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:40,120
[SPEAKER_07]: That scenario is called the no build conditions, basically the future condition without the project.

218
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we add the project traffic to that, that gives us the future conditions with the project called the build condition.

219
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:52,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I mentioned, we used a 1% growth rate for general background growth.

220
00:25:52,292 --> 00:26:03,421
[SPEAKER_07]: We included traffic from 11 background projects, including the expansion of the Encore Casino and the Assembly Row expansions.

221
00:26:05,342 --> 00:26:13,649
[SPEAKER_07]: This gives us the no-build condition, which is a base to compare the impacts of the project in the build condition.

222
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:23,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we added the trips that you saw in the previous slide into the network to identify the delay increases due to the project.

223
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:31,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And a summary is that in terms of the level of service or LOS, which

224
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, backing up a little bit, assigns letters to delay ranges.

225
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:45,611
[SPEAKER_07]: So for unsignalized intersections, for instance, a level of service A is an average delay per vehicle less than 10 seconds.

226
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:54,958
[SPEAKER_07]: A level of service B is an average delay of between 10 and 15 seconds.

227
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:02,004
[SPEAKER_07]: A level of service C, like what we're talking about here, is an average delay of between 15 and 25 seconds.

228
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:07,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we're not talking about huge delays at these locations.

229
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:21,659
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the project, when we add the project traffic into the network, what we find is that there's really no change in level of service at 13 of the 14 locations.

230
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:27,383
[SPEAKER_07]: There's level of service C or better at nine intersections.

231
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:34,528
[SPEAKER_07]: The two Felsway locations, which are on this graphic, locations one at Riverside and

232
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:49,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Location 4 at Central and Medford Street, those are operating at level of service F or greater than an 80 second delay with or without the project.

233
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:58,244
[SPEAKER_07]: We also did a supplemental analysis of the operations at those 2 intersections.

234
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:06,587
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a pedestrian phase that's not to get too deep into the weeds on traffic.

235
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:30,020
[SPEAKER_07]: signal timing but if we if we remove the if we discount the pedestrian phase it gives an idea of what the what the what the impact of the project is and and again the the level of service didn't change with that supplemental analysis that's in the that's in the

236
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:39,412
[SPEAKER_07]: In the TIA, in general, delays are less than 2 seconds as a result of the project.

237
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:48,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the next slide, we start to get into transportation demand management.

238
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:56,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mentioned previously that we plan to improve on that 23% non-auto transportation component.

239
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And one way we do that is with the TDM measures.

240
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:14,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So these consist of a number of proven principles and measures to encourage the use of more sustainable transportation instead of personal vehicles.

241
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:20,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Things like a transportation coordinator or a TC would be designated for the project.

242
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:26,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably somebody in the leasing office or the on-site maintenance.

243
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:43,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody that residents can go to, someone that will coordinate with the lower Mystic TMA, for instance, can provide information on transit, biking, walking, what other options are available.

244
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:49,780
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be support for telecommuting with high-speed internet and other options.

245
00:29:51,261 --> 00:30:05,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Secure bicycle parking is proposed, and we're still working through the details on those, but we're looking at also providing space for e-bikes to be charged in the facility.

246
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:10,709
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also looking at EV charging facilities on site.

247
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, these are things that are still

248
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:19,176
[SPEAKER_07]: still being worked through the details on, but this is part of the proposal for the project.

249
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:38,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And coordination with Blue Bikes in order to potentially set up a Blue Bikes kiosk that would be able to be used by not just the residents of the project, but residents of the neighborhood as well.

250
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:53,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I meant, I believe I mentioned previously that Bill Lucas will also indicate how the site plan is proposed to have access to the potential Wellington connector.

251
00:30:53,995 --> 00:31:10,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of these measures are in use, they're proven strategies, they're in use in Medford to some extent, but also in Boston and in Cambridge and Somerville and Everett and Malden, and that's because they work there.

252
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:16,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And some cities, you have to develop a TDM plan.

253
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:27,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And Davis is taking the charge or taking the lead on this to implement this plan.

254
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:37,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, just to summarize, I think the last slide just shows the conclusions.

255
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:55,790
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, this TIA indicates a minimal impact on peak hour traffic delays and vehicle queuing with no change in level of service at 13 or 14 intersections and less than a two-second increase in delay at most locations.

256
00:31:56,611 --> 00:32:00,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the project is improving circulation and.

257
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:15,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really doing a great preview for Bill, but the project is improving circulation in the neighborhood by introducing new on-street parking on Myrtle Street and Amaranth Ave.

258
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:28,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And this improves the accommodation and circulation for two-way traffic flow on both of those streets.

259
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:46,684
[SPEAKER_07]: The project is enhancing operations through the closure of two curb cuts, construction of a multi-modal sidewalk on Amaranth Ave.

260
00:32:47,825 --> 00:32:56,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's no sidewalk there now, but the project includes the addition of that sidewalk.

261
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:09,132
[SPEAKER_07]: As I mentioned, eliminating curb cuts at the intersection of Myrtle, Amaranth, and Lawrence Street and at the corner of Myrtle Street and the Felsway.

262
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:14,173
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, promoting alternative modes of transportation.

263
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:29,479
[SPEAKER_07]: It did another way to support the use of bicycles as an inclusion of a bicycle repair shop, as I mentioned, the secure storage and e-bike charging, as well as a tie-in to the Wellington connector.

264
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:42,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know that we still have the city and peer review process to work through, but we feel that all of these conclusions and points reinforce the

265
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:47,569
[SPEAKER_07]: the idea that the project can be accommodated as designed.

266
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,852
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, that's the end of my presentation.

267
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:54,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll turn it over to Bill Lucas from Bowler.

268
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:54,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

269
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, everyone.

270
00:33:59,326 --> 00:34:00,607
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can't hear me, let me know.

271
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:02,467
[SPEAKER_13]: But otherwise, I'll move ahead.

272
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:07,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a quick summary of my discussion points for this evening.

273
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:11,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Quick site layout update.

274
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:18,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Our parking demand analysis review, which may have Scott as part of that presentation again.

275
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:22,815
[SPEAKER_13]: A fire truck access and circulation on the site itself.

276
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,316
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, utility and drainage updates.

277
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:27,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Next slide, please.

278
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:32,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, just to interject, I may have misunderstood Pat earlier.

279
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:40,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the intention to present this all together and then the board will ask questions, or was it to split it up into two separate pieces?

280
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, the intent is to present all together.

281
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,322
[SPEAKER_09]: There are only a few brief slides here.

282
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:51,984
[SPEAKER_09]: We just felt like it tied the whole presentation in, closing out with a site plan update.

283
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:53,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds great, thanks.

284
00:34:54,687 --> 00:35:05,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike, and further to that point, Mr. Chair, the idea is part of this presentation from a civil standpoint is to tie in the traffic elements around the site to the site itself.

285
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:08,554
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's generally how I'm approaching it.

286
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:15,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Site plan before you now is a little different than what was shown at the previous hearing.

287
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:20,639
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to walk through some of those points for clarification purposes.

288
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:31,449
[SPEAKER_13]: The majority of the project and the layout itself has not changed the building location size has remained in place.

289
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,692
[SPEAKER_13]: But what we've done is try to review this plan.

290
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:44,842
[SPEAKER_13]: From an internal standpoint, from a vehicular and pedestrian safety standpoint, and based on the same 1 of the major.

291
00:35:46,054 --> 00:36:05,999
[SPEAKER_13]: review points was to look at emergency access, and I'll get into that in some future slides, but emergency access vehicles around the site itself to ensure that we were providing proper access from the public streets through the driveways around the site and around the buildings.

292
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:17,844
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of some of the other plan changes that have occurred, we've had a minor adjustment to the configuration of the front entry point.

293
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:19,705
[SPEAKER_13]: That is for several reasons.

294
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:34,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, to make sure that we were accommodating emergency vehicles properly and to try to enhance the beauty and the entry of this new building and this new project to the neighborhood itself.

295
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:43,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Another minor layout adjustment was at the front of the self-storage facility out towards the Felsway.

296
00:36:44,482 --> 00:37:01,946
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had the opportunity to again review any of the trucks in and out of that facility, their turning movements, how the drive aisle's been laid out, and also a layout of the small parking lot associated with that facility.

297
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:14,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, as Scott spoke to, we've had some changes, again, minor in nature, to the on-site parking along Myrtle Street and Amaranth Avenue.

298
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:22,617
[SPEAKER_13]: In particular on Amaranth, we have widened the street for vehicle access.

299
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:28,561
[SPEAKER_13]: and then provided parking and public sidewalk along its frontage.

300
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:41,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, as everyone knows, it is limited parking due to building locations, utility poles, large existing curb cuts that disallow that use to happen.

301
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:49,676
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we're going to provide almost 12 parking spaces and sidewalk along that frontage itself.

302
00:37:50,970 --> 00:38:12,641
[SPEAKER_13]: We've also, again, as I noted, reviewed and adjusted on-site, some on-site features due to vehicular and pedestrian circulation in terms of some of the pathing to and from the building for accessibility and EV purposes and EV accessible stalls.

303
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:19,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, we are showing a few accessible and EV stalls

304
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:33,701
[SPEAKER_13]: on the surface near the northeastern corner of the building and the remaining accessible and EV stalls are currently proposed to be within the podium parking area itself.

305
00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:36,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Next slide, please.

306
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:47,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Scott, would you like to jump in and talk to this slide itself?

307
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:48,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure.

308
00:38:49,002 --> 00:39:10,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had done an estimate of part in demand in the TIA and we relied on data from the ITE who compiles counts of, as well as similar to what they do with the trip generation manual, they compile

309
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:34,857
[SPEAKER_07]: uh counts of uh parking demand of similar facilities as uh as what are proposed here um and or existing so in terms of the the there's a there's a weekday demand and a weekend demand uh for both the the self-storage facility and the proposed residential development those

310
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:53,781
[SPEAKER_07]: those demand rates, those average parking ratios are applied to the specific unit or number of units or building area for whichever land use as appropriate.

311
00:39:54,641 --> 00:40:00,022
[SPEAKER_07]: That gives us an average demand of 276 parking spaces during a weekday, 252

312
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:15,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Spaces on the on the weekend, so, you know, the, the, the parking supply is is on the 1 hand is is higher than the.

313
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:19,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Estimated peak parking demand, but.

314
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:27,749
[SPEAKER_07]: But I believe, but Bill, I'll let you get into the into the next slide because I think that's that's the other part of this.

315
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:38,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it's I guess it's not so sorry about that.

316
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:39,651
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 2 slides down.

317
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:40,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

318
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:41,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

319
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:46,416
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I don't know if you want to just go right to the, I think you want to see the parking slide.

320
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:47,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Scott, is that correct?

321
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:51,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

322
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just jump in here quick.

323
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:08,306
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go back, Bill, I think the parking slides are condensed onto this 1 slide to just summarize quickly the zoning ordinance.

324
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:19,272
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the asterisk comment at the bottom just with what we believe would be required against what the supply is and would have you just talk to that.

325
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:40,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, currently with the site plan that you had seen previously, we're looking at 324 parking spaces that's inclusive of on-site and podium parking for the residential use itself.

326
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:47,656
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are proposing another 22 parking stalls for the self-storage facility.

327
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:52,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, those are where we stand currently, maybe subject to change.

328
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:59,407
[SPEAKER_13]: But based on everything that we've seen to date, we feel.

329
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:09,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Encouraged that the amount of parking we're providing for both of the facilities should be sufficient in nature and does take into account.

330
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:24,133
[SPEAKER_13]: the notion that we've received from the zoning board in the past to not over park this site, but try to park it appropriately for each of the uses in hand.

331
00:42:25,273 --> 00:42:26,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Next slide, please.

332
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:39,740
[SPEAKER_13]: This slide provides a quick review of the

333
00:42:41,021 --> 00:42:48,803
[SPEAKER_13]: fire truck for Medford and its pathing from Myrtle Street onto the site at the front of the building.

334
00:42:48,823 --> 00:43:04,727
[SPEAKER_13]: It may be a little difficult to see, but it is a fire truck traveling to the east towards the Felsway, making a right into the main entry point, and then following along to the front of the building.

335
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:09,931
[SPEAKER_13]: where it would have access to any emergency situation.

336
00:43:10,592 --> 00:43:15,777
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we just show that exiting movement out to the street itself in the upper right hand corner.

337
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:21,843
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the model of the fire truck that we have utilized for this representation.

338
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:27,708
[SPEAKER_13]: And to my knowledge, it is consistent with the fire marshal's request from Medford.

339
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:29,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Next slide, please.

340
00:43:34,035 --> 00:43:53,378
[SPEAKER_13]: And this provides the fire truck circulation from the Fellsway onto the site as it makes a right in, passes by the self-storage facility, and then circulates clockwise around the rear of the building and then out to Amaranth Avenue.

341
00:43:54,139 --> 00:44:04,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this was another reason why we had to make some minor adjustments to the site layout itself just to ensure that we could accommodate a vehicle of the size.

342
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:18,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Next step for our office is to then provide this material to the Medford fire marshal for his review and any further comments that we can take into consideration in the future.

343
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,807
[SPEAKER_13]: We can flip to the next slide.

344
00:44:21,847 --> 00:44:40,862
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's the questions, but just to give an update as far as the rest of the civil design, it is we are undertaking that currently, and we look forward to submitting a full revised site plan package back to Medford and beta for peer review.

345
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:48,035
[SPEAKER_13]: We are currently reviewing utilities and stormwater management on the site itself.

346
00:44:48,175 --> 00:44:51,837
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not anticipate again, any major.

347
00:44:53,014 --> 00:44:58,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Differences from the package that we had submitted in January on those elements.

348
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:07,308
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a matter of refinement at this point to confirm where all the tie in location should be at the building itself.

349
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:12,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Since that building has been adjusted and programmed slightly differently and then.

350
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:39,697
[SPEAKER_13]: At the same time, again, a lot of moving pieces on the site itself, so we need to situate the subsurface stormwater management systems in appropriate locations to ensure that they are spaced appropriately away from buildings, and then we can make appropriate connections to the downstream on-street sewer system.

351
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:47,689
[SPEAKER_13]: With that said, I can turn it back to Pat or open it up to questions as we go.

352
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:54,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

353
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:57,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Pat, was there anything else or can we open it up to, okay, great.

354
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:02,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, I'm going to open it up to questions and comments from the board.

355
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:05,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would like to go first?

356
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:16,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre, please go ahead.

357
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:17,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

358
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:17,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

359
00:46:18,502 --> 00:46:19,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the presentation.

360
00:46:19,563 --> 00:46:30,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more about the parking need assumptions, particularly around the studio and one bedroom.

361
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:33,894
[SPEAKER_04]: The 0.68 does seem a little low.

362
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:41,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm not a huge over-parking fan, but I'm wondering how that was calculated.

363
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:59,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so that data is just based on counts of existing facilities that have been provided, developed by ITE, just based on counts of other locations.

364
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:24,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of categorized down by by unit type and you know the latest values that Looking at our our point six eight four studios in one bedrooms and one point two three four two bedrooms but those and those Comps are they I mean what kinds of projects exactly?

365
00:47:25,682 --> 00:47:26,683
[SPEAKER_04]: you know in terms of

366
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:30,183
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship to transit, other modes.

367
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:39,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't think that there's that level of detail.

368
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:52,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I can look into it, but I don't think in this particular category that there's that level of detail with proximity to transit for these uses.

369
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:56,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know that we had done some initial

370
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:20,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the perfect fit parking report from MAPC has a lot of data that indicates in general, there's a lot of unused parking spaces for a lot of multifamily housing developments in this area.

371
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:25,762
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can look into that number further and get you an answer on that.

372
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

373
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:33,254
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, other questions or comments from the board?

374
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:49,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I can go next then.

375
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:55,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess while we're on this one, I'd like to better understand

376
00:48:57,843 --> 00:49:04,086
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the reasonable parking buffer compared to the parking demand?

377
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:12,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand from this slide that by ordinance, 361 spaces are required.

378
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:18,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Applicants already requesting a reduction based on the proposal, a modest reduction of 30.

379
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:23,196
[SPEAKER_05]: The demand on the parking buffer

380
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: weekday in totality seems to be this 276.

381
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:33,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is that?

382
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:38,069
[SPEAKER_05]: About 55 extra spaces.

383
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:48,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And of those 55, I guess 11 of the extra spaces are for the storage facility.

384
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's about 44

385
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:55,643
[SPEAKER_05]: space buffer, is that the right number?

386
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:59,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Should it be a lower number, a larger number?

387
00:49:59,224 --> 00:50:02,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a great intuition about what's customary here.

388
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:13,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Mister chair I can address that and can also let Scott weigh in on that as far as the technical elements.

389
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:16,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Pat Gallagher from Goulston and stores.

390
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:25,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think we're trying to balance here that on one hand, you have what's required under the zoning ordinance.

391
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:32,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to be clear that the 361 number is just what would be required with respect to the project.

392
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:39,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that does not include the number of spaces that would be required for the remaining storage facility.

393
00:50:40,558 --> 00:50:42,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're trying to balance what's required under the zoning.

394
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:48,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and what we're showing here would still necessitate a parking waiver.

395
00:50:49,145 --> 00:50:52,808
[SPEAKER_03]: For the project, as well as approval of shared parking.

396
00:50:52,828 --> 00:50:57,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, for between the project and the storage facility that's adjacent.

397
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:02,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but also to balance that against concerns among.

398
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:04,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks who live in the neighborhood around.

399
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,962
[SPEAKER_03]: overflow parking spilling into the neighborhood itself.

400
00:51:10,422 --> 00:51:15,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're trying to strike that balance here and be a little bit conservative.

401
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:30,691
[SPEAKER_03]: This was something that was raised by Director Hunt when we spoke yesterday as well, just the delta between what we're showing as peak estimated demand and what we'd be including.

402
00:51:31,652 --> 00:51:33,993
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think wrapped into that is that

403
00:51:34,322 --> 00:51:37,628
[SPEAKER_03]: You know these are these are estimates and we need to factor in.

404
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,616
[SPEAKER_03]: For all of those different considerations that it might be greater than that number.

405
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Mr Gordon was there anything you wanted to add to that.

406
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:52,712
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think Pat summed it up pretty well.

407
00:51:52,732 --> 00:51:57,195
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're finding is that there's less demand for a lot of these units that are coming

408
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:18,243
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming online, they're being programmed with less parking, and it's people that are moving into the area that may be coming from other locations and not bringing vehicles.

409
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:25,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's less of a demand for a personal transportation and therefore a parking space.

410
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:32,808
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do agree that the intent here is to strike the balance between what

411
00:52:33,268 --> 00:52:41,115
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, what the ordinance says and what the demand is indicating that the supply should be.

412
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:43,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks.

413
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:52,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just so I'm clear, these counts do or don't include the 12 street parking spaces that are along the building frontage?

414
00:52:54,226 --> 00:52:54,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not.

415
00:52:55,247 --> 00:52:55,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

416
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:12,979
[SPEAKER_05]: My next sets of questions were in some cases referenced in the presentation and one case not specifically referenced, but they're from a detailed read of the supplemental TIA itself.

417
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:20,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I just want to make sure I'm understanding the transit ridership portion.

418
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:31,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so as I understood it, the, there's data from the MBTA about the current ridership at peak times.

419
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:36,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was in the morning going inbound was the worst case.

420
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:37,055
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 29% capacity.

421
00:53:37,075 --> 00:53:37,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, um,

422
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,266
[SPEAKER_05]: as of this stop or is that all the way down?

423
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:50,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it get fuller further down the line or is that 29% along the entire route?

424
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:58,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I'll have to get back to you on that.

425
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:02,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the daily usage is 1,256 at maximum.

426
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:10,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And the capacity level is 5,088, so that's about 25% of capacity that gets used.

427
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:23,565
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll get back to you on that specific number.

428
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:36,291
[SPEAKER_07]: My guess is that it's at that point, but I'll get back to you on that.

429
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:37,692
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

430
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:42,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm sorry, Mike, just on that issue, if I could jump in for clarification.

431
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:45,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'd be great to know if there is like

432
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,556
[SPEAKER_04]: peak times of the day, right?

433
00:54:47,576 --> 00:55:01,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if that's all of the buses throughout the whole day, I can imagine, you know, late at night will be mostly empty, but I'm mostly curious about what's the capacity at the peak hours and that's, you know, are they overflowing at peak hours?

434
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:03,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

435
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:05,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Andre, that's what I was referring to.

436
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:08,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the report, there's peak hour numbers and it's,

437
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:17,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the morning, on the way in, it's still 29% capacity in the peak hour.

438
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:23,135
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's spread over three buses, and it doesn't speak to whether some of the buses are fuller than others.

439
00:55:23,255 --> 00:55:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And then evening on the way back, I think it was closer to maybe 25%.

440
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:35,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I would love to know the answer on that, especially on the way back.

441
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:46,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we have residents taking the public transit and the buses start out full, that even if they empty before the stop, I just want to make sure there's no issues there.

442
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:51,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you going to say something, Scott?

443
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:53,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and certainly,

444
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:57,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Inbound from from this stop.

445
00:55:57,673 --> 00:55:59,795
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the ridership is.

446
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:03,016
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's plenty of seats.

447
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,631
[SPEAKER_07]: there's plenty of seats on the bus getting to this point inbound.

448
00:56:08,751 --> 00:56:11,651
[SPEAKER_07]: After here, it may pick up.

449
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:13,752
[SPEAKER_07]: We have that information.

450
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:20,613
[SPEAKER_07]: We can probably lay out some type of ridership chart by stop.

451
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:21,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

452
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:30,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I love data in general, but I guess to try to keep it tangible, I agree on the way in since it's

453
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:34,355
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe middle of the line, it's 29%.

454
00:56:38,101 --> 00:56:48,628
[SPEAKER_05]: when the residents in this area, whether they're residents of this site or, uh, adjacent properties should have ability to get on.

455
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:52,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the board would want to know if on the way back.

456
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're, if you're going into Wellington, you're probably coming back later from Wellington.

457
00:56:56,553 --> 00:57:05,699
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's any issues there in the, in the capacity, if I had a guess from these ridership numbers, probably not an issue, but it would just be good to know for sure.

458
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:05,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

459
00:57:07,812 --> 00:57:15,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And then related to this, so I think I understood all the detailed reports here.

460
00:57:16,174 --> 00:57:25,676
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the assumed 13% of the trips generated would be transit specifically.

461
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:34,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was looking at the numbers, and it looked like that ends up being about 12 to 13 people during the peak hour.

462
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:35,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

463
00:57:36,298 --> 00:57:36,418
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

464
00:57:37,627 --> 00:57:38,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

465
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:42,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And if, and if that's spread out over three buses, you know, it's three to four people.

466
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:43,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

467
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:43,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

468
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:50,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst case scenario, if everyone gets on one bus, if that bus is over capacity, but that's not really plausible.

469
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, across three buses, it would be funny.

470
00:57:53,115 --> 00:57:53,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like.

471
00:57:54,196 --> 00:57:54,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

472
00:57:54,596 --> 00:58:00,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and, uh, so, so Myrtle street is, I think it's, it's stopped.

473
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's about two thirds of the way in, uh, on the route.

474
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know,

475
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:12,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's obviously the population density increases as you get closer to Wellington.

476
00:58:14,207 --> 00:58:20,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So there may be more riders that are getting on further down.

477
00:58:20,211 --> 00:58:32,880
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, at this point, at this location, and I understand your question, but at this point, there sure seems like there'll be plenty of seats on that bus coming inbound or coming outbound.

478
00:58:33,648 --> 00:58:34,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thanks.

479
00:58:34,548 --> 00:58:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a different set of questions, just a clarification.

480
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:48,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So I saw in the report the unfortunate situation where a couple of the count equipment were vandalized.

481
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:54,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there were two intersections where, as a result, older data was used.

482
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:57,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Central and Pinkerton, Central and Kenmuir.

483
00:58:58,298 --> 00:58:58,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

484
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:09,876
[SPEAKER_05]: In the neighboring intersections where the counts way different between 2020 and now or do you think these are reasonable approximations for the current numbers?

485
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:26,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, we used, they were a bit different, but we used the locations on either side of the two subject intersections and balanced up the traffic volumes.

486
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:36,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we made adjustments to the volume that was going in and out of those two streets based on counts that we had from, I think it was either 2019 or 2020.

487
00:59:38,582 --> 00:59:40,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that, you know, it's.

488
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:53,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, it's unfortunate, but but I I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty confident in the in the way we the way we adjusted the volumes to account for it.

489
00:59:53,313 --> 00:59:54,574
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

490
00:59:54,654 --> 00:59:55,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

491
00:59:55,254 --> 00:59:56,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my questions.

492
00:59:57,155 --> 01:00:03,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we have other members of the board who would like to ask questions or make comments?

493
01:00:08,523 --> 01:00:13,364
[SPEAKER_11]: We have just a more of a clarification of at the end, you described that plan.

494
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:14,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you remind me again?

495
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:26,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, is that a recommended planners that the plan that will most likely that will take place the, like, having a person responsible for managing on site transportation and that list.

496
01:00:28,466 --> 01:00:32,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I think that that is the framework of a plan.

497
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:46,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I expect that it will be, you know, it may be supplemented or it may be modified by the city and possibly by the peer reviewer, but right now that is the plan.

498
01:00:47,002 --> 01:00:49,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

499
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:52,667
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

500
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:55,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions or comments from the board?

501
01:01:04,824 --> 01:01:17,369
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, seeing none, at this point, chair awaits a motion to open the public portion of the hearing on the supplemental transportation impact assessment.

502
01:01:19,029 --> 01:01:19,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

503
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:20,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

504
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:23,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

505
01:01:23,191 --> 01:01:25,772
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

506
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:26,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

507
01:01:28,173 --> 01:01:28,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

508
01:01:29,073 --> 01:01:29,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

509
01:01:29,613 --> 01:01:30,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

510
01:01:31,874 --> 01:01:32,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

511
01:01:32,994 --> 01:01:33,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

512
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:34,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie?

513
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:35,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

514
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:36,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, aye.

515
01:01:37,743 --> 01:01:41,526
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, folks, the public portion of the hearing is now open.

516
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:57,739
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a member of the public and you would like to make a public comment in regards to the supplemental traffic impact assessment that was presented tonight, please go ahead and raise your hand on Zoom.

517
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn on your camera and raise your hand.

518
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:07,627
[SPEAKER_05]: You can type something in the chat, or you can email Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

519
01:02:08,568 --> 01:02:12,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I see we have a member of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

520
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:15,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Allison D., please state your name and address for the record.

521
01:02:17,295 --> 01:02:18,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

522
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:19,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Allison D'Agostino.

523
01:02:20,077 --> 01:02:23,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent the D'Agostino Trust.

524
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the owners of 1022-1024 Felsway.

525
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for the time.

526
01:02:30,161 --> 01:02:32,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the presentation.

527
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,783
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a couple quick things.

528
01:02:36,944 --> 01:02:44,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Just from my understanding, it sounds like the traffic assessment was just one day's worth of traffic captured.

529
01:02:45,749 --> 01:02:46,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's standard.

530
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:50,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to just note that was the Thursday before holiday weekend.

531
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:55,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably not maybe the best to actually record

532
01:02:57,118 --> 01:02:58,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Typical traffic.

533
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:02,919
[SPEAKER_01]: One other comment too is just the peak hours, I don't really agree with.

534
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:10,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely seen an evolution, been here myself 12 years, my mother-in-law 50 plus years, same house.

535
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:13,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So we overlooked the Felsway, have a great view.

536
01:03:13,142 --> 01:03:20,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say from the pandemic evolution, your peak evening hour commute time especially is a little bit earlier.

537
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:23,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And also your beginning time's a little bit earlier than was noted.

538
01:03:23,924 --> 01:03:25,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something to take away.

539
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:39,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Initial comments, I just, I think I work with data for a living, so I know data can represent what you want it to show.

540
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:51,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the increase from a car perspective of four to 14 during peak hours in the morning for 289 units seems really completely unreasonable.

541
01:03:53,801 --> 01:03:56,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I respect, again, great presentation,

542
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:05,288
[SPEAKER_01]: level of detail on the source of your parking average ratio comp seems something I'd expect in a meeting like this.

543
01:04:05,848 --> 01:04:11,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps happens behind the scenes and I'm speaking specifically to the parking demand analysis slide.

544
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:21,133
[SPEAKER_01]: You should know your source data if that's what you're standing behind for representing the amount of cars going.

545
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:24,000
[SPEAKER_01]: up and down.

546
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:28,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And my last comment is really just the, again, the size of the street increase.

547
01:04:28,705 --> 01:04:29,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that with Amarith.

548
01:04:29,886 --> 01:04:31,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure those folks do too.

549
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:38,715
[SPEAKER_01]: If Myrtle Street's not increasing in size right now, I encourage the board to walk the site.

550
01:04:39,156 --> 01:04:41,938
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already, you cannot pass two cars.

551
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:46,057
[SPEAKER_01]: up and down Myrtle Street without someone pulling over and let somebody go.

552
01:04:46,737 --> 01:04:53,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, my concern is definitely that it's sort of being glossed over.

553
01:04:53,024 --> 01:04:57,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And Myrtle continues to be a one-way, Lawrence is a one-way coming in.

554
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:03,251
[SPEAKER_01]: You write where that congestion point is, is where this property is planned to be built.

555
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:05,972
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, those weren't really spoken about.

556
01:05:06,832 --> 01:05:11,293
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to also just say quickly, Davis Company, listen, you make great properties.

557
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Rivers Edge is beautiful.

558
01:05:13,554 --> 01:05:17,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in the traffic assessment, they mentioned Encore and Assembly.

559
01:05:18,575 --> 01:05:20,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can all agree what's different there.

560
01:05:20,456 --> 01:05:24,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not within a neighborhood in any of those properties.

561
01:05:25,618 --> 01:05:26,459
[SPEAKER_01]: very separated.

562
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:30,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, my mother-in-law has been here 50 plus years.

563
01:05:30,422 --> 01:05:33,885
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to, you know, conserve our neighborhood.

564
01:05:33,925 --> 01:05:35,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the time.

565
01:05:38,629 --> 01:05:39,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

566
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:49,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that on a couple of those points, there's a shared understanding.

567
01:05:49,341 --> 01:05:52,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was the peak hours.

568
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:55,288
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that's as measured by the count.

569
01:05:55,428 --> 01:05:56,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

570
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:57,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's correct.

571
01:05:58,532 --> 01:06:19,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as far as as far just to continue on that point, you know, we, we, we count the, we get those peak hours and, and wherever they occur, if it's, if it's seven to eight, if it's seven, 15 to eight, 15, if it's, you know, eight to eight to nine, whatever's the highest peak hour, that's what we use in the analysis.

572
01:06:19,522 --> 01:06:22,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, and that's just what shows up in the data.

573
01:06:26,686 --> 01:06:27,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, if I may.

574
01:06:28,323 --> 01:06:29,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, please go ahead.

575
01:06:30,745 --> 01:06:41,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I direct to Bill Lucas, just to make a clarification on the, one of the last points about the width of Myrtle Street, and just to talk a little bit about what we are proposing out there.

576
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:43,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sounds great.

577
01:06:43,796 --> 01:06:44,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Please go ahead Bill.

578
01:06:45,096 --> 01:06:46,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you Allison.

579
01:06:46,637 --> 01:06:51,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the questions and comments on the presentation itself.

580
01:06:51,819 --> 01:06:58,863
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, excuse me for not addressing this specific comment with regard to Myrtle Street.

581
01:06:59,803 --> 01:07:01,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, maybe I just got a little too.

582
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:04,606
[SPEAKER_13]: It is our intention to widen Myrtle Street.

583
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:09,387
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an existing 26-foot wide curb-to-curb, and it is very narrow, being out there myself and seeing the conditions.

584
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:15,349
[SPEAKER_13]: But as part of this is, what we will do is, we're going to do a lot of work to make sure that we're able to do that.

585
01:07:24,312 --> 01:07:48,366
[SPEAKER_13]: from the existing curb line along our face of the property we will adjust that in to provide an additional width of parallel parking along Myrtle Street and as part of that we will improve the sidewalk conditions and we will actually be providing some land back to the city for

586
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,503
[SPEAKER_13]: for both the pedestrian and the street parking itself.

587
01:07:53,563 --> 01:08:01,971
[SPEAKER_13]: So as part of this, Davis will be giving up some land in order to widen Myrtle Street for that better flow of traffic that everyone's looking for.

588
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:05,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

589
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:08,157
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one other item.

590
01:08:10,267 --> 01:08:11,347
[SPEAKER_05]: that was mentioned.

591
01:08:12,107 --> 01:08:18,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, there is the supplemental traffic impact assessment is public record.

592
01:08:18,989 --> 01:08:23,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either already in the folder or will be shortly after the meeting.

593
01:08:24,991 --> 01:08:34,013
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding from reading table six of that report is that on the weekday morning peak hour,

594
01:08:34,897 --> 01:08:45,342
[SPEAKER_05]: there are 90 net new vehicle trips, 21 entering and 69 exiting, and then afternoon peak hour is 89, 55 entering and 34 exiting.

595
01:08:45,402 --> 01:08:46,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not 14, it's 90 and 89.

596
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:48,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, going in and out of the site, yes.

597
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

598
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:01,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

599
01:09:01,757 --> 01:09:05,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that covers the questions.

600
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:13,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there are any other members of the public that would like to speak on this matter, please go ahead.

601
01:09:14,063 --> 01:09:14,824
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, there we go.

602
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:16,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you.

603
01:09:16,164 --> 01:09:22,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see a Christina, I always forget how to pronounce your last name.

604
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:24,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even try.

605
01:09:24,148 --> 01:09:25,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just tell you.

606
01:09:26,169 --> 01:09:26,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch.

607
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:27,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for the record, please.

608
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:30,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Christina Kach, 130 Myrtle Street.

609
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Please go ahead.

610
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,007
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

611
01:09:35,027 --> 01:09:43,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick note to add on to Allison's comment about the traffic study happening the Thursday before a long weekend.

612
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:47,095
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had a snowstorm that Monday of that week.

613
01:09:48,536 --> 01:09:52,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow emergency, schools closed, parking restrictions.

614
01:09:53,019 --> 01:09:57,342
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a long weekend and a snow emergency the week of the traffic study.

615
01:09:59,383 --> 01:10:00,404
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have some questions.

616
01:10:00,424 --> 01:10:06,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was fortunate enough today to have time to read through your entire 62-page document cover to cover.

617
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:11,811
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have some comments that might be directly related to that versus the presentation.

618
01:10:12,712 --> 01:10:16,655
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first question was, after you collected the data,

619
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:20,017
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you perform the analysis?

620
01:10:20,077 --> 01:10:23,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you using a Minitab statistical software?

621
01:10:23,463 --> 01:10:25,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you use a simulation model?

622
01:10:26,067 --> 01:10:28,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the data go to get this output?

623
01:10:31,123 --> 01:10:38,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, just to interject, I want to make sure we don't devolve into a back and forth conversation.

624
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:40,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be public comments.

625
01:10:40,332 --> 01:10:45,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So Christina, maybe you could list out your questions.

626
01:10:45,557 --> 01:10:49,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in general, I intend, if we don't know that information, we'll certainly ask.

627
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,984
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to avoid conversations.

628
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:53,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

629
01:10:53,485 --> 01:10:54,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run through them all.

630
01:10:54,506 --> 01:10:55,267
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was number one.

631
01:10:56,657 --> 01:11:12,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two was that I saw both in your conversation today in the PowerPoint as well as your full Word document that there would be quote new on street parking and quote to create more on street parking supply.

632
01:11:14,249 --> 01:11:20,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a map that I didn't see of where of like how that was gonna look?

633
01:11:22,034 --> 01:11:23,535
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was, if that,

634
01:11:24,669 --> 01:11:32,476
[SPEAKER_00]: new plan of how you're going to include more parking spaces on the street was somewhere, please let me know where it was so I can go check it out.

635
01:11:33,396 --> 01:11:50,611
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my final question was, you mentioned in your conclusion and your summary, specifically on page seven, if you want to know where I'm looking, that with the removal of the industrial use space, the heavy traffic, the heavy vehicles and trucks will be fewer.

636
01:11:52,026 --> 01:11:57,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't see anywhere in the body of the report where you did that analysis.

637
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:04,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, obviously, you're getting rid of Art of the Event and Churchill Furniture, so they will not be there anymore.

638
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:20,739
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you're adding 300, almost 300 units to the property with a entrance directly across from me for delivery vehicles, I have a hard time believing that there really will be fewer trucks

639
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:31,182
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Myrtle Street Amaranth neighborhood by just removing two companies when you're adding a delivery truck entrance right here on Myrtle Street.

640
01:12:31,262 --> 01:12:36,765
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to realize, I have to reason that if not more, it's at least the same.

641
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:42,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't see where that analysis happened for the claim that said fewer.

642
01:12:44,128 --> 01:12:44,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my three.

643
01:12:46,302 --> 01:12:46,722
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, great.

644
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was taking notes.

645
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:49,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to make sure we didn't miss anything.

646
01:12:49,604 --> 01:12:50,944
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

647
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:55,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the second question, I can just speak to that.

648
01:12:55,726 --> 01:12:59,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that what we're looking at right now does depict the street parking.

649
01:12:59,368 --> 01:13:04,170
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know it's not zoomed in easily, the viewable.

650
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:08,753
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look along Amaranth and Myrtle,

651
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:20,317
[SPEAKER_05]: set those little green bumps, those are actually separating out some street parking spaces that are on the property that are being used to extend the space.

652
01:13:20,337 --> 01:13:26,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be, I don't remember the split across Amaranth and Myrtle, but it's on the picture.

653
01:13:27,723 --> 01:13:29,124
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct, Mr. Chair.

654
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:34,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to elaborate on that a bit, the street.

655
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:38,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, again, I think the

656
01:13:40,237 --> 01:13:47,179
[SPEAKER_03]: commitment to pull in the curb and to create new spaces by widening the street.

657
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:57,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really unique commitment for this team to be making and not something that I've really ever come across in the context of this type of project.

658
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:05,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important to recognize that this is a real concession that the team is making to the neighborhood here.

659
01:14:07,078 --> 01:14:09,999
[SPEAKER_03]: to be granting easements for this parking.

660
01:14:11,339 --> 01:14:22,962
[SPEAKER_03]: The result along Myrtle is to have approximately, and Bill Lucas can speak to this more, but to have approximately the same number of spaces that exist today.

661
01:14:23,982 --> 01:14:29,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that's accomplished is because a very large curb cut that's on the corner here is being closed off.

662
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:35,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the addition of new parking that does not exist today on Amaranth Avenue.

663
01:14:36,002 --> 01:14:38,464
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of that would be intended to be public parking.

664
01:14:40,586 --> 01:14:45,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's not guaranteed for Myrtle Street, Amaranth residents.

665
01:14:45,892 --> 01:14:48,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you for the clarification.

666
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:51,417
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not getting more resident parking specifically on Myrtle.

667
01:14:51,917 --> 01:14:54,019
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the addition of new parking.

668
01:14:54,059 --> 01:14:54,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

669
01:14:55,718 --> 01:14:55,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

670
01:14:55,918 --> 01:14:56,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

671
01:14:56,078 --> 01:15:03,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I understand it, it's the rules for usage of the space would be governed by the Medford ordinance.

672
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's complicated by it being on private property.

673
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:09,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to claim to know the specifics there.

674
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:21,964
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm currently interpreting it as this is spaces that anyone in the area who's allowed to park on these streets would be able to park in.

675
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that accurate, Attorney Gallagher?

676
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:25,956
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

677
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:28,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, our intent is for this to be public parking.

678
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:34,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may be residents of the neighborhood, that may be visitors to the project.

679
01:15:36,464 --> 01:15:38,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the intent currently.

680
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:40,188
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thanks.

681
01:15:40,548 --> 01:15:44,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the other two questions, I think these are both for Scott.

682
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:52,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a question about statistical software or what's used to generate these reports.

683
01:15:52,693 --> 01:16:01,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so the count data is processed, balanced.

684
01:16:01,742 --> 01:16:10,029
[SPEAKER_07]: As I mentioned, we look at peak hours, peak hour volumes, and there's a specific traffic analysis.

685
01:16:11,811 --> 01:16:20,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a stochastic analysis model that's used in the industry.

686
01:16:20,758 --> 01:16:33,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a standard software package that's one of the packages that's required by state reviewing agencies.

687
01:16:33,367 --> 01:16:39,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's pretty widespread use amongst the consultants in the industry.

688
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,681
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

689
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:48,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last question had to do with the heavy vehicle and truck counts.

690
01:16:49,108 --> 01:16:52,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did try to do a keyword search of the doc myself.

691
01:16:52,811 --> 01:17:01,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't notice if there's something in the supplement that speaks to that beyond the statement in the conclusion.

692
01:17:01,971 --> 01:17:19,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, and I think it's more of a review of the operations that we've seen when we've been out there, where we've seen trucks circulating in the parking lot.

693
01:17:21,758 --> 01:17:34,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the delivery vehicles, Amazon vehicles, UPS, post office, these vehicles are everywhere now.

694
01:17:34,403 --> 01:17:47,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think that the way that the deliveries are made, they're done to specific areas and they're likely to

695
01:17:50,588 --> 01:17:51,729
[SPEAKER_07]: They're likely already there.

696
01:17:51,749 --> 01:17:59,934
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of these delivery vehicles are likely already on the streets in the neighborhood around the site.

697
01:18:00,234 --> 01:18:11,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would think that instead of passing by the site like some of them do, once the development is in there, they would be pulling into the site.

698
01:18:11,522 --> 01:18:19,647
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know that they represent really an increase from what's already in the neighborhood.

699
01:18:19,947 --> 01:18:32,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas I think by removing some of the industrial uses that are there, those larger vehicles would no longer be entering the site.

700
01:18:33,671 --> 01:18:38,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so have you thought about clarifying the language that when you were speaking about

701
01:18:39,474 --> 01:18:43,698
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy vehicles and trucks, you're excluding delivery vehicles.

702
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:47,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I see trucks, I say I bucket in delivery vehicles.

703
01:18:47,282 --> 01:18:50,986
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I would clarify that language to avoid further confusion.

704
01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:58,455
[SPEAKER_00]: But also have you talked to UPS, FedEx, DHL about their predictions of how much

705
01:18:59,524 --> 01:19:01,525
[SPEAKER_00]: their increase is going to be.

706
01:19:02,025 --> 01:19:12,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're talking about supply chains and how they determine their routes, they do it by zones because of the patterns and how much they have to deliver in a certain area at a certain time.

707
01:19:13,089 --> 01:19:18,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have almost 300 units, almost 300 people, that might be more than one truck.

708
01:19:19,072 --> 01:19:22,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with UPS, I know specifically they send out more than one truck in a day.

709
01:19:23,073 --> 01:19:27,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you looked at any operations research principles about what the traffic might look like?

710
01:19:27,777 --> 01:19:30,572
[SPEAKER_00]: for the delivery trucks that have to deliver so much more.

711
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:36,945
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not looked at any operations research principles for delivery vehicles.

712
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:44,490
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, you know, that's a bit beyond the scope of a standard traffic study.

713
01:19:45,091 --> 01:19:59,322
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I mean, if the city and the peer review consultants have indicated that that's something we should review, we can make an effort to do that.

714
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:09,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so to that point, my intention is that the board does have peer review consultants who is.

715
01:20:10,828 --> 01:20:14,989
[SPEAKER_05]: reviewing this with expertise and reviewing these sorts of reports.

716
01:20:15,049 --> 01:20:24,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the board certainly intends to both consider the public comment and request as well as the expert guidance of the peer review consultant.

717
01:20:24,911 --> 01:20:39,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will say just a suggestion, not a requirement, but I do generally buy into the principle that a final report should not make a claim that isn't supported by some

718
01:20:40,455 --> 01:20:42,196
[SPEAKER_05]: table or data in there.

719
01:20:42,216 --> 01:20:53,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think maybe the conclusion should either be very crisp about why we think that's the case, or maybe just not reference that specifically.

720
01:20:53,404 --> 01:21:04,351
[SPEAKER_05]: But as to whether there should be supplemental analysis, I think the board intends to wait for peer review comments and make a determination at that point.

721
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:06,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Understood.

722
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:07,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

723
01:21:07,273 --> 01:21:08,113
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

724
01:21:09,935 --> 01:21:13,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a resident Richmond chow please state your name and address for the record.

725
01:21:13,717 --> 01:21:17,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is, uh, Japan chow.

726
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:24,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the owner and I live at 1 26128 Myrtle street, which is directly across from.

727
01:21:25,092 --> 01:21:30,615
[SPEAKER_02]: in that picture, the new opening or the front entrance of the building.

728
01:21:31,755 --> 01:21:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a unique perspective because I am temporarily living at RE150 in Medford, which is a similar development to this, I guess, proposed area.

729
01:21:45,302 --> 01:21:47,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I have unique insight as to

730
01:21:48,218 --> 01:21:55,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The traffic and delivery and kind of what happens from the residents coming in and out of this building.

731
01:21:55,820 --> 01:22:01,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll start off with my 1st comment, the shift of.

732
01:22:01,661 --> 01:22:07,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, percentage usage to from cars to bikes, I don't think that's.

733
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:09,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, you know, reasonable.

734
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

735
01:22:11,024 --> 01:22:17,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is trying to add bikes and and by capability, but, you know, we look out today and there's, there's no bikers anywhere.

736
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:19,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at least half the year.

737
01:22:19,905 --> 01:22:20,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

738
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:20,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um.

739
01:22:21,106 --> 01:22:26,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see if that number should be reduced at some for some amount.

740
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:31,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a question related to, you know, counting the number of.

741
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:39,951
[SPEAKER_02]: additional trips or impacts of drivers into the building, right?

742
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:59,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the data only accounting for the residents generating the trips or does it account for the gate drivers, the food delivery, the Ubers, the packages, and the visitors, all those trips that are also going to be occurring to this building?

743
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:09,128
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, living at 150, there are food deliveries, Uber pickups, and also package deliveries around the clock.

744
01:23:09,889 --> 01:23:13,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazon comes here four, five, six times a day.

745
01:23:13,852 --> 01:23:16,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with UPS and FedEx.

746
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just a one-day drop-off.

747
01:23:18,757 --> 01:23:21,959
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, you know, a constant stream of deliveries.

748
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:27,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Trucks, there's also people who move in and out of here.

749
01:23:27,907 --> 01:23:31,391
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't stay long term people have 1 year leases.

750
01:23:31,892 --> 01:23:32,613
[SPEAKER_02]: They move in and out.

751
01:23:32,653 --> 01:23:38,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so moving trucks coming in and out constantly and being a direct.

752
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:38,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

753
01:23:40,335 --> 01:23:43,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, directly in front of the new proposed entrance.

754
01:23:44,721 --> 01:23:47,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to kind of see data on.

755
01:23:47,966 --> 01:23:52,772
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that what is the number of trips per hour coming in and out of.

756
01:23:53,373 --> 01:23:55,075
[SPEAKER_02]: That street that that entrance, right?

757
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:55,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Because.

758
01:23:56,377 --> 01:24:01,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's 0 and I can, I can live in front of my, I can live at my house and not worry about cars.

759
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:11,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Turning in and out of towards my house, especially with, you know, I know you're increasing the park, the street parking and the width of the street.

760
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:33,164
[SPEAKER_02]: A 2 lane street taking left and right is not necessarily totally sufficient, depending on how well people drive, especially if they're trucks or inexperienced type drivers or people in a hurry because they're dropping off food or people, right?

761
01:24:33,504 --> 01:24:34,565
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't necessarily live there.

762
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:41,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I have a major concern about that that entrance point there and not speaking to.

763
01:24:41,849 --> 01:24:45,230
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you mentioned 80 trips, 90 trips.

764
01:24:46,071 --> 01:24:49,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming in and out the facility during peak hours, but.

765
01:24:49,953 --> 01:24:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that per hour and throughout the day?

766
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:56,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm seeing somewhere between increase of 0 to 90 trips.

767
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:06,105
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, constantly out of that, that, that location, that, that, that, that, that entrance way, which currently nothing exists.

768
01:25:06,665 --> 01:25:14,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that that's, that's my major concern, you know, having a direct entrance right in front of my house.

769
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:16,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so.

770
01:25:19,772 --> 01:25:21,313
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much all I have to say.

771
01:25:23,054 --> 01:25:23,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

772
01:25:24,522 --> 01:25:24,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

773
01:25:24,882 --> 01:25:34,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do believe there in the detailed report, there are some projections that are specific to the drives themselves.

774
01:25:35,246 --> 01:25:47,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'll have Scott check me on this, but I think it's figures nine and 10 and 11 and, uh, yeah, nine, 10 and 11, I think.

775
01:25:47,871 --> 01:25:48,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

776
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:48,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

777
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:48,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

778
01:25:48,431 --> 01:25:48,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, um,

779
01:25:55,298 --> 01:26:11,049
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm understanding it correctly, I believe Mr. Chow is by the site drive C, which is expecting 5% of the volume, or maybe 10% in totality.

780
01:26:11,089 --> 01:26:14,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So 5% turning left, 5% turning right.

781
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,212
[SPEAKER_05]: This is exiting and then on the way in.

782
01:26:26,325 --> 01:26:26,847
[SPEAKER_05]: also 5%.

783
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:29,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I, is that correct?

784
01:26:29,675 --> 01:26:30,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I reading that?

785
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:33,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, yep, that's correct.

786
01:26:33,456 --> 01:26:57,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the majority of the trips are expected to be using the Felsway and the Felsway access, a lesser percentage using Amaranth and the intent of the access to Myrtle is really to get a small component of

787
01:26:58,522 --> 01:27:01,646
[SPEAKER_07]: The project traffic, but, yeah, it's it works out to be.

788
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:07,814
[SPEAKER_07]: It works out to be over the course of a day.

789
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:12,139
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 trips entering and 50 trips.

790
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:15,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Exiting so that's over 24 hour period.

791
01:27:18,729 --> 01:27:19,490
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

792
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do we have other members?

793
01:27:23,272 --> 01:27:24,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, am I able to.

794
01:27:25,233 --> 01:27:29,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask clarification on that assumption.

795
01:27:29,736 --> 01:27:31,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess so.

796
01:27:32,118 --> 01:27:36,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like we're assuming 10% of the trips come out of that.

797
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:40,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That, um, I guess, uh, interest that.

798
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:43,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You exit way during exit, right?

799
01:27:43,786 --> 01:27:45,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I, I'm not sure.

800
01:27:46,835 --> 01:27:47,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the 10%?

801
01:27:47,617 --> 01:27:50,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that assumed 10%?

802
01:27:51,003 --> 01:27:53,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if that's the front entrance.

803
01:27:54,702 --> 01:28:00,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume somewhere in the 60 to 70% people would go through there.

804
01:28:00,785 --> 01:28:08,489
[SPEAKER_02]: People drive, the easiest way and the easiest way to get to the building is through Myrtle Street and into that exit.

805
01:28:09,169 --> 01:28:11,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not through the Fells Way.

806
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:16,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You come in through the opposite streets off of Fells Way, through that area.

807
01:28:16,993 --> 01:28:22,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, entering the building, if I came from the West,

808
01:28:22,968 --> 01:28:26,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't come, I would enter the building right in front of my house.

809
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:34,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't come, I wouldn't drive to the back of the building, and I wouldn't drive all the way to the Fellsway to come in that direction.

810
01:28:34,155 --> 01:28:36,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, 10% doesn't seem reasonable.

811
01:28:36,857 --> 01:28:45,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be if at least 33% of the time, and I would think it's a lot more, because why would you drive to the back of the building when you can drive to the front?

812
01:28:49,225 --> 01:28:51,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm understanding correctly,

813
01:28:52,746 --> 01:29:09,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone on Felsway heading north, since they can't turn into the Felsway entrance, you're saying they would, your observation is that they would use Myrtle Street, is that?

814
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:23,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm saying the way people access this area currently is a lot of the traffic comes west.

815
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:29,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So down, I think it's Lawrence Street, or they pass through this street.

816
01:29:29,732 --> 01:29:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone was going,

817
01:29:35,873 --> 01:29:38,974
[SPEAKER_02]: North of the city, they would, they would exit out of that.

818
01:29:39,455 --> 01:29:41,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That the entrance way and head West.

819
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:45,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they were coming, coming home, they would come in from the West side.

820
01:29:46,578 --> 01:29:50,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Off 93, because it's easier to cut through those side streets then.

821
01:29:50,879 --> 01:29:54,541
[SPEAKER_02]: To fight the traffic coming down the Fells way.

822
01:29:56,605 --> 01:30:12,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're there during rush hour, you'll see how many cars just zip past up and down those side streets to avoid the Fellsway because you would get stuck at the U-turns or whatnot to turn around.

823
01:30:13,791 --> 01:30:23,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to go north and south heading west than going down the Fellsway in either direction.

824
01:30:25,383 --> 01:30:25,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

825
01:30:26,144 --> 01:30:26,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

826
01:30:26,964 --> 01:30:27,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

827
01:30:28,466 --> 01:30:34,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So Scott, I'd appreciate if you could clarify how the percentages are determined.

828
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:44,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also I was checking my notes and I had forgotten to ask about whether the trip generation accounts for delivery vehicles or not.

829
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:46,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

830
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:49,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's important to note that

831
01:30:51,515 --> 01:31:02,639
[SPEAKER_07]: The access to the garage is, there's one access point off of Amaranth, and then there's another access point off of that driveway.

832
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:07,761
[SPEAKER_07]: You can kind of see, yeah, right where Pat's circling there.

833
01:31:08,321 --> 01:31:17,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we are expecting that some of the traffic is gonna come, is gonna depart

834
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:32,673
[SPEAKER_07]: to the west and arrive from the west we think that traffic is more likely to use the amaranth access point than to use the myrtle street access point because that

835
01:31:33,393 --> 01:31:41,245
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that access off of Myrtle is is really intended, you know, it's not intended for residents.

836
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:46,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's intended for for visitors and it's a, it's an area for.

837
01:31:48,855 --> 01:31:51,877
[SPEAKER_07]: for those deliveries to occur.

838
01:31:52,478 --> 01:32:07,508
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not an easy path to come in from Myrtle, go around the internal roundabout, pass the townhomes, to then come to the driveway where

839
01:32:09,929 --> 01:32:20,434
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're already coming from the West, I think it's more likely that you choose to use the Amaranth access point.

840
01:32:21,175 --> 01:32:30,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So the traffic that's on Felsway is likely to be using that Felsway access point.

841
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,302
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the rest of that project traffic

842
01:32:35,142 --> 01:32:35,702
[SPEAKER_07]: comes from.

843
01:32:36,663 --> 01:32:50,292
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of Mr. Chow's other questions, the bike usage, I think it's a relatively small component of the trips.

844
01:32:50,632 --> 01:32:58,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we basically, if you look at the existing data,

845
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:20,728
[SPEAKER_07]: the transit and the walk and the work from home and the other modes that people use, that accounts for about

846
01:33:22,905 --> 01:33:32,509
[SPEAKER_07]: looks like it accounts for about 30% of usage without considering the bike percentage.

847
01:33:32,849 --> 01:33:40,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're already assuming 77% of trips using vehicles.

848
01:33:40,693 --> 01:33:42,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's already a conservative assumption.

849
01:33:42,954 --> 01:33:44,575
[SPEAKER_07]: If we backed out the,

850
01:33:45,415 --> 01:34:08,604
[SPEAKER_07]: If we backed out that 5% bike percentage and used the work from home as is in the census data and used the others commuting mode as is in the census data, we'd only be using 70% of the traffic assigned to vehicular trips.

851
01:34:09,364 --> 01:34:14,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's already a conservative assumption in that regard.

852
01:34:15,169 --> 01:34:24,436
[SPEAKER_07]: The trips that are counted or that are projected do include all users because they're trips of the driveways for sites.

853
01:34:24,496 --> 01:34:36,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So they include delivery vehicles, they include trash trucks, they include as well as the residence trips.

854
01:34:38,687 --> 01:34:44,510
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I do understand the point about people moving in and out of.

855
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:59,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the of the complexes and, you know, it's that's and they're moving trucks and those are things that we're we're continuing to study with the with the with the site plan and and evaluating these.

856
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,561
[SPEAKER_07]: These kinds of kinds of issues.

857
01:35:04,542 --> 01:35:06,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. chair, if I may, thank you.

858
01:35:08,461 --> 01:35:10,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, please go ahead, Attorney Gallagher.

859
01:35:11,503 --> 01:35:20,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to add on to what Scott was saying that so, you know, as as Pat had mentioned, we had a very productive meeting yesterday with the beta team.

860
01:35:20,188 --> 01:35:31,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as part of that, we were talking about TDM measures and other tactics that we could use to lessen the impact of the additional trips that we're talking about.

861
01:35:32,196 --> 01:35:36,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think as we go through this, and I know that beta is still reviewing

862
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:38,630
[SPEAKER_03]: and is going to provide written comments.

863
01:35:39,331 --> 01:35:50,393
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, we would certainly look at things like traffic calming as a way to encourage trips in a particular direction, such as out to the Fellsway.

864
01:35:51,253 --> 01:36:00,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the types of things that we spoke about and are definitely looking at and we'll look for betas and the board's input as well on those.

865
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:03,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

866
01:36:03,137 --> 01:36:09,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's 5% of the trips coming out of that entrance, is that even necessary then?

867
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:14,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Is closing that entrance optional?

868
01:36:14,161 --> 01:36:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're saying like 5% of the trips come out of there, then it sounds like it's a useless feature to the building.

869
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:29,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So my understanding of the history is this was originally added as a way for delivery that didn't

870
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:44,161
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, rely on, um, the other entrances and that would be close to the front of the building and for, um, I think maybe some of the parking for the leasing office or something was proposed there.

871
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:51,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's been changed a little bit because I think it's also the way a fire truck heading north would need to enter the

872
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:55,359
[SPEAKER_05]: property from the west side.

873
01:36:55,379 --> 01:36:56,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

874
01:36:56,559 --> 01:36:57,299
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

875
01:36:57,419 --> 01:36:59,720
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the site plan we're proceeding with at this point.

876
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:00,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

877
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:03,601
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

878
01:37:03,661 --> 01:37:07,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, Scott, one last clarification just so I'm clear.

879
01:37:07,382 --> 01:37:17,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So Felsway heading north, a resident who's going to use the Felsway entrance would do a U-turn north of the site and then come down.

880
01:37:17,485 --> 01:37:18,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

881
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:43,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and we know that there's a lot of congestion there, but it seems like that is still a preferable move as compared with that traffic wanting to make a left turn and then going down central to come down

882
01:37:49,151 --> 01:38:03,600
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have some of the traffic that's expected to do that, but there's probably going to be more delay associated with that type of movement than there would be with the U-turn.

883
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:07,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do have some traffic that's

884
01:38:08,923 --> 01:38:26,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's coming to the site from the west, some traffic that's coming from Riverside and coming from Central, and some of that traffic is coming in Amaranth, and a lot of the traffic is on Fells Way.

885
01:38:26,413 --> 01:38:38,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And just due to the nature of the locations and the access on Fells Way, that traffic is going to be making U-turn maneuvers at those two intersections.

886
01:38:39,241 --> 01:38:39,645
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thanks.

887
01:38:39,969 --> 01:38:40,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, did you have a question?

888
01:38:42,274 --> 01:38:48,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think at the previous meeting, I had brought that up about that U-turn, and I've driven around the area.

889
01:38:48,976 --> 01:39:09,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, realistically, the options coming up the Fellsway are to go up to the intersection, do a U-turn, come down the Fellsway, come in the Fellsway entrance, go up to the intersection, take a left, come down Kenmare, or potentially what some people might choose to do is come up the Fellsway to Riverside, go down Riverside, up

890
01:39:11,422 --> 01:39:15,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Spring Street, and then come down Lawrence.

891
01:39:17,105 --> 01:39:21,247
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that's much more complex than going up to the Fellsway.

892
01:39:21,267 --> 01:39:22,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's less likely to happen.

893
01:39:24,428 --> 01:39:24,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

894
01:39:25,008 --> 01:39:25,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

895
01:39:26,049 --> 01:39:26,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

896
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:29,090
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

897
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:33,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have other members of the public who would like to speak on this matter?

898
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:39,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not see any.

899
01:39:40,532 --> 01:39:44,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a moment to close the public.

900
01:39:44,235 --> 01:39:44,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.

901
01:39:44,656 --> 01:39:46,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is speaking.

902
01:39:46,057 --> 01:39:47,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody came off mute.

903
01:39:48,339 --> 01:39:50,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's someone who keeps unmuting themselves.

904
01:39:50,741 --> 01:39:56,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll double check if they actually wanted to speak or if it's just a technology issue.

905
01:39:57,107 --> 01:40:00,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there another member of the public that wants to speak or was that just an accidental unmute?

906
01:40:06,153 --> 01:40:07,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it was an accident on mute.

907
01:40:08,275 --> 01:40:13,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of this session of the hearing.

908
01:40:13,999 --> 01:40:16,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

909
01:40:16,421 --> 01:40:17,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

910
01:40:18,623 --> 01:40:18,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

911
01:40:18,943 --> 01:40:21,445
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

912
01:40:22,806 --> 01:40:23,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

913
01:40:24,528 --> 01:40:24,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

914
01:40:26,029 --> 01:40:26,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

915
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:27,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

916
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:28,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

917
01:40:28,351 --> 01:40:28,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

918
01:40:28,831 --> 01:40:29,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie?

919
01:40:29,792 --> 01:40:29,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

920
01:40:32,215 --> 01:40:37,340
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, the public portion of this session of the hearing is now closed.

921
01:40:39,822 --> 01:40:48,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the board, other questions or comments before we move on to next step logistical items?

922
01:40:49,932 --> 01:40:51,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

923
01:40:51,773 --> 01:40:53,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Yvette was jumping in.

924
01:40:53,515 --> 01:40:55,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I apologize.

925
01:40:56,676 --> 01:41:00,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you pull up the map where you would do that U-turn?

926
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:11,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think that was one of the intersections, right, that was spoken about, that have been given the, that was the low-rated one, right, to confirm.

927
01:41:15,147 --> 01:41:15,667
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

928
01:41:16,468 --> 01:41:17,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

929
01:41:17,168 --> 01:41:25,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, so there's, so there's location four, which is central and the Felsway, and then location one, which is Riverside and the Felsway.

930
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:32,123
[SPEAKER_11]: And so was there any discussion about the possibility of improving that?

931
01:41:32,143 --> 01:41:44,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm recollecting that that U-turn line can get really long, and I recognize it's a bad intersection already, and it's not going to improve necessarily.

932
01:41:44,649 --> 01:41:55,354
[SPEAKER_11]: But was there any, is there, could there be any discussion of, you know, other developments have sometimes improved the streets around them in different ways, and so.

933
01:41:55,945 --> 01:41:58,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, is that something that could happen?

934
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:07,384
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know what that would look like, but, you know, extending that left turn, that left turn, your lane or what, but.

935
01:42:08,905 --> 01:42:26,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, we, when we did the analysis, it showed that really all of the, there's a lot of delay, a lot of queuing on all four approaches and all the movements within the approaches.

936
01:42:28,371 --> 01:42:34,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if you, you know, you could potentially look at

937
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:44,446
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, modifications to signal timing, but then you're really prioritizing one movement at the expense of another.

938
01:42:47,949 --> 01:43:01,778
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as modifying the median there to possibly extend it or extend the left turn lane, we have not looked at that yet.

939
01:43:03,348 --> 01:43:18,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I could just add onto that too, I think, um, you know, again, the, the charge and what we're, what we're trying to look at here is how we can mitigate our impact to the greatest extent that we can.

940
01:43:18,861 --> 01:43:19,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

941
01:43:19,061 --> 01:43:23,905
[SPEAKER_03]: But these two intersections already are at the lowest rated level of service.

942
01:43:24,825 --> 01:43:30,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so I think, you know, we're, we're going to have those conversations and do

943
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:37,584
[SPEAKER_03]: what we can within reason and within the scope of what Chapter 40B is asking for.

944
01:43:38,965 --> 01:43:47,913
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to be realistic that there are some real limitations, I think, on our ability to make any sort of physical change to the Fells Way.

945
01:43:51,436 --> 01:43:52,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to be clear, those

946
01:43:53,064 --> 01:43:59,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Limitations include the need for conversations and buy-in with MassDOT?

947
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:02,132
[SPEAKER_05]: With DCR, actually.

948
01:44:02,473 --> 01:44:02,853
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

949
01:44:03,434 --> 01:44:07,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

950
01:44:08,838 --> 01:44:09,199
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

951
01:44:09,239 --> 01:44:12,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Yvette, if you're done with your questions, then Andre is next.

952
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:17,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I do have a couple more questions and comments.

953
01:44:18,391 --> 01:44:21,812
[SPEAKER_04]: One is just around the parking management itself.

954
01:44:21,932 --> 01:44:27,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hear you speak to how the parking spaces would be allocated.

955
01:44:29,275 --> 01:44:32,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Would, since you're not all the

956
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:41,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't hear you talk about kind of like how they would be allocated, would residents pay for their parking?

957
01:44:41,252 --> 01:44:47,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And what about how a visitor space is managed?

958
01:44:52,296 --> 01:44:55,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Mr. LaRue, I think those are all things that

959
01:44:57,224 --> 01:44:58,764
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have an answer for you yet on.

960
01:45:00,065 --> 01:45:03,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're certainly looking at all of those questions.

961
01:45:05,206 --> 01:45:19,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask Pat, if you have anything to add to that, but I think for now, the answer is that we'll follow up with you, but we're going through that process and that'll be part of our conversations with the peer reviewer as well.

962
01:45:22,029 --> 01:45:22,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

963
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:24,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And another,

964
01:45:25,503 --> 01:45:27,176
[SPEAKER_04]: My other comment slash question is,

965
01:45:29,347 --> 01:45:35,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the transportation demand management plan is a little bit weak.

966
01:45:36,792 --> 01:45:50,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see some additional kinds of incentives to your residents to use the bus system so that we can exceed the mode share numbers for transit.

967
01:45:51,761 --> 01:45:56,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if you could think a little creatively about that, whether that means

968
01:45:58,551 --> 01:46:07,315
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, helping residents get subsidized passes or subsidizing passes yourself or things like that.

969
01:46:07,355 --> 01:46:09,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that there are some creative ideas out there.

970
01:46:09,836 --> 01:46:11,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an expert in this area.

971
01:46:15,676 --> 01:46:22,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something that, you know, that came up yesterday in our conversation with Beta and with Director Hunt.

972
01:46:22,421 --> 01:46:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, again, that's something that we'll certainly look at.

973
01:46:26,704 --> 01:46:33,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would put into that bucket as well, you know, we would be very interested in trying to get a blue bike station out there.

974
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:42,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that if that's something that looks like it's going to be feasible, I think that would add a lot as well in trying to promote bike usage.

975
01:46:49,432 --> 01:46:49,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

976
01:46:49,732 --> 01:46:51,553
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

977
01:46:52,313 --> 01:46:54,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions or comments from the board?

978
01:47:07,579 --> 01:47:07,779
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

979
01:47:07,799 --> 01:47:08,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing any.

980
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:13,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have our peer reviewers from beta on the call.

981
01:47:14,202 --> 01:47:16,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like there's been some initial

982
01:47:17,465 --> 01:47:19,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Discussions with the applicant.

983
01:47:19,287 --> 01:47:21,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to check in.

984
01:47:22,371 --> 01:47:24,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking at the list.

985
01:47:24,253 --> 01:47:26,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Jeff on, for example.

986
01:47:28,178 --> 01:47:37,128
[SPEAKER_05]: From a timeline perspective, based on the information and discussions you have today, when do you think we'll have more details in terms of the peer review letter?

987
01:47:45,702 --> 01:47:47,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

988
01:47:47,824 --> 01:47:53,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we've done an initial preliminary read-through of the report.

989
01:47:55,689 --> 01:48:01,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I've identified some additional information at this point, clarifications, those sorts of things.

990
01:48:03,254 --> 01:48:11,700
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have not done a deep dive into checking the calculations, you know, the appendices, that sort of information.

991
01:48:14,727 --> 01:48:18,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, site visits, we need to go out to the site and observe.

992
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:21,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Traffic conditions, take some measurements.

993
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:26,014
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're going to need another another couple of weeks.

994
01:48:26,274 --> 01:48:26,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like.

995
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:32,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually on vacation next week, so that's kind of a dead week.

996
01:48:33,998 --> 01:48:38,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So, maybe a couple of weeks after that, we just need some time to do a.

997
01:48:39,261 --> 01:48:40,962
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a complete review.

998
01:48:42,502 --> 01:48:57,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a good, you know, we had a good discussion yesterday, several of the issues that the board members brought up, you know, like Andre just brought up with parking and TDM, we had the same initial reactions or questions.

999
01:48:57,869 --> 01:49:07,813
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know some of that already, but we have to get into the details and that takes a little more time to do.

1000
01:49:11,084 --> 01:49:12,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, thank you for the update.

1001
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:16,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that due to the

1002
01:49:17,773 --> 01:49:23,776
[SPEAKER_05]: order in which things are presented in the continuance, we're not tracking to the original schedule anyway.

1003
01:49:24,917 --> 01:49:35,302
[SPEAKER_05]: But so the original intention was that, I guess, if we kind of carry forward the things we haven't done yet.

1004
01:49:35,382 --> 01:49:43,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next thing the board would like to see is the updated architectural plans.

1005
01:49:46,055 --> 01:49:55,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess the meeting after that would be when we'd ideally want to review the updated engineering and traffic plans, as well as the peer review comments.

1006
01:49:55,759 --> 01:50:08,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to check in with, so to be clear, so our next session of this hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, March 26, so in a little less than two weeks.

1007
01:50:09,005 --> 01:50:10,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be the one where

1008
01:50:11,584 --> 01:50:17,166
[SPEAKER_05]: If everything follows the schedule, the next step would be updated architectural plans.

1009
01:50:17,846 --> 01:50:24,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that would mean the Thursday, April 11th would be the one where it's the engineering and the traffic.

1010
01:50:25,029 --> 01:50:33,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to check in with the applicant to just coordinate on next topics.

1011
01:50:33,431 --> 01:50:36,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that we're tracking to that?

1012
01:50:37,053 --> 01:50:40,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what should we be doing with these upcoming hearings?

1013
01:50:42,127 --> 01:50:45,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Mister chair I I think we're in agreement on that approach.

1014
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:56,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now we're hoping to deliver an updated architectural package to the city and and the board and and our peer reviewer at Davis square.

1015
01:50:56,515 --> 01:51:10,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe at the end of this week or early next with the goal of having a follow-up session with with our peer reviewer next week and being able to present on that at our upcoming hearing on the 26th.

1016
01:51:11,925 --> 01:51:14,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then for the following hearing on April 11th.

1017
01:51:15,667 --> 01:51:23,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree that to the extent beta has had a chance to provide comments, we'll certainly be in a position to talk through.

1018
01:51:23,752 --> 01:51:27,795
[SPEAKER_03]: The transportation analysis and more detail.

1019
01:51:28,534 --> 01:51:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also add to that, that I think, and I can defer to Bill Lucas on this, but I think we'll be in a position to have a more fulsome discussion on the updated civil set.

1020
01:51:40,123 --> 01:51:51,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if not necessarily have written comments, we'll at least be able to introduce the full civil plan set on April 11th.

1021
01:51:51,272 --> 01:51:53,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill, is that, am I speaking out of turn or is that correct?

1022
01:51:54,468 --> 01:51:55,689
[SPEAKER_13]: You are not speaking out of turn.

1023
01:51:55,729 --> 01:51:56,650
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.

1024
01:51:57,030 --> 01:52:03,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Our plan is to deliver an updated set of civil drawings by the end of next week.

1025
01:52:03,996 --> 01:52:14,985
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully, that will allow sufficient time for Beda to work through that and give us good feedback in time for the 11th.

1026
01:52:17,968 --> 01:52:18,848
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, great.

1027
01:52:19,569 --> 01:52:20,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like a plan then.

1028
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:27,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there other topics we should be discussing tonight before we move on?

1029
01:52:27,132 --> 01:52:38,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we covered the primary intended topics for the night, just checking in if there's something else that we needed to discuss, whether it's logistic or otherwise.

1030
01:52:39,369 --> 01:52:56,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's everything from the applicant's perspective, Mr. Chair, and, you know, again, we're very appreciative of the board's time and of our peer reviewers' time, and think we've been having some really good conversations and looking forward to continuing those.

1031
01:52:56,765 --> 01:52:58,146
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very excited about the project.

1032
01:52:59,407 --> 01:53:00,168
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, wonderful.

1033
01:53:00,508 --> 01:53:01,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for the update.

1034
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:05,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Great to see the progress here.

1035
01:53:06,001 --> 01:53:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so with that, Chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to our special meeting on Tuesday, March 26th at 6.30 PM.

1036
01:53:22,246 --> 01:53:22,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

1037
01:53:22,626 --> 01:53:23,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

1038
01:53:23,907 --> 01:53:24,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

1039
01:53:24,627 --> 01:53:27,348
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

1040
01:53:27,568 --> 01:53:28,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

1041
01:53:28,148 --> 01:53:28,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1042
01:53:29,568 --> 01:53:29,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

1043
01:53:30,769 --> 01:53:30,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1044
01:53:31,309 --> 01:53:31,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yvette?

1045
01:53:32,729 --> 01:53:32,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1046
01:53:33,529 --> 01:53:33,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie?

1047
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:33,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1048
01:53:35,954 --> 01:53:36,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, aye.

1049
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:37,836
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1050
01:53:37,896 --> 01:53:40,959
[SPEAKER_05]: This matter is continued to that date.

1051
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:42,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, folks.

1052
01:53:43,302 --> 01:53:43,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good night.

1053
01:53:47,146 --> 01:53:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two other items on the agenda, just administrative updates and the meeting.

1054
01:53:51,751 --> 01:53:54,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we have any administrative updates tonight?

1055
01:54:00,788 --> 01:54:03,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I think relating to this, nothing comes to mind.

1056
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:07,333
[SPEAKER_08]: The only other thing would be the discussion for our meeting 2 weeks hence just.

1057
01:54:08,473 --> 01:54:11,055
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to do some of that during this portion of the meeting.

1058
01:54:12,076 --> 01:54:16,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I think you're referring to just coordinating.

1059
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:20,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a scheduling matter for the for our regular meeting.

1060
01:54:20,442 --> 01:54:20,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

1061
01:54:22,121 --> 01:54:22,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1062
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:22,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1063
01:54:22,861 --> 01:54:24,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that's something we don't have to do.

1064
01:54:26,062 --> 01:54:29,623
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do that offline too, but yeah, we'll do that offline.

1065
01:54:30,103 --> 01:54:30,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay.

1066
01:54:30,883 --> 01:54:31,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1067
01:54:32,143 --> 01:54:32,483
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1068
01:54:32,563 --> 01:54:33,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a meeting minutes.

1069
01:54:34,404 --> 01:54:37,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I know I sent you some, but I'm trying to remember which ones I sent you.

1070
01:54:37,784 --> 01:54:38,485
[SPEAKER_08]: So I apologize.

1071
01:54:38,505 --> 01:54:43,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I have the many times Rachel has done a bunch and they've been very good.

1072
01:54:43,146 --> 01:54:45,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just can't remember which ones I've sent you and which ones I haven't.

1073
01:54:45,986 --> 01:54:47,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the January 25th.

1074
01:54:50,543 --> 01:54:57,749
[SPEAKER_05]: and the January 11th, which I think those were the regular meetings.

1075
01:55:01,032 --> 01:55:02,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1076
01:55:02,314 --> 01:55:04,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't sent you the February one, so that's apologies for that.

1077
01:55:04,776 --> 01:55:06,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get you that before the next one.

1078
01:55:06,097 --> 01:55:16,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, yeah, just the ones from Rachel for the, I think we still have to approve the meeting minutes for the special meeting as well.

1079
01:55:18,652 --> 01:55:21,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, those are the ones I was mostly referring to, the special meetings, the ones that I've sent you.

1080
01:55:22,095 --> 01:55:24,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I can't remember.

1081
01:55:24,677 --> 01:55:26,018
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of meeting minutes.

1082
01:55:26,618 --> 01:55:31,762
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just trying to go back to look at what my sent emails are.

1083
01:55:32,182 --> 01:55:32,463
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1084
01:55:32,943 --> 01:55:33,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1085
01:55:33,563 --> 01:55:37,787
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I don't believe we have meeting minutes to approve tonight.

1086
01:55:37,867 --> 01:55:39,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like a plan.

1087
01:55:39,488 --> 01:55:43,671
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll send those to us, and then we'll approve at our next meeting.

1088
01:55:44,091 --> 01:55:44,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound good?

1089
01:55:45,698 --> 01:55:45,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

1090
