At this time, I'd ask everyone to please rise to salute the flag.

18
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:29,503
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:45,893

27
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,792
internet issues here at city hall.

28
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:12,157

31
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:34,979
Medford, M-E-D-F-O-R-D dash M-A dot gov.

32
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:41,844
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

33
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:53,253
2-0-6-7-4 offered by council and I being resolved that the Memphis city council requests the discontinuance of the use of asphalt sidewalk replacement panels in the city of Medford.

34
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,774
Councilor Knight.

35
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:55,614
Yes, Mr. President.

36
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:10,334
Some maybe four years ago, the DPW implemented a practice where they would use asphalt to replace sidewalk panels with the intention of coming back at a later date and replacing them with concrete when concrete crews are out performing the type of work.

37
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,535
But what I'm seeing is that it's becoming

38
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:21,417
few and far between that these asphalt replacement panels are actually replacement panels, Mr. President.

39
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:28,144
They stand there, I think, far past their shelf life, and they're degrading at a rate that would be much faster than that of our concrete sidewalks.

40
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:31,407
Plus, they don't necessarily have the same curb appeal.

41
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,630
And just not as aesthetically pleasing, Mr. President.

42
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:48,039
So we've seen issues across the community where asphalt sidewalks have been put in front of the Morris Memorial Hospital, for example, and other places where the neighborhood really hasn't liked the look of it, hasn't wanted that to be the standard that's acceptable in our community.

43
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:50,280
And I really don't think it is an acceptable standard, Mr. President.

44
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:58,166
So with that being said, I'm asking that the DPW discontinue the use of using asphalt sidewalk replacement panels and revert back to using concrete.

45
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:03,832
or some other semi-pervious material, Mr. President, that has a little bit more curb appeal than that of a black asphalt.

46
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:06,214
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

47
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:08,597
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

48
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:20,610
Mr. President, just if I could, and I understand what Councilor Knight's intent is, there are areas in the city that strictly have just asphalt sidewalks.

49
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:32,236
And I just want to make sure that we're not just discontinuing the use of asphalt in general, because there are areas in the city that require the replacement of asphalt.

50
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:33,797
So I just want to make that known.

51
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:43,440
I think Councilor Layton is pushing for where it's replacing existing cement sidewalk, but I just want to make sure we're not discontinuing the use of asphalt in general.

52
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,421
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

53
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,162
To me, the continuity of aesthetics, Mr. President.

54
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:49,689
Is that Councilor Knight?

55
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:52,590
To remain, to have some continuity in the aesthetics.

56
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:53,411
Absolutely.

57
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:54,651
Thank you very much.

58
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:55,812
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

59
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,053
Any other questions or comments from the council?

60
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,434
Clerk Hertoghez, have you received any emails?

61
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:01,634
I have not.

62
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:02,655
Okay, you have not.

63
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:07,456
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

64
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,217
Councilor Behrs?

00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:11,498

Councilor Morrell?

73
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:14,079
Yes.

74
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:15,480
Councilor Scarpelli?

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,560
Yes.

76
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:16,838
Yes.

77
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:17,819
President Falco.

78
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:18,239
Yes.

79
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,280
Senator the affirmative.

80
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,261
Zero in the negative.

81
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:21,221
The motion passes.

82
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:36,353
2 0 dash 6 7 5 offered by council appears to be resolved by the Memphis city council that the update on the COVID-19 mitigation actions and COVID-19 safety enforcement actions requested at the council's December 8th meeting be presented.

83
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,413
Councilor Behrs.

84
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:38,674
Thank you, Mr. President.

85
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:44,839
Um, I want to acknowledge that we did get a written update today from a health director O'Connor on this topic.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,861
I would like to motion to table this until next week so that we can have that presented.

87
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:50,821
Thank you.

88
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,522
Councilor Pierce, was that sent late this afternoon or?

89
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:55,922
I believe, yeah.

90
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:59,643
I mean, my email has been a little, city email has also been having issues.

91
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,104
So I've not been able to send emails.

92
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:03,724
I don't know if everyone has received it, but I got an email around 4.30.

93
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:04,084
Okay.

94
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:05,445
No problem.

95
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:05,945
Okay.

96
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:06,985
Thank you.

97
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,738
So there's a motion to table, if I'm correct?

98
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,058
Yeah, motion to table for one week.

99
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:12,579
Till next week?

100
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:13,359

125
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:28,573
Vice President Caravaglio?

126
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:28,873
Yes.

127
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:29,554

Yes.

129
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:30,854
Councilor Marks?

130
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:31,314
Yes.

131
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:32,674
Councilor Morrell?

132
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:33,094
Yes.

133
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,175

20-677 offered by Councilor Knight.

140
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:49,858
Be it resolved that the city administration provide to the council, provide the council with a copy of its COVID vaccination distribution plan.

141
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,511
Councilor Neidt.

142
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:54,293
Mr. President, I feel as though this is a rather self-explanatory resolve.

143
00:07:55,033 --> 00:08:07,962
I'm just asking to know what it is, what approach it is that the city administration intends to take when vaccinations become available in our community, what the sites are going to be, what the locations are going to be, who the priority individuals to receive the vaccination will be.

144
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:12,005
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that this paper be forwarded to the administration for a written response.

145
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,406
Thank you, Councilor Neidt.

146
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,348
Any other questions or comments from the council?

147
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:17,589
Second.

148
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,851
Clerk Rodriguez, any emails?

149
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,015
No emails, Mr. President.

150
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:22,255
No emails.

151
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,736
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

152
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:26,557

162
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

163
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,020
Councilor Scarpelli.

164
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,321

00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:48,745
Second.

173
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,446
Is it tabled for a week, or is it just tabled?

174
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:50,866
One week, yeah.

175
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,778
table to next week, Councilor Night?

176
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:57,899
Whatever, we can always take it off the table if it doesn't have a date on it, but yeah, that's fine, next week is great.

177
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,780
So on the motion of Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly to table 20-678.

178
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,981
So is it, I'm still unclear, is it for one week or is it just general tabling?

179
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:08,461
I'm still unclear.

180
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,182
I believe it's a general.

181
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:12,562
Next.

182
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:13,422
Just put it on next week.

183
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:14,222
Next week.

184
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:16,363
Thank you, Councilor.

185
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:23,516
On that motion, Clerk Turner, please call the roll.

186
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:23,957
Yes.

187
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:25,578
Yes.

188
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:26,699
Yes.

189
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,002
Yes.

190
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:29,482
Yes.

191
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:31,224

192
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:32,305
Yes.

193
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,387
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

194
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:35,929
The motion passes.

195
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:45,946
Reports to committee is 20-295, 19-660, and 20-519.

196
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:52,191
There was a Committee of the Whole meeting on December 2nd, 2020, to discuss those matters.

197
00:09:52,971 --> 00:10:02,198
The purpose of the meeting was to review and update the collection bin ordinance, the promote, prevent, support behavioral health commission ordinance, and the rodent ordinance.

198
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,280
We received updates from

199
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,426
our city solicitor, as well as attorney Stein from KP law.

200
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:14,592
And we should be receiving updates back from the city solicitor's office soon.

201
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:18,717
All the motion of council Scott Kelly to approve that report.

00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,560
Seconded by councilor Knight.

203
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,903

The motion passes.

220
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,027
It was last Tuesday.

221
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,088
I don't know which one it was.

222
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,289
I can go get it if you need me to.

223
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,204
Okay, 20-643, December 8th, 2020.

224
00:10:55,264 --> 00:11:01,587
That was the committee, the whole report regarding taxes and setting a tax rate for the upcoming year.

225
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:09,650
On the motion of Vice President Caravaglia, to approve, seconded by Councilor Behrs, Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

226
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:11,651

227
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,111
Yes.

228
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:13,131
Vice President Caravaglia?

229
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:13,412
Yes.

230
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,212

Yes.

236

Councilor Scarpelli?

237
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:18,654
Yes.

238
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:19,474
President Falco?

239
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,890
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

240
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,651
The motion passes.

241
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:27,112
20-568, December 9th, 2020, Committee of the Whole.

242
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:31,553
That was our Committee of the Whole report with our zoning consultant, Mark Fabroski.

243
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:40,657
We talked to him about a number of issues and he will be sending us a draft of our zoning report.

244
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:48,198
updated zoning, and that should be coming, I believe he said right around Christmas Eve, so that would be next Thursday, I believe.

245
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:54,282
On the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, for her to be, please call the roll.

246

Councilor Behrs.

Yes.

248
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:59,189
Vice President Caravaglia.

249
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,470
Yes.

250
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,210
Councilor Knight.

251
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,691
Yes.

252
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:01,271
Councilor Marks.

253
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:01,711
Yes.

254
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:02,452
Councilor Morrell.

255
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:02,892
Yes.

256
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:03,753
Councilor Scarpelli.

257
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:03,853
Yes.

258
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:04,934
President Falcone.

259
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:05,374
Yes.

260
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:07,976

Motion to take papers under suspension, Mr. President.

262
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:14,621
I have a motion of Vice President Caravaglia to take papers under suspension, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

263
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:15,762
Clerk Herter, please call the roll.

264
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:20,659
Councilor Behrs?

265
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:20,999
Yes.

266
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,261
Vice President Caravaglia?

267
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:22,681
Yes.

268
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:23,442
Councilor Knight?

269
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:23,682
Yes.

270
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:24,664
Councilor Marks?

271
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,204
Yes.

272
00:12:25,565 --> 00:12:26,146
Councilor Morrell?

273
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:26,526
Yes.

274
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,407
Councilor Scarpelli?

275
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:27,687
Yes.

276
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:28,569
President Falco?

277
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,849
Yes.

278
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,651
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

279
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,612
The motion passes.

280
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:34,906
20-682 offered by Councilor Marks.

281
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:50,205
Be it resolved that the Medford High School Hall of Famer, Brian Branson, be recognized and officially honored by the City of Medford for his several decades of unselfish volunteerism and commitment to Medford High student-athletes and sport programs.

282
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:51,327
Councilor Marks.

283
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:58,652
Thank you, Mr. President, and it's an honor and pleasure to speak tonight on behalf of Brian Branson, Mr. President.

284
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:07,619
Anyone that has come in contact with Brian or personally knows Brian can attest to his character, Mr. President.

285
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,160
Brian is a courageous man.

286
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:20,408
While fighting and battling a current illness, he still gives himself to others, Mr. President.

287
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:35,153
and still finds time in his own trying time to find time to be kind to others and to donate his time, Mr. President, which to me speaks volumes about a person and who they are.

288
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:37,634
He's a true gentleman.

289
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:40,435
He's a kind heart and a good friend.

290
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:50,750
And I know there are a number of people, Mr. President, that have contacted me that would like to speak on Brian's behalf.

291
00:13:51,330 --> 00:14:01,895
However, where Zoom is not operating tonight, I would ask that you give residents the liberty next week if they choose to speak on this, Mr. President.

292
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:04,496
So I would respectfully ask that that happen.

293
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:12,058
Brian is a Mustang and has Mustang pride embedded in his DNA.

294
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,279
He has, as we refer to, blue and white.

295
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:26,481
Anyone that has played sports for Meffitt High School or volunteered for the sport program, in my opinion, have blue and white that runs through their veins.

296
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,141
And Brian is no different.

297
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,342
He bleeds blue and white.

298
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,042
And as a

299
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:37,586
member of the Hall of Fame, which I can't say I've ever been inducted, Mr. President.

300
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:41,188
It's a big privilege to be a member of the Hall of Fame.

301
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:47,252
And Brian truly is that person that deserves the honor, Mr. President.

302
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:55,317
He volunteered every Saturday for 20 years to help student athletes at Meffitt High School.

303
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:56,758
20 years of a commitment.

304
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:02,523
never once looked for any recognition, never once waved a banner and said, look what I'm doing.

305
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:06,687
Everything was behind the scenes, and he did it to help student athletes out.

306
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,910
And again, that speaks volumes about a person.

307
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,794
He's a current and active baseball umpire.

308
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,456
And he loves the sport.

309
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:18,617
He likes to be around it.

310
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,118
He likes the camaraderie.

311
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:22,559
He likes dealing with the athletes.

312
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,803
And he's a fair man as I think anyone would speak when they mention his name.

313
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:37,589
He was involved for many years and still is with Medford High baseball and the football programs as the equipment manager.

314
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,170
And that's a tough job.

315
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,651
Don't think for a second that's not a tough job.

316
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:46,833
And the stats manager, which is equally a tough job, Mr. President.

317
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:53,117
Brian is involved with the coaches versus cancer yearly charity fundraiser.

318
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:54,577
Mr. President.

319
00:15:55,037 --> 00:16:12,561
It's an event that's part of the American Cancer Society, and it spotlights cancer awareness through the playing of our national pastime to raise money, in which it raised tens of thousands of dollars for cancer, Mr. President.

320
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:16,262
And Brian has been part of that over the years.

321
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:22,503
Brian also played senior Babe Ruth baseball for the Memphis Rotary Colts,

322
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:30,264
And he helped coach Method's Mega Club, which is a long established club in this community.

323
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:45,067
And I think it's only fitting, Mr. President, to find someone that has such a commitment to this community and dedication, unselfishness, and reward them, Mr. President.

324
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:47,488
So I would respectfully ask my colleagues,

325
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:54,931
That we send, we don't want to vote on it tonight, we can vote on it next week because this was offered under suspension.

326
00:16:54,971 --> 00:17:01,114
But where it's a congratulatory thing, Mr. President, I think it would be acceptable voting on it tonight.

327
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:10,159
I would respectfully ask that we vote to send this paper to the athletic director at Meffitt High School and also the Hormel Commission.

328
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:29,265
and have them come up in unison with some naming dedication, Mr. President, that would rightfully fit Brian Branson and all the years, the decades of volunteerism and service to Medford High School athletes and the entire community in general.

329
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:35,148
So I would respectfully offer that tonight, Mr. President, and I just want to personally thank Brian.

330
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:46,174
We're both 1984 graduates of Meffitt High School, and I just personally would like to thank him, Mr. President, for his many years of volunteerism in this community.

331
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:47,775
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

332
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:52,798
Thank you, and thank you for Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

333
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:58,181
You want to talk about an individual in this community where, you know, you're seeing so many

334
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,574
So many social issues and so many variations of what's right and wrong in this world.

335
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:12,058
And Brian Branson is what's true and what's real about Medford.

336
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:22,665
He was and still is one of the most dedicated people to this community, their kids and their sports and mostly anything.

337
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,627
One thing that it's funny that I've known Brian probably my whole life.

338
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,870
And you don't realize he's a great family man.

339
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:31,272
He's a proud dad.

340
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:34,456
He's someone that's committed to his children.

341
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:41,964
But at the same time, you wouldn't know that if you were a Mustang, because it seems like Brian's always given to Memphis High and the blue and white.

342
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:59,257
I am fortunate that I am on the Hall of Fame with Bryan Branson and to be on the plaque or on a committee or on a group that has Bryan Branson as a representative to me is an honor as a Hall of Famer.

343
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,964
He is that type of person.

344
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:06,628
I've often coached while Brian umpired games.

345
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:10,691
And Brian's not afraid to tell you what's up.

346
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:13,673
And he's a man of strong conviction.

347
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:18,136
And I think he always taught sportsmanship and fair play.

348
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:25,042
And how always to work hard and always love Medford.

349
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,924
You know, one thing he doesn't realize, I don't know how

350
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:46,252
In today's society, when you have individuals with different physical issues, I'm proud that this community rallies around young kids that have these disabilities, and we really champion that.

351
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:56,718
Brian grew up in an era where I can remember that if you had a kid with vision issues or hearing issues, you didn't talk about it.

352
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,639
That person never stood out.

353
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:04,403
Brian Branson had his issues and never hid from it.

354
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,404
He was always on the forefront.

355
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,345
And that's why, to me, he was a hero.

356
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,706
He let nothing get in his way.

357
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:16,828
He didn't mind to be with any group in the high school or anywhere in this community.

358
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:19,509
And he always stood strong as a Mustang.

359
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,890
And I'm proud to call him my friend.

360
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:31,073
So I know Brian's going through a tough time in his life right now, and he truly is a warrior, truly a warrior.

361
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:44,555
And for Council Marks to bring this forward, when you talk about naming rights of different entities and you want to say why or why not, and Brian is a perfect example to say why.

362
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:45,896
Why aren't we?

363
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:47,056
Why wouldn't we?

364
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,657
Because you want that name to go down in history.

365
00:20:53,475 --> 00:21:04,544
that kids will always talk about, and that story will always be told, and who Brian Branson is, and what he's done for our community, and the city of Medford, because he's left that type of impression.

366
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,066
At least for one council, that's what he's left with me.

367
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:13,811
And I know my children, when my son is around Brian, he understands why he's there.

368
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:20,437
So when you wanna do something, go do something because nobody's watching, because that's what Brian Branson has always taught us.

369
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:23,679
Go do something because you love it.

370
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,940
Go do something because you have pride in something.

371
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,900
I don't expect for anything else.

372
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:32,302
And that's why I'm rambling on tonight because he wouldn't want this.

373
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,383
He wouldn't expect it, but he deserves it.

374
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:41,285
So I know I'm a little winded, but if anybody needs that wind, it's Brian Branson.

375
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:42,366
So thank you.

376
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,626
Council Marks for bringing this forward.

377
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:44,387
Thank you.

378
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:55,171
And if I may quickly, I first met Brian Branson when I was 15 years old.

379
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,611
I was a sophomore at High School.

380
00:21:57,711 --> 00:22:05,693
And like Councilor Marks mentioned, Brian was the team manager for the football team.

381
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,013
And believe it or not, I played football.

382
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:16,095
And, but he was, he's just an amazing, amazing person in, you know,

383
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,271
people like Brian are people that you want in your community.

384
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:29,054
And I remember being 15 years old and I remember learning, you know, right away from coach Bud Kelly, you know, and he would always talk about, you know, blue and white running through your veins.

385
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,674
You have blue and white running through your veins.

386
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:38,317
And that was all about Mustang football and being dedicated and committed and being someone who was committed to the team, but also committed to the city and working hard.

387
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:42,158
And that's someone, and I will tell you something, there is no one that has

388
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:46,027
We're blue and white running through their veins and Brian Branson.

389
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,755
He is a remarkable person who

390
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:58,224
just, you know, just very dedicated to our community, dedicated to sports at the high school for years.

391
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:07,646
And like Councilor Mark said, I think at least probably 20 years that he was a statistician at the high school, you know, working with the football team and the baseball team.

392
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,046
And I remember seeing him every Saturday when I played.

393
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:14,207
And then after that, I'd come back and he was still there and he was still doing it and he loved it.

394
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,208
And he loved giving back and,

395
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:20,710
And, you know, later on in life, he decided, well, I'm going to be an umpire.

396
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,811
And I remember saying to him, you sure you want to do that?

397
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,472
And he wanted to do it and he loves doing it.

398
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:36,237
And I know he goes out to Cooperstown every year to, you know, to actually the home of our, actually that's where our city clerk was born and raised.

399
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:42,380
But he, Brian would go out there every year to umpire baseball games for the whole weekend.

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,461
And he loved it, and he enjoyed it, and he always gave back.

401
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:49,542
And so I think this is a very fitting honor.

402
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,763
Council Marks, I thank you for bringing this forward.

403
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:57,044
Councilor Scarpelli and Council Marks, you both hit it on the head with the words that you had to say.

404
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:04,887
He's completely committed to our city, to the youth of our community, and it's a well-deserved honor.

405
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:09,648
So on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

406
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:11,929
Clerk Herterby, please call the roll.

407
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:14,417
Councilor Behrs?

408
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:14,858
Yes.

409
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:16,359
Vice President Caravaglio?

410
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:16,639
Yes.

411
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:17,659
Councilor Night?

412
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,000
Yes.

413
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,940
Councilor Marks?

414
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,421
Yes.

415
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:20,241
Councilor Morrell?

416
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:20,661
Yes.

417
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:21,742
Councilor Scarpelli?

418
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:22,022
Yes.

419
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:22,883
President Falco?

420
00:24:22,943 --> 00:24:23,143
Yes.

421
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:24,844
Seven affirmative, zero negative.

422
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:31,708
The motion passes under suspension offered by Vice President Caravaglio, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks.

423
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:35,611
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate

424
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:40,986
John Giglio from VIP Barbershop.

425
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:47,068
On his recent retirement, John owned and operated VIP Barbershop for over 50 years.

426
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,308
Vice President Caviello.

427
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:49,288
Thank you, Mr. President.

428
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:55,670
Mr. President, I think you're going to find it very hard to find someone who hasn't gotten a haircut.

429
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:57,764
from John over the years.

430
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:03,107
John, he was a Memphis Square staple as long as I can remember.

431
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:06,229
I remember when I was young, I got my haircut there.

432
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:10,452
He was doing hairstyling when it wasn't even fashionable to do hairstyling.

433
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:17,976
And now he's finally hanging up his scissors after 50 plus years of cutting people's hair.

434
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:23,640
So I just want to wish John a healthy retirement and wherever he

435
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:28,350
wherever he goes on his next adventure, but good guy and good community guy.

436
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:30,877
And I say, he'll be missing the square.

437
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:32,982
Thank you, Vice President Capiello.

438
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:33,583
Counselor Marks.

439
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:39,062
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on.

440
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:48,629
As Councilor Caviello mentioned, that Brian was synonymous with, John was synonymous with the square.

441
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,110
And indeed, I got my haircut back.

442
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,833
I think everyone, like you said, got their haircut at some point.

443
00:25:55,733 --> 00:26:00,581
And you know what, Mr. President, I stopped going there because John gave one haircut.

444
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:05,568
So when you went in there and said, I like this or this, John gave you the haircut he wanted to give you.

445
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,915
Everyone had that haircut, Mr. President.

446
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:11,654
He was a good guy.

447
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:13,415
You go in there, you talk about sports.

448
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:16,417
I still don't know how, I know he's been there a long time.

449
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:19,418
If you look at him, he doesn't look like he's ready to retire.

450
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,039
He's in good shape.

451
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:21,900
He's good.

452
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,721
I mean, everything about him looks good.

453
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:25,061
I wish him well, Mr. President.

454
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:26,122
He will be missed.

455
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:32,085
Those faces that you come to know and love in an area, and then they're not there any longer.

456
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:36,107
You do miss it, Mr. President, but this retirement is well,

457
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:39,190
And I wish him well, Mr. President.

458
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,131
Thank you, Counsel Marks.

459
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:41,373
Counselor Scarapelli.

460
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:42,193
Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:43,795
Again, thank you for my colleagues bringing this forward.

462
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:47,299
I know that John was a great guy.

463
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,807
The only difference between myself and my colleagues, something happened with my head and theirs.

464
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:56,209
So he must have used a different tonic.

465
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,232
that he lost my business at about 30.

466
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:05,074
But I will tell you, my son's first haircut.

467
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:10,416
I'll never forget the day making that trip to VIP and strapping John in.

468
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,078
And I've gone through a lot of tough times with my son that really questioned

469
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,159
Your father and son really shook you up a little.

470
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,380
But watching John put my son in a headlock to give him his first haircut was something special.

471
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,782
But he did it with such love that, you know what, he was in good hands.

472
00:27:30,802 --> 00:27:33,142
He was a great businessman.

473
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:38,464
Like my colleague said, he could talk about politics in the city.

474
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,604
He could talk about politics nationwide.

475
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,845
He could talk about any sports program.

476
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:48,529
As I coached high school sports, he knew my record.

477
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:50,731
He knew what was going on with the team.

478
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:58,198
Always kept involved and whenever you'd hear him speak to other clients and you want to jump in the conversation.

479
00:27:58,238 --> 00:28:01,380
So it really truly became that community meeting spot.

480
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:08,765
I know that he's got some great barbers there now, but he's definitely going to be missed.

481
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,107
Wish him luck, like Councilman Mox said.

482
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:16,710
He must be going on 30 years old because he looks younger.

483
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,511
I don't know how it works.

484
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:25,507
A lot of my hair was left on that floor, Councilor Falco, and I blame him, but thank you.

485
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,689
Thank you.

486
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,770
All of it.

487
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:34,955
And if I may also congratulate John on his recent retirement.

488
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:40,900
John watched me go from absolutely full head of hair.

489
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:43,923
At one time I actually had Adam Knight hair, I think.

490
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:45,684
No, you didn't.

491
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:46,605
No, you didn't.

492
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:49,990
It was a long time ago, at least for Kavya.

493
00:28:51,152 --> 00:28:58,363
But at one time it was that thick, and that's when I first met John, and he saw me from the beginning to this, so.

494
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,267
but I want to wish John well on his retirement.

495
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,549
Like my colleague said, John is a great guy, fabulous guy.

496
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:08,930
We'll miss seeing him in the square.

497
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,771
I used to always see him in the square.

498
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:17,475
If not, you know, cutting here, we'd be walking around or getting a coffee, but just a fabulous guy, great guy to talk to.

499
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,056
And we wish him well on his retirement.

500
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:28,601
