[SPEAKER_01]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

33
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:53,253
[SPEAKER_01]: 2-0-6-7-4 offered by council and I being resolved that the Medford city council requests the discontinuance of the use of asphalt sidewalk replacement panels in the city of Medford.

34
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Knight.

35
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:55,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mr. President.

36
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:10,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Some maybe four years ago, the DPW implemented a practice where they would use asphalt to replace sidewalk panels with the intention of coming back at a later date and replacing them with concrete when concrete crews are out performing the type of work.

37
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm seeing is that it's becoming

38
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:21,417
[SPEAKER_03]: few and far between that these asphalt replacement panels are actually replacement panels, Mr. President.

39
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:28,144
[SPEAKER_03]: They stand there, I think, far past their shelf life, and they're degrading at a rate that would be much faster than that of our concrete sidewalks.

40
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:31,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, they don't necessarily have the same curb appeal.

41
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And just not as aesthetically pleasing, Mr. President.

42
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:48,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've seen issues across the community where asphalt sidewalks have been put in front of the Morris Memorial Hospital, for example, and other places where the neighborhood really hasn't liked the look of it, hasn't wanted that to be the standard that's acceptable in our community.

43
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:50,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really don't think it is an acceptable standard, Mr. President.

44
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:58,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I'm asking that the DPW discontinue the use of using asphalt sidewalk replacement panels and revert back to using concrete.

45
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:03,832
[SPEAKER_03]: or some other semi-pervious material, Mr. President, that has a little bit more curb appeal than that of a black asphalt.

46
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:06,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

47
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:08,597
[SPEAKER_01]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

48
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:20,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, just if I could, and I understand what Councilor Knight's intent is, there are areas in the city that strictly have just asphalt sidewalks.

49
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:32,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to make sure that we're not just discontinuing the use of asphalt in general, because there are areas in the city that require the replacement of asphalt.

50
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:33,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make that known.

51
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:43,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Councilor Layton is pushing for where it's replacing existing cement sidewalk, but I just want to make sure we're not discontinuing the use of asphalt in general.

52
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

53
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,162
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, the continuity of aesthetics, Mr. President.

54
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:49,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Councilor Knight?

55
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:52,590
[SPEAKER_03]: To remain, to have some continuity in the aesthetics.

56
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:53,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

57
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:54,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

58
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:55,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

59
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

60
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Clerk Hurtubise, have you received any emails?

61
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:01,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not.

62
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:02,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you have not.

63
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:07,456

00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:28,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

131
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:32,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell?

132
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:33,094

00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:49,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it resolved that the city administration provide to the council, provide the council with a copy of its COVID vaccination distribution plan.

141
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Knight.

142
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:54,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I feel as though this is a rather self-explanatory resolve.

143
00:07:55,033 --> 00:08:07,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just asking to know what it is, what approach it is that the city administration intends to take when vaccinations become available in our community, what the sites are going to be, what the locations are going to be, who the priority individuals to receive the vaccination will be.

144
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:12,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that this paper be forwarded to the administration for a written response.

145
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

146
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

147
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:17,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

148
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Clerk Rodriguez, any emails?

149
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,015
[SPEAKER_06]: No emails, Mr. President.

150
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:22,255
[SPEAKER_01]: No emails.

00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:50,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it resolved that the Medford High School Hall of Famer, Brian Branson, be recognized and officially honored by the City of Medford for his several decades of unselfish volunteerism and commitment to Medford High student-athletes and sport programs.

282
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:51,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Marks.

283
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:58,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President, and it's an honor and pleasure to speak tonight on behalf of Brian Branson, Mr. President.

284
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:07,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that has come in contact with Brian or personally knows Brian can attest to his character, Mr. President.

285
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian is a courageous man.

286
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:20,408
[SPEAKER_04]: While fighting and battling a current illness, he still gives himself to others, Mr. President.

287
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:35,153
[SPEAKER_04]: and still finds time in his own trying time to find time to be kind to others and to donate his time, Mr. President, which to me speaks volumes about a person and who they are.

288
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:37,634
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a true gentleman.

289
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:40,435
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a kind heart and a good friend.

290
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:50,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there are a number of people, Mr. President, that have contacted me that would like to speak on Brian's behalf.

291
00:13:51,330 --> 00:14:01,895
[SPEAKER_04]: However, where Zoom is not operating tonight, I would ask that you give residents the liberty next week if they choose to speak on this, Mr. President.

292
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:04,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would respectfully ask that that happen.

293
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:12,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian is a Mustang and has Mustang pride embedded in his DNA.

294
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,279
[SPEAKER_04]: He has, as we refer to, blue and white.

295
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:26,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that has played sports for Medford High School or volunteered for the sport program, in my opinion, have blue and white that runs through their veins.

296
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brian is no different.

297
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,342
[SPEAKER_04]: He bleeds blue and white.

298
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a

299
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:37,586
[SPEAKER_04]: member of the Hall of Fame, which I can't say I've ever been inducted, Mr. President.

300
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:41,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big privilege to be a member of the Hall of Fame.

301
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:47,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brian truly is that person that deserves the honor, Mr. President.

302
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: He volunteered every Saturday for 20 years to help student athletes at Medford High School.

303
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:56,758
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years of a commitment.

304
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:02,523
[SPEAKER_04]: never once looked for any recognition, never once waved a banner and said, look what I'm doing.

305
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:06,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was behind the scenes, and he did it to help student athletes out.

306
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, that speaks volumes about a person.

307
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,794
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a current and active baseball umpire.

308
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And he loves the sport.

309
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:18,617
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes to be around it.

310
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,118
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes the camaraderie.

311
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:22,559
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes dealing with the athletes.

312
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's a fair man as I think anyone would speak when they mention his name.

313
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:37,589
[SPEAKER_04]: He was involved for many years and still is with Medford High baseball and the football programs as the equipment manager.

314
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a tough job.

315
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think for a second that's not a tough job.

316
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:46,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And the stats manager, which is equally a tough job, Mr. President.

317
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:53,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian is involved with the coaches versus cancer yearly charity fundraiser.

318
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:54,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

319
00:15:55,037 --> 00:16:12,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an event that's part of the American Cancer Society, and it spotlights cancer awareness through the playing of our national pastime to raise money, in which it raised tens of thousands of dollars for cancer, Mr. President.

320
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:16,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brian has been part of that over the years.

321
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:22,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian also played senior Babe Ruth baseball for the Medford Rotary Colts,

322
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:30,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And he helped coach Method's Mega Club, which is a long established club in this community.

323
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:45,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's only fitting, Mr. President, to find someone that has such a commitment to this community and dedication, unselfishness, and reward them, Mr. President.

324
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:47,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would respectfully ask my colleagues,

325
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:54,931
[SPEAKER_04]: That we send, we don't want to vote on it tonight, we can vote on it next week because this was offered under suspension.

326
00:16:54,971 --> 00:17:01,114
[SPEAKER_04]: But where it's a congratulatory thing, Mr. President, I think it would be acceptable voting on it tonight.

327
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:10,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I would respectfully ask that we vote to send this paper to the athletic director at Medford High School and also the Hormel Commission.

328
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:29,265
[SPEAKER_04]: and have them come up in unison with some naming dedication, Mr. President, that would rightfully fit Brian Branson and all the years, the decades of volunteerism and service to Medford High School athletes and the entire community in general.

329
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:35,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would respectfully offer that tonight, Mr. President, and I just want to personally thank Brian.

330
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:46,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We're both 1984 graduates of Medford High School, and I just personally would like to thank him, Mr. President, for his many years of volunteerism in this community.

331
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:47,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

332
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:52,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, and thank you for Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

333
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:58,181
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to talk about an individual in this community where, you know, you're seeing so many

334
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So many social issues and so many variations of what's right and wrong in this world.

335
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:12,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And Brian Branson is what's true and what's real about Medford.

336
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:22,665
[SPEAKER_05]: He was and still is one of the most dedicated people to this community, their kids and their sports and mostly anything.

337
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,627
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that it's funny that I've known Brian probably my whole life.

338
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't realize he's a great family man.

339
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:31,272
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a proud dad.

340
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:34,456
[SPEAKER_05]: He's someone that's committed to his children.

341
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:41,964
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, you wouldn't know that if you were a Mustang, because it seems like Brian's always given to Medford High and the blue and white.

342
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:59,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I am fortunate that I am on the Hall of Fame with Bryan Branson and to be on the plaque or on a committee or on a group that has Bryan Branson as a representative to me is an honor as a Hall of Famer.

343
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,964
[SPEAKER_05]: He is that type of person.

344
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:06,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I've often coached while Brian umpired games.

345
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:10,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And Brian's not afraid to tell you what's up.

346
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:13,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's a man of strong conviction.

347
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:18,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think he always taught sportsmanship and fair play.

348
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:25,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And how always to work hard and always love Medford.

349
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,924
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one thing he doesn't realize, I don't know how

350
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:46,252
[SPEAKER_05]: In today's society, when you have individuals with different physical issues, I'm proud that this community rallies around young kids that have these disabilities, and we really champion that.

351
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:56,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian grew up in an era where I can remember that if you had a kid with vision issues or hearing issues, you didn't talk about it.

352
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,639
[SPEAKER_05]: That person never stood out.

353
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:04,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian Branson had his issues and never hid from it.

354
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,404
[SPEAKER_05]: He was always on the forefront.

355
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why, to me, he was a hero.

356
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: He let nothing get in his way.

357
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:16,828
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't mind to be with any group in the high school or anywhere in this community.

358
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:19,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And he always stood strong as a Mustang.

359
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm proud to call him my friend.

360
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:31,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know Brian's going through a tough time in his life right now, and he truly is a warrior, truly a warrior.

361
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:44,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And for Council Marks to bring this forward, when you talk about naming rights of different entities and you want to say why or why not, and Brian is a perfect example to say why.

362
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:45,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't we?

363
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:47,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wouldn't we?

364
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you want that name to go down in history.

365
00:20:53,475 --> 00:21:04,544
[SPEAKER_05]: that kids will always talk about, and that story will always be told, and who Brian Branson is, and what he's done for our community, and the city of Medford, because he's left that type of impression.

366
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,066
[SPEAKER_05]: At least for one council, that's what he's left with me.

367
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:13,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know my children, when my son is around Brian, he understands why he's there.

368
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:20,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you wanna do something, go do something because nobody's watching, because that's what Brian Branson has always taught us.

369
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:23,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Go do something because you love it.

370
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Go do something because you have pride in something.

371
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't expect for anything else.

372
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:32,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I'm rambling on tonight because he wouldn't want this.

373
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,383
[SPEAKER_05]: He wouldn't expect it, but he deserves it.

374
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know I'm a little winded, but if anybody needs that wind, it's Brian Branson.

375
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:42,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

376
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Marks for bringing this forward.

377
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:44,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

378
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:55,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I may quickly, I first met Brian Branson when I was 15 years old.

379
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a sophomore at High School.

380
00:21:57,711 --> 00:22:05,693
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Councilor Marks mentioned, Brian was the team manager for the football team.

381
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe it or not, I played football.

382
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:16,095
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but he was, he's just an amazing, amazing person in, you know,

383
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,271
[SPEAKER_01]: people like Brian are people that you want in your community.

384
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:29,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember being 15 years old and I remember learning, you know, right away from coach Bud Kelly, you know, and he would always talk about, you know, blue and white running through your veins.

385
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,674
[SPEAKER_01]: You have blue and white running through your veins.

386
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:38,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all about Mustang football and being dedicated and committed and being someone who was committed to the team, but also committed to the city and working hard.

387
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:42,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's someone, and I will tell you something, there is no one that has

388
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:46,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We're blue and white running through their veins and Brian Branson.

389
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,755
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a remarkable person who

390
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:58,224
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, just very dedicated to our community, dedicated to sports at the high school for years.

391
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:07,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Councilor Mark said, I think at least probably 20 years that he was a statistician at the high school, you know, working with the football team and the baseball team.

392
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember seeing him every Saturday when I played.

393
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:14,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, I'd come back and he was still there and he was still doing it and he loved it.

394
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And he loved giving back and,

395
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:20,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, later on in life, he decided, well, I'm going to be an umpire.

396
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember saying to him, you sure you want to do that?

397
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to do it and he loves doing it.

398
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:36,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know he goes out to Cooperstown every year to, you know, to actually the home of our, actually that's where our city clerk was born and raised.

399
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:42,380
[SPEAKER_01]: But he, Brian would go out there every year to umpire baseball games for the whole weekend.

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And he loved it, and he enjoyed it, and he always gave back.

401
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:49,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think this is a very fitting honor.

402
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Council Marks, I thank you for bringing this forward.

403
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:57,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Scarpelli and Council Marks, you both hit it on the head with the words that you had to say.

404
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:04,887
[SPEAKER_01]: He's completely committed to our city, to the youth of our community, and it's a well-deserved honor.

405
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:09,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

406
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:11,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

407
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:14,417

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:16,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello?

410
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:16,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

411
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:17,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

412
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

413
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

414
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

415
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:20,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell?

416
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:20,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

417
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:21,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

418
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:22,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

419
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:22,883
[SPEAKER_06]: President Falco?

420
00:24:22,943 --> 00:24:23,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

421
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:24,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven affirmative, zero negative.

422
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:31,708
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion passes under suspension offered by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks.

423
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:35,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate

424
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:40,986
[SPEAKER_01]: John Giglio from VIP Barbershop.

425
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:47,068
[SPEAKER_01]: On his recent retirement, John owned and operated VIP Barbershop for over 50 years.

426
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President Caraviello.

427
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:49,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

428
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:55,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I think you're going to find it very hard to find someone who hasn't gotten a haircut.

429
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:57,764
[SPEAKER_02]: from John over the years.

430
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:03,107
[SPEAKER_02]: John, he was a Medford Square staple as long as I can remember.

431
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:06,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I was young, I got my haircut there.

432
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:10,452
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing hairstyling when it wasn't even fashionable to do hairstyling.

433
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:17,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he's finally hanging up his scissors after 50 plus years of cutting people's hair.

434
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:23,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to wish John a healthy retirement and wherever he

435
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:28,350
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever he goes on his next adventure, but good guy and good community guy.

436
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:30,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, he'll be missing the square.

437
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:32,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vice President Capiello.

438
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:33,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Marks.

439
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:39,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on.

440
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:48,629
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Caraviello mentioned, that Brian was synonymous with, John was synonymous with the square.

441
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And indeed, I got my haircut back.

442
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone, like you said, got their haircut at some point.

443
00:25:55,733 --> 00:26:00,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, Mr. President, I stopped going there because John gave one haircut.

444
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you went in there and said, I like this or this, John gave you the haircut he wanted to give you.

445
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone had that haircut, Mr. President.

446
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:11,654
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a good guy.

447
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:13,415
[SPEAKER_04]: You go in there, you talk about sports.

448
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:16,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't know how, I know he's been there a long time.

449
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:19,418
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at him, he doesn't look like he's ready to retire.

450
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,039
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in good shape.

451
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:21,900
[SPEAKER_04]: He's good.

452
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything about him looks good.

453
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:25,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish him well, Mr. President.

454
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:26,122
[SPEAKER_04]: He will be missed.

455
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:32,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Those faces that you come to know and love in an area, and then they're not there any longer.

456
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:36,107
[SPEAKER_04]: You do miss it, Mr. President, but this retirement is well,

457
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:39,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wish him well, Mr. President.

458
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Counsel Marks.

459
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:41,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarapelli.

460
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:43,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, thank you for my colleagues bringing this forward.

462
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:47,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that John was a great guy.

463
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,807
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference between myself and my colleagues, something happened with my head and theirs.

464
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:56,209
[SPEAKER_05]: So he must have used a different tonic.

465
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,232
[SPEAKER_05]: that he lost my business at about 30.

466
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:05,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will tell you, my son's first haircut.

467
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:10,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget the day making that trip to VIP and strapping John in.

468
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've gone through a lot of tough times with my son that really questioned

469
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Your father and son really shook you up a little.

470
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But watching John put my son in a headlock to give him his first haircut was something special.

471
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,782
[SPEAKER_05]: But he did it with such love that, you know what, he was in good hands.

472
00:27:30,802 --> 00:27:33,142
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a great businessman.

473
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:38,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my colleague said, he could talk about politics in the city.

474
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,604
[SPEAKER_05]: He could talk about politics nationwide.

475
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,845
[SPEAKER_05]: He could talk about any sports program.

476
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:48,529
[SPEAKER_05]: As I coached high school sports, he knew my record.

477
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:50,731
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew what was going on with the team.

478
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:58,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Always kept involved and whenever you'd hear him speak to other clients and you want to jump in the conversation.

479
00:27:58,238 --> 00:28:01,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really truly became that community meeting spot.

480
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:08,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that he's got some great barbers there now, but he's definitely going to be missed.

481
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Wish him luck, like Councilman Mox said.

482
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:16,710
[SPEAKER_05]: He must be going on 30 years old because he looks younger.

483
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how it works.

484
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:25,507
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of my hair was left on that floor, Councilor Falco, and I blame him, but thank you.

485
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

486
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,770
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it.

487
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:34,955
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I may also congratulate John on his recent retirement.

488
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:40,900
[SPEAKER_01]: John watched me go from absolutely full head of hair.

489
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:43,923
[SPEAKER_01]: At one time I actually had Adam Knight hair, I think.

490
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:45,684
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't.

491
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:46,605
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't.

492
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:49,990
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago, at least for Kavya.

493
00:28:51,152 --> 00:28:58,363
[SPEAKER_01]: But at one time it was that thick, and that's when I first met John, and he saw me from the beginning to this, so.

494
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,267
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to wish John well on his retirement.

495
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my colleague said, John is a great guy, fabulous guy.

496
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:08,930
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll miss seeing him in the square.

497
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to always see him in the square.

498
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:17,475
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, you know, cutting here, we'd be walking around or getting a coffee, but just a fabulous guy, great guy to talk to.

499
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wish him well on his retirement.

500
