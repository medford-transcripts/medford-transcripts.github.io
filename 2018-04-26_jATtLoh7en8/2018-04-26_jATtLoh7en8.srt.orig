00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,564

152
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:26,380
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's been a lot of concern, especially in the West Medford neighborhood, about local businesses on Wednesdays closing early so that kids that get out of school on early release day don't have a place to go, really, and it's creating a situation.

153
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an understanding that you're going to be open 11 a.m.

00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:30,898

00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:31,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

158
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:34,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have no problem with the student kids in the neighborhood coming into the school?

159
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:34,539
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

160
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:34,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

161
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:35,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

162
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:36,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.

163
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:37,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

164
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, sir.

165
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

166
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Move approval of the question, Mr. President.

167
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

168
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Want some oxygen?

169
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:45,562
[SPEAKER_04]: You want some?

170
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:48,142
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli.

171
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:50,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

172
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,303
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

173
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

174
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:52,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

175
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:53,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

176
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Medford.

177
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:59,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Communications from the Mayor.

178
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:14,017
[SPEAKER_04]: 13382, dear President Caraviello and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request that the City Council approve the following list of food trucks for the events that are scheduled for coming months.

179
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:23,660
[SPEAKER_04]: West Medford Open Studios, Circle the Square, Medford Farmers Market, Hoops and Hopes, Medford Diversity Festival, Students of the Fells,

180
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:27,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Methodist and Mystic River celebrations.

181
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:28,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

182
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:33,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, it's common course for this council to approve food trucks.

183
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:40,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks has explained in the past the difficulty it is sometimes in securing a food truck for a date like this and without having a date in advance.

184
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:45,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very important that we take a look at this and take the appropriate steps to ensure that these food trucks are approved.

185
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,164
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, Mr. President, I certainly have no problem approving these.

186
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:53,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's about time we revisit whether or not we should establish an ordinance on such.

187
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.

188
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:57,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mox.

189
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

190
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,652
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no problem approving this.

191
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:06,256
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the event at Circle the Square, it mentions various locations.

192
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:16,403
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, as one member of the council, would want to make sure that whatever is being done is not placed in front of an already existing food establishment.

193
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:22,647
[SPEAKER_13]: And would ask that the paper be amended

194
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:27,984
[SPEAKER_13]: to have the administration provide locations for this particular event, Mr. President.

195
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:29,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

196
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:31,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scott Belli.

197
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:32,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

198
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:34,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Councilor Marks will bring that forward.

199
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:36,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed that.

200
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:38,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I think that Councilor Knight's right.

201
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:40,687
[SPEAKER_12]: We might need to look at something more permanent.

202
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:47,669
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I think the biggest sticking point was when it was affecting food trucks that were affecting our brick and mortar businesses.

203
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:51,850
[SPEAKER_12]: So I, too, would second that resolve from my colleague.

204
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

205
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:56,584
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Nights, second and by?

206
00:25:58,244 --> 00:25:58,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

207
00:25:58,785 --> 00:25:59,625
[SPEAKER_04]: By Councilor Scott Pell.

208
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,305
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

209
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:00,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

210
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:01,825
[SPEAKER_12]: As amended.

211
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:03,486
[SPEAKER_04]: As amended by Councilor Marks.

212
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:05,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

213
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:22,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Hugh McIsaac on his recent passing.

214
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:23,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

215
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

216
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:31,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. McIsaac was a resident of Method for many years, and he recently passed away.

217
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:34,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And just thoughts and prayers to the family.

218
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

219
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Would I like to rise for a moment of silence, please?

220
00:26:50,698 --> 00:27:08,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Scott Pelley, be it resolved that the City Administration, being Director of DPW, report back to this Council to see if we could add decorative banners, barrels, I'm sorry, barrels throughout our streets.

221
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

222
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor.

223
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:15,603
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caviello, I apologize for the chicken scratch.

224
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:31,321
[SPEAKER_12]: This is, I've received many phone calls and emails over the last few weeks about the lack of community barrels placed throughout our main streets and roads.

225
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:44,306
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's happening, especially in front of most of our convenience stores that sell lottery tickets and such, what's happening when people are exiting those

226
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:53,498
[SPEAKER_12]: businesses that people don't find, uh, can't find a place to discard those from what I've been told.

227
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:59,861
[SPEAKER_12]: And they throw them down and they blow down the side streets and end up in front of a neighbor's houses.

228
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:06,264
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, I took a tour down cherry street, um, just yesterday.

229
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:16,310
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, that street from what the residents sent me pictures that, uh, he would come home at night, uh, sweep the front of his house,

230
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:29,673
[SPEAKER_12]: leave for work, come back, send me the picture of the next day with the same type of litter, cigarette packs, wrappers, candy wrappers, and then mostly just scratch tickets and such.

231
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:41,443
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that what we're seeing is even if you go through, traverse through our business districts, you don't see as many barrels, especially decorative barrels, that could be placed around our community.

232
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:46,747
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd ask the city administration, the DPW director, to maybe give us a price and see if they can give us

233
00:28:48,026 --> 00:29:03,956
[SPEAKER_12]: what we can do to place these most needed barrels throughout our community so we can look at it when it comes to budget time, or is that something we can look at for the city administration for our complete streets as we move forward with that?

234
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,118
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I appreciate your time.

235
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:08,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

236
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:09,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

237
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. President.

238
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a very fitting resolution, considering we just celebrated Earth Day just a couple of days ago.

239
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:22,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all gotten some correspondence from individuals in the community expressing concern about the cleanliness of our streets as well.

240
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:31,269
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, Mr. President, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, especially because Counselor Schiappelli is actually asking the administration to come up with a price, what it's going to cost, what the impact.

241
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:41,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to amend the paper and ask that for every barrel that we install, that we look at, we also look at installing one of the solar-powered recycling receptacles that we see at our parks, Mr. President.

242
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:42,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd ask that this be added as either

243
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:50,658
[SPEAKER_02]: an amendment or a B paper, whichever the sponsor of the resolution prefers, so that we can get prices for that as well, and then how we can move forward on the issue.

244
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Constantin Rousseau.

245
00:29:52,599 --> 00:30:11,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Just as a comment, Mr. President, some years, over 25 years ago, one of my former confreres had graduated from the Sorbonne in France, and the treasurer of the college went to his graduation and noticed that the city of Paris used a special cast-iron public trash barrel.

246
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:28,015
[SPEAKER_06]: He somehow contacted the director of the DPW of the city of Paris, or the director or commissioner de sanitaire, found out where those cast iron barrels were made.

247
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:33,037
[SPEAKER_06]: He ordered them and put them all over the college campus.

248
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:40,880
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 years later, undented and only with a second coat of paint, they still function very well.

249
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

250
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:53,598
[SPEAKER_04]: We do, the cast iron barrels that we do have, the Secretary of the Prime Minister is in town, so perhaps we can check with him.

251
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

252
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

253
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this forward.

254
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,823
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a major issue throughout our city.

255
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:11,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I've received many emails as well with regard to colonialism in the city, and we should be making sure that, you know, people are keeping it clean, but also giving them the opportunity to actually

256
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:17,036
[SPEAKER_08]: throw things away, you know, have barrels thrown on streets with trash cans.

257
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:24,922
[SPEAKER_08]: As I wait for the bus every day on Salem Street, there are trash cans, you know, all the way down Salem Street.

258
00:31:24,942 --> 00:31:29,866
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think that this is true for all of our major thoroughfares throughout the streets.

259
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:39,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could get a list from the DPW as to what streets actually have public trash cans or public barrels, because it'd be interesting to see.

260
00:31:39,894 --> 00:31:41,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't, I know they,

261
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:50,535
[SPEAKER_08]: They go down Salem Street, but I don't think, as far as I know, that they are down most of our thoroughfares throughout the city.

262
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:56,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could get a listing from the DPW department as to where they are located, I'd greatly appreciate it.

263
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:57,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great resolution.

264
00:31:57,997 --> 00:31:59,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's something that we should be doing.

265
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:07,779
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have, especially if you take a look at bus stops, you know, people are always on the bus stop, you know, they're eating, they're getting ready to go, you know, get on the bus, whatnot.

266
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,860
[SPEAKER_08]: So we should be giving them somewhere where they can throw out their trash.

267
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you.

268
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:13,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

269
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:15,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

270
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to thank the Method Community Coalition and the Chamber of Commerce.

271
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:25,787
[SPEAKER_13]: They held a cleanup day this past Saturday in many of our business districts, and they did a tremendous job.

272
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:37,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe we all received an email regarding trash from one woman that her and her daughter were out, and she noticed a lot of cigarette butts.

273
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:41,000
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would say that, in addition to a trash barrel,

274
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:53,087
[SPEAKER_13]: that the city also look at putting cigarette receptacles where people can place a cigarette in, Mr. President, because you don't want them throwing them in a trash barrel that could cause a fire.

275
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:54,948
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask that, Mr. President.

276
00:32:55,668 --> 00:33:02,392
[SPEAKER_13]: The second thing is that I believe much of the debris we see around is because the fact that

277
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:05,876
[SPEAKER_13]: this community only sweeps our streets twice a year.

278
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:13,462
[SPEAKER_13]: It's inadequate for the number of businesses that we have, the number of vehicular cars that are cut through this community, that may dump trash.

279
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:31,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe that we have to impact and put together a full-fledged street sweeping program, which would sweep our streets more than twice a year, and also our neighborhoods, which much of this debris, as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned,

280
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:38,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I can tell you firsthand, living off the Felsway, that every day, indeed, I'm out there picking up trash that blows up the street.

281
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:42,747
[SPEAKER_13]: And you come out the next day, and it's more trash that's out there.

282
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:47,649
[SPEAKER_13]: And it ranges from Dunkin' Donuts to plastic bags to newspapers, you name it.

283
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:51,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the stuff you see out there is pretty amazing.

284
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,872
[SPEAKER_13]: A second thing, Mr. President, and I don't want to seem critical, but waste management.

285
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:07,007
[SPEAKER_13]: If you happen to see when they dump the barrels, it's pretty amazing how much trash gets left behind.

286
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:13,293
[SPEAKER_13]: When it picks up, the arm picks up, it dumps the thing in there, and then you see paper fly out here and there.

287
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:17,416
[SPEAKER_13]: And it may not seem like a lot in front of your house, but times that by 30,000 households,

288
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:24,517
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a fair number of trash that's somehow escaping from the truck and not getting in there.

289
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:35,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of it's due to barrels that are over strewn with trash, and the lids aren't closed properly, which was supposed to be a mandate in order to dump your trash.

290
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:38,250
[SPEAKER_13]: The lid had to be shut when the program first started.

291
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:43,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they seem to be very liberal in taking the trash, Mr. President.

292
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:48,176
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the second reason, I believe, you see additional trash.

293
00:34:48,476 --> 00:34:50,498
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's the lack of street sweeping in this community.

294
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:57,504
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also the waste management pickup, which I believe could be done more efficiently and effectively.

295
00:34:58,084 --> 00:35:08,273
[SPEAKER_13]: And the third point, Mr. President, and I had this discussion with the gentleman that called up regarding the trash along the sidewalks when he walks his pet.

296
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,015
[SPEAKER_13]: The dog's trying to eat stuff constantly that's

297
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:13,808
[SPEAKER_13]: left outside on the sidewalks.

298
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:25,212
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, we require by ordinance that people shovel in front of their home, even though it's a city sidewalk, that you take ownership and pride and you shovel in front of your home.

299
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:27,653
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you don't, you potentially could get a ticket.

300
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:39,137
[SPEAKER_13]: And someday we may need to expand that to also sweeping in front of your home and taking care of the public sidewalk in front of your home when it comes to cleanliness, Mr. President.

301
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:40,691
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's a bad idea.

302
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:47,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it shows a sense of pride and a sense of ownership, you know, and a lot of people do it anyways.

303
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:53,234
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I think this would go a long way to putting our best foot forward as a community.

304
00:35:53,574 --> 00:36:06,977
[SPEAKER_13]: When people drive through, which many thousands of people do, they see a city that's clean and taken care of and not a city that's littered with debris, which I hate to say is currently happening right now in our community.

305
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:09,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, so those would be my suggestions.

306
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:10,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

307
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:11,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Member Kern.

308
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Carviello.

309
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:21,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I too have gotten a few emails with regards to the neighborhoods and litter lingering on our streets.

310
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:30,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I think it may have came about because the Chamber of Commerce and Medford Community Coalition did do the cleanups this weekend, which went very well, by the way.

311
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:36,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I saw Councilor Carviello there at Haines Square cleaning up, and every square had people, a lot of people there.

312
00:36:38,459 --> 00:37:03,370
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the suggestions was, because it was so good this weekend, you had DPW involved as well and they gave out, I think Modern Hardware gave out brooms and everybody sweeping the streets and pushing all the, a lot of cigarette butts in front of, especially in front of a couple of those restaurants, but sweeping all the trash into the streets and then we had DPW on board who said they would come by later at night and sweep the streets.

313
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:06,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe that would be a good suggestion

314
00:37:07,362 --> 00:37:31,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who could organize it, maybe the administration through the mayor's office, but have a community citywide cleanup where people would register their street as part of the community cleanup, especially those ones near the business districts, hopefully get the businesses involved to just sweep everything into the streets and then have the DPW on board to come and

315
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:34,572
[SPEAKER_00]: clean the street at night, I think it would go a long way.

316
00:37:34,612 --> 00:37:37,373
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a spring street cleanup.

317
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:42,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that could be organized pretty quickly, and I think it would go a very long way.

318
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:59,077
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the staff to go through every single street and clean up the sidewalks, and if we could organize something where our trucks could come out an extra time to certain streets that are willing to participate, I really think it would go a long way, and I know a lot of residents who would see their neighbors

319
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:05,220
[SPEAKER_00]: people out, maybe get an organiser from each street to get notification of something like that.

320
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:15,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that's something that needs to be done because you have a lot of trash on some of our streets that aren't main thoroughfares that need to be cleaned, all over the sidewalks.

321
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:29,367
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to get done one way or another and there are people out there requesting, you know, having us request this type of organisation of such a clean-up and I think it's definitely something I would take part in and I think it would go, definitely help out the neighbourhoods.

322
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:30,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

323
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:31,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

324
00:38:31,998 --> 00:38:33,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, thanks for everybody.

325
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:34,539
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate everybody's input.

326
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:48,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that it's important that we as a city council really focus on making sure that the taxpayers get what they deserve when they pay their taxes.

327
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:54,127
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's basic necessities and making sure that our streets are cleaned.

328
00:38:54,147 --> 00:38:59,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's one of the frustrations of the neighbor that I talked to is that he's out there every single night

329
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:03,028
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's sweeping in front of his house every single night.

330
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:12,176
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we're not doing what we need to do as an administration, then that's a problem.

331
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:22,624
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's important that we get the prices for the barrels and the solar-powered barrels and also the cigarette dispensaries.

332
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:26,868
[SPEAKER_12]: But I also like the idea that we look at a formalized

333
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,494
[SPEAKER_12]: program of street sweeping.

334
00:39:29,874 --> 00:39:36,918
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's something we need to look at as a budgetary item when it comes, comes up this, uh, the spring.

335
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:38,839
[SPEAKER_12]: So, uh, thank you again.

336
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

337
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:55,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And being out there and said, you know, with council long ago, um, I think what you saw with the squares that have a package stores is you see the nip bottles, little plastic nip bottles are really rampant throughout, throughout the city.

338
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And because that's,

339
00:39:57,543 --> 00:40:03,487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big part of these small package stores is they're selling the little nips and people just leave them everywhere.

340
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:08,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, if that's where we could place some barrels near those things, that might help out a little bit more.

341
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Member O'Keefe.

342
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:17,395
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice just in front of the few restaurants that you know are open late in Haines Square, they're just a lot of cigarette butts.

343
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:22,338
[SPEAKER_00]: The parking lots were, we did a big cleanup of the Haines Square parking lot.

344
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we filled like 20 bags of just leaves and trash.

345
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:33,746
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is, no matter what it is, even dunking donuts lids, they were kind of all over with the straws and the cups.

346
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:42,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is trickling, like Councilor Scarpelli said, this is trickling into the neighborhoods where people are just walking around and throwing litter into our neighborhoods.

347
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:54,358
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think between the trash barrels and maybe a community citywide cleanup, and with the help of our DPW, like they did over the weekend, you can't go wrong.

348
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:56,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

349
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:58,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval of the question, Mr. President.

350
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:01,538
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley.

351
00:41:01,598 --> 00:41:03,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to speak in this matter?

352
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

353
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:05,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

354
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:06,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, sir.

355
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

356
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:15,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I have gone with my camera up and down the streets and it is a disaster.

357
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:17,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially the nip bottles.

358
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:22,316
[SPEAKER_09]: The nip bottles, I think maybe over at Sheridan, they were just like piles of them.

359
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:23,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like,

360
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:26,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any self-respect in the community?

361
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:31,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm forever picking up litter that comes in from the street into my driveway.

362
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:36,786
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a perpetual, one neighbor would actually come over and pick it up for me with a, with a stick.

363
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,866
[SPEAKER_09]: He felt so badly that it just comes in from the wind.

364
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:50,530
[SPEAKER_09]: So we, as a community, we need to, you know, it speaks volumes because one last, very quickly, when you come off of 93 and go down Salem street, as councilor DelaRusso knows, they fly.

365
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:58,384
[SPEAKER_09]: You have people from all sorts of communities bypassing Route 16 because there were fewer lights on Salem and Route 60.

366
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:00,706
[SPEAKER_09]: They see the mess.

367
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:04,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we have all sorts of people from different cities and towns seeing our mess.

368
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not good.

369
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:07,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford pride.

370
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:08,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

371
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:08,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

372
00:42:10,296 --> 00:42:11,937
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion by Councilor Scott Pele.

373
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:13,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

374
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,379
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

375
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

376
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

377
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Mox.

378
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:21,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that walking court be discussed.

379
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:22,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Mox.

380
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:23,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

381
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:33,752
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe we all received an email from a resident that was concerned about the living conditions of her parents living at Walkland Court.

382
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:45,060
[SPEAKER_13]: I happen to make a call and talk to the executive director, Mr. Driscoll, regarding some of the concerns that were mentioned, which was cleanliness of

383
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:58,083
[SPEAKER_13]: the building and we did receive several photos which showed a building that was in dire need of a sweep and some 409 and some heavy duty cleaning.

384
00:42:58,804 --> 00:43:02,286
[SPEAKER_13]: It was also mentioned that in this particular location

385
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:26,991
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been a concern with bed bugs in several of the units within Walkland Court, of which I was assured by the executive director that the exterminator that's been called out has been doing the proper number of treatments to eradicate the bed bugs, which I believe has to take at least a two to three week span and at least three treatments.

386
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:32,133
[SPEAKER_13]: And also the fact that when residents are told that

387
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:39,569
[SPEAKER_13]: their apartment will be exterminated, there should be a step-by-step process that they need to follow.

388
00:43:40,427 --> 00:44:07,336
[SPEAKER_13]: in order to eradicate the bed bugs, because if you take your sheeting and other items, clothing, and put it in storage, which may be in the basement of that facility while they're treating your apartment, and then after it's done, reintroduce all the stuff that was in the apartment, that may be the cause of reintroducing the bed bugs over and over, and also the spread of bed bugs within a particular housing unit.

389
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:09,677
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm confident now that

390
00:44:10,618 --> 00:44:21,889
[SPEAKER_13]: The executive director, Mr. Driscoll, is on top of this, that the proper professionals were called out in order to take care of the concerns.

391
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,273
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a cleaning crew that will be going through all the buildings.

392
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:30,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Another issue, Mr. President, was the dumpsters.

393
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:35,042
[SPEAKER_13]: According to this particular woman that contacted the council,

394
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:44,252
[SPEAKER_13]: that at any given time this furniture and a number of items that are left outside of this little alleyway, which is where they housed their dumpster.

395
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:50,437
[SPEAKER_13]: And the executive director assured me that he will have it monitored.

396
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:52,289
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not under lock and key.

397
00:44:53,110 --> 00:45:00,815
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, you probably have people dumping that don't live in the particular area and know there's a dumpster there and dumping items off.

398
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:06,959
[SPEAKER_13]: And depending on what the item is, it could be attracting rodents and infestation and other concerns.

399
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:19,828
[SPEAKER_13]: So he assured me that they were going to keep a close eye on the dumpster and potentially look at some type of locking mechanism that's only available to residents, which to me makes sense.

400
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:42,819
[SPEAKER_13]: The last concern which I discussed with Mr. Driscoll was based on what this particular Method resident reached out and said that when residents bring concerns, they're fearful that their concerns may be used against them or they may be told, well, if you keep on bringing these things up, you know, you're going to have to find housing somewhere.

401
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:46,321
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's pretty devastating when you're talking

402
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:53,005
[SPEAKER_13]: elderly and disabled people which occupy these 144 units, Mr. President.

403
00:45:53,745 --> 00:46:01,549
[SPEAKER_13]: And I made it known to the executive director that any such action by any employee will not be tolerated.

404
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:06,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And he agreed with me and said that he was going to have a discussion with his staff.

405
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:09,493
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is proper protocol according to

406
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:17,129
[SPEAKER_13]: federal and state statute out there for housing that would require when you file a grievance.

407
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:24,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're living in a state or federal building, there's a whole policy you can follow to file a grievance.

408
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:28,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And it actually gets to the executive director level.

409
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,961
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're not happy with the executive director,

410
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:35,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you can go to either federal or state court to resolve your issues.

411
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:52,320
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a number of avenues, and by no means or at any time should anyone be a fear that there'll be retribution or something held against them for reporting an issue of concern, which may be cleanliness, rodents, whatever it might be, Mr. President.

412
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,261
[SPEAKER_13]: No one should be in fear of that.

413
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:56,962
[SPEAKER_13]: And I let that be known to the executive director.

414
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:59,589
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hoping some changes are going to be made.

415
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:05,152
[SPEAKER_13]: That walk-in court is the only state development we have in this community now.

416
00:47:05,852 --> 00:47:17,278
[SPEAKER_13]: The federal government back, I think it was two or three years ago, moved to purchase all the state housing within the Commonwealth, and I assume across the country, but I know in the Commonwealth.

417
00:47:17,798 --> 00:47:22,121
[SPEAKER_13]: And for some reason, that walk-in court, they were not interested in.

418
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:26,763
[SPEAKER_13]: They purchased some of the other state housing we had in the community, but not walk-in court.

419
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:34,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And according to the director, he said it's no excuse, but they are sorely underfunded by the state.

420
00:47:35,558 --> 00:47:45,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, he's paying special attention to this particular unit because of the lack of funding and the needs that are in that building, Mr. President.

421
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:46,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

422
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:46,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

423
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:47,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilman Locren.

424
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:49,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Carviello.

425
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:51,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Councilman Marks for bringing this up.

426
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:56,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Councilman Marks has been back and forth with a few residents who have

427
00:47:56,472 --> 00:48:04,414
[SPEAKER_00]: family and walk in court and so have I. I know the mayor's office did reach out to Jeff as well and did some walkthroughs.

428
00:48:05,195 --> 00:48:09,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the mice and the bedbugs, those issues are being worked on.

429
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:16,478
[SPEAKER_00]: One that I'm really concerned with is just, after looking at the pictures too, is just the cleanliness of the building.

430
00:48:16,538 --> 00:48:17,998
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to reiterate that.

431
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:22,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that you need to sweep the floors and dust the main

432
00:48:23,728 --> 00:48:30,374
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of that building, or I think there's nine buildings in Walkland Court, they need to be done on at least a monthly basis.

433
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:30,374
18?

434
00:48:32,796 --> 00:48:39,422
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 units at Walkland Court, 144 apartments, I think they said earlier.

435
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:44,827
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to come to the rail and speak, that would be great.

436
00:48:52,493 --> 00:48:53,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

437
00:48:54,074 --> 00:48:57,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob Salvato, 1A Rockland Court.

438
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,179
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is bedbugs is not a problem.

439
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:04,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an infestation.

440
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And it keeps happening over and over and over again to the same apartments throughout the whole unit.

441
00:49:11,104 --> 00:49:12,285
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no dumpsters there.

442
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,025
[SPEAKER_07]: There were barrels.

443
00:49:14,706 --> 00:49:15,807
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like six barrels.

444
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're always overflowing by the day trash day comes.

445
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:20,830
[SPEAKER_07]: The place is a pigsty.

446
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:30,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, since Keith, our maintenance man, has been out injured, you know, there's been hardly, most days, there's hardly anybody there at all.

447
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:34,248
[SPEAKER_07]: The last couple of weeks, there's been a bunch of them there trying to get caught up with everything.

448
00:49:34,268 --> 00:49:36,429
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the place is a joke.

449
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:39,710
[SPEAKER_07]: The bed bug people, B&B, they're a joke.

450
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,450
[SPEAKER_07]: They never go into the basements.

451
00:49:41,671 --> 00:49:46,833
[SPEAKER_07]: They spray the apartment that the problem is in, but they never go in the basement where the problem originates.

452
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:50,454
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I had them, all right?

453
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,836
[SPEAKER_07]: They came into my apartment and inspected.

454
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:58,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Two weeks later, they told me, well, that day they told me, they inspected, they said, your house is clean.

455
00:49:59,017 --> 00:49:59,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, yes, it is.

456
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:08,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Two weeks later, they made me, three days before Christmas, throw my couch out at $175 to me, my cost.

457
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Three days before Christmas, they said my couch was infestated.

458
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:14,822
[SPEAKER_07]: They came and they sprayed three times, all right?

459
00:50:15,968 --> 00:50:19,189
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem seems to be corrected so far, but it's only a matter of time.

460
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:24,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I know people there that have had bedbugs three or four times, and these people are clean.

461
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,330
[SPEAKER_07]: The company's not doing the right job.

462
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:31,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, hire someone that does the right job.

463
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:34,612
[SPEAKER_07]: BNB is putting a Band-Aid on a major cut.

464
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:38,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

465
00:50:38,232 --> 00:50:38,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Ross.

466
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:39,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

467
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:40,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Longo.

468
00:50:41,236 --> 00:50:47,621
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm glad there's residents in the audience, because I feel like we're learning a lot from the residents who emailed us.

469
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:55,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mayor's office is being told something by the director, which is the information that I got today.

470
00:50:55,947 --> 00:51:07,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we met with, I think, Council Member Matsui just walked in after this, but we met with Walkland Court and the director, who said, I think, tried to put our minds at ease with regards to

471
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:09,868
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that they're working on things.

472
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:21,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I just reiterated is we need to get an update on this cleaning and how often it's going to be done because you saw the picture of the dead mouse and just the layer of dust.

473
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just the basics aren't getting done.

474
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:25,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can only imagine what's going on in the basement.

475
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:31,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know much about the B&B company, but I, the mayor's office did tell me about them today.

476
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:33,093
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that spray for the bed bugs.

477
00:51:34,033 --> 00:51:34,313
[SPEAKER_00]: So there,

478
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:40,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's three or four stories that we need to kind of get into a room to try to figure this out so that we can alleviate the problems.

479
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we name and address of the record please?

480
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:43,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

481
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:47,692
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Steven Glein senior and I'm a resident of Walkland court.

482
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:50,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I've been there since August.

483
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:56,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I'm a veteran, I'm senior citizen and I applied to met for housing.

484
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:57,296
[SPEAKER_11]: So I get in right away.

485
00:51:57,316 --> 00:52:00,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I wanted to try to get into a federal building.

486
00:52:01,153 --> 00:52:05,356
[SPEAKER_11]: but there's two or three year wait, and veterans have no priority at all.

487
00:52:06,417 --> 00:52:08,819
[SPEAKER_11]: State run, we have number one priority.

488
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,502
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as the bedbugs go, I've been fortunate, I haven't had any.

489
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:15,264
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been in my building.

490
00:52:16,324 --> 00:52:20,908
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot of things that they're turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to.

491
00:52:21,926 --> 00:52:27,950
[SPEAKER_11]: There's videos, all right, there was one apartment in building seven that was sprayed.

492
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:34,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So what they did is the people in the apartment took their clothes out and they put them in the trash.

493
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:43,039
[SPEAKER_11]: We have videos of people from that building going out in the trash and taking the clothes out and bringing them back in.

494
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,202
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they're doing is they're shipping them overseas.

495
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:53,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't get in, I don't want to use any ethnic groups or this, that, or everything.

496
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:59,056
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's people that deliver barrels there 10, 12 times a month.

497
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:07,963
[SPEAKER_11]: And people are going, they're bringing furniture in, they're bringing everything in, and they're packing, and this is going out.

498
00:53:07,983 --> 00:53:12,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought it up to Berlin.

499
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:17,111
[SPEAKER_11]: She's the, I guess, the rental agent for Walkland Court.

500
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And it don't seem like, you know, they shrug it off.

501
00:53:23,096 --> 00:53:24,717
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they all come up with excuses.

502
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:29,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Four o'clock one morning they were taking barrels out.

503
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:30,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're sly about it.

504
00:53:31,002 --> 00:53:37,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when someone complains, they were going from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock, 8 o'clock at night.

505
00:53:38,027 --> 00:53:40,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And one morning, four o'clock in the morning they took them out.

506
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:46,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it was reported to Berlin, she said the individual in that apartment was moving.

507
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the only time they could take the barrels out.

508
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the person's still there.

509
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:57,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've had 15, 20 barrels come out of that apartment in the last seven or eight months.

510
00:53:58,287 --> 00:54:05,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And tomorrow, I guess, they're going to have a meeting at Walkland Court with Mr. Driscoll.

511
00:54:06,893 --> 00:54:08,954
[SPEAKER_11]: And how it goes, nobody knows.

512
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:10,875
[SPEAKER_11]: And they kind of threaten you.

513
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I was making noise.

514
00:54:13,377 --> 00:54:15,918
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a letter that I was making too much noise.

515
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:17,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I live on the second floor.

516
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,902
[SPEAKER_11]: And the place is not insulated.

517
00:54:22,022 --> 00:54:24,443
[SPEAKER_11]: So someone downstairs, it's an elderly woman.

518
00:54:25,004 --> 00:54:27,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, when you walk, you hear.

519
00:54:27,065 --> 00:54:29,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not really making any excessive noise.

520
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,648
[SPEAKER_11]: But the letter they sent me, they're going to terminate me.

521
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:34,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to go in for a hearing.

522
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:35,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had to bring a lawyer with me.

523
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:39,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm disabled, I'm, you know, I'm a veteran.

524
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:40,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Where do I go?

525
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:41,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Where do I go?

526
00:54:42,223 --> 00:54:43,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is fair.

527
00:54:43,503 --> 00:54:45,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I fought for my country and I'm a senior citizen.

528
00:54:46,024 --> 00:54:50,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I helped, you know, and the thing is, a lot of people here, the senior citizens, they built this country.

529
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:52,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And what are we getting for it?

530
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:54,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely nothing.

531
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:58,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I say, when you go to say something, they kind of brush it off.

532
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:01,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't, you know.

533
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,848
[SPEAKER_11]: But like I say, fortunate enough, I haven't gotten any.

534
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:12,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, tomorrow I got some solutions I could try to come up with, but whether they adhere to them or not, that's another thing.

535
00:55:13,414 --> 00:55:17,636
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what it is, a lot of these people there, they're elderly, and where are they going to go?

536
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:19,516
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

537
00:55:20,837 --> 00:55:27,779
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want to clarify that I think they are turning a blind eye in the deaf ear to what's going on.

538
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,601
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, and no matter how much you complain about it or you say something,

539
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:36,774
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like the bed bug thing.

540
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:40,576
[SPEAKER_11]: The woman turned around and says, well, it's the people you're sitting with.

541
00:55:40,776 --> 00:55:47,699
[SPEAKER_11]: One has it, the bed bug jumps off to, you know, I'm 70 years old, I never even heard of bed bugs until I moved here.

542
00:55:48,559 --> 00:56:00,365
[SPEAKER_11]: But yet, we have pictures of people taking trash out of an apartment that was just, you know, fumigated, and they're bringing it back up.

543
00:56:01,686 --> 00:56:03,687
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that is one of the major,

544
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:08,601
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they're doing is they're taking them clothes and they're putting them in barrels and they ship them overseas.

545
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:10,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know.

546
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:12,743
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you for listening to me.

547
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:13,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

548
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your service.

549
00:56:14,843 --> 00:56:15,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

550
00:56:15,424 --> 00:56:15,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

551
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:16,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Member Kern.

552
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:17,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the chair, yes, thank you.

553
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:32,391
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some of the information that Jeff, I believe, gave to Deanna from the mayor's office with regards to furniture being removed from units and then brought back in and some people's clothes being brought back in.

554
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:34,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think we just

555
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:43,995
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole walk-in court needs some guidance and some special attention, and that's a good step with Jeff Driscoll going down to meet with, hopefully, residents and listening to them.

556
00:56:44,895 --> 00:56:50,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Being threatened is something that I have heard recently, and I don't know if it was that Berlin.

557
00:56:50,936 --> 00:56:55,578
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds familiar, but I hope Jeff can get a handle on that as well.

558
00:56:56,038 --> 00:57:04,280
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's reporting back to the council with regards to the cleaning issues, but if he could also just keep the council apprised on how the meeting goes tomorrow and what

559
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:18,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what we can do, but besides speak out and try to make sure that these meetings are being had, I also would, I mean, they're Medford residents, so hopefully our administration can maybe be present at the meeting tomorrow.

560
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:31,199
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would go a long way to have somebody there as, not necessarily a mediator, but somebody that could listen and speak out for our residents that live in those buildings, because they definitely need it.

561
00:57:31,259 --> 00:57:33,760
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a number of people here tonight and a number of

562
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:38,267
[SPEAKER_00]: emails we've got as of recent with a number of pictures that say a thousand words.

563
00:57:38,327 --> 00:57:41,929
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, hopefully we're heading in the right direction and we keep on it.

564
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:42,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

565
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

566
00:57:44,551 --> 00:57:44,711
Yeah.

567
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:45,992
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is John Campbell.

568
00:57:46,012 --> 00:57:47,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm six G walkling court.

569
00:57:48,934 --> 00:57:50,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I had an incident a couple of weeks ago.

570
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:52,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I was sprayed for bedbugs.

571
00:57:53,257 --> 00:57:53,957
[SPEAKER_10]: They came twice.

572
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:56,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I cleaned my apartment out.

573
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:57,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I threw a bunch of things out.

574
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,401
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them happened to be a computer bag.

575
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:02,729
[SPEAKER_10]: in the computer bag were several dead bedbugs.

576
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I assumed they were dead.

577
00:58:06,012 --> 00:58:06,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I threw them in a barrel.

578
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:19,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Within six hours, I'm walking down the hallway, and there's my computer bag sitting on a chair in the hall on the second landing with a few other articles that I threw in the barrel.

579
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a solution to that problem.

580
00:58:22,545 --> 00:58:28,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not throwing anything out anymore unless I cut it up, shred it up, or destroy it in some way, fashion, or form.

581
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,391
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's useless now.

582
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:31,422
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way you have to handle this thing.

583
00:58:32,783 --> 00:58:36,023
[SPEAKER_10]: The barrel situation goes on all the time.

584
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:39,224
[SPEAKER_10]: These big blue barrels, they're about five feet high.

585
00:58:39,844 --> 00:58:44,925
[SPEAKER_10]: They're lugging them in and out of these buildings at least once, twice a month, three times a month.

586
00:58:45,385 --> 00:58:46,866
[SPEAKER_10]: A truck comes and picks these things up.

587
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:54,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Berlin tells me that they're paying this freight company $180 to ship this stuff.

588
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:56,528
[SPEAKER_10]: If they can afford to pay $180 to ship these barrels,

589
00:58:58,404 --> 00:58:59,305
[SPEAKER_10]: to wherever they're going.

590
00:58:59,345 --> 00:59:00,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where they go.

591
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:01,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care where they go.

592
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:03,508
[SPEAKER_10]: They should not be in Walkland Court.

593
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:09,754
[SPEAKER_10]: They shouldn't be storing things that they take out of the trash, things that they take out of collection bins for charity.

594
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I see this stuff coming into the building all the time.

595
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:15,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an ongoing problem.

596
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,623
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I understand, there was a meeting with the director at one point

597
00:59:21,256 --> 00:59:22,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said, we know what's going on.

598
00:59:23,317 --> 00:59:24,577
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't do anything about it.

599
00:59:24,817 --> 00:59:26,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yes, there is something you can do about it.

600
00:59:27,098 --> 00:59:31,199
[SPEAKER_10]: You can stop these barrels from coming into our building and destroying our life.

601
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,060
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very simple.

602
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it only takes a letter.

603
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:37,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it takes a warning.

604
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:41,602
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have to stop.

605
00:59:44,065 --> 00:59:49,250
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just out of hand over there with the used clothes and the clothes coming out of the garbage.

606
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:57,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the guy that took the video of a woman in the barrel taking these bug-infested clothes out of the barrel, putting them in a bag and bringing them back into a building.

607
00:59:59,498 --> 01:00:00,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is this going on?

608
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:02,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand charity.

609
01:00:02,821 --> 01:00:03,461
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all for it.

610
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:04,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Send money.

611
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:05,103
[SPEAKER_10]: They need money.

612
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,464
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't need bugs.

613
01:00:06,824 --> 01:00:07,405
[SPEAKER_10]: They need money.

614
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:09,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Send them cash.

615
01:00:10,787 --> 01:00:12,409
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my piece.

616
01:00:14,084 --> 01:00:15,625
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

617
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:21,309
[SPEAKER_04]: As amended, seconded by Councilor Locren.

618
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:31,957
[SPEAKER_00]: If the amendments, I just want to make sure, I just want to amend it to make sure that, see if the mayor, somebody from the mayor's office could attend the meeting tomorrow morning, or tomorrow.

619
01:00:33,138 --> 01:00:34,759
[SPEAKER_00]: At two o'clock at Walkland Court.

620
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,823
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some representation for residents at Walkland Court.

621
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:45,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, yeah, it seems like it's time.

622
01:00:46,049 --> 01:01:00,537
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could get just an update from Mr. Driscoll with regards to, we asked in our committee the whole meeting for an update on any type of cleaning contract or results from any type of what he's doing to make sure that the properties are cleaned.

623
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:11,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can also get an update with regards to any just policy changes, what's being done to prevent trash and garbage from being taken from the dumpsters into the property.

624
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:19,282
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a solution, whether it's a locked dumpster, different types of trash pickup, removing those garbage cans.

625
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:22,424
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could just get an update from Mr. Driscoll.

626
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:26,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's been responsive to a number of us in the mayor's office.

627
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:33,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to definitely, the city needs to definitely stay on top of him to make sure these issues are resolved.

628
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:33,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

629
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:44,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, Mr. President, I'd just like to further amend the paper and request that the members of the Medford Housing Authority Board be copied on anything that goes forward.

630
01:01:44,495 --> 01:01:46,796
[SPEAKER_10]: They need 20 more barrels in Lockley Court.

631
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:48,756
[SPEAKER_10]: The barrels, every week they go out.

632
01:01:49,316 --> 01:01:50,697
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard you talking about this earlier.

633
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:52,537
[SPEAKER_10]: The barrels are overflowing.

634
01:01:53,238 --> 01:01:59,119
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't close the covers because there's this much above them.

635
01:01:59,179 --> 01:02:00,020
[SPEAKER_10]: They need more barrels.

636
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if these have to be purchased by housing

637
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:06,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Waste management.

638
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:11,472
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to supply more barrels.

639
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:17,575
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not enough barrels needed to take care of the residents.

640
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:25,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I just further amended the paper, Mr. President, asking that any correspondence that comes out of the council would also be sent to the Medford Housing Authority Commission.

641
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:28,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

642
01:02:28,847 --> 01:02:30,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Stephen Glantz, Walkman Court.

643
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:34,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank you very much for taking time to listen to us.

644
01:02:35,592 --> 01:02:38,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I say, a lot of people are just scared.

645
01:02:38,974 --> 01:02:42,557
[SPEAKER_11]: They're scared to voice their opinion.

646
01:02:42,657 --> 01:02:45,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care, to be honest with you.

647
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:50,563
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, to get someone that listens, and I voted for a lot of people here, and thank you.

648
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:51,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

649
01:02:52,324 --> 01:02:57,008
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Knight,

650
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:59,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo, and that's it.

651
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

652
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:03,841
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

653
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:06,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Marks.

654
01:03:06,862 --> 01:03:08,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

655
01:03:08,763 --> 01:03:09,743
[SPEAKER_05]: First, President Del Rosario.

656
01:03:09,763 --> 01:03:10,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

657
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:11,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

658
01:03:11,764 --> 01:03:11,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

659
01:03:12,404 --> 01:03:12,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Night.

660
01:03:13,005 --> 01:03:13,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

661
01:03:13,785 --> 01:03:14,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Kern.

662
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:15,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

663
01:03:16,286 --> 01:03:17,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

664
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:17,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

665
01:03:18,347 --> 01:03:19,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Kellogg.

666
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:19,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

667
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:20,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

668
01:03:20,648 --> 01:03:21,388
[SPEAKER_05]: President Caprio.

669
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:23,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

670
01:03:24,249 --> 01:03:25,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

671
01:03:27,702 --> 01:03:28,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Records.

672
01:03:30,163 --> 01:03:30,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Nice.

673
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:34,284
[SPEAKER_02]: But one, eight, three, seven, six from the table, please.

674
01:03:36,764 --> 01:03:37,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

675
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:39,645
[SPEAKER_02]: One, eight, three, seven, six.

676
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:48,168
[SPEAKER_04]: One, eight, three, seven, six.

677
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:49,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Nice.

678
01:03:50,888 --> 01:03:53,529
[SPEAKER_02]: From a procedural standpoint, Mr. President last week, this council

679
01:03:54,543 --> 01:04:02,826
[SPEAKER_02]: had a discussion on use variances and whether or not there was a vagueness surrounding the city's ability to apply use variances through their Zoning Board of Appeals.

680
01:04:03,526 --> 01:04:07,747
[SPEAKER_02]: The same question was raised in August of 2016 and was answered by the city solicitor.

681
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:20,751
[SPEAKER_02]: As such, I made a resolution requesting that we adopt the city solicitor's opinion and direct the city clerk to make the appropriate changes to our codified ordinances, as it was the opinion of the city solicitor that this codification was done in error in 2001

682
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:24,994
[SPEAKER_02]: and that use variances in the community of Medford were never precluded or barred.

683
01:04:25,535 --> 01:04:27,896
[SPEAKER_02]: As such, Mr. President, we took a vote to table the matter.

684
01:04:27,936 --> 01:04:28,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That vote failed.

685
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:34,501
[SPEAKER_02]: From a procedural standpoint, the matter was then section 22, which is a unilateral table.

686
01:04:35,222 --> 01:04:51,434
[SPEAKER_02]: When the matter is unilaterally tabled and comes up the next week, this is next week, I'd move for approval on the request that the Medford City Council adopt the city solicitor's opinion, rendered in paper 16-589, and that we direct the city clerk to take the appropriate action to correct our codified ordinances.

687
01:04:52,928 --> 01:04:53,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Member Kern.

688
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Carviello.

689
01:04:57,292 --> 01:05:08,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we have a conflicting Committee of the Whole meeting coming up where we're going to discuss eliminating or potentially eliminating use variances.

690
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:13,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is something that should wait, but I understand the council wants to take a vote on it.

691
01:05:13,145 --> 01:05:16,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just ask that it wait and we discuss it in Committee of the Whole.

692
01:05:16,348 --> 01:05:17,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I asked that last week as well.

693
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:18,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to correct the record.

694
01:05:19,697 --> 01:05:28,921
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a committee of the whole to ask whether or not we should eliminate use variances, but ordinances say that use variances are already precluded.

695
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:31,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Langel-Kern asked a question as to how this could be.

696
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:34,023
[SPEAKER_02]: The city solicitor came back and told us that it was an error.

697
01:05:34,443 --> 01:05:36,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's correct the error and then we can move forward.

698
01:05:36,044 --> 01:05:37,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're working with a document that's been edited.

699
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:44,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight's motion is just to correct the error that's in the ordinances.

700
01:05:46,127 --> 01:05:46,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

701
01:05:48,263 --> 01:05:54,247
[SPEAKER_13]: As I stated last week, Mr. President, during this discussion, that I am all in favor of correcting the error.

702
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:59,691
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I do agree with my council colleague that we found out about this error well over two years ago.

703
01:06:00,411 --> 01:06:07,436
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, as one member of the council, you know, am very supportive of doing away with the use variance.

704
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:16,182
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so I'd rather pursue it in that avenue, and we will cover that by a vote of this council in doing so.

705
01:06:17,424 --> 01:06:19,965
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, either way, it doesn't matter to me.

706
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:21,165
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of semantics.

707
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:34,049
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I hope we meet sooner than later regarding moving some of these important issues, Mr. President, with all this development going on, that we need to move some of these important issues to safeguard our residents.

708
01:06:34,169 --> 01:06:36,710
[SPEAKER_04]: The Zoning Committee has been meeting on a regular basis.

709
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:44,653
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Nath, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso,

710
