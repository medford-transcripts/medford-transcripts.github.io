    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1386.759s">Mr.</a>  Owes, congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1387.98s">First</a>  of all, I grew up in the neighborhood and I was a frequent patron of Jimmy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1391.624s">They</a>  have a great steak and cheese. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1392.785s">I</a>  hope you keep the recipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1394.828s">However,</a>  there's been a lot of concern, especially in the West Medford neighborhood, about local businesses on Wednesdays closing early so that kids that get out of school on early release day don't have a place to go, really, and it's creating a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1407.197s">I</a>  have an understanding that you're going to be open 11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1409.338s">to</a>  10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1410.358s">on</a>  Wednesdays? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1411.098s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1411.238s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1411.338s">And</a>  you have no problem with the student kids in the neighborhood coming into the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1414.279s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1414.739s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1414.939s">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1415.639s">I</a>  really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1416.919s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1417.6s">Congratulations,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1418.42s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1418.76s">Move</a>  approval of the question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1420.32s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1423.501s">Want</a>  some oxygen? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1425.202s">You</a>  want some? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1426.302s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1429.383s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1430.563s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1431.323s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1432.223s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1432.963s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1433.804s">Welcome</a>  to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1438.253s">Communications</a>  from the Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1439.473s">13382,</a>  dear President Caraviello and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request that the City Council approve the following list of food trucks for the events that are scheduled for coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1454.717s">West</a>  Medford Open Studios, Circle the Square, Medford Farmers Market, Hoops and Hopes, Medford Diversity Festival, Students of the Fells, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1464.436s">Methodist</a>  and Mystic River celebrations.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1467.777s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1469.358s">Mr.</a>  President, it's common course for this council to approve food trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1473.319s">Councilor</a>  Marks has explained in the past the difficulty it is sometimes in securing a food truck for a date like this and without having a date in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1480.921s">So</a>  it's very important that we take a look at this and take the appropriate steps to ensure that these food trucks are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1486.443s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I certainly have no problem approving these. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1489.204s">And</a>  I think that it's about time we revisit whether or not we should establish an ordinance on such. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1493.427s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1496.769s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1498.19s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1499.291s">I</a>  have no problem approving this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1501.132s">However,</a>  the event at Circle the Square, it mentions various locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1507.216s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, would want to make sure that whatever is being done is not placed in front of an already existing food establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1517.063s">And</a>  would ask that the paper be amended <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1523.023s">to</a>  have the administration provide locations for this particular event, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1528.764s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1530.325s">Councilor</a>  Scott Belli. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1531.785s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1532.885s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks will bring that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1535.546s">I</a>  missed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1536.646s">Again,</a>  I think that Councilor Knight's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1538.207s">We</a>  might need to look at something more permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1540.747s">But</a>  again, I think the biggest sticking point was when it was affecting food trucks that were affecting our brick and mortar businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1548.209s">So</a>  I, too, would second that resolve from my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1552.25s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1553.203s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knights, second and by?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1560.545s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1560.765s">As</a>  amended.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1561.925s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1564.786s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1567.187s">Motion</a>  to take papers in the hands of the clerk, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Hugh McIsaac on his recent passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1582.963s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1584.624s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1585.885s">Mr.</a>  McIsaac was a resident of Method for many years, and he recently passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1591.948s">And</a>  just thoughts and prayers to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1594.93s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1595.751s">Would</a>  I like to rise for a moment of silence, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1610.698s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the City Administration, being Director of DPW, report back to this Council to see if we could add decorative banners, barrels, I'm sorry, barrels throughout our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1628.161s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1630.002s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1631.142s">President</a>  Caraviello, I apologize for the chicken scratch. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1637.175s">This</a>  is, I've received many phone calls and emails over the last few weeks about the lack of community barrels placed throughout our main streets and roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1651.721s">And</a>  what's happening, especially in front of most of our convenience stores that sell lottery tickets and such, what's happening when people are exiting those <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1667.054s">businesses</a>  that people don't find, uh, can't find a place to discard those from what I've been told. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1673.578s">And</a>  they throw them down and they blow down the side streets and end up in front of a neighbor's houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1680.561s">And,</a>  um, I took a tour down cherry street, um, just yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1686.945s">And,</a>  uh, that street from what the residents sent me pictures that, uh, he would come home at night, uh, sweep the front of his house, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1697.564s">leave</a>  for work, come back, send me the picture of the next day with the same type of litter, cigarette packs, wrappers, candy wrappers, and then mostly just scratch tickets and such. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1709.713s">So</a>  I think that what we're seeing is even if you go through, traverse through our business districts, you don't see as many barrels, especially decorative barrels, that could be placed around our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1721.483s">So</a>  I'd ask the city administration, the DPW director, to maybe give us a price and see if they can give us <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1728.026s">what</a>  we can do to place these most needed barrels throughout our community so we can look at it when it comes to budget time, or is that something we can look at for the city administration for our complete streets as we move forward with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1744.896s">So</a>  again, I appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1748.318s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1749.499s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1750.74s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1751.46s">I</a>  think this is a very fitting resolution, considering we just celebrated Earth Day just a couple of days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1757.022s">I</a>  think we've all gotten some correspondence from individuals in the community expressing concern about the cleanliness of our streets as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1762.985s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, especially because Councilor Schiappelli is actually asking the administration to come up with a price, what it's going to cost, what the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1771.65s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper and ask that for every barrel that we install, that we look at, we also look at installing one of the solar-powered recycling receptacles that we see at our parks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1781.134s">And</a>  I'd ask that this be added as either <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1782.915s">an</a>  amendment or a B paper, whichever the sponsor of the resolution prefers, so that we can get prices for that as well, and then how we can move forward on the issue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1791.659s">Constantin</a>  Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1792.599s">Just</a>  as a comment, Mr. President, some years, over 25 years ago, one of my former confreres had graduated from the Sorbonne in France, and the treasurer of the college went to his graduation and noticed that the city of Paris used a special cast-iron public trash barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1812.989s">He</a>  somehow contacted the director of the DPW of the city of Paris, or the director or commissioner de sanitaire, found out where those cast iron barrels were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1828.615s">He</a>  ordered them and put them all over the college campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1833.337s">25</a>  years later, undented and only with a second coat of paint, they still function very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1842.95s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1846.553s">We</a>  do, the cast iron barrels that we do have, the Secretary of the Prime Minister is in town, so perhaps we can check with him.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1853.618s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1854.599s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1855.319s">I</a>  thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1857.981s">This</a>  is a major issue throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1860.863s">I've</a>  received many emails as well with regard to colonialism in the city, and we should be making sure that, you know, people are keeping it clean, but also giving them the opportunity to actually <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1872.433s">throw</a>  things away, you know, have barrels thrown on streets with trash cans. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1878.317s">As</a>  I wait for the bus every day on Salem Street, there are trash cans, you know, all the way down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1884.942s">But</a>  I don't think that this is true for all of our major thoroughfares throughout the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1889.886s">So</a>  if we could get a list from the DPW as to what streets actually have public trash cans or public barrels, because it'd be interesting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1899.894s">I</a>  mean, I don't, I know they, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1902.493s">They</a>  go down Salem Street, but I don't think, as far as I know, that they are down most of our thoroughfares throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1910.575s">So</a>  if we could get a listing from the DPW department as to where they are located, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1916.836s">I</a>  think it's a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1917.997s">I</a>  think it's something that we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1919.577s">We</a>  should have, especially if you take a look at bus stops, you know, people are always on the bus stop, you know, they're eating, they're getting ready to go, you know, get on the bus, whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1927.999s">So</a>  we should be giving them somewhere where they can throw out their trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1930.88s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1933.237s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1934.818s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1935.639s">I</a>  do want to thank the Method Community Coalition and the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1939.362s">They</a>  held a cleanup day this past Saturday in many of our business districts, and they did a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1946.128s">I</a>  believe we all received an email regarding trash from one woman that her and her daughter were out, and she noticed a lot of cigarette butts. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1958.337s">So</a>  I would say that, in addition to a trash barrel, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1961.6s">that</a>  the city also look at putting cigarette receptacles where people can place a cigarette in, Mr. President, because you don't want them throwing them in a trash barrel that could cause a fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1973.147s">So</a>  I would ask that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1975.668s">The</a>  second thing is that I believe much of the debris we see around is because the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1983.053s">this</a>  community only sweeps our streets twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1986.476s">It's</a>  inadequate for the number of businesses that we have, the number of vehicular cars that are cut through this community, that may dump trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1994.222s">And</a>  I believe that we have to impact and put together a full-fledged street sweeping program, which would sweep our streets more than twice a year, and also our neighborhoods, which much of this debris, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2012.404s">I</a>  can tell you firsthand, living off the Fellsway, that every day, indeed, I'm out there picking up trash that blows up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2019.546s">And</a>  you come out the next day, and it's more trash that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2023.107s">And</a>  it ranges from Dunkin' Donuts to plastic bags to newspapers, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2028.009s">Some</a>  of the stuff you see out there is pretty amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2031.81s">A</a>  second thing, Mr. President, and I don't want to seem critical, but waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2037.598s">If</a>  you happen to see when they dump the barrels, it's pretty amazing how much trash gets left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2047.988s">When</a>  it picks up, the arm picks up, it dumps the thing in there, and then you see paper fly out here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2053.633s">And</a>  it may not seem like a lot in front of your house, but times that by 30,000 households, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2058.551s">And</a>  it's a fair number of trash that's somehow escaping from the truck and not getting in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2064.797s">Some</a>  of it's due to barrels that are over strewn with trash, and the lids aren't closed properly, which was supposed to be a mandate in order to dump your trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2075.748s">The</a>  lid had to be shut when the program first started. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2078.71s">Now</a>  they seem to be very liberal in taking the trash, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2083.692s">That's</a>  the second reason, I believe, you see additional trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2088.476s">So</a>  it's the lack of street sweeping in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2091.438s">It's</a>  also the waste management pickup, which I believe could be done more efficiently and effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2098.084s">And</a>  the third point, Mr. President, and I had this discussion with the gentleman that called up regarding the trash along the sidewalks when he walks his pet. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2108.933s">The</a>  dog's trying to eat stuff constantly that's <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2111.427s">left</a>  outside on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2114.428s">And,</a>  you know, we require by ordinance that people shovel in front of their home, even though it's a city sidewalk, that you take ownership and pride and you shovel in front of your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2125.492s">And</a>  if you don't, you potentially could get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2128.353s">And</a>  someday we may need to expand that to also sweeping in front of your home and taking care of the public sidewalk in front of your home when it comes to cleanliness, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2139.531s">I</a>  don't think it's a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2140.711s">I</a>  think it shows a sense of pride and a sense of ownership, you know, and a lot of people do it anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2147.353s">But,</a>  you know, I think this would go a long way to putting our best foot forward as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2153.574s">When</a>  people drive through, which many thousands of people do, they see a city that's clean and taken care of and not a city that's littered with debris, which I hate to say is currently happening right now in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2167.307s">Mr.</a>  President, so those would be my suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2169.708s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2170.449s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2171.469s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2173.09s">I</a>  too have gotten a few emails with regards to the neighborhoods and litter lingering on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2182.256s">I</a>  know, I think it may have came about because the Chamber of Commerce and Medford Community Coalition did do the cleanups this weekend, which went very well, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2191.001s">I</a>  know I saw Councilor Caraviello there at Haines Square cleaning up, and every square had people, a lot of people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2198.459s">But</a>  one of the suggestions was, because it was so good this weekend, you had DPW involved as well and they gave out, I think Modern Hardware gave out brooms and everybody sweeping the streets and pushing all the, a lot of cigarette butts in front of, especially in front of a couple of those restaurants, but sweeping all the trash into the streets and then we had DPW on board who said they would come by later at night and sweep the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2224.371s">I</a>  think maybe that would be a good suggestion <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2227.362s">I</a>  don't know who could organize it, maybe the administration through the mayor's office, but have a community citywide cleanup where people would register their street as part of the community cleanup, especially those ones near the business districts, hopefully get the businesses involved to just sweep everything into the streets and then have the DPW on board to come and <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2251.992s">clean</a>  the street at night, I think it would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2254.612s">It's</a>  almost like a spring street cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2257.753s">I</a>  think it's something that could be organized pretty quickly, and I think it would go a very long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2262.734s">We</a>  don't have the staff to go through every single street and clean up the sidewalks, and if we could organize something where our trucks could come out an extra time to certain streets that are willing to participate, I really think it would go a long way, and I know a lot of residents who would see their neighbors <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2279.759s">people</a>  out, maybe get an organiser from each street to get notification of something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2286.181s">I</a>  really think that's something that needs to be done because you have a lot of trash on some of our streets that aren't main thoroughfares that need to be cleaned, all over the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2296.083s">It</a>  needs to get done one way or another and there are people out there requesting, you know, having us request this type of organisation of such a clean-up and I think it's definitely something I would take part in and I think it would go, definitely help out the neighbourhoods.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2309.797s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2310.797s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2311.998s">Again,</a>  thanks for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2313.318s">I</a>  appreciate everybody's input. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2314.559s">And</a>  I think that it's important that we as a city council really focus on making sure that the taxpayers get what they deserve when they pay their taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2328.545s">And</a>  that's basic necessities and making sure that our streets are cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2334.147s">I</a>  think that's one of the frustrations of the neighbor that I talked to is that he's out there every single night <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2340.266s">And</a>  he's sweeping in front of his house every single night. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2343.549s">But</a>  if we're not doing what we need to do as an administration, then that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2352.196s">So</a>  I think it's important that we get the prices for the barrels and the solar-powered barrels and also the cigarette dispensaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2362.664s">But</a>  I also like the idea that we look at a formalized <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2368.173s">program</a>  of street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2369.874s">And</a>  I think that's something we need to look at as a budgetary item when it comes, comes up this, uh, the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2376.978s">So,</a>  uh, thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2379.98s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2380.981s">And</a>  being out there and said, you know, with council long ago, um, I think what you saw with the squares that have a package stores is you see the nip bottles, little plastic nip bottles are really rampant throughout, throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2395.41s">And</a>  because that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2397.543s">That's</a>  a big part of these small package stores is they're selling the little nips and people just leave them everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2403.527s">So</a>  again, if that's where we could place some barrels near those things, that might help out a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2408.97s">Council</a>  Member O'Keefe.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2410.051s">And</a>  you notice just in front of the few restaurants that you know are open late in Haines Square, they're just a lot of cigarette butts. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2418.296s">The</a>  parking lots were, we did a big cleanup of the Haines Square parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2422.378s">I</a>  think we filled like 20 bags of just leaves and trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2426.862s">but</a>  this is, no matter what it is, even dunking donuts lids, they were kind of all over with the straws and the cups. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2434.166s">I</a>  mean, this is trickling, like Councilor Scarpelli said, this is trickling into the neighborhoods where people are just walking around and throwing litter into our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2443.031s">So</a>  I think between the trash barrels and maybe a community citywide cleanup, and with the help of our DPW, like they did over the weekend, you can't go wrong.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2456.173s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2457.034s">Move</a>  approval of the question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2459.876s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2461.598s">Do</a>  you want to speak in this matter?</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2464.14s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2464.861s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2466.022s">Thank</a>  you very much, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2467.383s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2471.166s">I</a>  have gone with my camera up and down the streets and it is a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2476.451s">Especially</a>  the nip bottles. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2477.872s">The</a>  nip bottles, I think maybe over at Sheridan, they were just like piles of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2482.917s">And</a>  it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2484.462s">Is</a>  there any self-respect in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2486.643s">I'm</a>  forever picking up litter that comes in from the street into my driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2492.004s">It's</a>  a perpetual, one neighbor would actually come over and pick it up for me with a, with a stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2496.826s">He</a>  felt so badly that it just comes in from the wind. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2498.926s">So</a>  we, as a community, we need to, you know, it speaks volumes because one last, very quickly, when you come off of 93 and go down Salem street, as councilor Dello Russo knows, they fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2511.878s">You</a>  have people from all sorts of communities bypassing Route 16 because there were fewer lights on Salem and Route 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2519.405s">They</a>  see the mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2521.187s">And</a>  so we have all sorts of people from different cities and towns seeing our mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2524.91s">It's</a>  just not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2525.811s">Medford</a>  pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2527.893s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2528.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2530.296s">The</a>  motion by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2532.678s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2533.759s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2534.399s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2535.32s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2536.241s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2537.982s">Be</a>  it resolved that walking court be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2541.264s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2542.885s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2544.626s">I</a>  believe we all received an email from a resident that was concerned about the living conditions of her parents living at Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2554.973s">I</a>  happen to make a call and talk to the executive director, Mr. Driscoll, regarding some of the concerns that were mentioned, which was cleanliness of <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2565.476s">the</a>  building and we did receive several photos which showed a building that was in dire need of a sweep and some 409 and some heavy duty cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2578.804s">It</a>  was also mentioned that in this particular location <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2582.699s">There's</a>  been a concern with bed bugs in several of the units within Walkland Court, of which I was assured by the executive director that the exterminator that's been called out has been doing the proper number of treatments to eradicate the bed bugs, which I believe has to take at least a two to three week span and at least three treatments. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2608.151s">And</a>  also the fact that when residents are told that <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2612.537s">their</a>  apartment will be exterminated, there should be a step-by-step process that they need to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2620.427s">in</a>  order to eradicate the bed bugs, because if you take your sheeting and other items, clothing, and put it in storage, which may be in the basement of that facility while they're treating your apartment, and then after it's done, reintroduce all the stuff that was in the apartment, that may be the cause of reintroducing the bed bugs over and over, and also the spread of bed bugs within a particular housing unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2647.756s">So</a>  I'm confident now that <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2650.618s">The</a>  executive director, Mr. Driscoll, is on top of this, that the proper professionals were called out in order to take care of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2663.03s">There</a>  is a cleaning crew that will be going through all the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2667.014s">Another</a>  issue, Mr. President, was the dumpsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2670.517s">According</a>  to this particular woman that contacted the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2675.625s">that</a>  at any given time this furniture and a number of items that are left outside of this little alleyway, which is where they housed their dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2684.973s">And</a>  the executive director assured me that he will have it monitored. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2690.968s">It's</a>  not under lock and key. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2693.11s">In</a>  my opinion, you probably have people dumping that don't live in the particular area and know there's a dumpster there and dumping items off. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2701.495s">And</a>  depending on what the item is, it could be attracting rodents and infestation and other concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2707.98s">So</a>  he assured me that they were going to keep a close eye on the dumpster and potentially look at some type of locking mechanism that's only available to residents, which to me makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2720.625s">The</a>  last concern which I discussed with Mr. Driscoll was based on what this particular Method resident reached out and said that when residents bring concerns, they're fearful that their concerns may be used against them or they may be told, well, if you keep on bringing these things up, you know, you're going to have to find housing somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2743.399s">And</a>  that's pretty devastating when you're talking <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2747.522s">elderly</a>  and disabled people which occupy these 144 units, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2753.745s">And</a>  I made it known to the executive director that any such action by any employee will not be tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2762.149s">And</a>  he agreed with me and said that he was going to have a discussion with his staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2766.892s">So</a>  there is proper protocol according to <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2769.943s">federal</a>  and state statute out there for housing that would require when you file a grievance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2777.89s">So</a>  if you're living in a state or federal building, there's a whole policy you can follow to file a grievance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2785.576s">And</a>  it actually gets to the executive director level. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2788.619s">And</a>  if you're not happy with the executive director, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2791.351s">Then</a>  you can go to either federal or state court to resolve your issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2795.813s">So</a>  there's a number of avenues, and by no means or at any time should anyone be a fear that there'll be retribution or something held against them for reporting an issue of concern, which may be cleanliness, rodents, whatever it might be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2813.14s">No</a>  one should be in fear of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2814.721s">And</a>  I let that be known to the executive director. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2817.568s">I'm</a>  hoping some changes are going to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2819.949s">That</a>  walk-in court is the only state development we have in this community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2825.852s">The</a>  federal government back, I think it was two or three years ago, moved to purchase all the state housing within the Commonwealth, and I assume across the country, but I know in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2837.798s">And</a>  for some reason, that walk-in court, they were not interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2842.441s">They</a>  purchased some of the other state housing we had in the community, but not walk-in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2847.475s">And</a>  according to the director, he said it's no excuse, but they are sorely underfunded by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2855.558s">And,</a>  you know, he's paying special attention to this particular unit because of the lack of funding and the needs that are in that building, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2865.801s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2866.222s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2866.842s">Councilman</a>  Locren.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2867.942s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2869.183s">I</a>  want to thank Councilman Marks for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2871.603s">I</a>  know Councilman Marks has been back and forth with a few residents who have <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2876.472s">family</a>  and walk in court and so have I. I know the mayor's office did reach out to Jeff as well and did some walkthroughs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2885.195s">And</a>  I know that the mice and the bedbugs, those issues are being worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2890.676s">One</a>  that I'm really concerned with is just, after looking at the pictures too, is just the cleanliness of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2896.538s">So</a>  I just want to reiterate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2898.058s">I</a>  think it's something that you need to sweep the floors and dust the main <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2903.728s">areas</a>  of that building, or I think there's nine buildings in Walkland Court, they need to be done on at least a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2912.796s">18</a>  units at Walkland Court, 144 apartments, I think they said earlier.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2934.074s">Bob</a>  Salvato, 1A Rockland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2941.038s">The</a>  problem is bedbugs is not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2943.219s">It's</a>  an infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2944.8s">And</a>  it keeps happening over and over and over again to the same apartments throughout the whole unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2951.104s">There</a>  are no dumpsters there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2952.325s">There</a>  were barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2954.706s">It's</a>  like six barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2955.987s">And</a>  they're always overflowing by the day trash day comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2959.649s">The</a>  place is a pigsty. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2962.103s">You</a>  know, since Keith, our maintenance man, has been out injured, you know, there's been hardly, most days, there's hardly anybody there at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2970.726s">The</a>  last couple of weeks, there's been a bunch of them there trying to get caught up with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2974.268s">You</a>  know, the place is a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2976.769s">The</a>  bed bug people, B&B, they're a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2980.07s">They</a>  never go into the basements. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2981.671s">They</a>  spray the apartment that the problem is in, but they never go in the basement where the problem originates. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2986.853s">You</a>  know, I had them, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2990.875s">They</a>  came into my apartment and inspected. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2993.376s">Two</a>  weeks later, they told me, well, that day they told me, they inspected, they said, your house is clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=2999.017s">I</a>  said, yes, it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3000.398s">Two</a>  weeks later, they made me, three days before Christmas, throw my couch out at $175 to me, my cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3008.82s">Three</a>  days before Christmas, they said my couch was infestated. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3012.441s">They</a>  came and they sprayed three times, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3015.968s">The</a>  problem seems to be corrected so far, but it's only a matter of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3019.549s">I</a>  know people there that have had bedbugs three or four times, and these people are clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3025.77s">The</a>  company's not doing the right job. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3029.531s">Now,</a>  hire someone that does the right job. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3032.151s">BNB</a>  is putting a Band-Aid on a major cut.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3036.812s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3038.232s">Mr.</a>  Ross. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3038.873s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3039.653s">Councilor</a>  Longo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3041.236s">No,</a>  I'm glad there's residents in the audience, because I feel like we're learning a lot from the residents who emailed us. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3048.041s">And</a>  the mayor's office is being told something by the director, which is the information that I got today. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3055.947s">And</a>  then we met with, I think, Council Member Matsui just walked in after this, but we met with Walkland Court and the director, who said, I think, tried to put our minds at ease with regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3068.288s">the</a>  fact that they're working on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3070.148s">And</a>  one thing I just reiterated is we need to get an update on this cleaning and how often it's going to be done because you saw the picture of the dead mouse and just the layer of dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3081.11s">I</a>  mean, just the basics aren't getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3083.271s">So</a>  you can only imagine what's going on in the basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3085.851s">And</a>  I don't know much about the B&B company, but I, the mayor's office did tell me about them today. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3091.372s">They're</a>  the ones that spray for the bed bugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3094.033s">So</a>  there, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3094.828s">I</a>  think there's three or four stories that we need to kind of get into a room to try to figure this out so that we can alleviate the problems.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3100.51s">Should</a>  we name and address of the record please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3103.731s">My</a>  name is Steven Glein senior and I'm a resident of Walkland court. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3109.073s">Uh,</a>  I've been there since August. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3110.954s">Uh,</a>  I'm a veteran, I'm senior citizen and I applied to met for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3116.275s">So</a>  I get in right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3117.316s">Uh,</a>  I wanted to try to get into a federal building. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3121.153s">but</a>  there's two or three year wait, and veterans have no priority at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3126.417s">State</a>  run, we have number one priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3129.559s">As</a>  far as the bedbugs go, I've been fortunate, I haven't had any. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3134.083s">They've</a>  been in my building. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3136.324s">And</a>  there's a lot of things that they're turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3141.926s">There's</a>  videos, all right, there was one apartment in building seven that was sprayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3148.77s">So</a>  what they did is the people in the apartment took their clothes out and they put them in the trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3156.035s">We</a>  have videos of people from that building going out in the trash and taking the clothes out and bringing them back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3164.04s">And</a>  what they're doing is they're shipping them overseas. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3168.768s">And</a>  I can't get in, I don't want to use any ethnic groups or this, that, or everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3173.772s">But</a>  there's people that deliver barrels there 10, 12 times a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3179.717s">And</a>  people are going, they're bringing furniture in, they're bringing everything in, and they're packing, and this is going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3187.983s">I</a>  brought it up to Berlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3192.087s">She's</a>  the, I guess, the rental agent for Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3198.653s">And</a>  it don't seem like, you know, they shrug it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3203.096s">You</a>  know, they all come up with excuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3206.699s">Four</a>  o'clock one morning they were taking barrels out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3209.121s">And</a>  they're sly about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3211.002s">Because</a>  when someone complains, they were going from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock, 8 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3218.027s">And</a>  one morning, four o'clock in the morning they took them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3221.349s">And</a>  when it was reported to Berlin, she said the individual in that apartment was moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3227.758s">And</a>  that was the only time they could take the barrels out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3230.42s">Well,</a>  the person's still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3232.522s">And</a>  they've had 15, 20 barrels come out of that apartment in the last seven or eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3238.287s">And</a>  tomorrow, I guess, they're going to have a meeting at Walkland Court with Mr. Driscoll. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3246.893s">And</a>  how it goes, nobody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3249.154s">And</a>  they kind of threaten you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3252.336s">I</a>  was making noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3253.377s">I</a>  got a letter that I was making too much noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3255.978s">I</a>  live on the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3258.18s">And</a>  the place is not insulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3262.022s">So</a>  someone downstairs, it's an elderly woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3265.004s">And</a>  you know, when you walk, you hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3267.065s">I'm</a>  not really making any excessive noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3269.766s">But</a>  the letter they sent me, they're going to terminate me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3273.349s">And</a>  I have to go in for a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3274.469s">And</a>  I had to bring a lawyer with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3276.842s">I</a>  mean, I'm disabled, I'm, you know, I'm a veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3279.823s">Where</a>  do I go? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3281.463s">Where</a>  do I go? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3282.223s">I</a>  mean, this is fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3283.503s">I</a>  fought for my country and I'm a senior citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3286.024s">I</a>  helped, you know, and the thing is, a lot of people here, the senior citizens, they built this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3291.885s">And</a>  what are we getting for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3293.706s">Absolutely</a>  nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3295.426s">And</a>  like I say, when you go to say something, they kind of brush it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3299.947s">So</a>  I don't, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3301.907s">But</a>  like I say, fortunate enough, I haven't gotten any. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3305.792s">I</a>  mean, tomorrow I got some solutions I could try to come up with, but whether they adhere to them or not, that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3313.414s">And</a>  I think what it is, a lot of these people there, they're elderly, and where are they going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3319.136s">You</a>  know? <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3320.837s">But</a>  I just want to clarify that I think they are turning a blind eye in the deaf ear to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3329.119s">And,</a>  you know, and no matter how much you complain about it or you say something, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3335.293s">You</a>  know, like the bed bug thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3337.254s">The</a>  woman turned around and says, well, it's the people you're sitting with. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3340.776s">One</a>  has it, the bed bug jumps off to, you know, I'm 70 years old, I never even heard of bed bugs until I moved here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3348.559s">But</a>  yet, we have pictures of people taking trash out of an apartment that was just, you know, fumigated, and they're bringing it back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3361.686s">So</a>  I think that is one of the major, <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3364.659s">And</a>  what they're doing is they're taking them clothes and they're putting them in barrels and they ship them overseas. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3368.681s">So,</a>  you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3371.402s">But</a>  thank you for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3372.983s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3373.803s">Thank</a>  you for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3374.843s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3375.424s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3375.704s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3376.584s">Through</a>  the chair, yes, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3378.005s">That</a>  is some of the information that Jeff, I believe, gave to Deanna from the mayor's office with regards to furniture being removed from units and then brought back in and some people's clothes being brought back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3392.531s">So,</a>  I think we just <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3394.612s">The</a>  whole walk-in court needs some guidance and some special attention, and that's a good step with Jeff Driscoll going down to meet with, hopefully, residents and listening to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3404.895s">Being</a>  threatened is something that I have heard recently, and I don't know if it was that Berlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3410.936s">That</a>  sounds familiar, but I hope Jeff can get a handle on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3416.038s">I</a>  know he's reporting back to the council with regards to the cleaning issues, but if he could also just keep the council apprised on how the meeting goes tomorrow and what <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3424.751s">I'm</a>  not sure what we can do, but besides speak out and try to make sure that these meetings are being had, I also would, I mean, they're Medford residents, so hopefully our administration can maybe be present at the meeting tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3438.655s">I</a>  think that would go a long way to have somebody there as, not necessarily a mediator, but somebody that could listen and speak out for our residents that live in those buildings, because they definitely need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3451.259s">This</a>  is a number of people here tonight and a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3454.204s">emails</a>  we've got as of recent with a number of pictures that say a thousand words. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3458.327s">So,</a>  um, hopefully we're heading in the right direction and we keep on it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3830.888s">From</a>  a procedural standpoint, Mr. President last week, this council <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3834.543s">had</a>  a discussion on use variances and whether or not there was a vagueness surrounding the city's ability to apply use variances through their Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3843.526s">The</a>  same question was raised in August of 2016 and was answered by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3848.387s">As</a>  such, I made a resolution requesting that we adopt the city solicitor's opinion and direct the city clerk to make the appropriate changes to our codified ordinances, as it was the opinion of the city solicitor that this codification was done in error in 2001 <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3861.892s">and</a>  that use variances in the community of Medford were never precluded or barred. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3865.535s">As</a>  such, Mr. President, we took a vote to table the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3867.936s">That</a>  vote failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3869.498s">From</a>  a procedural standpoint, the matter was then section 22, which is a unilateral table. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3875.222s">When</a>  the matter is unilaterally tabled and comes up the next week, this is next week, I'd move for approval on the request that the Medford City Council adopt the city solicitor's opinion, rendered in paper 16-589, and that we direct the city clerk to take the appropriate action to correct our codified ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3892.928s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3895.35s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3897.292s">I</a>  think that we have a conflicting Committee of the Whole meeting coming up where we're going to discuss eliminating or potentially eliminating use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3908.501s">So</a>  I think this is something that should wait, but I understand the council wants to take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3913.145s">I</a>  would just ask that it wait and we discuss it in Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3916.348s">I</a>  think I asked that last week as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3917.769s">Just</a>  to correct the record.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3919.697s">We're</a>  going to have a committee of the whole to ask whether or not we should eliminate use variances, but ordinances say that use variances are already precluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3928.941s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn asked a question as to how this could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3931.862s">The</a>  city solicitor came back and told us that it was an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3934.443s">Let's</a>  correct the error and then we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3936.044s">But</a>  now we're working with a document that's been edited.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3937.804s">Councilor</a>  Knight's motion is just to correct the error that's in the ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3946.127s">Move</a>  approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3948.263s">As</a>  I stated last week, Mr. President, during this discussion, that I am all in favor of correcting the error. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3954.687s">However,</a>  I do agree with my council colleague that we found out about this error well over two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3960.411s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, you know, am very supportive of doing away with the use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3968.777s">You</a>  know, so I'd rather pursue it in that avenue, and we will cover that by a vote of this council in doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3977.424s">You</a>  know, either way, it doesn't matter to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3980.005s">It's</a>  kind of semantics. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3981.626s">But,</a>  you know, I hope we meet sooner than later regarding moving some of these important issues, Mr. President, with all this development going on, that we need to move some of these important issues to safeguard our residents.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4013.459s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4013.579s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4013.679s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4013.839s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4013.959s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4014.319s">By</a>  the affirmative to the negative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4018.942s">The</a>  records. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4020.002s">That's</a>  a Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4036.026s">Just</a>  a couple of quick announcements. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4038.808s">Saturday</a>  night, a night of 10,000 lights here at City Hall is a fundraiser for the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4043.892s">Always</a>  a great event, so if you can make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4046.975s">We</a>  will be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4048.536s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4049.276s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4049.877s">And</a>  I was notified too that if you want to go see a free movie down at the Chevalier this Friday, April 27th at 7 p.m., an inconvenient sequel, Truth to Power, and that's being sponsored by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4064.333s">It's</a>  a free movie for anyone that's interested.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4066.295s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4070.739s">Records,</a>  the table records of March 27, 2018 were passed to Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4078.706s">Councilor</a>  Marks, have you examined those records?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4082.229s">Mr.</a>  President, believe it or not, I have not examined the records yet.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4097.91s">The</a>  records, yeah, I'm sorry, before we. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4102.192s">The</a>  records of the meeting of April 17th, 2018 were passed to Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4107.634s">Councilor</a>  Falco, how did you find those records?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4114.597s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4115.517s">I</a>  reviewed the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4116.477s">They</a>  appear to be in order and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4125.09s">If</a>  I could, I know that I forgot to do this, but if we can get the word to someone in the city to change the flag at Webster Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4135.275s">I</a>  guess it's pretty tarnished and tattered, so.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4137.817s">Flag</a>  at Webster Park.</p>
