    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=119.486s">Yeah,</a>  so we began in 1996. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=121.306s">There's</a>  only one other left from that fateful day, Charlie Chimpaya, but we created a program to allow 12-year-old all-stars to play a very competitive baseball game. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=136.273s">Then</a>  we moved to running the Tufts Winter Clinic for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=144.197s">We</a>  got involved, we created the Medford Baseball Council that helped all the baseball leagues in the city join together and talk as one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=152.645s">We</a>  took over some fledgling bankrupted leagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=157.37s">And</a>  then we turned on to Challenger Baseball, started in Malden for children with mental and physical health challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=167.713s">We</a>  brought them here to Medford, had an incredible first game, and now 15 years later, a week from Sunday, we'll do it again for the final time for the Medford Invitational.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=180.911s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=190.809s">I</a>  want that support of the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=192.851s">Having</a>  one member of my family has been involved with the group for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=195.554s">And</a>  thank you and Charlie and the other people involved there to be there on the Sunday and see the amount of work you guys put in and characters and the games and everything that goes on with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=207.058s">If</a>  you've never been before, try to come, it's a week from Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=212.742s">Try</a>  to make it, say it's a fun day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=215.023s">If</a>  you'd like to help out, they're always looking for volunteers.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=217.365s">And</a>  if I may, I just want to say that this group behind me is just a portion of the great volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=223.482s">The</a>  families of the kids are amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=226.384s">Our</a>  city officials have been very supportive, both in Medford and in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=230.387s">We</a>  couldn't do it without the business community who have given us such great financial backing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=235.51s">So</a>  we're very proud to have done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=236.971s">It's</a>  a great community event. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=238.852s">I'm</a>  pleased that I get to be at least part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=242.695s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=243.335s">You</a>  guys have done a great job over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=246.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=247.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=247.758s">And</a>  I'm sorry to see that you're gonna end it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=250.1s">And</a>  hopefully the group, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=252.362s">If</a>  that takes everything, we'll do just as good a job.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=259.986s">Yeah,</a>  I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=261.346s">I</a>  don't know if you wanna stand up, but the great Patty Falasca, who...

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=405.175s">Now,</a>  I'm fortunate enough to know the gentleman at the podium, it's someone that I idolized growing up across the street, probably hit the farthest half ball home runs I've ever seen in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=415.78s">So</a>  some people looking, what is half ball? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=419.882s">But</a>  this is what, you know, we talked about the last year and how difficult the last, really the last year has been in really society. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=428.946s">And</a>  I think that, you know, we talk about, you know, the division in our community and <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=436.144s">At</a>  that time, if you remember back then, Medford's baseball was sort of what the city was about today. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=443.228s">And</a>  there wasn't anybody really bringing that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=446.17s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=448.132s">Ronnie</a>  and your team really stood up and kind of put baseball back on the map in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=454.395s">I</a>  remember as a young man watching this happen and saying, wow, I would love to be part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=459.357s">And</a>  you could hear the kids that I would teach, they would be so proud to be in that tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=463.698s">And</a>  then to move it to the next level where you see where it really pays dividends and shows where <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=473.597s">the</a>  kids that needed it the most found something and reaching out to challenge it and having families, the Alaskans and the Butler's for some that have been supporting it for years and doing great things in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=488.806s">And</a>  it's been a sad, it's been a sad couple of months here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=493.228s">You</a>  know, you're hearing these different, all these <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=496.885s">different</a>  changes in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=499.286s">And</a>  for someone who grew up with these great changes, I'm excited to see what the next step will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=504.708s">But</a>  when you see the moving on of a Michael Mox or the end of an era and challenger and the MIT and see what you guys have done, I want you to realize there's a reason why people want to move to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=521.117s">And</a>  it's people like yourself, Ron, and your team that made Medford the city that everybody loves and wants to be part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=528.001s">So</a>  I'm proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=530.363s">I'm</a>  proud to be your friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=531.703s">And</a>  I thank you for everything you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=534.945s">And</a>  I can't wait for Sunday's event and support you guys again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=540.309s">And</a>  those people that don't know the reason why I leave, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=544.489s">I</a>  have a sweating problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=545.77s">So</a>  I don't know what it is lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=547.611s">It's</a>  like 90 degrees and humid and we have our, and you know, I try to, I've been pawning my kids off now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=554.915s">Hey,</a>  we're going to volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=556.435s">And</a>  then I try to hide behind a tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=558.577s">So,</a>  but I just got to tell you, again, thank you for everything you do and we're definitely going to miss this.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=568.142s">So</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=570.406s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=571.106s">I</a>  also want to thank Ron and Charlie and all the volunteers that are here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=574.569s">I</a>  know a lot of time, effort, dedication, and commitment go into this on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=581.693s">And</a>  to be doing this for 25 years, year after year, that's a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=588.637s">But</a>  as you, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, and Councilor Marks, this has been a successful tournament year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=595.401s">And</a>  it's something that you hear throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=599.285s">Thank</a>  you so much for all your time, your commitment to the tournament, to the youth of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=605.893s">I</a>  can't thank you enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=606.734s">And</a>  I just want to say thank you for your years of service and commitment to our community.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=958.547s">Well,</a>  Desmond's making his way up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=961.209s">I</a>  think that it's important that I think everybody here really celebrates Desmond's achievements. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=968.536s">I</a>  think that, you know, first, I've been given the honor in the past to present an Eagle Scout, and I think that was one of my biggest honors, because you realize how amazing and how important and <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=982.753s">What</a>  an honor this is the great people that have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=985.076s">So,</a>  and I know Chris Murphy comes out every year, every time there's an Eagle Scout presented as a fellow Eagle Scout he's here to present so here to show his respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=994.767s">So</a>  again, with your family and in the whole team behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=998.838s">I</a>  know the work that has to be done to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1000.94s">And</a>  I know Desmond understands the greatness that is upon you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1006.625s">You</a>  know, president, vice president, something big is gonna happen, Desmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1010.048s">Just</a>  don't forget Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1011.609s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1017.054s">Mr.</a>  President, also, if we can get a commitment that Desmond is not going to run for local public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1026.139s">What</a>  do you have to worry about? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1030.162s">A</a>  true politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1032.603s">Desmond,</a>  if you could just relay, we've had other recipients come before us, and I know a big part of becoming an Eagle Scout <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1041.709s">are</a>  the many adventures that you go on, but also the community service part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1046.634s">And</a>  what project you've done to obtain the community service aspect.</p>

    <p>[Desmond Lambert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1050.479s">Yeah,</a>  so my Eagle Scout project was I built a, like a big bench at the Medford dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1058.447s">The</a>  more recent one at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1062.753s">And</a>  yeah, it served a couple purposes provided more seating, of course, but protected the tree that the dogs are getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1073.074s">And</a>  yeah, I'd say that was a really cool project. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1077.376s">But</a>  like, in terms of the community service aspect, like the thing that's going to stick with me is the Veterans Day dinners that the scouts would put on every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1086.899s">And</a>  those, you know, we've been doing it for many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1091.761s">And</a>  it's something that we really take pride in. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1095.262s">It</a>  comes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1096.463s">And,</a>  and <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1097.992s">Having</a>  that commitment, it shows a lot, but it also teaches the right practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1106.936s">I</a>  think that is something I'd like to highlight a little bit more.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1111.078s">That's</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1112.298s">And</a>  every Eagle Scout that we've spoken with always states that it wasn't just solely their effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1120.582s">It</a>  was other people that helped them along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1123.863s">And</a>  I know you have a few people with you today.</p>

    <p>[Desmond Lambert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1125.785s">Yes,</a>  yes, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1126.766s">I'd</a>  like to shout out my parents as well, Julie and Tim Lambert. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1133.131s">It</a>  really is a group effort and you can't say it's all one person, but it was everything that all the volunteers put in and all the scouts around you, how they contribute to your journey as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1152.127s">I</a>  wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the Eagle Scouts before me that that pushed me to, you know, achieve this goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1162.311s">And,</a>  you know, I owe a lot to them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1164.911s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1166.732s">Well,</a>  you're truly a fine young gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1169.734s">I</a>  look for great things from you in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1173.356s">And</a>  I'd also like to thank your parents that are here tonight for their involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1179.758s">And</a>  I also would like to thank Councilor Falco, who since I've been on the council with them, I think has recognized a number of Eagle Scouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1189.822s">And</a>  I think he holds that great responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1194.535s">obtaining</a>  of that badge as a real high honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1198.718s">And</a>  I want to thank him as well and congratulate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1201.18s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2087.262s">That</a>  is that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2088.083s">Councilor</a>  can begin not less than that, because and with Labor Day weekend, uh, right, we wouldn't want to do the voting on a holiday weekend, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2096.429s">So</a>  that is that is correct.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2097.99s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2101.2s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2102.34s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2103.521s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2104.841s">We</a>  happen to have Sandy Gale that's here, who's the acting elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2110.622s">So</a>  I was wondering if she could step to the podium, just basically tell this council the need for early voting in this community and her staffing levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2125.206s">And</a>  I want to make sure that we administratively are able to pull this off, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2131.828s">in</a>  a very important city election.</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2135.371s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Marks through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2139.214s">Um,</a>  I think that early voting is is a very important aspect of elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2146.881s">However,</a>  given <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2151.088s">The</a>  preliminary election, it's my opinion that I don't believe we need four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2157.331s">I</a>  think in initial talks with the clerk, we were ready to jump on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2161.693s">For</a>  the full four days, I think five days would have been absolutely impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2166.256s">But</a>  I think we could achieve the same goal if we drop that to two days, which would be Wednesday, the 8th, and Thursday the 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2176.541s">We</a>  still would have over-the-counter voting, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2179.73s">going</a>  on in the clerk's office for that Friday and the Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2184.791s">So</a>  people that vote absentee and are accustomed to voting in that office for preliminary elections, they still would have that opportunity to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2195.234s">That</a>  also would reduce budgetary costs for early voting because I do have to have a minimum of probably eight staff, including myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2210.263s">I</a>  have the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2211.464s">That's</a>  not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2212.865s">But</a>  to reduce on a preliminary election some cost, it probably would be a worthy idea.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2222.233s">So</a>  through you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2224.615s">So,</a>  Sandy, the coverage of the poll that's gonna be here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2232.061s">Is</a>  that done with existing city employees or <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2234.999s">of</a>  these poll workers that would come in?</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2238.324s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Marks, it would be done with existing election workers that have done early voting last year all the way since 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2250.004s">It's</a>  been an ongoing training process for that early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2255.768s">Initially</a>  when we started in 2016, everything was on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2259.691s">Now</a>  we are lucky enough to have poll pads that we use that we can look voters up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2264.675s">There's</a>  a barcode so that when we process those ballots downstairs in the registrar voters office after voting has closed, we scan the barcode and it automatically takes that person out of the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2277.325s">so</a>  they can't come and try to vote early again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2280.948s">So</a>  it's an ongoing evolving process.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2285.953s">So</a>  just so I understand, it's not done with existing registrar voters employees.</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2293.799s">It</a>  is at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2295.641s">At</a>  night, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2296.842s">When</a>  voting is all done for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2300.645s">So</a>  the process is you come in, you check in through the poll pad, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2305.5s">you</a>  are given an affirmation envelope or what we call an EV7. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2310.784s">You're</a>  affirming on that envelope that you are the registered voter that is listed in the rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2316.949s">You</a>  sign the envelope, put your address, print your name. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2320.151s">You</a>  are then sent back to a table. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2322.173s">And</a>  since we all get the same ballot, this time around, there's no confusion about ballots and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2329.058s">So</a>  everybody for the preliminary will get exactly the same ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2332.721s">They</a>  get their ballot, go to the booth, fold it up, put it in the envelope, and then they drop it in the ballot box on their way out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2340.607s">We</a>  close the gap after voting is over for the day when myself or the clerk, with a police escort, take those ballots downstairs to the Registrar of Voters Office, and we open the VRIS system, which is our state voter registration information system. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2360.245s">and</a>  we scan each one of those barcodes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2364.127s">And</a>  that generates a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2366.309s">The</a>  difference with the preliminary this time is the plan is to send them out to the precincts to be tabulated on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2375.495s">So</a>  they would be handled like absentee ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2379.317s">And</a>  they would go with a checklist that would be created by us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2385.796s">And</a>  my other question, I did read through Chapter 29 of the Acts of 2021.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2391.104s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2391.645s">And</a>  I thought I read and correct me if I'm wrong, there's language in there for people that are unable to attend the in-person <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2400.462s">voting</a>  that would allow the registrar voters office to actually go out to homes and have people vote by ballot.</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2408.467s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2409.128s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2410.028s">We've</a>  always offered that service in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2413.09s">It</a>  depends on I'm last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2416.252s">It</a>  was a little, um, a little more dicey because of Cove it and <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2421.856s">being</a>  in the midst of a pandemic, we had to get a little more creative, like putting things in baggies or having the police drive or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2431.284s">But</a>  we've always offered that service, and I personally have done it myself for someone that had a disabled child that could not get to the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2440.251s">And</a>  I took the ballot out and allowed her to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2443.334s">And</a>  I do believe that the Board of Registrars also has done that in the past.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2449.142s">And</a>  does that need to happen in conjunction with the days that we approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2453.364s">Or</a>  does that happen right up until the election?</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2456.165s">I</a>  think that happens right up until the election and including election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2460.207s">Because</a>  you don't ever know what type of emergency situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2464.809s">And</a>  you certainly don't want to turn a voter away because someone can't get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2470.111s">That's</a>  one of the reasons why we have registrars and people who are equipped to do that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2478.398s">And</a>  that's great, and I think part of offering this is also notifying the public that it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2484.7s">Because</a>  when I read the acts, I wasn't familiar with some of it myself, and I've been around for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2490.642s">So</a>  I think part of the outreach that will be done between now and the plenary and the general election should include that outreach, what options people have available. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2500.585s">So</a>  I'd ask that that be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2502.946s">Have</a>  you had the opportunity to put a monetary value on <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2508.408s">what</a>  it's gonna cost the city to provide each day with having election employees as well as I would assume you'd need a police officer present for the time and any other associated costs with allowing the in-person voting?</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2524.299s">A</a>  rough guesstimate is it probably would cost <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2540.254s">roughly</a>  it's gonna cost about between 750 and 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2543.256s">Does</a>  that sound fair, Mr. Clerk?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2547.479s">That's</a>  ballpark.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2548.379s">Yeah,</a>  that's ballpark. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2550.38s">And</a>  that would be based on the number of days that you offered the full for the preliminary?</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2555.263s">No,</a>  that's for both days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2556.864s">That's</a>  for two days of early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2559.026s">So</a>  it's roughly about $400 a day.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2561.647s">So</a>  that's for two days of early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2565.96s">Based</a>  on what you're telling me, I feel very comfortable, especially knowing the preliminary election in this community typically has a real low turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2576.834s">And</a>  I think having the early voting in person voting <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2580.205s">for</a>  four days sounds kind of excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2583.826s">Friday</a>  to me is kind of a lost day because Friday City Hall closes at 1230. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2588.788s">So</a>  you're really only getting four hours on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2590.889s">I</a>  much prefer having the extended hours on the Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2595.542s">for</a>  those that may be working and can't make it during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2598.525s">So</a>  I would support and put it in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we have the early in-person voting for the preliminary on Wednesday, September 8th, from 8.30 to 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2614.698s">That's</a>  normal business hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2616.379s">And</a>  Thursday, September 9th, from 8.30 to 4.30, and that's for the preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2622.422s">and</a>  Wednesday, October 27th, 8.30 to 7.30, and Thursday, October 28th, 8.30 to 4.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2629.106s">From</a>  my tabulations, that's 19 hours of additional in-person options that people have in addition to mail-in ballots and so forth and other options that they may have, Mr. President, for voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2645.577s">So</a>  I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2648.258s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2651.012s">What</a>  are the information for your early voting in October, which is for your general election in November? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2659.634s">The</a>  one thing that you want to do is definitely capture at least one weekend day so that those folks who work a regular job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2668.895s">I</a>  do think that in the October early voting for the general election, you do need to offer all five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2679.177s">That's</a>  my opinion and based on looking at what the numbers were for early voting last year, we have a much higher turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2688.24s">And</a>  without really knowing where we're going to be as far as community health concerns in regards to the Delta variant in Medford, the controlled environment that we have here with help from DPW who comes in and fogs for us every two hours, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2708.329s">it's</a>  probably a little bit more important for the general to have that five days.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2716.333s">I</a>  just don't know why this would be any more controlled than any other poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2720.856s">Don't</a>  we follow the same standards?</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2723.457s">Yes</a>  and no. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2725.138s">I</a>  don't anticipate having sanitizers and spacers in the precincts unless something develops in the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2736.389s">that</a>  the governor reissues a mask mandate or reissues closings. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2741.971s">So</a>  I didn't anticipate having sanitizers and spacers as I did last November. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2750.594s">So</a>  the staff in a polling location has changed even from March of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2758.517s">We</a>  had a warden and a clerk, two check-in inspectors, and two check-out inspectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2766.47s">Under</a>  these acts, we have eliminated the checkout inspectors, which has worked much better.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2774.914s">So</a>  at this point, Mr. President, I'll listen to what my colleagues have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2779.216s">I</a>  will withdraw the motion I put forth for the general election and listen to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2787.44s">I</a>  do want to say, Mr. President, that it's vital that we have an election coordinator in position <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2795.131s">which</a>  this council has been pushing for for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2799.294s">And</a>  Sandy Gill has been our election coordinator for all intents and purposes for a couple of decades now in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2809.28s">As</a>  we found out, Sandy is acting and the administration's working on apparently <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2817.635s">uh,</a>  posting the position and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2819.917s">But</a>  we also heard from the city administration less than an hour ago that they like to get people into acting roles and then push them into the role, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2831.046s">And</a>  here we have someone <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2832.928s">that's</a>  been acting, doing the job, a very capable person. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2836.689s">That's</a>  another thing we heard from the city administration, that they wanna make sure if they are gonna put someone in an acting role, they're capable, and then also have the ability to do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2846.69s">And</a>  here we have someone that's capable doing the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2849.951s">I</a>  don't know what the hangup is, but in my opinion, 26 years elected in this city, Mr. President, the integrity of our election process is of the utmost importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2862.959s">And</a>  if people lose confidence in how we run an election, Mr. President, I don't want to be around for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2869.341s">So</a>  I think it's important that we have a coordinator, the council recognize that, while waiting for the city administration to follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2876.323s">And</a>  it's vital, Mr. President, we have someone in that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2880.565s">I</a>  appreciate Sandy's and the acting role, and I think it's about time the city administration gets off their duff and does something, Mr. President, in order to maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2890.995s">of</a>  the integrity and security of our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2893.395s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2893.896s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2894.456s">Councilor</a>  Raul.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2896.216s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2897.256s">I</a>  understand the rationale of Councilor Marks' motion, as well as what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2902.737s">Gail</a>  is sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2903.897s">I</a>  personally don't feel comfortable cutting the days for early voting for the preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2908.998s">I</a>  would support the original four days that were recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2913.019s">And</a>  that's just, as an elected official, I don't feel comfortable limiting the days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2917.38s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2918.798s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2919.458s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2921.859s">Through</a>  you to Coordinator Gale, my first question is on the mail-in voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2930.66s">Are</a>  we or is the Secretary of State's office going to be sending a postcard out to let people know that they can apply for a mail ballot?</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2939.342s">At</a>  this time, I'm sorry, through the Chair, Councilor Bears, at this time, the only <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2947.781s">advertisement</a>  is the Secretary of State making infomercials or having on their website that you can vote by mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2959.624s">There</a>  is a link. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2961.385s">I</a>  did work with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2963.205s">Peeks</a>  like a week and a half ago on putting some information up on our Medford website where you could click the link, download the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2973.088s">It's</a>  very important that when voters download that application, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2976.983s">that</a>  they don't type their name in, they have to sign it, physically sign it, or we will be returning it, the application will be rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2985.309s">We</a>  did run into some of that last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2987.33s">The</a>  mail-in is an evolving process. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2991.293s">We</a>  are learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2992.194s">Last</a>  year, it was done on a scale that had never been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2996.216s">But</a>  by November, we were perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2998.798s">So</a>  we've learned and made notes, and we have the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3005.428s">It's</a>  just getting the information out there, which also brings me to, the clerk and I have already ordered a large banner to hang, reminding people that September the 14th is preliminary election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3021.401s">We</a>  have lawn signs to go throughout the city and two larger signs that are gonna be put on frames in the front lawn to get voter awareness out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3031.982s">But</a>  as of right now, in my last account from the state, which was earlier today, no, they are not sending out any postcards. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3040.845s">But</a>  it is important for voters to know on this platform that if you're applying for a mail-in ballot for the preliminary election, that one application covers you for preliminary and general. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3058.351s">So</a>  you only have to do it once.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3060.943s">That's</a>  helpful, yeah, and I have full confidence in the mail process and the votes being all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3066.045s">I</a>  think it's the question of do people know that it's still an option? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3069.926s">So</a>  I'm glad to hear that there's gonna be some efforts made. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3073.928s">I</a>  think for the, I guess my question, then I'll make my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3077.609s">How,</a>  is there a date, can I request a mail ballot today for these elections?</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3083.251s">Through</a>  the chair, yes, Councilor Bears, you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3085.692s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3086.492s">You</a>  can request one right up until, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3094.789s">I</a>  believe it's the eighth, Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3097.79s">I</a>  have to check the exact schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3100.851s">I</a>  think it's five days before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3105.152s">Five</a>  days before, I believe it is the eighth of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3108.233s">It</a>  might be six days before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3110.034s">So</a>  that would be, yeah, it's the eighth of the ninth, but I think Sandy's right, I think it's the eighth.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3116.336s">All</a>  right, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3117.376s">Yeah,</a>  and I would just maybe suggest, I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3120.818s">It</a>  may incur a cost, maybe even a pretty significant cost, but letting voters know the options, maybe via a postcard or a robocall of some kind, I think would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3132.042s">Just</a>  because the law, I mean, it's right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3135.563s">This</a>  came to us August 12th, the law was signed July 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3138.804s">There's</a>  kind of been some back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3140.584s">There's</a>  some concerns that some options may not be available. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3144.306s">So</a>  I do think just to make sure voters know all their options, that could be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3148.567s">we</a>  can we council bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3150.468s">We</a>  can request a we can request reverse 911 postcard would be, um, might be prohibitively prohibitively expensive on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3160.411s">Um,</a>  last year, as you'll recall, the Secretary of State's office, in other words, the Commonwealth covered the cost for all those postcards, which was a which is a very large cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3168.833s">But</a>  I think we can definitely do some reverse 911 citywide alerting people to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3174.555s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3174.955s">part</a>  of the reason and we'd be more than happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3178.257s">Um,</a>  particularly if you act tonight on the early voting dates, because we can get all that we can get all that information out at once, and we could do it more than once.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3186.18s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3186.821s">And</a>  then on early voting, I personally I hear Council marks on the low turnout, but this is the first election I can remember <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3196.523s">in</a>  many, many years where we've had a preliminary election for the office of mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3200.886s">So</a>  I think that may significantly increase turnout from a preliminary elections in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3206.37s">So</a>  I personally would like to maintain the four days of early voting for the preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3212.394s">I</a>  know that I respect your view on it, and I understand that it would save about $1,000, but I just don't think we know what turnout might be and having three candidates <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3226.162s">is</a>  is unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3228.903s">Custom</a>  rope.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3230.744s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3231.585s">Councilor</a>  Bears job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3232.845s">My</a>  memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3233.306s">I've</a>  seen some people if I could for coordinator Gail through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3238.248s">People</a>  voted absentee for the first time last November. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3241.49s">They</a>  still need to request to vote absentee to vote mail in ballot again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3245.872s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3246.112s">They're</a>  not going to automatically get something.</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3248.218s">Through</a>  the chair, Councilor Morell, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3250.979s">They</a>  need to request a new application for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3254.94s">And</a>  that application will cover them for the preliminary election and for the general November 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3261.742s">So</a>  they only need to do it once and it stays checked in our file system. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3267.505s">in</a>  VRIS so that we know, okay, they requested we have to mail this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3273.087s">There</a>  have been no ballots mailed out as of this time because they were just ordered today.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3277.868s">Great,</a>  thank you, because I've seen that question posed in a number of places, and I just want to thank you and the clerk for doing the work on the banner and the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3285.391s">That's</a>  a request I've seen for a number of years, so I'm really excited to see those go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3289.752s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3292.701s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and miss Gail, thank you so much for your presentation and the clerk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3298.563s">And</a>  we've been talking about advertising elections for a while, and it's it's great to see that this is occurring, and it's, you know, it's I said we're reaching out trying to engage people, and you know being part of the process of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3312.189s">I</a>  for one, I completely understand the rationale for. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3316.318s">reducing</a>  the number of days, but for me, I like to see that this flexibility, so I would be in favor of keeping the four days in person early voting as stated here, the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th for the preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3331.596s">That</a>  would be <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3334.105s">I</a>  think it's great that we have the flexibility, especially with concerns of COVID and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3339.327s">If</a>  someone's weary, they had the flexibility of coming over a multiple number of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3345.309s">So</a>  I think four days is ideal, and I would be in favor of the four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3349.891s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3350.811s">Through</a>  the chair, thank you, Councilor Thompson.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3354.032s">Have</a>  we been in contact with the post office yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3356.473s">I</a>  know last time we had some issues with the post office.</p>

    <p>[Sandra Burbine-Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3362.857s">Mr.</a>  President, I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3364.338s">I</a>  have a direct contact now at the post office when the issues began to arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3369.684s">I</a>  went in person to the post office and I have a direct contact here and we've made an agreement how our in city mail will be handled, especially if it's ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3381.475s">So</a>  generally the track of mail <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3385.678s">in</a>  Medford is it goes to Forest Street, and then from Forest Street it goes into Boston, and from Boston it comes back out to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3394.145s">So</a>  my contact at the Forest Street post office, as long as we keep it separated as to local mail and non-local mail, meaning non-Medford delivery, they will deliver immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3406.575s">I</a>  also have a postal connection that I made last year at the urging of the clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3413.65s">to</a>  establish some groundwork with another gentleman at the post office in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3421.273s">And</a>  he oversees all cities and towns in any mailing through the Secretary of State's office, and I have a very good rapport with both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3431.156s">So</a>  I don't anticipate that to be an issue at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3435.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3435.798s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3438.099s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3438.939s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3442.707s">Council</a>  Marks, you have a motion on the floor to have the yearly voting for just Wednesday and Thursday, correct?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3455.453s">Based</a>  on the recommendation of our elections coordinator for the preliminary, I withdrew my recommendations for the general election.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3465.337s">So,</a>  on the motion by Council Marks, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3472.081s">As</a>  amended, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3477.362s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3478.902s">So</a>  I need some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3483.343s">Are</a>  you voting on the two days of early voting for September and then all the additional days for October, or are they separate votes?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3490.184s">No,</a>  it's one vote.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3492.344s">So</a>  the motion is to reduce it to two?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3495.485s">The</a>  two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3496.025s">For</a>  the preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3497.365s">For</a>  the preliminary, for the Wednesday and the Thursday on the recommendation <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3502.186s">of</a>  the election coordinator.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3513.452s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3545.252s">Wait,</a>  wait, wait, what?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3548.593s">I</a>  had a question about if it was severed or not, because I wanna, I don't know what, okay.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3555.254s">Are</a>  we voting?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3558.195s">The</a>  motion is by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3560.376s">He</a>  supported the motion as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3562.936s">He's</a>  amending the motion to reduce the early voting in four days to two on the Wednesday and Thursday.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3570.618s">I</a>  would like to vote on the amendment first and then vote on the... Do you want to sever?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3577.042s">I</a>  don't... They asked me a motion to sever the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3583.647s">Wait</a>  a second, we're voting on the whole package at once.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3586.509s">Yeah,</a>  I would like to vote on the amendment proposed by Councilor Marks and then vote on the final paper, depending on... And then that version of the final paper will be determined on the vote of the amendment, if that makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3599.457s">I'm</a>  not opposed to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3600.447s">Okay,</a>  so on the amendment, a motion by Councilor Markswell to reduce the days from four to two. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3611.34s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3613.743s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3616.145s">So</a>  this is to reduce from four to two, for the preliminary.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3619.129s">For</a>  the preliminary.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3632.85s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3633.951s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3635.452s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3636.173s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3637.374s">Vice</a>  President Knight is absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3638.615s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3639.736s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3640.837s">Councilor</a>  Morell?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3641.598s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3642.979s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3643.84s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3647.463s">President</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3648.484s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3650.526s">It's</a>  a tie, we have a tie.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3653.649s">Motion</a>  fails.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3655.11s">That</a>  generally means motion fails.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3657.092s">Motion</a>  fails.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3659.435s">So</a>  does that mean that there's no early voting?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3662.877s">No,</a>  I'm now moving to approve.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3664.998s">There'll</a>  be four days now.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3667.139s">I</a>  move to approve.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3668.159s">We</a>  gotta vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3670.24s">Approve.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3670.761s">That's</a>  what I'm trying to figure out.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3672.221s">Motion</a>  to approve all nine days of early voting, four for the preliminary, five for the general.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3678.124s">I'd</a>  ask that we sever that vote, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3682.266s">What</a>  do you want to sever out of that?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3684.05s">take</a>  them as two distinct votes, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3685.851s">Preliminary</a>  and the general election.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3687.932s">That's</a>  fine with me.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3688.652s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion by Councilor Bears to vote on the preliminary dates, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3701.659s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3706.641s">And</a>  this is for the dates of the preliminary only, the four dates.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3711.663s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3713.091s">Council</a>  Max.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3713.931s">Just</a>  if I could, it was only roughly, I think less than a month ago that a member of this council offered a resolution to do away with the preliminary altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3724.757s">And</a>  here we have a preliminary that's gonna take place and now we're adding days, which I'm not opposed to, I'm opposed to that many days, but now we're adding days from going to eliminating the preliminary to adding days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3738.524s">I</a>  just think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3741.632s">I</a>  don't know where we're going, Mr. President, you know, unless it's just, you know, on a whim that we go back and forth, but it doesn't make much sense to me.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3751.515s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President, I actually took a page from the book of Councilor Marks on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3757.957s">And</a>  my resolution was that the preliminary election be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3762.399s">And</a>  I just wanted to feel out the room to see if there may be interest in not having a preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3767.742s">and</a>  clearly there was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3769.344s">So</a>  we discussed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3770.945s">We</a>  decided against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3772.126s">I</a>  think if we're going to have the election, we should make it as flexible and open as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3775.59s">So</a>  that's my position, right?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3776.891s">But</a>  that wasn't the original intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3778.953s">The</a>  original intent was to have a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3781.516s">And</a>  this council thought better because <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3784.121s">We</a>  didn't even have the full number of people that were gonna run. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3787.722s">We</a>  didn't even know if we were gonna have a preliminary election.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3790.063s">We</a>  discussed it and decided it was a bad idea and I stand by it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3792.905s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3793.465s">But</a>  I don't know how we go from one extreme to another, but I guess everyone's entitled to their opinion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3800.288s">But</a>  my vote is based on the recommendation from our election coordinator that's been in this community for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3808.131s">And</a>  to think that because of the election in this preliminary, that there's gonna be some strange turnout <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3814.426s">I</a>  think is misguided, very misguided, Mr. President, but that's my own opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3819.168s">We</a>  shall see.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3821.129s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3823.61s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3826.031s">And</a>  this is to approve the- To approve the four days of preliminary voting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3832.434s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3833.895s">Just</a>  before you call, so if this happens to get voted down, Mr. President, in the spirit of cooperation, if this happens to get voted down, there will be no early, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3843.966s">in</a>  voting at all for the poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3848.69s">And</a>  so a three to three vote is eliminating it altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3853.533s">So</a>  rather than having four days or two days, we're gonna have zero days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3857.096s">So</a>  in the interest of negotiation, Mr. President, I just wanna put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3863.901s">So</a>  no one's caught off guard because I know what I'm gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3876.04s">I'd</a>  rather have 19 hours of in-person voting than zero.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3879.283s">But</a>  if I were to move to reconsider before the end of the meeting, would we be able to take up the vote again at this meeting?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3886.929s">No,</a>  because you're not on the prevailing side. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3888.911s">You</a>  have to be on the prevailing side.</p>

    <p>[Gilwood Chen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4413.799s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4414.399s">My</a>  current address where I live is 1119 Skyline Drive, Daly City, California, 94015. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4421.081s">And</a>  my name is Gilwood Chen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4422.662s">Camilla</a>  is currently busier at the moment, so she couldn't fill in on the council meeting.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4428.487s">Okay,</a>  so a couple of few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4430.568s">I</a>  know that now this is just changing over from one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4435.17s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4436.191s">The</a>  other correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4437.912s">I</a>  know the word when it comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4439.032s">Yes,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4440.413s">I</a>  think that's just just the term that we use cleaning dying. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4444.715s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4445.295s">You</a>  know, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4449.077s">The</a>  biggest, you know, in this area is what's happened in years of water so people may see dying, but just to be sure this is just a legal form a formality for cleaning and laundry.</p>

    <p>[Gilwood Chen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4465.522s">Sorry,</a>  excuse me.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4467.402s">How</a>  many employees do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4468.903s">How</a>  many employees we have?</p>

    <p>[Gilwood Chen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4471.173s">It's</a>  just me and Camilla, we're co-owners, and it's just a straight laundromat, there's no dry cleaning, there's no other special chemicals that we're using, just detergent and soap.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4479.678s">All</a>  right, and your hours of operations?</p>

    <p>[Gilwood Chen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4482.5s">Six</a>  to 11.</p>

Alden Memorial Chambers on the second floor of Medford City Council, 85 George B. Assett Drive, at seven o'clock on Tuesday, August 17th, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4589.587s">2020,</a>  a link posted no later than Friday, August 13th, 2021, on a petition of LR Construction, Inc., on behalf of the Citizens Bank, for permission to construct the proposed ADA upgrades at 257 Spring Street, Citizens Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4605.355s">Proposed</a>  plans have been filed in the office of the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4609.296s">Wherefore,</a>  it prays that after the due notice and hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4613.215s">by</a>  law, they'd be granted permission to complete the project in accordance with the plans available for inspection in the office of the City Clerk of the City Hall room 103 George Piazza Drive, FMS 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4625.021s">The</a>  entire scope of this project includes ABA upgrades of three locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4629.862s">front</a>  ATM vestibule and lobby, rear parking lot, and the front entrance along Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4636.869s">The</a>  work at the front entrance includes modifying city sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4640.692s">The</a>  scope of the work at the front entrance is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4644.056s">Demo</a>  existing sidewalks in three sections along the building, 108 square feet, install a new ADA compliant landing and ramp, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4657.602s">install</a>  a new EDA compliant handrail around landing along the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4665.33s">Approved</a>  city engineer with the following conditions, recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4668.233s">One,</a>  the engineering division provided a suggested process to assist the city council in our October 21, 2020 memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4677.342s">As</a>  indicated in that process, if approved by the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4680.94s">the</a>  petitioner would be required to draft a proposed licensing agreement in coordination with the legal department and engineering division. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4689.782s">The</a>  engineering division recommends that the city council determine if this process is adequate and reasonable pursuant to section 74-63 of the city ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4701.165s">Two,</a>  the engineering division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situated <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4709.32s">for</a>  as long as they remain in good condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4711.602s">If</a>  they fall into disrepair or poor conditions, the city will revoke the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4715.585s">The</a>  existing encroachments will include a metal fire escape, building cornices, and signs attached to the building three. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4723.311s">The</a>  easement plan indicates an easement area that extends beyond the existing projections into the public way, the engineering division. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4731.531s">takes</a>  no exception to this approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4733.392s">However,</a>  the license agreement should indicate that no new encroachments or expansion of the existing encroachments is allowed beyond the limits of the existing encroachments as shown on the eastern plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4746.503s">Four,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4747.43s">The</a>  license agreement should indicate that the licensee will maintain the encroaching items in good condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4753.131s">Five,</a>  the license agreement should indicate that the city will revoke the license upon removal of the encroaching items. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4760.572s">Six,</a>  the city council should decide if the license agreement should include a renewal period or expiration. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4767.554s">Seven,</a>  the city council should recommend a reasonable fee be charged by the city for use of public property for the benefit of the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4776.739s">The</a>  licensed area must include the level landing at the base of the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4781.342s">Nine,</a>  the license agreement should acknowledge that the potential presence of underground utilities beneath the proposed ramp should not restrict access to these utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4790.388s">10,</a>  the notification for the public hearing regarding this approval process should include utility companies that have infrastructure in this block of Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4801.615s">11,</a>  the sidewalk work associated with this ramp is adjacent to a cracked sidewalk panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4807.07s">adjacent</a>  crack panels should be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4809.111s">12,</a>  the ramp is a projection of the building and is associated with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4814.714s">Entrance</a>  and exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4815.835s">The</a>  ramp must be built per applicable building code and inspected by the building department for code compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4823.719s">13,</a>  the plan indicates a national grid manhole near the proposed ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4829.223s">The</a>  licensee should not restrict access to this manhole. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4834.313s">The</a>  plan indicates relocating a tree pit on Spring Street that conflicts with clearances needed for the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4841.074s">The</a>  new location appears reasonable and should be confirmed with the tree ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4846.535s">15,</a>  the license agreement should indicate the minimum clearance between the ramp and the front of the curb to be 72 inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4855.877s">Call</a>  781-393-2425 for any further accommodations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4865.32s">Do</a>  we have any discussion on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4867.401s">The</a>  petitioner is on call. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4869.442s">Where</a>  is the petitioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4871.744s">Ammar</a>  Salam?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4873.645s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4874.885s">Yeah,</a>  I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4877.047s">This</a>  is Ammar Salam. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4878.207s">I'm</a>  from Senior Project Manager from Citizen Financial Group. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4883.13s">I'm</a>  the one who's managing the project at this location, and I reviewed the comments provided by the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4894.904s">Comments</a>  no, I will kind of like if we go from number one and down Common number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4901.187s">We</a>  have no issue about this common back to the consulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4905.53s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4906.69s">Can</a>  you hold on one second? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4908.051s">We're</a>  just dying to hear Are you here speaking in favor of this hearing?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4915.515s">Yes,</a>  sir</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4916.397s">Yeah,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4917.638s">Is</a>  there anyone else here speaking in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4920.781s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, we close that portion of the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4923.344s">Is</a>  there anyone here opposed to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4927.628s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, we close that portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4931.813s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Salam. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4933.334s">If</a>  you can continue with the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4936.678s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4937.879s">Item</a>  number two, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4939.966s">uh</a>  the engineering division uh recommending metal fire escape uh building cornish and signs attached to the building the metal fire escape was constructed in this building from day one and i just want to kind of like uh uh present citizen bank side we are leasing this building triple net so we pay lease we maintain it <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4964.578s">And</a>  when we leased the place, which is constructed, I think 1934 or around this time, the metal fire escape was already existing over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4975.165s">So</a>  my thought in this case, the metal fire escape, it's a landlord issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4980.528s">It's</a>  not citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4982.289s">The</a>  building coronation signage, we removed it and we installed more modern design, which less much less projection. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4991.915s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4993.218s">For</a>  item number two, we have no problem in regards to the signage or the cornish because we already took them out and installed newer version with much less projection than the existing one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5004.665s">And</a>  this work was done like early this year, and a permit being pulled from the township, approved, and the work is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5015.651s">For</a>  item number three, we have no issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5018.293s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5019.093s">We</a>  have information Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5022.994s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5025.135s">Are</a>  you saying that there's a discrepancy that we're not, we're not, it's not, I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5030.817s">You're</a>  saying that there's an issue with the fire escape that has no reflection to citizens, but to the landlord, what does that have to do with, I'm confused with this project.</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5041.64s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, metal fire escape, it's existing condition in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5044.661s">When</a>  the building is built like 19, mid 1900, is the original landlord, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5052.101s">or</a>  the Lakarta landlord, when it's built, they build the fire escape, and at the time, probably, the permit officer approved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5061.403s">It's</a>  existing condition, and usually, it's not related to our project at all.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5067.785s">So</a>  Citizens Bank does not agree with number two, then?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5071.706s">Part</a>  of it, because the mental fire escape, it's a part of the building that's been constructed since 1934, and probably has been approved at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5082.26s">I'm</a>  not sure why the engineer would like to include it in the scope of work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5089.806s">He</a>  is pointing out some violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5093.129s">And</a>  from Citizen Bank, the fine and Cornish building, it's already been demoed earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5100.075s">We</a>  have a brand new signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5101.836s">If</a>  you guys allow me, I can share my screen with a new picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5106.314s">My</a>  only comment here, I agree with the building coordination signage, but the metal fire escape, it's existing part of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5116.663s">It</a>  was happening before we leave the building.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5118.565s">Okay,</a>  do you realize this is a hearing that will depend whether this council supports us or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5127.172s">A</a>  city engineer is requesting that this be one of the stipulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5131.416s">You</a>  understand that, right?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5133.838s">Yeah,</a>  I mean if you guys want to include it because but in this case if you if some deterioration happened to it We are liable to fix it because we are leasing the building triple net So we are liable of fixing any item in the building that could cause any hazard to the public Yeah, I mean <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5157.539s">We</a>  can maintain it, but when our lease expire, we're not responsible for the metal fire escape after that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5167.547s">We</a>  have Chris Schultz on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5170.769s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5173.031s">From</a>  LR Construction.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5175.553s">Yeah,</a>  I'm here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5176.233s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5177.775s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Chris Schultz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5181.618s">Chris</a>  Schultz, 346 Lake Street in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5185.16s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5188.407s">Chris,</a>  I think there's a, maybe you could enlighten us about the fire escape issue.</p>

    <p>[Chris Schultz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5193.551s">It's</a>  just a lot of these comments were brought up by the city engineer in our approval process for this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5201.978s">And</a>  a lot of them, they have nothing to do with the work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5205.241s">It's</a>  just these, all these comments were addressed or brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5210.245s">As</a>  armor said, their existing conditions that have nothing with this job that we're trying to get completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5216.733s">So</a>  why are you bringing it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5220.136s">We</a>  didn't feel the need to bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5222.398s">This</a>  was the stuff that was brought up in our review by the city.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5228.662s">I'm</a>  trying, I'm just, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5237.209s">I</a>  can clarify more if you allow me to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5240.672s">I</a>  have a picture of the building with the fire escape. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5244.818s">And</a>  you guys can see it is that Citizen Bank hired LR Construction to build a ramp on the front of the branch and the landing based on a registered architect drawing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5259.986s">And</a>  this is the scope of work that we requesting approval on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5265.108s">I</a>  believe like the engineer, when they went over there, they find existing enroachment and they incorporated on this hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5274.993s">does</a>  not relate to the scope of work that has been noted in the beginning of the petition, which is scope of work at front entrance is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5284.1s">Demo</a>  existing sidewalk, three section, install new ADA compliant landing and ramp, install new ADA compliant handrail around landing along the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5296.21s">This</a>  is all what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5298.311s">Item</a>  number two, it's pointing existing condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5303.144s">been</a>  built like from day one from the building, except of course, time, which is maybe.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5310.08s">Yeah,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5312.781s">Unfortunately,</a>  the city engineer isn't on the call, and as I'm reading this, our city engineer division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situate for as long as they remain in good condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5326.244s">If</a>  they fall into disrepair or poor condition, the city will revoke the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5329.865s">The</a>  existing encroachment includes a metal fire escape building and sign attached to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5336.046s">So</a>  you're saying that, um, so I just want to make sure we're clear on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5340.632s">So</a>  you're saying that citizens bank does not agree with number two and will not.</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5346.961s">I'm</a>  just, no, I'm clarifying that the metal fire escape, it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5352.192s">something</a>  new we're building.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5353.773s">It's</a>  existing, and for item number two, the engineer is giving us direction as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5361.617s">These</a>  are steps that the engineer is giving us that you would abide by, so we would give you this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5370.921s">We</a>  would allow this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5371.942s">Do</a>  you understand what we're saying?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5374.683s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah 100% I'm not agreeing with his comment where we need to maintain it in good condition So I'm agreeing with that He's saying that yeah already on the building and it is in good repair so if it does correct They will have to fix it</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5401.975s">We,</a>  Citizen Bank, will have to fix it as long as we are leasing the building.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5406.056s">If</a>  I understand that correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5407.596s">Right,</a>  but I'm understanding that Mr. Salaam said that they do not support what that is because that is... He's saying that that's not part of his scope of work.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5416.939s">He's</a>  only doing the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5418.659s">He's</a>  not touching the fire extinguishers. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5421.08s">I</a>  mean, the fire escape. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5422.82s">All</a>  he's doing is a sidewalk and ABA.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5424.84s">I'm</a>  going to yield to my fellow consultants.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5426.881s">Maybe</a>  I'm overthinking this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5428.361s">If</a>  I understand that right.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5429.301s">If</a>  I'm correct, though, with this paper here, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5433.089s">These</a>  are the recommendations for approval by the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5438.49s">So</a>  the papers here, these are the recommendations that he's basically- The engineer has said that as long as these things remain in good condition, which the fire escape is one of them, they will be allowed to keep their license.</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5455.494s">And</a>  Citizen Bank will agree with that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5458.323s">This</a>  is not Citizens Bank's concerns, it's the landlord's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5463.406s">So</a>  obviously, so they're not taking responsibility for that, if that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5467.068s">Am</a>  I confused with that?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5469.35s">No,</a>  these are already on the building, the existing encroachments.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5473.653s">What</a>  he's saying is- It's not a question, Ricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5475.714s">This</a>  stuff is already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5477.915s">We</a>  know that, but if the petitioner just said, this is what I'm getting at, he said that <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5484.8s">This</a>  is a disagreement with the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5486.961s">That's</a>  the landlord's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5488.622s">Well,</a>  the landlord's not here for this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5491.003s">Citizens</a>  Bank, if they're not gonna take responsibility for this, then they're not gonna support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5495.865s">Do</a>  you understand what I'm saying?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5497.046s">No,</a>  no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5498.947s">Excuse</a>  me, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5499.827s">We're</a>  gonna take responsibility for it as long we are leasing the building.</p>

    <p>[Chris Schultz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5505.41s">If</a>  they move out, it's not their responsibility.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5509.752s">Why</a>  would you bring up the landlord? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5512.053s">What</a>  would this council need that for?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5518.093s">We</a>  are not we were maintaining the building any Deterioration to fire escape or any other item within the building or outside of the building is the citizen bank responsibility As long as we are leasing the building So you agree with that?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5536.545s">Yes</a>  How is that so difficult <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5542.327s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5543.047s">No,</a>  I just want to clarify that the metal fire escape was existing structure from the building originally. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5548.39s">It</a>  wasn't part of the project, but we are maintaining it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5552.132s">We</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5552.673s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5553.013s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5553.253s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5554.254s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5556.215s">Number</a>  four, we agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5558.036s">Number</a>  five, we agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5561.177s">Number</a>  six, we agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5566.7s">Number</a>  seven, we kind of like <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5571.202s">don't</a>  agree with it because we notice other property within the township have ramp and landing, and I don't believe that the township charging fee for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5584.47s">In</a>  addition to that, our lease, we pay in taxes, all the taxes required for the building.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5590.734s">Mr.</a>  Slavkin, Councilor Falco has a question.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5593.636s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5594.676s">It's</a>  not a question for Ghalam. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5598.038s">I</a>  believe last time we <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5599.948s">In</a>  the last meeting, we asked for some guidance on, I think, point number seven.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5603.451s">Yes,</a>  and Ellen Bourdeaux is on the line to give us some guidance for that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5607.695s">Okay,</a>  if we could hear from Ellen with regards to point number seven, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5610.877s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you unmute Ellen, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5612.178s">I</a>  don't know if she's still muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5614.76s">Ellen,</a>  can you give us some guidance on a reasonable fee that should be charged by the city for this?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5627.768s">Yeah,</a>  good evening Councilors and I apologize for the mute thing I have a three year old grandson being very vocal in the background. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5634.233s">So,</a>  um, I, I apologize that I'm probably not going to give you the information that you want to hear this evening, um, I received this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5644.12s">Prior</a>  to going on vacation I came back from vacation this week from, and I did provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5650.948s">the</a>  mayor's office, and then Adam had contacted me this evening, earlier today for my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5658.711s">I</a>  have reviewed the parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5662.232s">I</a>  don't have market data that would support providing an estimate of the cost to rent 108 square foot sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5669.775s">I</a>  don't gather market data on the value of sidewalks, roadways, or anything that's used as a public right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5678.998s">And</a>  honestly, for me to do some wild guess number, I would be guessing at something that I, you know, I'd be in violation of Uniswap. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5690.854s">So</a>  I truly cannot give you a number of what <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5694.263s">that</a>  kind of what that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5696.485s">And</a>  the best guidance I could say would, if that's something that the city council wanted to pursue would be to find an appraiser that has expertise and valuing that would not be an easy thing to do but I'm sure there's probably somebody out there that could offer some kind of number. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5713.319s">And,</a>  and that's really all I can can add to that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5717.918s">Ellen,</a>  is this a common practice in other cities to rent the sidewalk?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5722.462s">Not,</a>  I contacted other peers, certainly I only call on three, I've just got back from vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5729.669s">They</a>  do not have any data in their communities of knowledge of renting sidewalk space. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5736.155s">It's</a>  a public right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5741.062s">I</a>  was kind of, like I said, I received this right before vacation, so I apologize for not getting back to city council earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5747.844s">I</a>  just returned yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5749.185s">It's</a>  not, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5754.366s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5755.587s">Ellen,</a>  do you think that if we were to just decide on some sort of nominal flat fee, that that would be an irresponsible decision or would it be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5767.568s">Do</a>  you really feel like we have to go the route of getting this area appraised?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5773.491s">I</a>  would ask, you have members that have been with this council much longer than I've been with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5779.354s">Is</a>  this a practice that does the city have, is the city leasing this type of space to anyone else today?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5785.717s">My</a>  understanding is it's a unique situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5788.979s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5789.359s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5792.519s">Yeah,</a>  I truly, I wouldn't know how to advise you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5796.821s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5799.682s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5801.503s">When</a>  I look at this here, this is a recommendation that has been made by the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5806.285s">So</a>  the city engineer must know of some community that is taking this type of action currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5814.389s">So</a>  I think we need to either reach back to him <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5816.873s">and</a>  find out what community is going through this process and how do they arrive at the fee that they charge the particular company in that city or town. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5831.019s">He</a>  must have come up with this somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5832.2s">It</a>  must be done in other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5833.8s">We</a>  need to get more information with regard to how much we should be charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5839.963s">If</a>  you guys allow me,</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5846.533s">Councilor</a>  Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5848.275s">I</a>  think this is such a big issue because I have also reached. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5851.459s">I</a>  did talk to a few residents that welcome the ramp because, uh, you know, handicapped accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5858.167s">I</a>  think it's very important, but I think it's unfinished business between the petitioner and the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5865.055s">uh</a>  I think it might behoove us that both parties that we table this so we get further clarification so this possibly could go to no vote which would then extend this longer than we should so I don't know if um if that might be the course I just put it out to my colleagues to to <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5885.416s">maybe</a>  contemplate that without the engineer being here with the assessor really not gauging, you know, the understanding of this as much as we should right now, because understandable factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5900.245s">And,</a>  you know, I don't, I see the sides on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5905.128s">It's</a>  a city sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5907.209s">It's</a>  taking land that not everybody will now traverse because it's being, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5913.378s">uh,</a>  handicap ramp, which I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5915.941s">I</a>  think that I want to move this forward, but I just want to make sure that, you know, there seems some discrepancies and some, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5923.963s">to</a>  be gone, but the negotiations shouldn't be done at this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5928.106s">This</a>  should be done by the city engineer who are the professionals in this situation with our city administration, the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5934.71s">So</a>  I truly think we should table this and until we get this information that Mr. Salam and his team sit together with the engineer and the city administration to clean up these fine issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5945.918s">So</a>  this isn't in jeopardy of failing this evening.</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5949.36s">So</a>  if you guys allow me, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5954.636s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5956.998s">I'm</a>  an architect for 30 years and a project manager for 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5961.121s">And</a>  I've been doing this project, I'm running the program for the ADA, for Citizen Bank for the past six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5968.126s">I've</a>  been done work in Pennsylvania, like over 250 branches, Philadelphia, Central City. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5974.47s">And</a>  we have the same situation when we approach the township. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5978.553s">As</a>  long as not intervening with the path of the public, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5982.22s">In</a>  addition, it maintaining the building, there was no other option for us to make it accessible in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5988.642s">They</a>  approve it, they give us a variance, they never charge us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5991.283s">Actually,</a>  next to your township, West Medford, one of our branches, the landlord, we designed it, we find the issue over there, and the landlord approached the township, he got the permit and built it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6003.948s">And</a>  there's no charge to the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6006.589s">In</a>  addition, I built at least like 10 or <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6009.747s">20</a>  ramp like this in our building in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where it was infeasible to do the ADA compliance through the lobby. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6017.713s">And</a>  we use the city sidewalk and they never charge us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6021.495s">It's</a>  a public service to make the building accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6024.277s">Especially</a>  we have this issue with the old building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6026.939s">They</a>  were never designed all before like the 2000 or 1999 was concept of making the building accessible to challenge persons. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6038.765s">and</a>  seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6039.766s">So</a>  this is what citizen bank doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6042.007s">We're</a>  running the entire program along our entire portfolio. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6045.309s">And</a>  we try, we are making it compliant based on the new code for the AD. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6050.493s">I</a>  mean, before we had option to make it one entrance only compliant, but now require 60% of the entrance to be compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6059.159s">And</a>  with two entrances mean a hundred percent compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6063.822s">And</a>  when I talked to Tim, yes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6067.277s">Sorry,</a>  you can finish your sentence Mr. Salama when you talk to Tim.</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6072.08s">I</a>  talked to Tim and I pointed out to him about the issue of the fee because we are, as I mentioned, we are leasing the property triple net so we are liable to pay all the required taxes for the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6084.809s">I</a>  talked to him that in other communities, we built this we take the variance as long as the ramp and the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6091.523s">is</a>  no, there is any conflict and everything is moving with a public path. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6095.764s">And</a>  it's plus it's a public service to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6098.545s">It's</a>  not like for our special purpose, the customer will still come from all entrants anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6104.267s">And</a>  I pointed out to him like this project started in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6110.368s">And</a>  all of this been dragging across Citizen Bank so far, way beyond the project cause that we started and <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6117.504s">The</a>  cost of the ramp and the landing, it costs between $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6120.606s">It</a>  costs us way more than that for me bringing the consultant in the meetings, preparing the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6128.712s">I</a>  just want to point it out.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6131.034s">Mr.</a>  Salaam, you mentioned West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6136.137s">When</a>  was that project completed?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6138.979s">This</a>  is like 2019.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6143.93s">A</a>  couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6145.031s">That's</a>  when that ramp was installed? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6146.532s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6146.992s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6147.513s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6147.893s">Ramp</a>  and a landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6148.674s">And</a>  actually it's a little bit bigger than ours and the sidewalk is less than this location.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6155.459s">Well,</a>  that should have... West Medford is part of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6158.902s">So</a>  what was the process when that project was approved?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6164.246s">It</a>  was a part of my project, but the landlord decided to do the exterior under his scope of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6173.664s">because</a>  the exterior is part of his scope of work, our lease, so he developed a growing approach, a township, got the permit, built it up, and we inspected a citizen bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6184.392s">It's</a>  compliant, we agreed, and that's it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6187.915s">All</a>  right, and I mean, I meant also to my fellow councilors, did that come before the council?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6192.198s">I</a>  do not recall that coming before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6193.799s">I</a>  don't remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6195.16s">It</a>  never came before the council.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6196.501s">I</a>  would be fine having, I mean, I think,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6199.659s">So,</a>  Mr. Salam, are you in agreement with everything, the exception of six and seven, which should be the renewal fee?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6206.526s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6206.766s">I</a>  mean, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6208.668s">I</a>  mean, everything else we're complying with, everything I agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6211.871s">We</a>  have registered architect, LI construction, Chris did like dig safe for the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6218.177s">All</a>  of the item below, we agree on it and we're confirming it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6221.188s">know</a>  exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6222.229s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6222.409s">So</a>  what are we trying to do here?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6224.19s">We</a>  don't have Mr. President, I would say, you know, number six, I would be fine with it be five years or something.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6230.413s">Number</a>  seven, I'm taking early but at this point, yeah, I mean, you know, again, I hate to tie this guy up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6235.036s">They</a>  want to get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6236.957s">I</a>  mean, they're doing their work.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6239.518s">We're</a>  setting precedent right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6241.419s">This</a>  council setting precedent something we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6244.596s">know</a>  that we've never done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6246.217s">So</a>  I think we need guidance and we don't have anyone right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6249.259s">We</a>  don't have the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6250.54s">Our</a>  assessor has just told us that there's not enough time right now to get the information that she needs to help us with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6256.984s">And</a>  I understand West Medford, but I also know that Salem Street encompasses a lot more of the sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6265.269s">It's</a>  a smaller sidewalk than it was in West Medford.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6267.731s">But</a>  it's a longer sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6268.971s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6270.813s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6272.363s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6274.444s">The</a>  petitioner just mentioned variance, and we as a body do not issue variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6280.986s">That</a>  is done by the Zoning Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6284.528s">So</a>  that is not something that's under our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6286.669s">So</a>  if something was done in West Medford through a variance, it's possible that it never made its way to the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6295.472s">This</a>  request is for a petition for a grant of location. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6298.913s">which</a>  would be approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6301.198s">So</a>  maybe it is a matter of how this was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6304.705s">The</a>  original one in West Method was presented as a variance and that was voted on by a separate board and commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6311.82s">and</a>  this one is being presented differently, I don't know, but it doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President, because Mr. Salaam just mentioned a variance and we have nothing to do with variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6323.908s">And</a>  regarding Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and everywhere else, to be quite frank with you, that's not the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6331.433s">And</a>  in my opinion, if you're gonna use public land, you should pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6335.735s">That's</a>  my own opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6337.563s">If</a>  I wanted to build a porch, Mr. President, on my house, and it was one inch on a public sidewalk, one inch, it would not be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6346.629s">It</a>  would not be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6349.331s">So</a>  I think to sit back and say that they don't pay in other areas and this and that, that's up to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6356.396s">But</a>  in this city, Mr. President, if you're going to use public land, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6359.935s">for</a>  private entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6361.616s">Since</a>  when is it our responsibility to make sure a citizen's bank has proper ADA compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6369.282s">It's</a>  not our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6370.563s">We're</a>  willing to work with them, Mr. President, but it's not our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6375.918s">So</a>  I think there has to be some give and take here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6378.599s">And</a>  my question, Mr. President, if we could, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli and my other council colleagues that this probably should be sent back, but definitely, Mr. President, we should find out regarding what West Medford, how it was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6395.627s">Was</a>  it approved by a petition for grant the location or was it approved by a variance? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6402.482s">And</a>  that's key if we move forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6405.605s">We</a>  can't answer this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6407.466s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6408.227s">But</a>  I would make that, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6420.036s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6420.776s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6421.577s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6421.937s">I</a>  just want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6423.138s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6424.278s">I</a>  think it may seem like this is a simple one off. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6426.34s">But</a>  what we're doing right now is setting precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6428.581s">And</a>  if we don't get this right this time, the next time a petitioner comes before us, they're going to cite this case for their reason for why they're doing something a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6435.825s">So</a>  we need to get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6437.066s">And</a>  I agree with Councilor Marks that this is <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6439.706s">this</a>  is a public right of way, and we need to treat it as such and figure out the right way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6443.97s">And</a>  if that's charging, then that's charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6446.752s">But</a>  I agree that I don't think we should move on this without just insight from our city engineer at this point.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6453.397s">I</a>  would add, if possible, to the motion that, I don't know, Engineer McGivern <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6461.4s">asked</a>  us to come up with the renewal period and the fee, I would actually ask that he make a proposal for what might be reasonable, and we could consider that as part of sending it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6471.749s">With</a>  the assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6472.53s">Right,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6473.631s">All</a>  right, so the chair waives the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6476.434s">Well,</a>  let's vote on these motions.</p>

    <p>[Chris Schultz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6479.496s">I</a>  add one thing, if I have a quick second. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6483.0s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6484.803s">In</a>  regards to the comment about Tim, the engineer, what the last person just said, it is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6491.975s">He's</a>  the one who brought this up to you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6493.558s">So</a>  I don't know if he can actually advise on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6496.892s">and</a>  what to recommend for the situation, because I know he was looking to you guys for guidance on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6503.057s">So</a>  we might just be going back around in a circle here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6505.179s">But</a>  in regards to the comment about if you go one inch into the sidewalk from your house, the city might say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6513.645s">I</a>  think that's more like extending your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6518.229s">It's</a>  still a public sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6519.911s">We're</a>  just making it 80. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6521.612s">The</a>  building isn't extending to get more square footage so they have more, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6525.575s">office</a>  space on the inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6526.956s">It's</a>  just to upgrade the sidewalks to make it safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6530.657s">And</a>  if we're doing, we were doing a little give and take back and forth, we agreed to replace additional damaged concrete sidewalk sections around it, making the whole area safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6539.962s">It's</a>  kind of a, you know, we'll help you guys out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6543.083s">We'll</a>  replace more sidewalk if we're allowed to put the ramp out front. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6547.793s">was</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6548.093s">We're</a>  not extending the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6549.254s">It's</a>  just we're making this the city's safer and we're going to replace panels around it to make the entire sidewalls because it is it is in rough shape.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6560.942s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President, I know that I'd like to vote on the motion, so it is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6565.726s">And</a>  then I truly think, you know, we <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6569.127s">Like</a>  the gentleman said, I think we get everybody involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6572.01s">We</a>  don't want to go in circles, but we think we bring Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6574.733s">We</a>  have the city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6576.115s">We</a>  have city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6577.917s">We</a>  bring in, you know, even the ADA compliance officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6581.561s">I</a>  think that it's important that he's here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6584.103s">So,</a>  you know, we get all these answers, these questions answered because it does, it is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6589.869s">I</a>  think that it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6591.54s">you</a>  know, not the idea is very important, but I think the process has to be done the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6597.203s">So</a>  this council doesn't set precedent for something that's leading us in a bad path moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6603.767s">So</a>  I, you know, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6606.208s">Yeah,</a>  I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6608.569s">We</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6609.73s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6611.331s">Motion</a>  to table?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6613.892s">We've</a>  motioned to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6615.253s">Our</a>  motions won't fall out, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6617.474s">Motion</a>  to table until we</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6621.391s">I'm</a>  going to I'm going to motion the table and, um, have the if we can ask promotion that we have the city engineer, the ADA officer and the city sister and the city administration work together to try to find, um, uh, common ground so we can, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6644.213s">not</a>  chase the tail all day, so we can get this project moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6648.476s">I</a>  know it's a delay, but I don't wanna go to a vote, the vote's no, and then we can't bring this up for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6654.239s">So</a>  if we can do that, I vote to table.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6657.161s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6658.422s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6659.142s">So</a>  if I may, Councilor Scarpelli, through you to Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6662.044s">So</a>  we're looking for specific recommendations for 0.6 and 0.7 from our city engineer?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6668.068s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6668.688s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6669.029s">And</a>  while we're there, I personally, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6671.45s">you</a>  know, for my edification to get the understanding of point number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6675.811s">So</a>  that's a little bit clearer in my eyes, you know, but my thing is moving past two, six and seven, we need that clarification.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6682.312s">Perfect,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6683.572s">And</a>  so on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to table this until the engineer makes his recommendations on number two, six and seven.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6693.134s">Yeah,</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6698.309s">Do</a>  you want to repeat your motion back with the clerk?</p>

    <p>[Amr Salam]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6710.915s">It</a>  wasn't variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6712.035s">I</a>  don't know if it was variance for West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6715.057s">It</a>  was handled by the landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6717.378s">Plus</a>  there's multiple other sites within the township. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6720.059s">Probably</a>  you guys have the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6728.459s">on</a>  the motion by, on the motion table by Councilor Scarpelli as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6735.043s">You</a>  want to put it in with his or you want to report it out as amended by Councilor Marks on how the project of West Bedford was completed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6746.29s">If</a>  it never came before the council, I don't recall it coming before the council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6751.654s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6752.334s">Second</a>  by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6753.435s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6754.596s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6756.352s">All</a>  those opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6759.516s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6765.182s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6765.943s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6766.563s">21457,</a>  petition for a grant of location, national grid, north end of Massachusetts, location of underground electrical condoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6776.134s">Do</a>  I hear notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6778.303s">that</a>  by order of the Medford City Council, the Council of the Medford City Council will hold a public hearing in Howard Hall left chambers at Medford City Hall, 85 George B.

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6796.028s">Excuse</a>  me, thank you, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6800.429s">I'm</a>  gonna vote to waive the motion on the table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6805.958s">We</a>  deal on the motion by Council Marks to waive the reading seconded by Council Mayors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6811.02s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6812.02s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6812.14s">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6812.62s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6813.72s">Good</a>  evening, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6814.301s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Moses Okokuro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6815.501s">Good</a>  evening, councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6816.441s">My</a>  name is Moses Okokoro. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6818.042s">I'm</a>  here from National Grid Electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6820.582s">My</a>  address is 170 Medford Street in Malden.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6824.264s">Can</a>  you give us a brief synopsis of this project?</p>

    <p>[Moses Okokuro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6828.505s">So</a>  National Grid is petitioning to install two four-inch conduits from my existing manhole on the sidewalk towards the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6836.971s">Yeah,</a>  so basically we, I've actually indicated here though, the conduit length would be approximately seven feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6844.316s">But</a>  after we submitted the petition, we did a manhole survey and we'll be hitting the building from a different angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6851.001s">So</a>  potentially that may increase to not something significantly different, but probably about 10 feet from an existing manhole to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6860.929s">This</a>  is for the purpose of providing the electric service to that customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6865.192s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6867.415s">You</a>  have questions for the gentleman? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6870.236s">It's</a>  present. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6873.258s">Oh,</a>  one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6875.999s">You</a>  are in favor of the project, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6877.66s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6879.761s">Anyone</a>  else in favor of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6882.242s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6883.343s">Hearing</a>  and seeing many more, is there anyone here opposed to the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6888.785s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, we motion that by the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6891.506s">So,</a>  sure, if you can come back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6895.783s">So</a>  you have the conditions by the engineer in the back here? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6902.591s">Yes,</a>  I saw the conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6905.855s">Do</a>  we have questions for the gentleman? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6907.617s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6908.318s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6908.999s">I</a>  have a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6910.981s">The</a>  first being, if this is approved, when will the work begin and how long will it take?</p>

    <p>[Moses Okokuro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6918.379s">Potentially,</a>  I mean, it shouldn't take more than one day's worth of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6922.462s">Yes,</a>  and as soon as it's approved, we will ask our civil contractor to get the permits and we can start almost immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6932.469s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6932.969s">You're</a>  welcome, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6935.851s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6936.131s">Councilor</a>  Bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6938.413s">And</a>  in terms of the sidewalk, the new sidewalk has not gone in yet, so is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Moses Okokuro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6945.618s">I'm</a>  not sure, I've not been to that location for a while.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6949.399s">Okay,</a>  but if it has, and you have to dig it up, you'll replace with concrete, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6954.761s">Yes,</a>  definitely, we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6955.902s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6956.562s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6958.403s">Any</a>  further questions for the gentleman? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6959.583s">Okay,</a>  so, Chair, what's the motion?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6964.445s">At</a>  this time, I would ask that we amend the petition to include what the petitioner just mentioned, that it's not seven feet, it's 10 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6973.635s">and</a>  that reflected in the approval by the city engineers, he also refers to seven feet.</p>

    <p>[Moses Okokuro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6980.041s">So</a>  it's 10 feet, not seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6981.502s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, it may still be seven feet, you know, it may, I mean, increase to 10 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6987.907s">The</a>  issue is, when we did like a manhole survey, they actually discovered the underground submersible transformers will not allow them to go in the direction we intended to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7000.395s">So</a>  now they want to go from a different angle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7002.355s">They</a>  are not sure what they will do until they get the civil contract on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7007.457s">So</a>  what I'm saying basically, it may increase to about 10 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7011.238s">It</a>  may, it may not.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7308.491s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7312.833s">It's</a>  time for my stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7314.553s">I</a>  think that's it for the petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7320.195s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7320.815s">21491</a>  offered by Councilor Bez. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7322.796s">Be</a>  it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7324.83s">by</a>  the Medford City Council that the Cannabis Advisory Commission and or the city administration include labor peace agreement language in any host community agreements made between the city of Medford and any potential recreational or medicinal cannabis dispensaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7342.297s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7343.077s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7344.898s">As</a>  folks may or may not know, one of the fastest growing unionized industries in the state is the medical and recreational marijuana industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7354.322s">Um,</a>  several of our local unions have been, uh, have been going out and organizing workers at these various locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7364.596s">Um,</a>  one thing that has been included in many agreements between municipalities and the <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7372.674s">owners</a>  or license holders of these facilities is that the license holders will not actively, will not try to oppose the unionization effort if it comes to their shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7383.518s">So</a>  that is the request here of the Cannabis Advisory Commission and the city to include language in our agreements that ask these license holders not to oppose unionization efforts at these facilities.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7397.272s">With</a>  all the hearings that have already been completed, I don't know if we have the authority to demand this in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7406.059s">The</a>  hearings have already been done, so to add new language into, maybe something going forward, but to add new language into the agreement that was already reached with these people, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7418.168s">I</a>  think we should be seeking a legal opinion on this.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7423.248s">host</a>  community agreements have been agreed to, because they would have to have been approved.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7427.391s">Let's</a>  say the hearings have all been done.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7429.673s">But</a>  that's for the licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7431.875s">The</a>  host community agreements are the, when they decide on the final three applicants, then they would begin negotiations around the host community agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7440.221s">So</a>  that's my understanding of the process.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7442.663s">All</a>  right, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7444.984s">Any</a>  further discussion on this?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7446.986s">I</a>  would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7448.567s">Mr.</a>  President, I, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7451.227s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7452.347s">I</a>  would tend, I would feel more comfortable if we did get an opinion from the city solicitor, you know, and we did create a cannabis advisory commission for purpose and I don't want to overstep our boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7466.991s">The</a>  resolution refers to include, include to me is asking them to put it in there, not asking them whether they would review or take it under advisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7478.054s">Changing</a>  the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7478.674s">You're</a>  asking them to include it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7480.407s">So</a>  I just would feel more comfortable having city solicitor to take a look at it, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7487.032s">I've</a>  made a motion to approve, but whatever happens happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7492.816s">There's</a>  no second on it, so.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7522.775s">No,</a>  I was just withdrawing my motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7525.397s">So</a>  if there's another motion on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7526.798s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Marks, you want to, I'm sorry, I thought you were going to draw it over.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7529.82s">No,</a>  if there's a motion to refer to the solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7531.862s">I</a>  wouldn't be opposed to that, or I wouldn't be opposed to receiving it and placing it on file, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7536.705s">Councilor</a>  Bears, it's your motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7537.726s">Do</a>  you want to receive it and place it on file?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7554.816s">21-</a>  Mr. President, just for the edification, because the city solicitor is going to want to know what we're referring to and for what purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7561.401s">And</a>  the purpose, I think, at least for me, is to find out whether or not we have the authority to request that in a separate board. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7571.358s">or</a>  a separate commission by state statute that's created. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7575.944s">So</a>  that would be the question I have, whether we have the authority.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7580.231s">Okay,</a>  21492, offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7584.52s">by</a>  the Medford City Council that abutters within 250 feet of a city-owned tree be notified at least 14 days in advance if the tree is going to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7593.563s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7594.403s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7595.903s">There</a>  have been many city-owned trees that have been cut down or removed with pretty short notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7604.186s">I</a>  did receive some communication from the tree warden that the forestry department generally does not <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7611.776s">decide</a>  to remove a tree until one to two days before they remove that tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7617.36s">And</a>  there was also a mention of emergency removals with National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7621.744s">I</a>  have no problem if there's an emergency with something needs to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7625.126s">But</a>  you know, I do think that abutters, I've run into abutters, there's a tree right in front of their house, they've planted their whole garden based around that tree, they've, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7634.304s">put</a>  a table out there based on that tree, and then they come out one day and there's a sign, and the next day the tree's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7640.228s">And</a>  that doesn't seem like enough due process, or at least enough of a notification for abutters that something that provides shade and that they've come to rely on is going to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7653.117s">So</a>  I would ask that there at least be more formal notice and the ability of, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7658.024s">you</a>  know, residents, if a tree is going to be removed to come to us or come to the tree warden with some advanced notice, I put in 14 days because I felt that was reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7667.949s">So</a>  it is just a request that they provide a little bit more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7671.071s">I</a>  certainly have no problem with emergency removals happening if they're an emergency, but if this is something that's being pre-planned and doesn't need to happen in 48 hours or 24 hours, I really do think that residents should get more notice when a tree is going to be removed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7688.248s">We</a>  have Aggie Tudin on the call here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7693.572s">Aggie?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7696.975s">Aggie,</a>  are you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7700.838s">Aggie</a>  Tudin? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7706.202s">See</a>  ya. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7707.003s">Aggie?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7710.806s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7715.197s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7715.897s">Yeah,</a>  I support the intention of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7719.119s">I</a>  think there's, I know personally there was a tree chipper down the street from me the other day, and he'd go running to the window to see which beloved tree is coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7728.163s">And</a>  I think that notification is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7731.065s">You</a>  know, trees don't benefit just the direct abutters, they direct, you know, they benefit the whole block, they cool the whole block. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7737.248s">So</a>  I think just as advanced notification gives people a chance to, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7742.67s">whether</a>  it's just get on the list for a new tree, buy their own tree, or just wrap their head around what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7747.253s">I</a>  think this is important just for stewardship in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7750.216s">And</a>  I also, I don't know if we need amended language to include the emergency situations or if the tree we're in would offer that if she joins us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7760.703s">But</a>  I do support this, but I also support the inclusion of emergency language.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7766.887s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7767.788s">Aggie,</a>  last call. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7768.808s">You</a>  were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7769.509s">Any</a>  opinion, Aggie? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7772.777s">No,</a>  it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7776.219s">Good</a>  evening, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7779.462s">Gentleman</a>  from East Medford, name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7783.785s">The</a>  mic's on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7785.066s">The</a>  mic's on?</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7786.186s">I'll</a>  have to be careful what I say then. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7788.848s">By</a>  the way, Mr. President, to the chair, off the record, I could tell Councilor Marks, say it ain't so, Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7799.81s">We're</a>  gonna sorely miss him, but not for long, I hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7803.951s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7806.651s">On</a>  this tree business, it is my understanding, let me back up, I'm not sure what the ordinance or law is within the city about trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7816.313s">I</a>  love nature, personally speaking, and I have three trees around my house, city trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7823.355s">My</a>  question <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7824.464s">Actually,</a>  my thought was, I remember reading the legal notices all too often, and I thought they were advertised in advance, so at least I want to guesstimate a week, two or three weeks in advance, and usually has a listing of multiple trees at certain addresses in the city, saying and calling them public trees, and they will be <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7847.675s">taken</a>  down, so that's all I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7850.876s">I'm</a>  not sure if I was dreaming when I saw this years and years ago, haven't seen any recently.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7858.76s">I</a>  don't know personally if it existed in the past, but I think that's exactly the kind of practice I would like to see in terms of notification, that a notice go out and give people due notice that something may be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7871.565s">I</a>  mean, I've had residents say, I walked out one morning and my tree was gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7874.726s">It's</a>  been there for 30 years and now there's no tree.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7879.701s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7880.582s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, Aggie's not on the call.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7883.002s">She's</a>  on the call, but she's not answering. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7885.323s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7885.943s">Because</a>  Aggie we know best, but from my previous experience, the state statute is very clear about the removal of a public shade tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7894.786s">And</a>  Aggie falls that to the T. And my experience states, unless it's an emergency, that it requires the tree be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7904.669s">So</a>  the tree will officially get a posting on it, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7907.041s">And</a>  I believe it requires a public hearing for any removal of the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7911.465s">And</a>  that is duly posted as well as Mr. Castagnetti said. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7915.708s">And</a>  I've never heard of the one or two day notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7919.431s">It's</a>  more like seven to 14 or maybe even longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7923.635s">So</a>  if trees are being removed, it may be an emergent nature or it may be the city's no longer following state statute, which I highly doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7936.868s">Mr.</a>  President, but it's about time we take a look at our own tree ordinance, which we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7942.612s">By</a>  the way, we don't have anything that protects public shade trees on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7947.755s">There's</a>  been a lot of talk over the years, but very little action. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7951.437s">And</a>  I think this is a perfect time, maybe to send something to a subcommittee, maybe the public works subcommittee, um, and have them take a look at the creation of a tree ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7963.145s">Mr.</a>  President,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7966.232s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7967.212s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7967.813s">We</a>  do have a pre-ordinance, I think that just got moved to Committee of the Whole, that we reviewed, I think about a month ago.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7976.336s">In</a>  subcommittee?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7977.496s">It</a>  went from the Woodman subcommittee to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7982.118s">So</a>  it was just voted over, I think it was July 17th.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7985.399s">I</a>  would be happy to refer this paper to the same Committee of the Whole and have that discussion as part of the larger pre-ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7991.361s">I</a>  think that would make it complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7992.601s">I</a>  think Aggie might be on the call now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7993.762s">Aggie,</a>  you on the call now?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8001.161s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8001.401s">Again,</a>  I'm trying to committee of the whole refer this to the same meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8007.703s">She's</a>  there but she's not answering.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8013.565s">All</a>  right, so all right, we've been here a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8015.205s">I</a>  don't want to belabor it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8016.165s">So</a>  my motion is to refer to committee of the whole for discussion along with the tree ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8021.246s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion by Council of is <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8023.54s">to</a>  refer this to Committee of the Whole with the tree warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8027.522s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8028.682s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8029.583s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8029.823s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8030.623s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8038.286s">I'll</a>  skip mine because I got a couple here and then we'll share. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8042.268s">21494</a>  offered by Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8044.009s">I</a>  withdraw.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8044.469s">You</a>  withdraw this?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8046.59s">Yeah,</a>  we've discussed it enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8047.91s">Okay.</a>  21495.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8052.618s">offered</a>  by Councilor Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we receive an update from Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee regarding Paper 21, not 312, to support state legislation regarding pilot payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8068.469s">This</a>  paper is in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8071.451s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, who is the chair of that committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8075.333s">Who's</a>  the?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8076.274s">I</a>  can look on my phone.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8078.295s">I</a>  think I am, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8080.016s">Councilor</a>  Marks, you are the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8081.437s">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8084.496s">Maybe</a>  call a meeting going down the line?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8087.797s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not quite sure what we're gonna discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8090.799s">The</a>  action was to wait for the state legislature to enact a piece of legislation, which never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8101.124s">I</a>  mean, I guess we can meet to talk, because we have nothing else to do.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8104.925s">I</a>  believe the, well, we have plenty to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8107.427s">The</a>  resolution was that this council <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8110.972s">would</a>  contact the legislature and say that we support the legislation that has been filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8116.536s">And</a>  I believe the issue at the time was that bill numbers had not been issued yet, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8121.94s">So</a>  it was just kind of still on a docket number, a temporary number. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8126.043s">Bill</a>  numbers have now been issued and we put a 90 day shot clock on the paper that the subcommittee would meet in 90 days to discuss whether we thought it was reasonable for this council to support such a legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8139.562s">So</a>  that's, I believe, where we left it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8141.975s">And</a>  I don't believe that council has the authority to put a 90 day shot clock on a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8147.997s">So</a>  I think the council overstepped its boundaries, but needless to say, Mr. President, I'm not sure quite what will be the discussion on a piece of legislation that hasn't been passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8158.219s">So</a>  that we need to give local cities and towns the authority to make a pilot and in lieu of tax payment mandatory for certain entities. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8169.882s">And</a>  if that legislation is not passed, I'm not sure what the subcommittee's use is. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8174.825s">If</a>  you're looking just for the council to give a vote of support on the legislation, then I don't think that was the correct place to send it to a subcommittee for that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8182.33s">That</a>  was not my motion to send it to subcommittee, certainly.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8185.673s">That's</a>  what was passed, right?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8187.134s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8187.334s">Well,</a>  I mean, I'd be happy to file it again.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8190.976s">I</a>  just don't know what we're going to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8194.098s">What</a>  do we discuss? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8195.239s">Something</a>  that may eventually be passed by the state legislature?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8199.009s">Well,</a>  that was, I mean, it could be a five minute meeting to say, yes, we should send our note of support to the legislature that we think this is something that we should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8207.171s">Just</a>  on the substance of it, I do think we need more authority and uniformity in state government and state statute to provide clarity around pilot agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8215.753s">And</a>  we know the pilot agreements are very important to the city bringing in close to $5 million a year in revenue of our $200 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8223.395s">So</a>  that's why I put it forward is the state doesn't have a good framework for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8228.427s">and</a>  this bill would provide a new state framework that then we can operate under. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8232.811s">The</a>  request was just that we support these bills and ask that our delegation advance them in the legislature.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8238.235s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8239.056s">So</a>  in my opinion, Mr. President, and maybe this is the conversation we're going to have at subcommittee, but in my opinion, Mr. President, the city is what needs to put together a framework regarding in lieu of tax payment.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8251.065s">City</a>  Council does not negotiate battle agreements.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8253.127s">And</a>  there is no current, as far as I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8257.194s">game</a>  plan within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8259.116s">And</a>  I was one of the first members when I first got on the council to request Tufts University, which never gave it a little tax payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8267.004s">And</a>  I was one of the first to initiate that Mr. President, and then Mayor McGlynn signed a 10 year pilot program, which was severely <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8277.508s">underfunded,</a>  in my opinion, or not what it should have been for such an institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8282.35s">But</a>  needless to say, Mr. President, this legislation doesn't say that the cities and towns have the authority to create their own policy or procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8292.674s">This</a>  states that it goes from voluntary to mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8296.576s">That's</a>  a huge change, Mr. President, that could potentially impact every church in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8303.782s">And</a>  every nonprofit that's servicing homeless, that's servicing disabled, that's doing yeoman's work, Mr. President, this could have a giant impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8313.81s">So</a>  I don't think it's as easy to say we should just support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8320.034s">This</a>  has really far reaching impact on nonprofits, including churches, Mr. President, in this community.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8331.033s">I</a>  don't want to get into the minutiae, but the legislation that is proposed in the State House would not apply to churches or social service organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8337.218s">So</a>  there would not be mandatory payments for either of those groups.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8340.241s">That's</a>  from the gentleman I talked to that I think you've been speaking with, and that probably initiated this with you, that will be left up to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8351.31s">Um,</a>  so I was told that that will be left up to cities and towns.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8355.899s">I</a>  believe he may have been not exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8357.962s">He</a>  had not gotten that wrong.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8359.345s">But</a>  well, that's that's the feedback I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8362.911s">Um,</a>  you know, so <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8364.377s">And</a>  I as one member, I'm not going to go after churches, Mr. President, or any other nonprofit that's doing social services for our constituency.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8374.422s">If</a>  you read the legislation, it explicitly includes a specific category of nonprofits, which is the large educational and medical institutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8383.587s">and</a>  excludes the church's religious organization.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8385.909s">Why</a>  don't you provide that language to us?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8387.59s">I</a>  believe I did when I proposed the original.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8389.992s">I'd</a>  ask that you provide it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8391.052s">That's</a>  not my understanding.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8392.694s">I</a>  would be happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8394.555s">In</a>  any case, on your other point, which is the local action that we can take, I do have proposed ordinance language, and I would love to have a committee of the whole on what we could create as a local ordinance around pilot agreements.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8409.123s">City</a>  Council does not negotiate pilot agreements.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8411.985s">The</a>  Mayor does. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8412.485s">Yes,</a>  this would create a framework, and actually I have had several discussions with the Mayor and residents on this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8418.168s">Well,</a>  when the Mayor comes here with her suggestions, we'll take it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8420.91s">But</a>  meanwhile, the Mayor is the chief negotiating officer of the city, and the Mayor negotiates pilot agreements, not the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8429.335s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8430.496s">So,</a>  on the motion by Council of Mayors, to receive a report, that's it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8437.76s">I</a>  withdraw.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8439.551s">Motion</a>  to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8445.963s">21496</a>  offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the method... <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8449.687s">that</a>  Medford Deputy Fire Chief Fran Fosco be recognized on his recent retirement after serving the residents of Medford with distinction for the past 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8459.691s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8461.011s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8462.251s">For</a>  all of us that know Deputy Chief Fosco, he started up through the ranks, Mr. President, and worked his way up to deputy chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8472.435s">And</a>  you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler man, Mr. President, a man who has raised a family, a man who has dedicated his life to the firefighting profession in the city of Medford, a man that always has been honored and respected in his field, and someone that really is going to be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8496.111s">His</a>  breadth of knowledge regarding fire suppression, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8500.954s">uh,</a>  regarding, uh, you know, fire management and, uh, just, uh, the administration of a fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8509.458s">Uh,</a>  it goes on matched and, uh, you know, personally, I wish he had a few more years because I think, uh, he would have made a great chief to be quite frank with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8520.062s">Um,</a>  he's loved by, uh, his fellow firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8523.924s">He's</a>  a man of reason, a man of knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8527.33s">And</a>  I think someone that would have really done well in that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8531.351s">But</a>  however, he is retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8533.012s">I</a>  want to wish him well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8535.193s">And</a>  I look forward to seeing him around the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8539.014s">And</a>  I wish him well on any future endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8542.875s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8543.779s">Councilor</a>  Scott Belli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8544.899s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8545.759s">Thank</a>  you, Council, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8547.32s">I</a>  think that Mr. Fusco is someone that I personally would reach out to if we had issues or concerns, and he'd be the first person to call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8556.402s">Always</a>  had a solution to assist you in not leaving people in the lurch or leaving them dumbfounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8563.444s">I</a>  think that Councilor Marks, as his knowledge of what he does, is second to none, and I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8568.805s">He</a>  would have been a great chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8571.305s">But</a>  more than that, I think the respect <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8574.247s">And</a>  what he gets from his colleagues and the people that work for him, I think is pretty <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8584.802s">pretty</a>  impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8585.662s">So</a>  I think that it's again, you celebrate and you applaud and you congratulate him on his retirement, but it's definitely, they're definitely gonna be shoes that need to be filled by a few people, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8598.945s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. Fusco, and again, a great Medford family, and I'm glad he settled in this area to raise his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8610.108s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8611.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8611.768s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8730.139s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8732.1s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8732.5s">All</a>  those opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8734.981s">21503,</a>  offered by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8737.112s">It's</a>  all resolved that the city council requests that the administration provide an update on the implementation of the city's bicycle infrastructure master plan or any other comprehensive plans for bicycle infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8752.082s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8753.066s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8754.246s">Yeah,</a>  I have this on here because I've had a number of bike commuters reach out lately just about certain improvements to streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8761.248s">A</a>  lot of those streets are referenced in the infrastructure master plan that was put together by the Bicycle Advisory Commission, which I know was meant to be used as a guide suggestions for DPW and a city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8774.111s">And</a>  it is my understanding that these improvements are generally implemented only when a street is repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8781.133s">And</a>  as we know from <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8782.353s">this</a>  very council, a very small number of streets are repaved each year, and a number of them just aren't even in this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8790.196s">So,</a>  you know, noting that we've got the Great Clippership Connector, which is connecting a number of greenways and a number of bike paths that they, bikes are mentioned in the draft of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8807.064s">And</a>  also just noting that ideally there will be hopefully substantial infrastructure money coming down from the federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8813.89s">I</a>  would just love an update from the administration on priorities around these improvements for bikes around the city if it's something that it's just going to keep being done kind of as we slowly repave streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8827.483s">or</a>  if there is something in the works that if we do get infrastructure money, it'll be something we'll be moving quickly on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8833.789s">So</a>  I would just love an update so that it's something I can, you know, that can be shared with the cyclists and would-be cyclists in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8841.677s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8842.337s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8844.099s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8845.32s">Mr.</a>  Castaign, did you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8850.785s">Good</a>  evening, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8851.326s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8853.394s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8858.176s">I</a>  sincerely want to thank City Councilor Morell for bringing this up, especially the Clippership Connector part. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8867.281s">It's</a>  very personal to me being injured in that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8875.785s">I</a>  scribbled a few notes, I hope it makes sense, but this missing incomplete <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8883.132s">bike</a>  community path. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8886.313s">And</a>  we in Medford have the best location in all of New England, in my opinion, five miles north of Boston with Route 93 here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8896.776s">But</a>  you know, they can't seem to finish off the missing link, the half mile right behind 99 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8905.859s">I</a>  was supposed to wave to Mr. Sano, who lives there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8910.24s">Anyways,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8912.045s">It's</a>  sad because you could go from West Method and beyond, actually, you come right through here, if you didn't have the half mile blockage to the Duggar Andrews, you could go clear to the MBTA stations without dealing with Route 16 or Route 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8929.141s">That's</a>  huge as a safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8934.09s">So</a>  it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8936.852s">Personally,</a>  in my opinion, it should have been done 20 years ago about when they built the two new schools, so-called two new schools, with bike paths and footpaths that go underneath Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8952.04s">Also,</a>  they should do this job right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8957.663s">Finish</a>  this half-mile missing link in the center of Medford Square <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8963.396s">with</a>  the Riparian Right Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8965.978s">It's</a>  a 1600 Massachusetts law. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8970.302s">And</a>  that means we the people have the right of pathway, egress, I believe it's 15 feet alongside waterways. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8983.553s">In</a>  this case, the Mystic River and Blessing of the Bay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8988.777s">Please,</a>  build this missing link <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8993.14s">The</a>  part that's missing is right next to the Doug Randrew School, that piece of land there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9002.622s">And</a>  then the next piece would be the Riverside Yacht Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9008.524s">And</a>  then heading towards the square would be two condo buildings, 54 to 68, Ship Ave, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9018.746s">And</a>  by the way, they have two fences on each end of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9022.688s">that</a>  go from the sidewalk all the way to the river, which, in my opinion, under riparian rights, is illegally built on the people's egress land. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9036.771s">And</a>  then there's another building going towards 93 that will be the last building, the 76th shipyard, large condo complex of approximately 20 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9046.992s">They</a>  have plenty of land and they didn't build any fences <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9051.996s">on</a>  top of the people's land. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9054.218s">And</a>  it continues around where I actually broke my hand with a bike injury when my bike found one of two potholes, four feet wide, one to two feet deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9066.046s">They're</a>  still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9067.287s">They</a>  put cones there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9069.288s">I</a>  found one on the river today, took my bike ride again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9072.21s">I</a>  put one cone inside the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9077.194s">The</a>  DCR, they should at least fill in the potholes, which is grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9083.664s">And</a>  the storm outfall number is OF04100. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9091.486s">And</a>  then it continues, the missing link I should say, does not continue, underneath 93 to behind the senior citizen center, which is the building in the back where Mr. Sano lives at 99 Riverside Avenue, the high affordable rent building. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9110.311s">It's</a>  a lousy half a mile, we're talking like <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9114.093s">10,</a>  15 miles beyond Arlington, Lexington possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9119.016s">Are</a>  you kidding? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9119.997s">This</a>  is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9122.319s">Excuse</a>  my lack of 10 cent words here, but I understand the wheels of government work slowly, but 20 years and still waiting is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9138.47s">Come</a>  on, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9141.809s">Let's</a>  get the missing half-mile path done now and complete the 10-mile plus route to the MBTA assembly row and station landing, and safely keep with the people off the streets, especially Route 16 and Route 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9161.556s">This</a>  is a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9164.177s">Please,</a>  city, wake up.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9166.551s">We</a>  recently received some funds from the federal government for the station landing area to do a bridge and some more of the walkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9175.334s">I</a>  think Councilor Falco and myself are there for the dedication.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9203.527s">I</a>  don't want to speak French no more. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9204.707s">That's</a>  a DCR project. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9205.648s">They</a>  know they're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9206.749s">Is</a>  the clippership approved?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9209.37s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9209.95s">Yeah,</a>  the clippership, it's approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9211.331s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9211.851s">And</a>  are they actually going to build it on our property? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9214.633s">As</a>  far as the egress next to the river behind those condo complexes? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9219.675s">Because</a>  they were complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9222.817s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9222.997s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9223.537s">Or</a>  they have to build a little bit onto the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9226.207s">in</a>  order to give them a break, which they don't need. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9228.928s">They</a>  already built the fence on our land. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9232.469s">I'm</a>  speaking straight English here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9235.089s">That's</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9237.93s">I'm</a>  sorry, my heart bleeds, my head broke, I was bleeding, broke my hand, I have receipts and bills like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9245.212s">I</a>  did not sue DCR or the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9248.313s">All</a>  I'm asking for is common sense 20 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9254.52s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9481.873s">I</a>  can amend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9483.174s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9485.015s">Thank</a>  you for Councilor Caravielloo bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9487.337s">I</a>  know that, you know, with the updates now with the tennis courts and as you see what goes on at Duggar Park and how much of a vital pocket is the community there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9501.607s">I</a>  often thought why <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9503.608s">those</a>  guardrails are even there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9505.789s">I</a>  think that there's gotta be something more pleasing to the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9509.351s">I</a>  know that there is the post and reel type of guardrail. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9515.113s">So</a>  it'd be interesting to see if we could ask the South State delegations to look at maybe converting that old rod iron, which is pretty dangerous on the other side, very dangerous on the other side, that we can look at more traditional, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9534.747s">fencing</a>  that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9536.769s">If</a>  there's any even needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9539.091s">I</a>  know that there's a need because I think there's no sidewalk, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9543.455s">But</a>  I think we need something there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9545.017s">But</a>  I think that there are so many aesthetically pleasing, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9551.701s">solutions</a>  we can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9552.821s">I</a>  know that they have just the, it has the wood look that has the post and rail look. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9558.643s">I</a>  think it looks so much classier, more inviting and allows the openings along as you walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9565.124s">So,</a>  and provides the safety that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9567.145s">But</a>  I know a few times with kids that are playing basketball and, you know, I know it's further away, but someone's taking a run at that and they run into that guardrail. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9577.347s">I'm</a>  shocked we haven't, at least we haven't heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9580.228s">any</a>  more serious incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9581.429s">So</a>  if you allow me to amend that to ask the state delegates to look at replacing that altogether.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10724.249s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10726.625s">Um,</a>  recently, the mayor's office submitted a press release regarding the strong stump removal in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10737.368s">And</a>  from what I can gather, the mayor is subcontracting out to a private vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10744.829s">The</a>  removal of I think the article stated 26 tree stumps in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10751.711s">The</a>  last count that I think I received, which I think is sorely underestimated, was there was about 575 stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10760.516s">And</a>  I believe it's much higher than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10763.658s">Just</a>  from my informal, you know, cursory of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10769.623s">And</a>  so it was quite disappointing to see a press release go out that addresses roughly 5% of the stumps that have been in this community for tens of years, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10786.516s">And</a>  I am very disappointed to see that we couldn't deal with these stumps in one fell swoop rather than just piecemeal it once again <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10798.866s">Mr.</a>  President, as we heard today, there's trees being cut down, and those will be added to the stump list, and we're never going to get ahead of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10806.952s">So</a>  I have to express my disappointment with this latest attempt to get ahead of some of the concerns that I'm hearing from the community, which is stump removal, poor sidewalk conditions, and very poor road conditions in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10823.545s">And</a>  I don't think that addresses anything by removing 5% of what we have out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10830.01s">It</a>  doesn't sound like a game plan to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10832.032s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10832.913s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10833.673s">If</a>  I may also just, I know it's in the agenda, but our September meeting is moved to the 21st instead of the 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10841.12s">So</a>  we will be meeting the 21st of September.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10844.202s">Mr.</a>  President also. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10845.62s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10846.02s">Just</a>  while we're on the topic of tree stumps and poor condition of our city streets and sidewalks, the mayor also came out with a press release recently, Mr. President, asking residents to adopt a catch basin. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10861.412s">So</a>  we are now asking residents to clean catch basins, which I always thought for years, and I've always asked during budget, we have a contract out to clean catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10874.358s">So</a>  I'm not quite sure what direction we're going in this community, Mr. President, but we have to start asking residents to clean catch basins, I think is way out of whack Mr. President, and that's not what we should be asking residents to do in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10889.285s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10893.386s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10894.547s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10897.934s">Name</a>  and address of the record please cast a netting on the subject of Councilor Marks about the condition of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10904.739s">I</a>  once made a comment is looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10907.261s">It's</a>  looking like Chelsea around here but I was, I was corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10911.024s">I</a>  looked at Chelsea Chelsea looks a lot better. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10915.767s">I</a>  can point out defects and, but I don't want to complain too much behind doors with a difference for one example, the bricks are sticking up like eight inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10927.96s">It's</a>  incredible, and with the snow, you don't see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10931.562s">But</a>  anyways, besides what my wife felt, Mr. Caballero tried to bring up that issue before we went on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10937.986s">In</a>  front of Doris, what a difference, and she ripped her shoulder apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10941.828s">I</a>  want to thank you, Councilors, for bringing up these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10945.791s">But</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10947.512s">Out</a>  of 550 tree stumps, and we're going to fix 10%, maybe 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10952.074s">I</a>  used to be involved with methadoncinitis. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10957.147s">a</a>  chairman at that time, 2001 until Councilor Moss recalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10961.59s">You</a>  know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10964.171s">Put</a>  a planter with a hanging plant over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10966.692s">Good</a>  night.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10967.293s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10969.034s">Motion</a>  to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10971.555s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, it's not on the agenda, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention I did bump into a resident this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10980.02s">His</a>  mother, elderly mother, lives on Dwyer Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10983.022s">It's</a>  imperative that she gets out during the day <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10985.563s">and</a>  exercise, but unfortunately she's unable to because of all the uneven sidewalk panels on Dwyer Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10993.447s">And</a>  I'd ask, challenge any of my colleagues to go out and take a walk around Dwyer Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10998.369s">This</a>  is not a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11000.35s">It's</a>  a public road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11002.27s">It's</a>  in deplorable condition, the road and the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11006.212s">And,</a>  you know, I'm not going to put it formally, but these are the type of things, Mr. President, when you talk about quality of life, here's a woman that can't get out because they're afraid of a trip and fall hazard in front of her own home.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11019.854s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11020.534s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11021.595s">And</a>  if I can remind everybody, go out and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11026.956s">Go</a>  out and vote on September 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11031.416s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11033.257s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11033.657s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11035.357s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11036.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11037.517s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11038.68s">Motion</a>  to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11040.886s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=11043.935s">All</a>  those in favor.</p>
