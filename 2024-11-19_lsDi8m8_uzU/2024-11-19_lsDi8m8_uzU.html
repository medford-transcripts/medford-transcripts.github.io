    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=119.486s">Yeah,</a>  so we began in 1996. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=121.306s">There's</a>  only one other left from that fateful day, Charlie Chimpaya, but we created a program to allow 12-year-old all-stars to play a very competitive baseball game. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=136.273s">Then</a>  we moved to running the Tufts Winter Clinic for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=144.197s">We</a>  got involved, we created the Medford Baseball Council that helped all the baseball leagues in the city join together and talk as one. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=152.645s">We</a>  took over some fledgling bankrupted leagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=157.37s">And</a>  then we turned on to Challenger Baseball, started in Malden for children with mental and physical health challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=167.713s">We</a>  brought them here to Medford, had an incredible first game, and now 15 years later, a week from Sunday, we'll do it again for the final time for the Medford Invitational.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=180.911s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=190.809s">I</a>  want that support of the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=192.851s">Having</a>  one member of my family has been involved with the group for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=195.554s">And</a>  thank you and Charlie and the other people involved there to be there on the Sunday and see the amount of work you guys put in and characters and the games and everything that goes on with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=207.058s">If</a>  you've never been before, try to come, it's a week from Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=212.742s">Try</a>  to make it, say it's a fun day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=215.023s">If</a>  you'd like to help out, they're always looking for volunteers.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=217.365s">And</a>  if I may, I just want to say that this group behind me is just a portion of the great volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=223.482s">The</a>  families of the kids are amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=226.384s">Our</a>  city officials have been very supportive, both in Medford and in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=230.387s">We</a>  couldn't do it without the business community who have given us such great financial backing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=235.51s">So</a>  we're very proud to have done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=236.971s">It's</a>  a great community event. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=238.852s">I'm</a>  pleased that I get to be at least part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=242.695s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=243.335s">You</a>  guys have done a great job over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=246.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=247.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=247.758s">And</a>  I'm sorry to see that you're gonna end it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=250.1s">And</a>  hopefully the group, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=252.362s">If</a>  that takes everything, we'll do just as good a job.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=255.964s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=256.704s">Mr.</a>  President, maybe if Ron could just mention who's here with him today.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=259.986s">Yeah,</a>  I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=261.346s">I</a>  don't know if you wanna stand up, but the great Patty Falasca, who...

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=405.175s">Now,</a>  I'm fortunate enough to know the gentleman at the podium, it's someone that I idolized growing up across the street, probably hit the farthest half ball home runs I've ever seen in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=415.78s">So</a>  some people looking, what is half ball? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=419.882s">But</a>  this is what, you know, we talked about the last year and how difficult the last, really the last year has been in really society. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=428.946s">And</a>  I think that, you know, we talk about, you know, the division in our community and <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=436.144s">At</a>  that time, if you remember back then, Medford's baseball was sort of what the city was about today. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=443.228s">And</a>  there wasn't anybody really bringing that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=446.17s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=448.132s">Ronnie</a>  and your team really stood up and kind of put baseball back on the map in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=454.395s">I</a>  remember as a young man watching this happen and saying, wow, I would love to be part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=459.357s">And</a>  you could hear the kids that I would teach, they would be so proud to be in that tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=463.698s">And</a>  then to move it to the next level where you see where it really pays dividends and shows where <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=473.597s">the</a>  kids that needed it the most found something and reaching out to challenge it and having families, the Alaskans and the Butler's for some that have been supporting it for years and doing great things in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=488.806s">And</a>  it's been a sad, it's been a sad couple of months here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=493.228s">You</a>  know, you're hearing these different, all these <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=496.885s">different</a>  changes in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=499.286s">And</a>  for someone who grew up with these great changes, I'm excited to see what the next step will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=504.708s">But</a>  when you see the moving on of a Michael Mox or the end of an era and challenger and the MIT and see what you guys have done, I want you to realize there's a reason why people want to move to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=521.117s">And</a>  it's people like yourself, Ron, and your team that made Medford the city that everybody loves and wants to be part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=528.001s">So</a>  I'm proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=530.363s">I'm</a>  proud to be your friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=531.703s">And</a>  I thank you for everything you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=534.945s">And</a>  I can't wait for Sunday's event and support you guys again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=540.309s">And</a>  those people that don't know the reason why I leave, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=544.489s">I</a>  have a sweating problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=545.77s">So</a>  I don't know what it is lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=547.611s">It's</a>  like 90 degrees and humid and we have our, and you know, I try to, I've been pawning my kids off now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=554.915s">Hey,</a>  we're going to volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=556.435s">And</a>  then I try to hide behind a tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=558.577s">So,</a>  but I just got to tell you, again, thank you for everything you do and we're definitely going to miss this.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=568.142s">So</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=570.406s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=571.106s">I</a>  also want to thank Ron and Charlie and all the volunteers that are here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=574.569s">I</a>  know a lot of time, effort, dedication, and commitment go into this on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=581.693s">And</a>  to be doing this for 25 years, year after year, that's a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=588.637s">But</a>  as you, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, and Councilor Marks, this has been a successful tournament year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=595.401s">And</a>  it's something that you hear throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=599.285s">Thank</a>  you so much for all your time, your commitment to the tournament, to the youth of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=605.893s">I</a>  can't thank you enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=606.734s">And</a>  I just want to say thank you for your years of service and commitment to our community.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1017.054s">Mr.</a>  President, also, if we can get a commitment that Desmond is not going to run for local public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1026.139s">What</a>  do you have to worry about? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1030.162s">A</a>  true politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1032.603s">Desmond,</a>  if you could just relay, we've had other recipients come before us, and I know a big part of becoming an Eagle Scout <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1041.709s">are</a>  the many adventures that you go on, but also the community service part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1046.634s">And</a>  what project you've done to obtain the community service aspect.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1050.479s">Yeah,</a>  so my Eagle Scout project was I built a, like a big bench at the Medford dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1058.447s">The</a>  more recent one at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1062.753s">And</a>  yeah, it served a couple purposes provided more seating, of course, but protected the tree that the dogs are getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1073.074s">And</a>  yeah, I'd say that was a really cool project. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1077.376s">But</a>  like, in terms of the community service aspect, like the thing that's going to stick with me is the Veterans Day dinners that the scouts would put on every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1086.899s">And</a>  those, you know, we've been doing it for many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1091.761s">And</a>  it's something that we really take pride in. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1095.262s">It</a>  comes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1096.463s">And,</a>  and <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1097.992s">Having</a>  that commitment, it shows a lot, but it also teaches the right practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1106.936s">I</a>  think that is something I'd like to highlight a little bit more.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1111.078s">That's</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1112.298s">And</a>  every Eagle Scout that we've spoken with always states that it wasn't just solely their effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1120.582s">It</a>  was other people that helped them along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1123.863s">And</a>  I know you have a few people with you today.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1125.785s">Yes,</a>  yes, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1126.766s">I'd</a>  like to shout out my parents as well, Julie and Tim Lambert. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1133.131s">It</a>  really is a group effort and you can't say it's all one person, but it was everything that all the volunteers put in and all the scouts around you, how they contribute to your journey as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1152.127s">I</a>  wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the Eagle Scouts before me that that pushed me to, you know, achieve this goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1162.311s">And,</a>  you know, I owe a lot to them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1164.911s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1166.732s">Well,</a>  you're truly a fine young gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1169.734s">I</a>  look for great things from you in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1173.356s">And</a>  I'd also like to thank your parents that are here tonight for their involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1179.758s">And</a>  I also would like to thank Councilor Falco, who since I've been on the council with them, I think has recognized a number of Eagle Scouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1189.822s">And</a>  I think he holds that great responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1194.535s">obtaining</a>  of that badge as a real high honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1198.718s">And</a>  I want to thank him as well and congratulate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1201.18s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
