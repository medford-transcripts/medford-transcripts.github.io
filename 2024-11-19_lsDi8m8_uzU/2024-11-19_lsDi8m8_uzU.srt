31
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:14,088
[SPEAKER_16]: commend and congratulate the Medford Invitational Tournament on its 25th anniversary.

32
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:22,111
[SPEAKER_16]: We would also like to thank the men and women who have helped the special needs children of Medford and greater Boston for the past 25 years.

33
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:27,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Our challenge today will continue in the future, but it'll be run by the

34
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,331
[SPEAKER_16]: District 12 Little League.

35
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:35,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have a lot of people in the audience tonight that are from the organization.

36
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:42,616
[SPEAKER_16]: And Ron, if you want to come up and say a few words before we get to say some good things about you.

37
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:47,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

38
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:51,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron Giovino, 326 East Porter Road, Medford, Mass.

39
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

40
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,360
[SPEAKER_16]: For those who don't know,

41
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:59,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Give a little brief synopsis on what the tournament's about and how long you've been doing it.

42
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we began in 1996.

43
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:15,233
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only one other left from that fateful day, Charlie Chimpaya, but we created a program to allow 12-year-old all-stars to play a very competitive baseball game.

44
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:22,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we moved to running the Tufts Winter Clinic for 10 years.

45
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:31,464
[SPEAKER_07]: We got involved, we created the Medford Baseball Council that helped all the baseball leagues in the city join together and talk as one.

46
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:36,549
[SPEAKER_07]: We took over some fledgling bankrupted leagues.

47
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:46,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we turned on to Challenger Baseball, started in Malden for children with mental and physical health challenges.

48
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:59,890
[SPEAKER_07]: We brought them here to Medford, had an incredible first game, and now 15 years later, a week from Sunday, we'll do it again for the final time for the Medford Invitational.

49
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

50
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:12,471
[SPEAKER_16]: I want that support of the group.

51
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Having one member of my family has been involved with the group for many years.

52
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:26,504
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you and Charlie and the other people involved there to be there on the Sunday and see the amount of work you guys put in and characters and the games and everything that goes on with it.

53
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:32,342
[SPEAKER_16]: If you've never been before, try to come, it's a week from Sunday.

54
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Try to make it, say it's a fun day.

55
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:37,045
[SPEAKER_16]: If you'd like to help out, they're always looking for volunteers.

56
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:42,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I may, I just want to say that this group behind me is just a portion of the great volunteers.

57
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,283
[SPEAKER_07]: The families of the kids are amazing.

58
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Our city officials have been very supportive, both in Medford and in Malden.

59
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:55,450
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't do it without the business community who have given us such great financial backing.

60
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're very proud to have done this.

61
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,632
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great community event.

62
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:02,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pleased that I get to be at least part of this.

63
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:03,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

64
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:06,497
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys have done a great job over the years.

65
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:06,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

66
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:07,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

67
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:09,459
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sorry to see that you're gonna end it.

68
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,661
[SPEAKER_16]: And hopefully the group,

69
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:14,843
[SPEAKER_16]: If that takes everything, we'll do just as good a job.

70
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

71
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:19,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, maybe if Ron could just mention who's here with him today.

72
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:20,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I will.

73
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:33,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you wanna stand up, but the great Patty Falasca, who... President of the Billy Falasca Foundation, her grandson, little Billy.

74
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:38,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane Butler.

75
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Amel Techi Bariola.

76
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk into the mic, talk into the mic.

77
00:04:49,839 --> 00:05:01,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Kevin Chin, Tommy Russo, and our CFO and partner in crime and co-founder, Charlie Chimpaya.

78
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:07,253
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it, Charlie.

79
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:10,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:17,506
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at 1996, it's amazing what a bunch of volunteers did in our community.

81
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:29,029
[SPEAKER_06]: To last 25 years and to go as strong as they did over 25 years is a true credit to all the volunteers that stuck it out this long.

82
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:33,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there were some real lean and hard times during this whole process.

83
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:33,990
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.

84
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:45,935
[SPEAKER_06]: You've, not only you, but everyone else here have been a stalwart in making this a real success and benefiting many aspects of our community.

85
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:48,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what goes a long way with me.

86
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:58,660
[SPEAKER_06]: When you went to the challenger days and saw the smiles and the people that you touched, truly it's an amazing story.

87
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,714
[SPEAKER_06]: and one that I'm not gonna forget.

88
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:11,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Since I've been in office right around the same number of years, your group has been synonymous with community involvement.

89
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:18,030
[SPEAKER_06]: and from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of all the residents of this community, I wanna thank you and all the volunteers here.

90
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:29,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to see such familiar faces and truly thank you and hopefully the next endeavor you come up with, which I'm sure you're working on right now, right, Ron?

91
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take that as a yes.

92
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna be part of that as well.

93
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate all your efforts.

94
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:40,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, thank you.

95
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:55,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm fortunate enough to know the gentleman at the podium, it's someone that I idolized growing up across the street, probably hit the farthest half ball home runs I've ever seen in life.

96
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,021
[SPEAKER_11]: So some people looking, what is half ball?

97
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:08,845
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is what, you know, we talked about the last year and how difficult the last, really the last year has been in really society.

98
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:14,248
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that, you know, we talk about, you know, the division in our community and

99
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:22,668
[SPEAKER_11]: At that time, if you remember back then, Medford's baseball was sort of what the city was about today.

100
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:26,010
[SPEAKER_11]: And there wasn't anybody really bringing that together.

101
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:26,550
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think

102
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:34,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Ronnie and your team really stood up and kind of put baseball back on the map in Medford.

103
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:39,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember as a young man watching this happen and saying, wow, I would love to be part of that.

104
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:43,098
[SPEAKER_11]: And you could hear the kids that I would teach, they would be so proud to be in that tournament.

105
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:52,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And then to move it to the next level where you see where it really pays dividends and shows where

106
00:07:53,597 --> 00:08:08,265
[SPEAKER_11]: the kids that needed it the most found something and reaching out to challenge it and having families, the Alaskans and the Butler's for some that have been supporting it for years and doing great things in our community.

107
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:13,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's been a sad, it's been a sad couple of months here.

108
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:16,070
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're hearing these different, all these

109
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:19,006
[SPEAKER_11]: different changes in Medford.

110
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:24,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And for someone who grew up with these great changes, I'm excited to see what the next step will be.

111
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:40,275
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you see the moving on of a Michael Mox or the end of an era and challenger and the MIT and see what you guys have done, I want you to realize there's a reason why people want to move to Medford.

112
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:47,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's people like yourself, Ron, and your team that made Medford the city that everybody loves and wants to be part of.

113
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm proud of that.

114
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm proud to be your friend.

115
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:54,625
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank you for everything you've done.

116
00:08:54,945 --> 00:09:00,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't wait for Sunday's event and support you guys again.

117
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,691
[SPEAKER_11]: And those people that don't know the reason why I leave,

118
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:05,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a sweating problem.

119
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,551
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know what it is lately.

120
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:14,855
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like 90 degrees and humid and we have our, and you know, I try to, I've been pawning my kids off now.

121
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:15,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, we're going to volunteer.

122
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:18,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I try to hide behind a tree.

123
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:28,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but I just got to tell you, again, thank you for everything you do and we're definitely going to miss this.

124
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:28,542
[SPEAKER_21]: So thanks.

125
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:31,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:34,308
[SPEAKER_21]: I also want to thank Ron and Charlie and all the volunteers that are here tonight.

127
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:40,952
[SPEAKER_21]: I know a lot of time, effort, dedication, and commitment go into this on a yearly basis.

128
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:47,256
[SPEAKER_21]: And to be doing this for 25 years, year after year, that's a long time.

129
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:55,381
[SPEAKER_21]: But as you, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, and Councilor Marks, this has been a successful tournament year after year after year.

130
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,442
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's something that you hear throughout the community.

131
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:05,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much for all your time, your commitment to the tournament, to the youth of our community.

132
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:06,674
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't thank you enough.

133
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:11,360
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to say thank you for your years of service and commitment to our community.

134
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:16,738
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we're up.

135
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:17,819
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,879
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to echo what my fellow Councilors are saying.

137
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,881
[SPEAKER_23]: And thank you, Ron and the whole team for the tremendous amount of volunteer hours you've put in over 25 years.

138
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:29,683
[SPEAKER_23]: Like my fellow Councilors, I'm someone who benefited from youth sports, but those things don't happen on their own.

139
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:33,025
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone has to put that together, hold it together for as long as you all have.

140
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:41,468
[SPEAKER_23]: So I thank you for the tremendous effort, just this great community offering, and really just this offering, this inclusive offering to our young athletes in Medford.

141
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,309
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you and congratulations on 25 years of great work.

142
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the best.

143
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:51,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't think I could say it any better than that.

144
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,376
[SPEAKER_03]: The folks have been so involved for a long time.

145
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:55,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I was only three years old when he started.

146
00:10:56,038 --> 00:11:01,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I know a lot of my friends who played baseball and then friends were involved in the community.

147
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:04,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a part of the event over the years and I've really appreciated it.

148
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm especially grateful that the Challenger Day will be continuing.

149
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really important.

150
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:10,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for your work.

151
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:12,423

153
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:18,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:24,634
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, for those who haven't had a chance to look them down, see the special needs kids.

155
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:34,782
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they have characters, and every year, the fire trucks, and I know the Batmobile was down there one year, and everybody pictures a great day.

156
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:42,954
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember one year, Ron had me cook about 800 hot dogs.

157
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,835
[SPEAKER_16]: He puts me on this table, this grill's about eight foot long.

158
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:49,736
[SPEAKER_16]: By the time you turned it, you had to walk back to it again.

159
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,616
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, thank you, thank you for all you've done for the special needs children.

160
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:58,277
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, please try to come out on Sunday, next Sunday and help them out.

162
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:03,598
[SPEAKER_16]: The mic's not on, Ron.

173
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you again.

174
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you and your team for all the work that you do.

175
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:37,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_16]: While we're on the suspension,

177
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scapi, can you make the motion on this?

178
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't make the motion.

179
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a motion?

180
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:04,496
[SPEAKER_11]: No, congratulations.

181
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:05,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.

182
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:13,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So make the motion that under special rules, we have a presentation from Councilor Falco to Eagle Scout.

183
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:18,075
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we need to vote on this one first.

184
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:23,577
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Scalia to congratulate and seconded by Councilor Falco.

185

[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor.

186
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:27,818
[SPEAKER_16]: All opposed, motion passes.

00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:39,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Desmond, where are you?

189
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:41,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Get up here, come on.

190
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hi, my name is Desmond Lambert.

191
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 330 Baldwin Street.

192
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:06,005
[SPEAKER_21]: You didn't have to do that, but thank you very much.

193
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:06,485
[SPEAKER_21]: That was it.

194
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:09,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I feel like the last procedure.

195
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:10,208
[SPEAKER_21]: We like that.

196
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:11,269
[SPEAKER_21]: That's perfect.

197
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,950
[SPEAKER_10]: The clerk appreciates it.

198
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,651
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a little slow today.

199
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:26,520
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to begin by thanking Desmond Lambert for being here tonight and congratulating him on earning the rank of Eagle Scout.

200
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,622
[SPEAKER_21]: This never gets tired.

201
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:46,310
[SPEAKER_21]: We have celebrated, we've had a lot of Eagle Scouts in our community that have come through Troop 416, and a big congratulations to Desmond, and also a big thank you to his parents, Tim and Julie Lambert in the back.

202
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,944
[SPEAKER_21]: was at the ceremony last night, and it was described as a journey scouting.

203
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:05,571
[SPEAKER_21]: And it has taken many years, not just for Desmond, but for everyone that begins in scouting and sees it through to the end.

204
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,053
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've had the

205
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:11,940
[SPEAKER_21]: the pleasure of knowing Desmond for probably about 16 years now.

206
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:19,985
[SPEAKER_21]: So I remember when he was just a kid and here he is a young man, he's made it through to the rank of Eagle Scout and he's done a fabulous job.

207
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:28,450
[SPEAKER_21]: He's someone that is a really, really, I'm really proud of everything that he's done and he's come a long way.

208
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,934
[SPEAKER_21]: And tonight we're going to be presenting him with the council accommodation from the Medford City Council.

209
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:40,908
[SPEAKER_21]: The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Desmond Lambert.

210
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations on being elevated to Eagle Scout.

211
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:50,159
[SPEAKER_21]: The realization of this outstanding achievement will undoubtedly lead to success in accomplishments throughout your life.

212
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:52,701
[SPEAKER_21]: Respectfully offered by John C. Falco Jr.'

213
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:53,923
[SPEAKER_21]: 's Medford City Council.

214
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:55,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on up, Desmond.

215
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:56,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

216
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, if we can.

217
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:57,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

218
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:01,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Desmond's making his way up there.

219
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:08,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's important that I think everybody here really celebrates Desmond's achievements.

220
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:22,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, you know, first, I've been given the honor in the past to present an Eagle Scout, and I think that was one of my biggest honors, because you realize how amazing and how important and

221
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,976
[SPEAKER_11]: What an honor this is the great people that have done that.

222
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:34,286
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and I know Chris Murphy comes out every year, every time there's an Eagle Scout presented as a fellow Eagle Scout he's here to present so here to show his respect.

223
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:38,371
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, with your family and in the whole team behind you.

224
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:40,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the work that has to be done to do that.

225
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,004
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know Desmond understands the greatness that is upon you now.

226
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,768
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, president, vice president, something big is gonna happen, Desmond.

227
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:51,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Just don't forget Medford.

228
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

229
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:06,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, also, if we can get a commitment that Desmond is not going to run for local public office.

230
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,580
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you have to worry about?

231
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,602
[SPEAKER_06]: A true politician.

232
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:20,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Desmond, if you could just relay, we've had other recipients come before us, and I know a big part of becoming an Eagle Scout

233
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,034
[SPEAKER_06]: are the many adventures that you go on, but also the community service part of it.

234
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:29,978
[SPEAKER_06]: And what project you've done to obtain the community service aspect.

235
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:37,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so my Eagle Scout project was I built a, like a big bench at the Medford dog park.

236
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,892
[SPEAKER_12]: The more recent one at the middle schools.

237
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:52,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it served a couple purposes provided more seating, of course, but protected the tree that the dogs are getting at.

238
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:57,256
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I'd say that was a really cool project.

239
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:06,879
[SPEAKER_12]: But like, in terms of the community service aspect, like the thing that's going to stick with me is the Veterans Day dinners that the scouts would put on every year.

240
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:11,481
[SPEAKER_12]: And those, you know, we've been doing it for many years now.

241
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something that we really take pride in.

242
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,423
[SPEAKER_12]: It comes up every year.

243
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,243
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and

244
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:26,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Having that commitment, it shows a lot, but it also teaches the right practices.

245
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:30,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that is something I'd like to highlight a little bit more.

246
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:32,098
[SPEAKER_06]: That's excellent.

247
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:39,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And every Eagle Scout that we've spoken with always states that it wasn't just solely their effort.

248
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:43,283
[SPEAKER_06]: It was other people that helped them along the way.

249
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you have a few people with you today.

250
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:46,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes, of course.

251
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:52,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to shout out my parents as well, Julie and Tim Lambert.

252
00:18:53,131 --> 00:19:10,844
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is a group effort and you can't say it's all one person, but it was everything that all the volunteers put in and all the scouts around you, how they contribute to your journey as well.

253
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:21,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the Eagle Scouts before me that that pushed me to, you know, achieve this goal.

254
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,891
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I owe a lot to them as well.

255
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,432
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

256
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're truly a fine young gentleman.

257
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I look for great things from you in the future.

258
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:38,838
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd also like to thank your parents that are here tonight for their involvement.

259
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:48,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also would like to thank Councilor Falco, who since I've been on the council with them, I think has recognized a number of Eagle Scouts.

260
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think he holds that great responsibility.

261
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:58,278
[SPEAKER_06]: obtaining of that badge as a real high honor.

262
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:00,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank him as well and congratulate you.

263
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

264
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:02,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

265
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,723
[SPEAKER_21]: President Caraviello.

266
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:05,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

267
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:09,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for earning your Eagle Scout.

268
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:17,392
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there's something in the water in Medford that I think, I don't know, since I've been here 10 years, an awful lot of Eagle Scouts have come through.

269
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:22,124
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if Medford has a record or something, but I want to thank you.

270
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:31,970
[SPEAKER_16]: You did say something which was good, how you enjoy doing the community service and how it feels good to do something for somebody, especially with the veterans.

271
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:35,472
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a great project you guys got behind.

272
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,514
[SPEAKER_16]: There's nothing better than the feeling of helping somebody.

273
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:42,596
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I want to thank you and your family for everything you did.

274
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, congratulations on whatever you,

275
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,912
[SPEAKER_16]: You moving, are you going to college?

276
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you going anywhere?

277
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm going to Bunker Hill right now.

278
00:20:50,914 --> 00:21:04,362
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm, you know, don't really know what exactly I'm gonna pursue, but it's one of those things that why go into a lot of debt?

279
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,325
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, just buy myself a little more time and I don't know.

280
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,252
[SPEAKER_12]: getting through this pandemic.

281
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:13,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Good for you.

282
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:15,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Just keep on doing what you're doing.

283
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:15,840
[SPEAKER_16]: You're doing a good job.

284
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:16,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

285
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:17,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

286
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:19,488
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

287
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,534

288
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:25,274
[SPEAKER_23]: Congratulations, Desmond.

289
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:41,419
[SPEAKER_23]: As someone who dropped out of the Brownies after about one year, the level of dedication and commitment that it takes to get to the rank of Eagle Scout is just something that will serve you so well in your life, but already serves the city of Medford and will continue to serve us as long as you choose to stay here.

290
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:47,261
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just congratulate you on such an achievement and all of your hard work to get here.

291
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:48,161
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

292
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:51,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

293
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:53,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

294
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends at Medford High School who also became Eagle Scouts.

295
00:21:57,727 --> 00:22:03,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think at some point I was in, you know, 10 years ago or so I was back in this audience congratulating them.

296
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know what kind of accomplishment it is.

297
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:11,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think your, your attitude is right on about about community service as well.

298
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:12,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And all I can say about

299
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:14,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Bunker Hill, I think that's a smart choice.

300
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:23,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do two years there, and you do well, you can transfer to a public university, know what you wanna do, get out in four, and get a good degree.

301
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,233
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like that.

302
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:29,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have any questions about that whole process, I've been involved with it for a few years now.

303
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So my contact information is on the website.

304
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:35,899
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

305
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,281
[SPEAKER_21]: And to answer your question, Councilor Marks, Councilor Caraviello,

306
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:59,925
[SPEAKER_21]: The past 10 years, there have been 17 Eagle Scouts that have come from Troop 416, which is a remarkable achievement for Troop 416, for their commitment and dedication to the community and to the Scouts.

307
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,880
[SPEAKER_21]: And once again, like we said before, it's a journey.

308
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,501
[SPEAKER_21]: It always takes a good support system.

309
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:06,624

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,190
[SPEAKER_16]: normal city hall business hours.

434

[SPEAKER_16]: normal city hall business hours.

437
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:13,936
[SPEAKER_16]: All in-person early voting would occur as with past practice in the city council chambers.

438
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:25,460
[SPEAKER_16]: For the municipal election on November 2, I am requesting and recommending that you designate the following five days in time for in-person early voting again in the city

439
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,593

[SPEAKER_16]: to five o'clock p.m.

442
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:32,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Saturday voting.

[SPEAKER_16]: Monday, October 25th, 8.30 a.m.

00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,479
[SPEAKER_16]: to 4.30 p.m.

445
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:40,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Normal City Hall Business Hours.

446
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Tuesday, October 26th, 8.30 a.m.

447
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:45,162
[SPEAKER_16]: to 4.30 p.m.

448
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:47,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Normal City Hall Business Hours.

449
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:48,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Wednesday,

450
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,222
[SPEAKER_16]: October 27th, 8.30 a.m.

451
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:54,525
[SPEAKER_16]: to 7.30 p.m., normal city hall business hours.

452
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:58,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Thursday, October 28th, 8.30 a.m.

453
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:01,971
[SPEAKER_16]: to 4.30 p.m., normal city hall business hours.

454
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:14,723
[SPEAKER_16]: For both elections, in-person early voting can begin not less than 10 days before the election and must end no later than the business day before the business day preceding the election.

455
00:34:15,564 --> 00:34:19,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for your consideration of these requests and recommendations.

456
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:24,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

457
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:26,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely wrong.

458
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:27,893
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

459
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:33,015
[SPEAKER_23]: I just have a question for the clerk for the chair for the note about for both elections in person.

460
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:36,317
[SPEAKER_23]: Early voting can begin not less than 10 days before the election.

461
00:34:36,997 --> 00:34:40,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, this it seems for the September election.

462
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:43,100
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it's in a smaller window of time.

463
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,601
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that because of the Labor Day holiday?

464
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:46,882
[SPEAKER_23]: There's like special exception for that.

465
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,043
[SPEAKER_10]: That is that is correct.

466
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:56,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor can begin not less than that, because and with Labor Day weekend, uh, right, we wouldn't want to do the voting on a holiday weekend, right?

467
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,730
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is that is correct.

468
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,610
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, thank you.

469
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

470
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

471
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:04,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

472
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:10,022
[SPEAKER_06]: We happen to have Sandy Gale that's here, who's the acting elections coordinator.

473
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was wondering if she could step to the podium, just basically tell this council the need for early voting in this community and her staffing levels.

474
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:30,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to make sure that we administratively are able to pull this off, Mr. President.

475
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:33,209
[SPEAKER_06]: in a very important city election.

476
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:38,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, Councilor Marks through the chair.

477
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:46,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that early voting is is a very important aspect of elections.

478
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:47,422
[SPEAKER_01]: However, given

479
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:56,771
[SPEAKER_01]: The preliminary election, it's my opinion that I don't believe we need four days.

480
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:00,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in initial talks with the clerk, we were ready to jump on board.

481
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,615
[SPEAKER_01]: For the full four days, I think five days would have been absolutely impossible.

482
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:15,100
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we could achieve the same goal if we drop that to two days, which would be Wednesday, the 8th, and Thursday the 9th.

483
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We still would have over-the-counter voting,

484
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,091
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in the clerk's office for that Friday and the Tuesday.

485
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:34,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that vote absentee and are accustomed to voting in that office for preliminary elections, they still would have that opportunity to do so.

486
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:47,657
[SPEAKER_01]: That also would reduce budgetary costs for early voting because I do have to have a minimum of probably eight staff, including myself.

487
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the staff.

488
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:52,605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a problem.

489
00:36:52,865 --> 00:37:00,712
[SPEAKER_01]: But to reduce on a preliminary election some cost, it probably would be a worthy idea.

490
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:04,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So through you, Mr. President.

491
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:11,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Sandy, the coverage of the poll that's gonna be here at City Hall.

492
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that done with existing city employees or

493
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,064
[SPEAKER_06]: of these poll workers that would come in?

494
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:28,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, Councilor Marks, it would be done with existing election workers that have done early voting last year all the way since 2016.

495
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:34,668
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an ongoing training process for that early voting.

496
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:39,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially when we started in 2016, everything was on paper.

497
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:44,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are lucky enough to have poll pads that we use that we can look voters up.

498
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:56,744
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a barcode so that when we process those ballots downstairs in the registrar voters office after voting has closed, we scan the barcode and it automatically takes that person out of the system.

499
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,627
[SPEAKER_01]: so they can't come and try to vote early again.

500
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:04,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an ongoing evolving process.

501
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:12,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So just so I understand, it's not done with existing registrar voters employees.

502
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It is at night.

503
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,702
[SPEAKER_01]: At night, okay.

504
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:20,005
[SPEAKER_01]: When voting is all done for the day.

505
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:24,769
[SPEAKER_01]: So the process is you come in, you check in through the poll pad,

506
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,104
[SPEAKER_01]: you are given an affirmation envelope or what we call an EV7.

507
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:36,328
[SPEAKER_01]: You're affirming on that envelope that you are the registered voter that is listed in the rolls.

508
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,571
[SPEAKER_01]: You sign the envelope, put your address, print your name.

509
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,053
[SPEAKER_01]: You are then sent back to a table.

510
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:48,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we all get the same ballot, this time around, there's no confusion about ballots and things like that.

511
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:52,261
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody for the preliminary will get exactly the same ballot.

512
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:59,806
[SPEAKER_01]: They get their ballot, go to the booth, fold it up, put it in the envelope, and then they drop it in the ballot box on their way out the door.

513
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:19,320
[SPEAKER_01]: We close the gap after voting is over for the day when myself or the clerk, with a police escort, take those ballots downstairs to the Registrar of Voters Office, and we open the VRIS system, which is our state voter registration information system.

514
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:23,067
[SPEAKER_01]: and we scan each one of those barcodes.

515
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,628
[SPEAKER_01]: And that generates a list.

516
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:34,854
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference with the preliminary this time is the plan is to send them out to the precincts to be tabulated on election day.

517
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:38,096
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would be handled like absentee ballots.

518
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:43,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would go with a checklist that would be created by us.

519
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:50,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And my other question, I did read through Chapter 29 of the Acts of 2021.

520
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:51,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

521
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:59,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought I read and correct me if I'm wrong, there's language in there for people that are unable to attend the in-person

522
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:08,447
[SPEAKER_06]: voting that would allow the registrar voters office to actually go out to homes and have people vote by ballot.

523
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:08,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?

524
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:09,848
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.

525
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:12,890
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always offered that service in Medford.

526
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,232
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on I'm last year.

527
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:21,176
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little, um, a little more dicey because of Cove it and

528
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:30,723
[SPEAKER_01]: being in the midst of a pandemic, we had to get a little more creative, like putting things in baggies or having the police drive or something like that.

529
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:39,310
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've always offered that service, and I personally have done it myself for someone that had a disabled child that could not get to the polls.

530
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:43,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took the ballot out and allowed her to vote.

531
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:48,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do believe that the Board of Registrars also has done that in the past.

532
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:53,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And does that need to happen in conjunction with the days that we approve?

533
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Or does that happen right up until the election?

534
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:59,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that happens right up until the election and including election day.

535
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:04,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't ever know what type of emergency situation.

536
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:09,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And you certainly don't want to turn a voter away because someone can't get out there.

537
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:17,034
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons why we have registrars and people who are equipped to do that.

538
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:23,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's great, and I think part of offering this is also notifying the public that it exists.

539
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when I read the acts, I wasn't familiar with some of it myself, and I've been around for a while.

540
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:40,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think part of the outreach that will be done between now and the plenary and the general election should include that outreach, what options people have available.

541
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd ask that that be done.

542
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:47,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you had the opportunity to put a monetary value on

543
00:41:48,408 --> 00:42:04,279
[SPEAKER_06]: what it's gonna cost the city to provide each day with having election employees as well as I would assume you'd need a police officer present for the time and any other associated costs with allowing the in-person voting?

544
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:09,763
[SPEAKER_01]: A rough guesstimate is it probably would cost

545
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,956
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly it's gonna cost about between 750 and 800.

546
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:26,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound fair, Mr. Clerk?

547
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:28,039
[SPEAKER_10]: That's ballpark.

548
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's ballpark.

549
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be based on the number of days that you offered the full for the preliminary?

550
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,524
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's for both days.

551
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:38,746
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for two days of early voting.

552
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's roughly about $400 a day.

553
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,889
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's for two days of early voting.

554
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:55,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on what you're telling me, I feel very comfortable, especially knowing the preliminary election in this community typically has a real low turnout.

555
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,778
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think having the early voting in person voting

556
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,106
[SPEAKER_06]: for four days sounds kind of excessive.

557
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:08,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday to me is kind of a lost day because Friday City Hall closes at 1230.

558
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:10,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're really only getting four hours on a Friday.

559
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:14,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I much prefer having the extended hours on the Wednesday.

560
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:18,024
[SPEAKER_06]: for those that may be working and can't make it during the day.

561
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:33,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would support and put it in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we have the early in-person voting for the preliminary on Wednesday, September 8th, from 8.30 to 7.30 p.m.

562
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:35,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's normal business hours.

563
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:41,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And Thursday, September 9th, from 8.30 to 4.30, and that's for the preliminary.

564
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:49,026
[SPEAKER_06]: and Wednesday, October 27th, 8.30 to 7.30, and Thursday, October 28th, 8.30 to 4.30.

565
00:43:49,106 --> 00:44:04,556
[SPEAKER_06]: From my tabulations, that's 19 hours of additional in-person options that people have in addition to mail-in ballots and so forth and other options that they may have, Mr. President, for voting.

566
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:08,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

567
00:44:08,258 --> 00:44:10,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information, Mr. President.

568
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:19,054
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the information for your early voting in October, which is for your general election in November?

569
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:27,455
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that you want to do is definitely capture at least one weekend day so that those folks who work a regular job.

570
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:37,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that in the October early voting for the general election, you do need to offer all five days.

571
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:47,919
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion and based on looking at what the numbers were for early voting last year, we have a much higher turnout.

572
00:44:48,240 --> 00:45:06,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And without really knowing where we're going to be as far as community health concerns in regards to the Delta variant in Medford, the controlled environment that we have here with help from DPW who comes in and fogs for us every two hours,

573
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:13,772
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably a little bit more important for the general to have that five days.

574
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:20,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know why this would be any more controlled than any other poll.

575
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:22,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't we follow the same standards?

576
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:24,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.

577
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:35,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't anticipate having sanitizers and spacers in the precincts unless something develops in the next several weeks.

578
00:45:36,389 --> 00:45:41,451
[SPEAKER_01]: that the governor reissues a mask mandate or reissues closings.

579
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:48,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't anticipate having sanitizers and spacers as I did last November.

580
00:45:50,594 --> 00:45:57,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So the staff in a polling location has changed even from March of last year.

581
00:45:58,517 --> 00:46:05,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a warden and a clerk, two check-in inspectors, and two check-out inspectors.

582
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:13,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Under these acts, we have eliminated the checkout inspectors, which has worked much better.

583
00:46:14,914 --> 00:46:19,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, Mr. President, I'll listen to what my colleagues have to say.

584
00:46:19,216 --> 00:46:26,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I will withdraw the motion I put forth for the general election and listen to my colleagues.

585
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to say, Mr. President, that it's vital that we have an election coordinator in position

586
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: which this council has been pushing for for several years now.

587
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:48,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sandy Gill has been our election coordinator for all intents and purposes for a couple of decades now in the community, Mr. President.

588
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,005
[SPEAKER_06]: As we found out, Sandy is acting and the administration's working on apparently

589
00:46:57,635 --> 00:46:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, posting the position and so forth.

590
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:10,686
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also heard from the city administration less than an hour ago that they like to get people into acting roles and then push them into the role, Mr. President.

591
00:47:11,046 --> 00:47:12,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have someone

592
00:47:12,928 --> 00:47:16,669
[SPEAKER_06]: that's been acting, doing the job, a very capable person.

593
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:26,150
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another thing we heard from the city administration, that they wanna make sure if they are gonna put someone in an acting role, they're capable, and then also have the ability to do the job.

594
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have someone that's capable doing the job.

595
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:41,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the hangup is, but in my opinion, 26 years elected in this city, Mr. President, the integrity of our election process is of the utmost importance.

596
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:48,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And if people lose confidence in how we run an election, Mr. President, I don't want to be around for that.

597
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:56,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's important that we have a coordinator, the council recognize that, while waiting for the city administration to follow through.

598
00:47:56,323 --> 00:48:00,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's vital, Mr. President, we have someone in that role.

599
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:10,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Sandy's and the acting role, and I think it's about time the city administration gets off their duff and does something, Mr. President, in order to maintain

600
00:48:10,995 --> 00:48:13,335
[SPEAKER_06]: of the integrity and security of our elections.

601
00:48:13,395 --> 00:48:13,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

602
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:14,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

603
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:15,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Raul.

604
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:16,936
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:22,717
[SPEAKER_23]: I understand the rationale of Councilor Marks' motion, as well as what Ms.

606
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:23,837
[SPEAKER_23]: Gail is sharing.

607
00:48:23,897 --> 00:48:28,898
[SPEAKER_23]: I personally don't feel comfortable cutting the days for early voting for the preliminary.

608
00:48:28,998 --> 00:48:32,299
[SPEAKER_23]: I would support the original four days that were recommended.

609
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:36,760
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's just, as an elected official, I don't feel comfortable limiting the days.

610
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,640
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

611
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:39,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears.

612
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

613
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:49,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Through you to Coordinator Gale, my first question is on the mail-in voting.

614
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we or is the Secretary of State's office going to be sending a postcard out to let people know that they can apply for a mail ballot?

615
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:06,663
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, I'm sorry, through the Chair, Councilor Bears, at this time, the only

616
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:19,004
[SPEAKER_01]: advertisement is the Secretary of State making infomercials or having on their website that you can vote by mail.

617
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,565
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a link.

618
00:49:21,385 --> 00:49:23,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I did work with Ms.

619
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:31,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Peeks like a week and a half ago on putting some information up on our Medford website where you could click the link, download the application.

620
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:36,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important that when voters download that application,

621
00:49:36,983 --> 00:49:44,328
[SPEAKER_01]: that they don't type their name in, they have to sign it, physically sign it, or we will be returning it, the application will be rejected.

622
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:47,310
[SPEAKER_01]: We did run into some of that last year.

623
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,853
[SPEAKER_01]: The mail-in is an evolving process.

624
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:52,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We are learning.

625
00:49:52,194 --> 00:49:55,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, it was done on a scale that had never been done before.

626
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:58,298
[SPEAKER_01]: But by November, we were perfect.

627
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:03,862
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've learned and made notes, and we have the plan.

628
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:20,861
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just getting the information out there, which also brings me to, the clerk and I have already ordered a large banner to hang, reminding people that September the 14th is preliminary election day.

629
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:30,389
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lawn signs to go throughout the city and two larger signs that are gonna be put on frames in the front lawn to get voter awareness out there.

630
00:50:31,982 --> 00:50:40,425
[SPEAKER_01]: But as of right now, in my last account from the state, which was earlier today, no, they are not sending out any postcards.

631
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:57,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is important for voters to know on this platform that if you're applying for a mail-in ballot for the preliminary election, that one application covers you for preliminary and general.

632
00:50:58,351 --> 00:50:59,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So you only have to do it once.

633
00:51:00,943 --> 00:51:05,985
[SPEAKER_03]: That's helpful, yeah, and I have full confidence in the mail process and the votes being all of that.

634
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:09,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the question of do people know that it's still an option?

635
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:12,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad to hear that there's gonna be some efforts made.

636
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:16,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for the, I guess my question, then I'll make my comment.

637
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:22,531
[SPEAKER_03]: How, is there a date, can I request a mail ballot today for these elections?

638
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:25,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the chair, yes, Councilor Bears, you can.

639
00:51:25,692 --> 00:51:26,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

640
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:29,073
[SPEAKER_01]: You can request one right up until,

641
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's the eighth, Mr. Clerk.

642
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to check the exact schedule.

643
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:45,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's five days before the election.

644
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:48,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Five days before, I believe it is the eighth of September.

645
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,834
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be six days before the election.

646
00:51:50,034 --> 00:51:55,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be, yeah, it's the eighth of the ninth, but I think Sandy's right, I think it's the eighth.

647
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:57,356
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's great.

648
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I would just maybe suggest, I know,

649
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:10,421
[SPEAKER_03]: It may incur a cost, maybe even a pretty significant cost, but letting voters know the options, maybe via a postcard or a robocall of some kind, I think would be helpful.

650
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:14,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because the law, I mean, it's right here.

651
00:52:15,563 --> 00:52:18,724
[SPEAKER_03]: This came to us August 12th, the law was signed July 29th.

652
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kind of been some back and forth.

653
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:23,305
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some concerns that some options may not be available.

654
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:28,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think just to make sure voters know all their options, that could be helpful.

655
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,448
[SPEAKER_10]: we can we council bears.

656
00:52:30,468 --> 00:52:40,031
[SPEAKER_10]: We can request a we can request reverse 911 postcard would be, um, might be prohibitively prohibitively expensive on this one.

657
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:48,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, last year, as you'll recall, the Secretary of State's office, in other words, the Commonwealth covered the cost for all those postcards, which was a which is a very large cost.

658
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:54,075
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think we can definitely do some reverse 911 citywide alerting people to this.

659
00:52:54,555 --> 00:52:54,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

660
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:57,736
[SPEAKER_10]: part of the reason and we'd be more than happy to do that.

661
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:05,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, particularly if you act tonight on the early voting dates, because we can get all that we can get all that information out at once, and we could do it more than once.

662
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:06,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

663
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:15,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on early voting, I personally I hear Council marks on the low turnout, but this is the first election I can remember

664
00:53:16,523 --> 00:53:19,966
[SPEAKER_03]: in many, many years where we've had a preliminary election for the office of mayor.

665
00:53:20,886 --> 00:53:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that may significantly increase turnout from a preliminary elections in the past.

666
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:32,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So I personally would like to maintain the four days of early voting for the preliminary election.

667
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:44,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I respect your view on it, and I understand that it would save about $1,000, but I just don't think we know what turnout might be and having three candidates

668
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:47,543
[SPEAKER_03]: is is unusual.

669
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:49,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Custom rope.

670
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:51,425
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

671
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:52,825
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Bears job.

672
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:53,246
[SPEAKER_23]: My memory.

673
00:53:53,306 --> 00:53:57,088
[SPEAKER_23]: I've seen some people if I could for coordinator Gail through the chair.

674
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:01,470
[SPEAKER_23]: People voted absentee for the first time last November.

675
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,792
[SPEAKER_23]: They still need to request to vote absentee to vote mail in ballot again.

676
00:54:05,872 --> 00:54:06,092
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct.

677
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,653
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not going to automatically get something.

678
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:10,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the chair, Councilor Morell, yes.

679
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:14,300
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to request a new application for this year.

680
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:21,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And that application will cover them for the preliminary election and for the general November 2nd.

681
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:26,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So they only need to do it once and it stays checked in our file system.

682
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:33,067
[SPEAKER_01]: in VRIS so that we know, okay, they requested we have to mail this out.

683
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:37,348
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been no ballots mailed out as of this time because they were just ordered today.

684
00:54:37,868 --> 00:54:45,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Great, thank you, because I've seen that question posed in a number of places, and I just want to thank you and the clerk for doing the work on the banner and the signs.

685
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:49,372
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a request I've seen for a number of years, so I'm really excited to see those go out.

686
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:50,072
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

687
00:54:51,032 --> 00:54:51,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

688
00:54:51,473 --> 00:54:52,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

689
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:57,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President, and miss Gail, thank you so much for your presentation and the clerk as well.

690
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:11,568
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've been talking about advertising elections for a while, and it's it's great to see that this is occurring, and it's, you know, it's I said we're reaching out trying to engage people, and you know being part of the process of voting.

691
00:55:12,189 --> 00:55:14,529
[SPEAKER_21]: I for one, I completely understand the rationale for.

692
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:31,556
[SPEAKER_21]: reducing the number of days, but for me, I like to see that this flexibility, so I would be in favor of keeping the four days in person early voting as stated here, the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th for the preliminary.

693
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:32,277
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be

694
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:38,927
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's great that we have the flexibility, especially with concerns of COVID and whatnot.

695
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:44,589
[SPEAKER_21]: If someone's weary, they had the flexibility of coming over a multiple number of days.

696
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:49,351
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think four days is ideal, and I would be in favor of the four days.

697
00:55:49,891 --> 00:55:50,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

698
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:52,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Through the chair, thank you, Councilor Thompson.

699
00:55:54,032 --> 00:55:56,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Have we been in contact with the post office yet?

700
00:55:56,473 --> 00:56:00,154
[SPEAKER_16]: I know last time we had some issues with the post office.

701
00:56:02,857 --> 00:56:04,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, I do.

702
00:56:04,338 --> 00:56:08,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a direct contact now at the post office when the issues began to arise.

703
00:56:09,684 --> 00:56:20,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in person to the post office and I have a direct contact here and we've made an agreement how our in city mail will be handled, especially if it's ballots.

704
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:24,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally the track of mail

705
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:33,524
[SPEAKER_01]: in Medford is it goes to Forest Street, and then from Forest Street it goes into Boston, and from Boston it comes back out to Medford.

706
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:46,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So my contact at the Forest Street post office, as long as we keep it separated as to local mail and non-local mail, meaning non-Medford delivery, they will deliver immediately.

707
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:52,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a postal connection that I made last year at the urging of the clerk

708
00:56:53,650 --> 00:57:00,492
[SPEAKER_01]: to establish some groundwork with another gentleman at the post office in Boston.

709
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:10,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And he oversees all cities and towns in any mailing through the Secretary of State's office, and I have a very good rapport with both of them.

710
00:57:11,156 --> 00:57:14,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't anticipate that to be an issue at all.

711
00:57:15,578 --> 00:57:15,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

712
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:16,758
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

713
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:18,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion?

714
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

715
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:33,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Marks, you have a motion on the floor to have the yearly voting for just Wednesday and Thursday, correct?

716
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:42,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on the recommendation of our elections coordinator for the preliminary, I withdrew my recommendations for the general election.

717
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:50,079
[SPEAKER_16]: So, on the motion by Council Marks,

718
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:57,042
[SPEAKER_16]: As amended, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

719
00:57:57,362 --> 00:57:58,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

720
00:57:58,902 --> 00:58:02,643
[SPEAKER_10]: So I need some clarification.

721
00:58:03,343 --> 00:58:10,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you voting on the two days of early voting for September and then all the additional days for October, or are they separate votes?

722
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:11,324
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's one vote.

723
00:58:12,344 --> 00:58:15,305
[SPEAKER_21]: So the motion is to reduce it to two?

724
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:16,005
[SPEAKER_16]: The two days.

725
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:16,665
[SPEAKER_16]: For the preliminary.

726
00:58:17,365 --> 00:58:21,426
[SPEAKER_16]: For the preliminary, for the Wednesday and the Thursday on the recommendation

727
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:23,907
[SPEAKER_16]: of the election coordinator.

728
00:58:33,452 --> 00:58:33,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

729
00:59:05,252 --> 00:59:06,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, wait, wait, what?

730
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:14,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a question about if it was severed or not, because I wanna, I don't know what, okay.

731
00:59:15,254 --> 00:59:15,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we voting?

732
00:59:18,195 --> 00:59:20,116
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion is by Councilor Marks.

733
00:59:20,376 --> 00:59:22,516
[SPEAKER_16]: He supported the motion as amended.

734
00:59:22,936 --> 00:59:30,098
[SPEAKER_16]: He's amending the motion to reduce the early voting in four days to two on the Wednesday and Thursday.

735
00:59:30,618 --> 00:59:34,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to vote on the amendment first and then vote on the... Do you want to sever?

736
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:40,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't... They asked me a motion to sever the vote.

737
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:45,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a second, we're voting on the whole package at once.

738
00:59:46,509 --> 00:59:59,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would like to vote on the amendment proposed by Councilor Marks and then vote on the final paper, depending on... And then that version of the final paper will be determined on the vote of the amendment, if that makes sense.

739
00:59:59,457 --> 01:00:00,238
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not opposed to that.

740
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:09,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so on the amendment, a motion by Councilor Markswell to reduce the days from four to two.

741
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

742
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:14,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

743
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:19,009
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is to reduce from four to two, for the preliminary.

744
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:19,649
[SPEAKER_16]: For the preliminary.

745
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:33,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

746
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:34,151
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

747
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:36,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco?

748
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:36,373
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

749
01:00:37,374 --> 01:00:38,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight is absent.

750
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:39,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

751
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:40,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

752
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:41,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell?

753
01:00:41,598 --> 01:00:41,798
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

754
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:43,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

755
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

756
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:48,184
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello?

757
01:00:48,484 --> 01:00:48,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

758
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:51,647
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a tie, we have a tie.

759
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:54,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion fails.

760
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,452
[SPEAKER_10]: That generally means motion fails.

761
01:00:57,092 --> 01:00:57,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion fails.

762
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:02,717
[SPEAKER_10]: So does that mean that there's no early voting?

763
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:04,978
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm now moving to approve.

764
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,679
[SPEAKER_16]: There'll be four days now.

765
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:08,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I move to approve.

766
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,220
[SPEAKER_10]: We gotta vote on it.

767
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Approve.

768
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:12,201
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm trying to figure out.

769
01:01:12,221 --> 01:01:17,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve all nine days of early voting, four for the preliminary, five for the general.

770
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:19,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd ask that we sever that vote, Mr. President.

771
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:23,327
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you want to sever out of that?

772
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,831
[SPEAKER_06]: take them as two distinct votes, Mr. President.

773
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:27,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Preliminary and the general election.

774
01:01:27,932 --> 01:01:28,532
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine with me.

775
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:40,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Bears to vote on the preliminary dates, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Morell.

776
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:44,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

777
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:51,063
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is for the dates of the preliminary only, the four dates.

778
01:01:51,663 --> 01:01:52,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I could.

779
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:53,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Max.

780
01:01:53,931 --> 01:02:03,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if I could, it was only roughly, I think less than a month ago that a member of this council offered a resolution to do away with the preliminary altogether.

781
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:17,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have a preliminary that's gonna take place and now we're adding days, which I'm not opposed to, I'm opposed to that many days, but now we're adding days from going to eliminating the preliminary to adding days.

782
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:19,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think, you know,

783
01:02:21,632 --> 01:02:31,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where we're going, Mr. President, you know, unless it's just, you know, on a whim that we go back and forth, but it doesn't make much sense to me.

784
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:37,737
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, Mr. President, I actually took a page from the book of Councilor Marks on that one.

785
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:41,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And my resolution was that the preliminary election be discussed.

786
01:02:42,399 --> 01:02:46,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to feel out the room to see if there may be interest in not having a preliminary election.

787
01:02:47,742 --> 01:02:48,783
[SPEAKER_03]: and clearly there was not.

788
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:50,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So we discussed it.

789
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:51,926
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided against it.

790
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:55,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we're going to have the election, we should make it as flexible and open as possible.

791
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:56,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my position, right?

792
01:02:56,891 --> 01:02:58,633
[SPEAKER_06]: But that wasn't the original intent.

793
01:02:58,953 --> 01:03:01,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The original intent was to have a vote on it.

794
01:03:01,516 --> 01:03:03,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And this council thought better because

795
01:03:04,121 --> 01:03:07,682
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even have the full number of people that were gonna run.

796
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:10,043
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even know if we were gonna have a preliminary election.

797
01:03:10,063 --> 01:03:12,885
[SPEAKER_03]: We discussed it and decided it was a bad idea and I stand by it.

798
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:13,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

799
01:03:13,465 --> 01:03:20,268
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know how we go from one extreme to another, but I guess everyone's entitled to their opinion, Mr. President.

800
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:27,591
[SPEAKER_06]: But my vote is based on the recommendation from our election coordinator that's been in this community for a number of years.

801
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:33,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And to think that because of the election in this preliminary, that there's gonna be some strange turnout

802
01:03:34,426 --> 01:03:38,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is misguided, very misguided, Mr. President, but that's my own opinion.

803
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:40,009
[SPEAKER_06]: We shall see.

804
01:03:41,129 --> 01:03:43,590
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morell.

805
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

806
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is to approve the- To approve the four days of preliminary voting.

807
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:52,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

808
01:03:53,895 --> 01:04:03,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Just before you call, so if this happens to get voted down, Mr. President, in the spirit of cooperation, if this happens to get voted down, there will be no early,

809
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:07,709
[SPEAKER_06]: in voting at all for the poll.

810
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a three to three vote is eliminating it altogether.

811
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:16,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So rather than having four days or two days, we're gonna have zero days.

812
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:23,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the interest of negotiation, Mr. President, I just wanna put that out there.

813
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:28,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So no one's caught off guard because I know what I'm gonna do.

814
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather have 19 hours of in-person voting than zero.

815
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:45,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I were to move to reconsider before the end of the meeting, would we be able to take up the vote again at this meeting?

816
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:48,851
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because you're not on the prevailing side.

817
01:04:48,911 --> 01:04:50,692
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be on the prevailing side.

818
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:52,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I may end up on the prevailing side.

819
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I may or may not.

820
01:04:54,275 --> 01:04:54,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

821
01:04:58,779 --> 01:04:59,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a risk.

822
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:02,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.

823
01:05:06,764 --> 01:05:07,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, you saw the vote?

824
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:11,647
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is for four days of early voting, September.

825
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:12,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's correct.

826
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:14,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

827
01:05:14,669 --> 01:05:14,949

01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:16,190

829
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:16,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Nye is absent.

01:05:20,733 --> 01:05:21,253

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

835
01:05:22,114 --> 01:05:22,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

836
01:05:23,114 --> 01:05:23,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

837
01:05:24,235 --> 01:05:24,956
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello?

838
01:05:27,317 --> 01:05:27,497
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

839
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:29,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Four in the affirmative, two in the negative.

840
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:30,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

841
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,002
[SPEAKER_16]: On the dates for

842
01:05:35,112 --> 01:05:37,415
[SPEAKER_16]: The municipal election.

843
01:05:39,557 --> 01:05:42,721
[SPEAKER_16]: On the date for the municipal election, do I have a motion?

844
01:05:42,961 --> 01:05:43,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

845

893
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:41,406

01:14:25,522 --> 01:14:26,722

01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:07,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that moving forward, we see everything in order.

1019
01:15:07,293 --> 01:15:10,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see anything holding this petition up.

1020
01:15:10,616 --> 01:15:13,979
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wait for my colleagues if they have any questions.

1021
01:15:14,339 --> 01:15:22,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any further discussion on the license for hearing and seeing none?

1022
01:15:22,626 --> 01:15:25,328
[SPEAKER_16]: I move to accept this move forward.

[SPEAKER_16]: by law, they'd be granted permission to complete the project in accordance with the plans available for inspection in the office of the City Clerk of the City Hall room 103 George Piazza Drive, FMS 02155.

1045
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:09,223
[SPEAKER_16]: The entire scope of this project includes ABA upgrades of three locations.

1046
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:15,708
[SPEAKER_16]: front ATM vestibule and lobby, rear parking lot, and the front entrance along Spring Street.

1047

[SPEAKER_16]: The work at the front entrance includes modifying city sidewalks.

1048
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:23,695
[SPEAKER_16]: The scope of the work at the front entrance is as follows.

1049
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:33,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Demo existing sidewalks in three sections along the building, 108 square feet, install a new ADA compliant landing and ramp,

1050
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:43,488
[SPEAKER_16]: install a new EDA compliant handrail around landing along the ramp.

1051
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Approved city engineer with the following conditions, recommendations.

1052
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:56,841
[SPEAKER_16]: One, the engineering division provided a suggested process to assist the city council in our October 21, 2020 memo.

1053
01:17:57,342 --> 01:18:00,445
[SPEAKER_16]: As indicated in that process, if approved by the city council,

1054
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:09,162
[SPEAKER_16]: the petitioner would be required to draft a proposed licensing agreement in coordination with the legal department and engineering division.

1055
01:18:09,782 --> 01:18:20,345
[SPEAKER_16]: The engineering division recommends that the city council determine if this process is adequate and reasonable pursuant to section 74-63 of the city ordinances.

1056
01:18:21,165 --> 01:18:28,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, the engineering division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situated

1057
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,201
[SPEAKER_16]: for as long as they remain in good condition.

1058
01:18:31,602 --> 01:18:35,045
[SPEAKER_16]: If they fall into disrepair or poor conditions, the city will revoke the license.

1059
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:42,670
[SPEAKER_16]: The existing encroachments will include a metal fire escape, building cornices, and signs attached to the building three.

1060
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:50,837
[SPEAKER_16]: The easement plan indicates an easement area that extends beyond the existing projections into the public way, the engineering division.

1061
01:18:51,531 --> 01:18:53,172
[SPEAKER_16]: takes no exception to this approach.

1062
01:18:53,392 --> 01:19:06,302
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the license agreement should indicate that no new encroachments or expansion of the existing encroachments is allowed beyond the limits of the existing encroachments as shown on the eastern plan.

1063
01:19:06,503 --> 01:19:06,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Four,

1064
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:13,071
[SPEAKER_16]: The license agreement should indicate that the licensee will maintain the encroaching items in good condition.

1065
01:19:13,131 --> 01:19:19,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Five, the license agreement should indicate that the city will revoke the license upon removal of the encroaching items.

1066
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:27,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Six, the city council should decide if the license agreement should include a renewal period or expiration.

1067
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:35,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven, the city council should recommend a reasonable fee be charged by the city for use of public property for the benefit of the petitioner.

1068
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:41,282
[SPEAKER_16]: The licensed area must include the level landing at the base of the ramp.

1069
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:50,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Nine, the license agreement should acknowledge that the potential presence of underground utilities beneath the proposed ramp should not restrict access to these utilities.

1070
01:19:50,388 --> 01:20:01,595
[SPEAKER_16]: 10, the notification for the public hearing regarding this approval process should include utility companies that have infrastructure in this block of Spring Street.

1071
01:20:01,615 --> 01:20:06,078
[SPEAKER_16]: 11, the sidewalk work associated with this ramp is adjacent to a cracked sidewalk panels.

1072
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,091
[SPEAKER_16]: adjacent crack panels should be replaced.

1073
01:20:09,111 --> 01:20:13,314
[SPEAKER_16]: 12, the ramp is a projection of the building and is associated with the building.

1074
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:15,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Entrance and exit.

1075
01:20:15,835 --> 01:20:23,059
[SPEAKER_16]: The ramp must be built per applicable building code and inspected by the building department for code compliance.

1076
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:28,842
[SPEAKER_16]: 13, the plan indicates a national grid manhole near the proposed ramp.

1077
01:20:29,223 --> 01:20:32,765
[SPEAKER_16]: The licensee should not restrict access to this manhole.

1078
01:20:34,313 --> 01:20:40,454
[SPEAKER_16]: The plan indicates relocating a tree pit on Spring Street that conflicts with clearances needed for the ramp.

1079
01:20:41,074 --> 01:20:45,195
[SPEAKER_16]: The new location appears reasonable and should be confirmed with the tree ward.

1080
01:20:46,535 --> 01:20:54,457
[SPEAKER_16]: 15, the license agreement should indicate the minimum clearance between the ramp and the front of the curb to be 72 inches.

1081
01:20:55,877 --> 01:20:57,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Call 781-393-2425 for any further accommodations.

1082
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any discussion on this?

1083
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,422
[SPEAKER_16]: The petitioner is on call.

1084
01:21:09,442 --> 01:21:10,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is the petitioner?

1085
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:13,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Ammar Salam?

1086
01:21:13,645 --> 01:21:14,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Senior Project Manager from Citizen Financial Group.

1090
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:32,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the one who's managing the project at this location, and I reviewed the comments provided by the engineer.

1091
01:21:34,904 --> 01:21:41,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Comments no, I will kind of like if we go from number one and down Common number one.

1092
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:44,949
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no issue about this common back to the consulate.

1093
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:45,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

1094
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hold on one second?

1095
01:21:48,051 --> 01:21:53,874
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just dying to hear Are you here speaking in favor of this hearing?

1096
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:55,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir

1097
01:21:56,397 --> 01:21:57,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, thank you very much.

1098
01:21:57,638 --> 01:22:00,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there anyone else here speaking in favor?

1099
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:02,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing none, we close that portion of the hearing.

1100
01:22:03,344 --> 01:22:05,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there anyone here opposed to this?

1101
01:22:07,628 --> 01:22:10,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing none, we close that portion.

1102
01:22:11,813 --> 01:22:13,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Salam.

1103
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:15,196
[SPEAKER_16]: If you can continue with the presentation.

1104
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:17,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1105
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:18,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Item number two,

1106
01:22:19,966 --> 01:22:43,698
[SPEAKER_04]: uh the engineering division uh recommending metal fire escape uh building cornish and signs attached to the building the metal fire escape was constructed in this building from day one and i just want to kind of like uh uh present citizen bank side we are leasing this building triple net so we pay lease we maintain it

1107
01:22:44,578 --> 01:22:54,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we leased the place, which is constructed, I think 1934 or around this time, the metal fire escape was already existing over there.

1108
01:22:55,165 --> 01:23:00,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So my thought in this case, the metal fire escape, it's a landlord issue.

1109
01:23:00,528 --> 01:23:01,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not citizen.

1110
01:23:02,289 --> 01:23:11,114
[SPEAKER_04]: The building coronation signage, we removed it and we installed more modern design, which less much less projection.

1111
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:12,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So

1112
01:23:13,218 --> 01:23:24,064
[SPEAKER_04]: For item number two, we have no problem in regards to the signage or the cornish because we already took them out and installed newer version with much less projection than the existing one.

1113
01:23:24,665 --> 01:23:33,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And this work was done like early this year, and a permit being pulled from the township, approved, and the work is done.

1114
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:38,273
[SPEAKER_04]: For item number three, we have no issue.

1115
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:38,333
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1116
01:23:39,093 --> 01:23:41,635
[SPEAKER_11]: We have information Councilor Scapelli.

1117
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:44,635
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

1118
01:23:45,135 --> 01:23:50,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you saying that there's a discrepancy that we're not, we're not, it's not, I'm confused.

1119
01:23:50,817 --> 01:24:00,580
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying that there's an issue with the fire escape that has no reflection to citizens, but to the landlord, what does that have to do with, I'm confused with this project.

1120
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, metal fire escape, it's existing condition in the building.

1121
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:07,802
[SPEAKER_04]: When the building is built like 19, mid 1900, is the original landlord,

1122
01:24:12,101 --> 01:24:20,003
[SPEAKER_04]: or the Lakarta landlord, when it's built, they build the fire escape, and at the time, probably, the permit officer approved it.

1123
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:26,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's existing condition, and usually, it's not related to our project at all.

1124
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:30,165
[SPEAKER_11]: So Citizens Bank does not agree with number two, then?

1125
01:24:31,706 --> 01:24:41,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of it, because the mental fire escape, it's a part of the building that's been constructed since 1934, and probably has been approved at that time.

1126
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:48,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure why the engineer would like to include it in the scope of work that we're doing.

1127
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:52,008
[SPEAKER_04]: He is pointing out some violation.

1128
01:24:53,129 --> 01:25:00,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And from Citizen Bank, the fine and Cornish building, it's already been demoed earlier this year.

1129
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:01,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a brand new signage.

1130
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:04,819
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys allow me, I can share my screen with a new picture.

1131
01:25:06,314 --> 01:25:15,021
[SPEAKER_04]: My only comment here, I agree with the building coordination signage, but the metal fire escape, it's existing part of the building.

1132
01:25:16,663 --> 01:25:18,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It was happening before we leave the building.

1133
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:26,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, do you realize this is a hearing that will depend whether this council supports us or not?

1134
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:31,396
[SPEAKER_11]: A city engineer is requesting that this be one of the stipulations.

1135
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:32,217
[SPEAKER_11]: You understand that, right?

1136
01:25:33,838 --> 01:25:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean if you guys want to include it because but in this case if you if some deterioration happened to it We are liable to fix it because we are leasing the building triple net So we are liable of fixing any item in the building that could cause any hazard to the public Yeah, I mean

1137
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:06,386
[SPEAKER_04]: We can maintain it, but when our lease expire, we're not responsible for the metal fire escape after that.

1138
01:26:07,547 --> 01:26:09,028
[SPEAKER_16]: We have Chris Schultz on the call.

1139
01:26:10,769 --> 01:26:11,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1140
01:26:13,031 --> 01:26:14,973
[SPEAKER_16]: From LR Construction.

1141
01:26:15,553 --> 01:26:16,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm here too.

1142
01:26:16,233 --> 01:26:16,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1143
01:26:17,775 --> 01:26:19,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address of the record, please.

1144
01:26:21,618 --> 01:26:25,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Schultz, 346 Lake Street in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.

1145
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1146
01:26:28,407 --> 01:26:33,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris, I think there's a, maybe you could enlighten us about the fire escape issue.

1147
01:26:33,551 --> 01:26:41,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a lot of these comments were brought up by the city engineer in our approval process for this job.

1148
01:26:41,978 --> 01:26:44,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them, they have nothing to do with the work that we're doing.

1149
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:48,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just these, all these comments were addressed or brought up.

1150
01:26:50,245 --> 01:26:55,269
[SPEAKER_05]: As armor said, their existing conditions that have nothing with this job that we're trying to get completed.

1151
01:26:56,733 --> 01:27:00,096
[SPEAKER_05]: So why are you bringing it up?

1152
01:27:00,136 --> 01:27:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't feel the need to bring it up.

1153
01:27:02,398 --> 01:27:05,460
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the stuff that was brought up in our review by the city.

1154
01:27:08,662 --> 01:27:13,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying, I'm just, I don't know.

1155
01:27:17,209 --> 01:27:20,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I can clarify more if you allow me to share my screen.

1156
01:27:20,672 --> 01:27:23,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a picture of the building with the fire escape.

1157
01:27:24,818 --> 01:27:38,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys can see it is that Citizen Bank hired LR Construction to build a ramp on the front of the branch and the landing based on a registered architect drawing.

1158
01:27:39,986 --> 01:27:43,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the scope of work that we requesting approval on.

1159
01:27:45,108 --> 01:27:52,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe like the engineer, when they went over there, they find existing enroachment and they incorporated on this hearing.

1160
01:27:54,993 --> 01:28:03,379
[SPEAKER_04]: does not relate to the scope of work that has been noted in the beginning of the petition, which is scope of work at front entrance is as follows.

1161
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Demo existing sidewalk, three section, install new ADA compliant landing and ramp, install new ADA compliant handrail around landing along the ramp.

1162
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:17,331
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all what we're doing.

1163
01:28:18,311 --> 01:28:21,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Item number two, it's pointing existing condition.

1164
01:28:23,144 --> 01:28:28,930
[SPEAKER_04]: been built like from day one from the building, except of course, time, which is maybe.

1165
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no problem.

1166
01:28:32,781 --> 01:28:45,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, the city engineer isn't on the call, and as I'm reading this, our city engineer division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situate for as long as they remain in good condition.

1167
01:28:46,244 --> 01:28:49,364
[SPEAKER_11]: If they fall into disrepair or poor condition, the city will revoke the license.

1168
01:28:49,865 --> 01:28:55,326
[SPEAKER_11]: The existing encroachment includes a metal fire escape building and sign attached to the building.

1169
01:28:56,046 --> 01:29:00,612
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're saying that, um, so I just want to make sure we're clear on this.

1170
01:29:00,632 --> 01:29:06,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're saying that citizens bank does not agree with number two and will not.

1171
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:11,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, no, I'm clarifying that the metal fire escape, it is not.

1172
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,473
[SPEAKER_04]: something new we're building.

1173
01:29:13,773 --> 01:29:21,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's existing, and for item number two, the engineer is giving us direction as a council.

1174
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:30,741
[SPEAKER_11]: These are steps that the engineer is giving us that you would abide by, so we would give you this permit.

1175
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:31,922
[SPEAKER_11]: We would allow this to happen.

1176
01:29:31,942 --> 01:29:33,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you understand what we're saying?

1177
01:29:34,683 --> 01:30:00,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah 100% I'm not agreeing with his comment where we need to maintain it in good condition So I'm agreeing with that He's saying that yeah already on the building and it is in good repair so if it does correct They will have to fix it

1178
01:30:01,975 --> 01:30:05,256
[SPEAKER_04]: We, Citizen Bank, will have to fix it as long as we are leasing the building.

1179
01:30:06,056 --> 01:30:07,236
[SPEAKER_11]: If I understand that correctly.

1180
01:30:07,596 --> 01:30:16,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, but I'm understanding that Mr. Salaam said that they do not support what that is because that is... He's saying that that's not part of his scope of work.

1181
01:30:16,939 --> 01:30:18,319
[SPEAKER_16]: He's only doing the sidewalk.

1182
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:20,319
[SPEAKER_16]: He's not touching the fire extinguishers.

1183
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:21,940
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the fire escape.

1184
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:24,800
[SPEAKER_16]: All he's doing is a sidewalk and ABA.

1185
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to yield to my fellow consultants.

1186
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:28,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'm overthinking this.

1187
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:29,281
[SPEAKER_16]: If I understand that right.

1188
01:30:29,301 --> 01:30:31,402
[SPEAKER_21]: If I'm correct, though, with this paper here,

1189
01:30:33,089 --> 01:30:37,290
[SPEAKER_21]: These are the recommendations for approval by the city engineer.

1190
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:54,394
[SPEAKER_16]: So the papers here, these are the recommendations that he's basically- The engineer has said that as long as these things remain in good condition, which the fire escape is one of them, they will be allowed to keep their license.

1191
01:30:55,494 --> 01:30:57,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And Citizen Bank will agree with that.

1192
01:30:58,323 --> 01:31:02,626
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not Citizens Bank's concerns, it's the landlord's concerns.

1193
01:31:03,406 --> 01:31:06,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So obviously, so they're not taking responsibility for that, if that happens.

1194
01:31:07,068 --> 01:31:07,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I confused with that?

1195
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:13,212
[SPEAKER_16]: No, these are already on the building, the existing encroachments.

1196
01:31:13,653 --> 01:31:15,274
[SPEAKER_11]: What he's saying is- It's not a question, Ricky.

1197
01:31:15,714 --> 01:31:17,415
[SPEAKER_11]: This stuff is already there.

1198
01:31:17,915 --> 01:31:23,599
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that, but if the petitioner just said, this is what I'm getting at, he said that

1199
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,921
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a disagreement with the landlord.

1200
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:28,382
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the landlord's responsibility.

1201
01:31:28,622 --> 01:31:30,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the landlord's not here for this permit.

1202
01:31:31,003 --> 01:31:35,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Citizens Bank, if they're not gonna take responsibility for this, then they're not gonna support this.

1203
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you understand what I'm saying?

1204
01:31:37,046 --> 01:31:38,887
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

1205
01:31:38,947 --> 01:31:39,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, sir.

1206
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:43,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna take responsibility for it as long we are leasing the building.

1207
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: If they move out, it's not their responsibility.

1208
01:31:49,752 --> 01:31:52,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would you bring up the landlord?

1209
01:31:52,053 --> 01:31:53,294
[SPEAKER_11]: What would this council need that for?

1210
01:31:58,093 --> 01:32:15,884
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not we were maintaining the building any Deterioration to fire escape or any other item within the building or outside of the building is the citizen bank responsibility As long as we are leasing the building So you agree with that?

1211
01:32:16,545 --> 01:32:21,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes How is that so difficult

1212
01:32:22,327 --> 01:32:22,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1213
01:32:23,047 --> 01:32:27,530
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just want to clarify that the metal fire escape was existing structure from the building originally.

1214
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:31,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't part of the project, but we are maintaining it.

1215
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:32,453
[SPEAKER_04]: We know.

1216
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:32,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1217
01:32:33,013 --> 01:32:33,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1218
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:33,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1219
01:32:34,254 --> 01:32:35,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1220
01:32:36,215 --> 01:32:37,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four, we agree with it.

1221
01:32:38,036 --> 01:32:39,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five, we agree with it.

1222
01:32:41,177 --> 01:32:45,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Number six, we agree with it.

1223
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:49,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Number seven, we kind of like

1224
01:32:51,202 --> 01:33:03,530
[SPEAKER_04]: don't agree with it because we notice other property within the township have ramp and landing, and I don't believe that the township charging fee for it.

1225
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:09,873
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, our lease, we pay in taxes, all the taxes required for the building.

1226
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:13,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Slavkin, Councilor Falco has a question.

1227
01:33:13,636 --> 01:33:14,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1228
01:33:14,676 --> 01:33:17,578
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a question for Ghalam.

1229
01:33:18,038 --> 01:33:18,959
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe last time we

1230
01:33:19,948 --> 01:33:23,351
[SPEAKER_21]: In the last meeting, we asked for some guidance on, I think, point number seven.

1231
01:33:23,451 --> 01:33:27,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, and Ellen Bourdeaux is on the line to give us some guidance for that.

1232
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:30,817
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, if we could hear from Ellen with regards to point number seven, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1233
01:33:30,877 --> 01:33:32,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Ellen, please?

1234
01:33:32,178 --> 01:33:34,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if she's still muted.

1235
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:47,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Ellen, can you give us some guidance on a reasonable fee that should be charged by the city for this?

1236
01:33:47,768 --> 01:33:54,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, good evening Councilors and I apologize for the mute thing I have a three year old grandson being very vocal in the background.

1237
01:33:54,233 --> 01:34:03,560
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, I, I apologize that I'm probably not going to give you the information that you want to hear this evening, um, I received this request.

1238
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:09,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Prior to going on vacation I came back from vacation this week from, and I did provide.

1239
01:34:10,948 --> 01:34:17,610
[SPEAKER_19]: the mayor's office, and then Adam had contacted me this evening, earlier today for my notes.

1240
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:20,612
[SPEAKER_19]: I have reviewed the parcel.

1241
01:34:22,232 --> 01:34:29,475
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have market data that would support providing an estimate of the cost to rent 108 square foot sidewalk.

1242
01:34:29,775 --> 01:34:38,058
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't gather market data on the value of sidewalks, roadways, or anything that's used as a public right of way.

1243
01:34:38,998 --> 01:34:49,953
[SPEAKER_19]: And honestly, for me to do some wild guess number, I would be guessing at something that I, you know, I'd be in violation of Uniswap.

1244
01:34:50,854 --> 01:34:53,137
[SPEAKER_19]: So I truly cannot give you a number of what

1245
01:34:54,263 --> 01:34:55,604
[SPEAKER_19]: that kind of what that would be.

1246
01:34:56,485 --> 01:35:12,639
[SPEAKER_19]: And the best guidance I could say would, if that's something that the city council wanted to pursue would be to find an appraiser that has expertise and valuing that would not be an easy thing to do but I'm sure there's probably somebody out there that could offer some kind of number.

1247
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:16,642
[SPEAKER_19]: And, and that's really all I can can add to that.

1248
01:35:17,918 --> 01:35:21,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Ellen, is this a common practice in other cities to rent the sidewalk?

1249
01:35:22,462 --> 01:35:29,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Not, I contacted other peers, certainly I only call on three, I've just got back from vacation.

1250
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:35,535
[SPEAKER_19]: They do not have any data in their communities of knowledge of renting sidewalk space.

1251
01:35:36,155 --> 01:35:37,276
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a public right of way.

1252
01:35:41,062 --> 01:35:47,804
[SPEAKER_19]: I was kind of, like I said, I received this right before vacation, so I apologize for not getting back to city council earlier.

1253
01:35:47,844 --> 01:35:49,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I just returned yesterday.

1254
01:35:49,185 --> 01:35:53,766
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not, yeah.

1255
01:35:54,366 --> 01:35:54,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

1256
01:35:55,587 --> 01:36:06,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Ellen, do you think that if we were to just decide on some sort of nominal flat fee, that that would be an irresponsible decision or would it be, you know,

1257
01:36:07,568 --> 01:36:11,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really feel like we have to go the route of getting this area appraised?

1258
01:36:13,491 --> 01:36:18,694
[SPEAKER_19]: I would ask, you have members that have been with this council much longer than I've been with the city.

1259
01:36:19,354 --> 01:36:25,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this a practice that does the city have, is the city leasing this type of space to anyone else today?

1260
01:36:25,717 --> 01:36:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: My understanding is it's a unique situation.

1261
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:29,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1262
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:29,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1263
01:36:32,519 --> 01:36:36,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I truly, I wouldn't know how to advise you on that.

1264
01:36:36,821 --> 01:36:37,521
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize.

1265
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:39,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

1266
01:36:39,682 --> 01:36:40,443
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1267
01:36:41,503 --> 01:36:45,945
[SPEAKER_21]: When I look at this here, this is a recommendation that has been made by the city engineer.

1268
01:36:46,285 --> 01:36:53,028
[SPEAKER_21]: So the city engineer must know of some community that is taking this type of action currently.

1269
01:36:54,389 --> 01:36:56,350
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we need to either reach back to him

1270
01:36:56,873 --> 01:37:09,398
[SPEAKER_21]: and find out what community is going through this process and how do they arrive at the fee that they charge the particular company in that city or town.

1271
01:37:11,019 --> 01:37:12,180
[SPEAKER_21]: He must have come up with this somehow.

1272
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,780
[SPEAKER_21]: It must be done in other cities and towns.

1273
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,862
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to get more information with regard to how much we should be charging.

1274
01:37:19,963 --> 01:37:20,683
[SPEAKER_21]: If you guys allow me,

1275
01:37:26,533 --> 01:37:27,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott.

1276
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:31,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is such a big issue because I have also reached.

1277
01:37:31,459 --> 01:37:38,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I did talk to a few residents that welcome the ramp because, uh, you know, handicapped accessible.

1278
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:44,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very important, but I think it's unfinished business between the petitioner and the city engineer.

1279
01:37:45,055 --> 01:38:03,406
[SPEAKER_11]: uh I think it might behoove us that both parties that we table this so we get further clarification so this possibly could go to no vote which would then extend this longer than we should so I don't know if um if that might be the course I just put it out to my colleagues to to

1280
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:18,584
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe contemplate that without the engineer being here with the assessor really not gauging, you know, the understanding of this as much as we should right now, because understandable factors.

1281
01:38:20,245 --> 01:38:24,848
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I don't, I see the sides on both sides.

1282
01:38:25,128 --> 01:38:26,989
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a city sidewalk.

1283
01:38:27,209 --> 01:38:31,772
[SPEAKER_11]: It's taking land that not everybody will now traverse because it's being,

1284
01:38:33,378 --> 01:38:35,921
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, handicap ramp, which I think it's very important.

1285
01:38:35,941 --> 01:38:42,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that I want to move this forward, but I just want to make sure that, you know, there seems some discrepancies and some, uh,

1286
01:38:43,963 --> 01:38:47,685
[SPEAKER_11]: to be gone, but the negotiations shouldn't be done at this level.

1287
01:38:48,106 --> 01:38:54,670
[SPEAKER_11]: This should be done by the city engineer who are the professionals in this situation with our city administration, the council.

1288
01:38:54,710 --> 01:39:05,858
[SPEAKER_11]: So I truly think we should table this and until we get this information that Mr. Salam and his team sit together with the engineer and the city administration to clean up these fine issues.

1289
01:39:05,918 --> 01:39:09,240
[SPEAKER_11]: So this isn't in jeopardy of failing this evening.

1290
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys allow me,

1291
01:39:14,636 --> 01:39:16,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1292
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:20,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an architect for 30 years and a project manager for 15 years.

1293
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:27,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been doing this project, I'm running the program for the ADA, for Citizen Bank for the past six years.

1294
01:39:28,126 --> 01:39:33,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been done work in Pennsylvania, like over 250 branches, Philadelphia, Central City.

1295
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:37,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have the same situation when we approach the township.

1296
01:39:38,553 --> 01:39:41,515
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as not intervening with the path of the public,

1297
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:47,922
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, it maintaining the building, there was no other option for us to make it accessible in the building.

1298
01:39:48,642 --> 01:39:50,983
[SPEAKER_04]: They approve it, they give us a variance, they never charge us.

1299
01:39:51,283 --> 01:40:03,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, next to your township, West Medford, one of our branches, the landlord, we designed it, we find the issue over there, and the landlord approached the township, he got the permit and built it.

1300
01:40:03,948 --> 01:40:05,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no charge to the landlord.

1301
01:40:06,589 --> 01:40:08,590
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, I built at least like 10 or

1302
01:40:09,747 --> 01:40:16,912
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 ramp like this in our building in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where it was infeasible to do the ADA compliance through the lobby.

1303
01:40:17,713 --> 01:40:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use the city sidewalk and they never charge us.

1304
01:40:21,495 --> 01:40:23,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a public service to make the building accessible.

1305
01:40:24,277 --> 01:40:26,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially we have this issue with the old building.

1306
01:40:26,939 --> 01:40:37,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They were never designed all before like the 2000 or 1999 was concept of making the building accessible to challenge persons.

1307
01:40:38,765 --> 01:40:39,305
[SPEAKER_04]: and seniors.

1308
01:40:39,766 --> 01:40:41,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what citizen bank doing now.

1309
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:44,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We're running the entire program along our entire portfolio.

1310
01:40:45,309 --> 01:40:50,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And we try, we are making it compliant based on the new code for the AD.

1311
01:40:50,493 --> 01:40:58,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, before we had option to make it one entrance only compliant, but now require 60% of the entrance to be compliant.

1312
01:40:59,159 --> 01:41:01,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And with two entrances mean a hundred percent compliant.

1313
01:41:03,822 --> 01:41:05,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I talked to Tim, yes.

1314
01:41:07,277 --> 01:41:10,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you can finish your sentence Mr. Salama when you talk to Tim.

1315
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:23,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to Tim and I pointed out to him about the issue of the fee because we are, as I mentioned, we are leasing the property triple net so we are liable to pay all the required taxes for the property.

1316
01:41:24,809 --> 01:41:30,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to him that in other communities, we built this we take the variance as long as the ramp and the sidewalk.

1317
01:41:31,523 --> 01:41:35,684
[SPEAKER_04]: is no, there is any conflict and everything is moving with a public path.

1318
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:38,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's plus it's a public service to the public.

1319
01:41:38,545 --> 01:41:42,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like for our special purpose, the customer will still come from all entrants anyway.

1320
01:41:44,267 --> 01:41:49,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And I pointed out to him like this project started in 2019.

1321
01:41:50,368 --> 01:41:56,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of this been dragging across Citizen Bank so far, way beyond the project cause that we started and

1322
01:41:57,504 --> 01:42:00,486
[SPEAKER_04]: The cost of the ramp and the landing, it costs between $25,000.

1323
01:42:00,606 --> 01:42:08,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs us way more than that for me bringing the consultant in the meetings, preparing the document.

1324
01:42:08,712 --> 01:42:09,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to point it out.

1325
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:14,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Salaam, you mentioned West Medford.

1326
01:42:16,137 --> 01:42:18,959
[SPEAKER_03]: When was that project completed?

1327
01:42:18,979 --> 01:42:21,121
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like 2019.

1328
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:24,991
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of years ago.

1329
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:26,312
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when that ramp was installed?

1330
01:42:26,532 --> 01:42:26,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1331
01:42:26,992 --> 01:42:27,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1332
01:42:27,513 --> 01:42:27,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1333
01:42:27,893 --> 01:42:28,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Ramp and a landing.

1334
01:42:28,674 --> 01:42:35,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually it's a little bit bigger than ours and the sidewalk is less than this location.

1335
01:42:35,459 --> 01:42:38,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that should have... West Medford is part of Medford.

1336
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:43,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was the process when that project was approved?

1337
01:42:44,246 --> 01:42:52,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a part of my project, but the landlord decided to do the exterior under his scope of work.

1338
01:42:53,664 --> 01:43:03,711
[SPEAKER_04]: because the exterior is part of his scope of work, our lease, so he developed a growing approach, a township, got the permit, built it up, and we inspected a citizen bank.

1339
01:43:04,392 --> 01:43:06,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's compliant, we agreed, and that's it.

1340
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:11,938
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and I mean, I meant also to my fellow councilors, did that come before the council?

1341
01:43:12,198 --> 01:43:13,779
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not recall that coming before the council.

1342
01:43:13,799 --> 01:43:15,120
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember that.

1343
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,201
[SPEAKER_16]: It never came before the council.

1344
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:18,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be fine having, I mean, I think,

1345
01:43:19,659 --> 01:43:26,506
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Mr. Salam, are you in agreement with everything, the exception of six and seven, which should be the renewal fee?

1346
01:43:26,526 --> 01:43:26,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

1347
01:43:26,766 --> 01:43:28,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah.

1348
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:31,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything else we're complying with, everything I agree with.

1349
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:37,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We have registered architect, LI construction, Chris did like dig safe for the site.

1350
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:40,620
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the item below, we agree on it and we're confirming it.

1351
01:43:41,188 --> 01:43:41,948
[SPEAKER_11]: know exists.

1352
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:42,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1353
01:43:42,409 --> 01:43:44,110
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are we trying to do here?

1354
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:50,393
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have Mr. President, I would say, you know, number six, I would be fine with it be five years or something.

1355
01:43:50,413 --> 01:43:54,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Number seven, I'm taking early but at this point, yeah, I mean, you know, again, I hate to tie this guy up.

1356
01:43:55,036 --> 01:43:56,537
[SPEAKER_16]: They want to get the work done.

1357
01:43:56,957 --> 01:43:59,358
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they're doing their work.

1358
01:43:59,518 --> 01:44:00,939
[SPEAKER_11]: We're setting precedent right now.

1359
01:44:01,419 --> 01:44:03,621
[SPEAKER_11]: This council setting precedent something we don't know.

1360
01:44:04,596 --> 01:44:06,137
[SPEAKER_11]: know that we've never done before.

1361
01:44:06,217 --> 01:44:09,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need guidance and we don't have anyone right now.

1362
01:44:09,259 --> 01:44:10,100
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have the engineer.

1363
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:16,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Our assessor has just told us that there's not enough time right now to get the information that she needs to help us with this.

1364
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:25,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand West Medford, but I also know that Salem Street encompasses a lot more of the sidewalk.

1365
01:44:25,269 --> 01:44:27,370
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a smaller sidewalk than it was in West Medford.

1366
01:44:27,731 --> 01:44:28,951
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a longer sidewalk.

1367
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:29,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

1368
01:44:30,813 --> 01:44:31,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1369
01:44:32,363 --> 01:44:33,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1370
01:44:34,444 --> 01:44:40,326
[SPEAKER_06]: The petitioner just mentioned variance, and we as a body do not issue variances.

1371
01:44:40,986 --> 01:44:43,968
[SPEAKER_06]: That is done by the Zoning Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1372
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is not something that's under our purview.

1373
01:44:46,669 --> 01:44:54,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So if something was done in West Medford through a variance, it's possible that it never made its way to the Medford City Council.

1374
01:44:55,472 --> 01:44:58,273
[SPEAKER_06]: This request is for a petition for a grant of location.

1375
01:44:58,913 --> 01:45:00,657
[SPEAKER_06]: which would be approved by this council.

1376
01:45:01,198 --> 01:45:04,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it is a matter of how this was presented.

1377
01:45:04,705 --> 01:45:10,596
[SPEAKER_06]: The original one in West Method was presented as a variance and that was voted on by a separate board and commission.

1378
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:23,167
[SPEAKER_06]: and this one is being presented differently, I don't know, but it doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President, because Mr. Salaam just mentioned a variance and we have nothing to do with variances.

1379
01:45:23,908 --> 01:45:30,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And regarding Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and everywhere else, to be quite frank with you, that's not the city of Medford.

1380
01:45:31,433 --> 01:45:34,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my opinion, if you're gonna use public land, you should pay.

1381
01:45:35,735 --> 01:45:36,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my own opinion.

1382
01:45:37,563 --> 01:45:46,009
[SPEAKER_06]: If I wanted to build a porch, Mr. President, on my house, and it was one inch on a public sidewalk, one inch, it would not be approved.

1383
01:45:46,629 --> 01:45:48,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It would not be approved.

1384
01:45:49,331 --> 01:45:55,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think to sit back and say that they don't pay in other areas and this and that, that's up to them.

1385
01:45:56,396 --> 01:45:59,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But in this city, Mr. President, if you're going to use public land,

1386
01:45:59,935 --> 01:46:01,236
[SPEAKER_06]: for private entity.

1387
01:46:01,616 --> 01:46:08,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Since when is it our responsibility to make sure a citizen's bank has proper ADA compliance?

1388
01:46:09,282 --> 01:46:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not our responsibility.

1389
01:46:10,563 --> 01:46:14,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We're willing to work with them, Mr. President, but it's not our responsibility.

1390
01:46:15,918 --> 01:46:18,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there has to be some give and take here.

1391
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:35,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And my question, Mr. President, if we could, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli and my other council colleagues that this probably should be sent back, but definitely, Mr. President, we should find out regarding what West Medford, how it was approved.

1392
01:46:35,627 --> 01:46:41,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it approved by a petition for grant the location or was it approved by a variance?

1393
01:46:42,482 --> 01:46:45,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's key if we move forward on this.

1394
01:46:45,605 --> 01:46:47,446
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't answer this question.

1395
01:46:47,466 --> 01:46:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

1396
01:46:48,227 --> 01:46:50,669
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would make that, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.

1397
01:47:00,036 --> 01:47:00,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry.

1398
01:47:00,776 --> 01:47:01,297
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1399
01:47:01,577 --> 01:47:01,857
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1400
01:47:01,937 --> 01:47:03,038
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to say thank you.

1401
01:47:03,138 --> 01:47:04,258
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli.

1402
01:47:04,278 --> 01:47:06,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it may seem like this is a simple one off.

1403
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:08,521
[SPEAKER_23]: But what we're doing right now is setting precedent.

1404
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:15,745
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we don't get this right this time, the next time a petitioner comes before us, they're going to cite this case for their reason for why they're doing something a certain way.

1405
01:47:15,825 --> 01:47:17,046
[SPEAKER_23]: So we need to get it right.

1406
01:47:17,066 --> 01:47:18,907
[SPEAKER_23]: And I agree with Councilor Marks that this is

1407
01:47:19,706 --> 01:47:23,890
[SPEAKER_23]: this is a public right of way, and we need to treat it as such and figure out the right way to do this.

1408
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:25,911
[SPEAKER_23]: And if that's charging, then that's charging.

1409
01:47:26,752 --> 01:47:32,557
[SPEAKER_23]: But I agree that I don't think we should move on this without just insight from our city engineer at this point.

1410
01:47:33,397 --> 01:47:39,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I would add, if possible, to the motion that, I don't know, Engineer McGivern

1411
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:51,649
[SPEAKER_03]: asked us to come up with the renewal period and the fee, I would actually ask that he make a proposal for what might be reasonable, and we could consider that as part of sending it back.

1412
01:47:51,749 --> 01:47:52,510
[SPEAKER_03]: With the assessor.

1413
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:53,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

1414
01:47:53,631 --> 01:47:55,953
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so the chair waives the motion.

1415
01:47:56,434 --> 01:47:57,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, let's vote on these motions.

1416
01:47:59,496 --> 01:48:01,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I add one thing, if I have a quick second.

1417
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:03,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.

1418
01:48:04,803 --> 01:48:11,935
[SPEAKER_05]: In regards to the comment about Tim, the engineer, what the last person just said, it is correct.

1419
01:48:11,975 --> 01:48:13,498
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the one who brought this up to you guys.

1420
01:48:13,558 --> 01:48:15,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if he can actually advise on.

1421
01:48:16,892 --> 01:48:21,576
[SPEAKER_05]: and what to recommend for the situation, because I know he was looking to you guys for guidance on that.

1422
01:48:23,057 --> 01:48:24,918
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might just be going back around in a circle here.

1423
01:48:25,179 --> 01:48:33,625
[SPEAKER_05]: But in regards to the comment about if you go one inch into the sidewalk from your house, the city might say no.

1424
01:48:33,645 --> 01:48:37,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's more like extending your house.

1425
01:48:38,229 --> 01:48:39,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a public sidewalk.

1426
01:48:39,911 --> 01:48:40,611
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just making it 80.

1427
01:48:41,612 --> 01:48:44,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The building isn't extending to get more square footage so they have more,

1428
01:48:45,575 --> 01:48:46,636
[SPEAKER_05]: office space on the inside.

1429
01:48:46,956 --> 01:48:50,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just to upgrade the sidewalks to make it safer.

1430
01:48:50,657 --> 01:48:59,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're doing, we were doing a little give and take back and forth, we agreed to replace additional damaged concrete sidewalk sections around it, making the whole area safer.

1431
01:48:59,962 --> 01:49:03,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a, you know, we'll help you guys out.

1432
01:49:03,083 --> 01:49:06,245
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll replace more sidewalk if we're allowed to put the ramp out front.

1433
01:49:07,793 --> 01:49:08,053
[SPEAKER_05]: was it?

1434
01:49:08,093 --> 01:49:09,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not extending the building.

1435
01:49:09,254 --> 01:49:16,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just we're making this the city's safer and we're going to replace panels around it to make the entire sidewalls because it is it is in rough shape.

1436
01:49:20,942 --> 01:49:25,706
[SPEAKER_11]: If I can, Mr. President, I know that I'd like to vote on the motion, so it is out.

1437
01:49:25,726 --> 01:49:27,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I truly think, you know, we

1438
01:49:29,127 --> 01:49:31,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the gentleman said, I think we get everybody involved.

1439
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,213
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to go in circles, but we think we bring Tim.

1440
01:49:34,733 --> 01:49:36,055
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the city assessor.

1441
01:49:36,115 --> 01:49:37,796
[SPEAKER_11]: We have city administration.

1442
01:49:37,917 --> 01:49:41,540
[SPEAKER_11]: We bring in, you know, even the ADA compliance officer.

1443
01:49:41,561 --> 01:49:44,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's important that he's here right now.

1444
01:49:44,103 --> 01:49:49,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we get all these answers, these questions answered because it does, it is important.

1445
01:49:49,869 --> 01:49:50,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's,

1446
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:57,103
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, not the idea is very important, but I think the process has to be done the right way.

1447
01:49:57,203 --> 01:50:03,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So this council doesn't set precedent for something that's leading us in a bad path moving forward.

1448
01:50:03,767 --> 01:50:06,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, you know, if I can.

1449
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:08,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I understand.

1450
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:08,989
[SPEAKER_11]: We understand.

1451
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:11,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1452
01:50:11,331 --> 01:50:13,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to table?

1453
01:50:13,892 --> 01:50:15,093
[SPEAKER_16]: We've motioned to table.

1454
01:50:15,253 --> 01:50:16,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Our motions won't fall out, correct?

1455
01:50:17,474 --> 01:50:19,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table until we

1456
01:50:21,391 --> 01:50:43,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to I'm going to motion the table and, um, have the if we can ask promotion that we have the city engineer, the ADA officer and the city sister and the city administration work together to try to find, um, uh, common ground so we can, uh,

1457
01:50:44,213 --> 01:50:48,456
[SPEAKER_11]: not chase the tail all day, so we can get this project moving forward.

1458
01:50:48,476 --> 01:50:54,079
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's a delay, but I don't wanna go to a vote, the vote's no, and then we can't bring this up for a long time.

1459
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:56,881
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can do that, I vote to table.

1460
01:50:57,161 --> 01:50:57,681
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President?

1461
01:50:58,422 --> 01:50:58,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1462
01:50:59,142 --> 01:51:02,024
[SPEAKER_21]: So if I may, Councilor Scarpelli, through you to Councilor Scarpelli.

1463
01:51:02,044 --> 01:51:07,928
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're looking for specific recommendations for 0.6 and 0.7 from our city engineer?

1464
01:51:08,068 --> 01:51:08,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1465
01:51:08,688 --> 01:51:08,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Perfect.

1466
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:10,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And while we're there, I personally,

1467
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:15,311
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, for my edification to get the understanding of point number two.

1468
01:51:15,811 --> 01:51:22,172
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a little bit clearer in my eyes, you know, but my thing is moving past two, six and seven, we need that clarification.

1469
01:51:22,312 --> 01:51:23,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Perfect, thank you.

1470
01:51:23,572 --> 01:51:33,114
[SPEAKER_16]: And so on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to table this until the engineer makes his recommendations on number two, six and seven.

1471
01:51:33,134 --> 01:51:35,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it.

1472
01:51:38,309 --> 01:51:50,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to repeat your motion back with the clerk?

1473
01:51:50,915 --> 01:51:51,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't variance.

1474
01:51:52,035 --> 01:51:54,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was variance for West Medford.

1475
01:51:55,057 --> 01:51:56,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It was handled by the landlord.

1476
01:51:57,378 --> 01:52:00,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus there's multiple other sites within the township.

1477
01:52:00,059 --> 01:52:01,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably you guys have the same thing.

1478
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:02,640
So

1479
01:52:08,459 --> 01:52:13,362
[SPEAKER_16]: on the motion by, on the motion table by Councilor Scarpelli as amended.

1480
01:52:15,043 --> 01:52:25,730
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to put it in with his or you want to report it out as amended by Councilor Marks on how the project of West Bedford was completed.

1481
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:29,292
[SPEAKER_06]: If it never came before the council, I don't recall it coming before the council.

1482
01:52:31,654 --> 01:52:31,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

1483
01:52:32,334 --> 01:52:33,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Second by Councilor Bears.

1484
01:52:33,435 --> 01:52:34,115
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor.

1485
01:52:34,596 --> 01:52:34,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1486
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,954
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1487
01:52:39,516 --> 01:52:42,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1488
01:52:45,182 --> 01:52:45,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1489
01:52:45,943 --> 01:52:46,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1490
01:52:46,563 --> 01:52:54,552
[SPEAKER_16]: 21457, petition for a grant of location, national grid, north end of Massachusetts, location of underground electrical condoms.

1491
01:52:56,134 --> 01:52:57,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I hear notified?

1492
01:52:58,303 --> 01:53:07,545
[SPEAKER_16]: that by order of the Medford City Council, the Council of the Medford City Council will hold a public hearing in Howard Hall left chambers at Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Henson Drive, Medford.

1493
01:53:08,186 --> 01:53:13,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And- President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading and just to give a brief synopsis.

1494
01:53:13,827 --> 01:53:16,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have anybody here from National Grid?

1495
01:53:16,028 --> 01:53:17,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me, thank you, sir.

1496
01:53:20,429 --> 01:53:24,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna vote to waive the motion on the table.

1497
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:30,960
[SPEAKER_16]: We deal on the motion by Council Marks to waive the reading seconded by Council Mayors.

1498
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:31,620
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor.

1499
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:32,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1500
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:32,600
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed.

1501
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:33,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1502
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:34,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, sir.

1503
01:53:34,301 --> 01:53:35,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address of the record, please.

1504
01:53:35,501 --> 01:53:36,361
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, councillors.

1505
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:37,862
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Moses Okokoro.

1506
01:53:38,042 --> 01:53:39,822
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here from National Grid Electric.

1507
01:53:40,582 --> 01:53:43,463
[SPEAKER_20]: My address is 170 Medford Street in Malden.

1508
01:53:44,264 --> 01:53:47,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you give us a brief synopsis of this project?

1509
01:53:48,505 --> 01:53:55,327
[SPEAKER_20]: So National Grid is petitioning to install two four-inch conduits from my existing manhole on the sidewalk towards the building.

1510
01:53:56,971 --> 01:54:03,616
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so basically we, I've actually indicated here though, the conduit length would be approximately seven feet.

1511
01:54:04,316 --> 01:54:10,981
[SPEAKER_20]: But after we submitted the petition, we did a manhole survey and we'll be hitting the building from a different angle.

1512
01:54:11,001 --> 01:54:20,548
[SPEAKER_20]: So potentially that may increase to not something significantly different, but probably about 10 feet from an existing manhole to the building.

1513
01:54:20,929 --> 01:54:24,051
[SPEAKER_20]: This is for the purpose of providing the electric service to that customer.

1514
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:25,452
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1515
01:54:27,415 --> 01:54:28,676
[SPEAKER_16]: You have questions for the gentleman?

1516
01:54:30,236 --> 01:54:32,537
[SPEAKER_16]: It's present.

1517
01:54:33,258 --> 01:54:35,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, one second.

1518
01:54:35,999 --> 01:54:37,360
[SPEAKER_16]: You are in favor of the project, correct?

1519
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:39,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, sir.

1520
01:54:39,761 --> 01:54:41,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone else in favor of the project?

1521
01:54:42,242 --> 01:54:43,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, sir.

1522
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:46,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing many more, is there anyone here opposed to the project?

1523
01:54:48,785 --> 01:54:51,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing none, we motion that by the hearing closed.

1524
01:54:51,506 --> 01:54:53,908
[SPEAKER_16]: So, sure, if you can come back here.

1525
01:54:55,783 --> 01:55:01,530
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have the conditions by the engineer in the back here?

1526
01:55:02,591 --> 01:55:03,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I saw the conditions.

1527
01:55:05,855 --> 01:55:06,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have questions for the gentleman?

1528
01:55:07,617 --> 01:55:08,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco.

1529
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:08,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1530
01:55:08,999 --> 01:55:10,941
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a couple of quick questions.

1531
01:55:10,981 --> 01:55:15,867
[SPEAKER_21]: The first being, if this is approved, when will the work begin and how long will it take?

1532
01:55:18,379 --> 01:55:21,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Potentially, I mean, it shouldn't take more than one day's worth of work.

1533
01:55:22,462 --> 01:55:31,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, and as soon as it's approved, we will ask our civil contractor to get the permits and we can start almost immediately.

1534
01:55:32,469 --> 01:55:32,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1535
01:55:32,969 --> 01:55:35,211
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome, sir.

1536
01:55:35,851 --> 01:55:36,111
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1537
01:55:36,131 --> 01:55:37,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bass.

1538
01:55:38,413 --> 01:55:44,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of the sidewalk, the new sidewalk has not gone in yet, so is that correct?

1539
01:55:45,618 --> 01:55:49,339
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure, I've not been to that location for a while.

1540
01:55:49,399 --> 01:55:54,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but if it has, and you have to dig it up, you'll replace with concrete, correct?

1541
01:55:54,761 --> 01:55:55,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, definitely, we will.

1542
01:55:55,902 --> 01:55:56,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1543
01:55:56,562 --> 01:55:56,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1544
01:55:58,403 --> 01:55:59,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further questions for the gentleman?

1545
01:55:59,583 --> 01:56:04,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so, Chair, what's the motion?

1546
01:56:04,445 --> 01:56:12,448
[SPEAKER_06]: At this time, I would ask that we amend the petition to include what the petitioner just mentioned, that it's not seven feet, it's 10 feet.

1547
01:56:13,635 --> 01:56:18,940
[SPEAKER_06]: and that reflected in the approval by the city engineers, he also refers to seven feet.

1548
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:21,222
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's 10 feet, not seven.

1549
01:56:21,502 --> 01:56:27,567
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I mean, it may still be seven feet, you know, it may, I mean, increase to 10 feet.

1550
01:56:27,907 --> 01:56:39,837
[SPEAKER_20]: The issue is, when we did like a manhole survey, they actually discovered the underground submersible transformers will not allow them to go in the direction we intended to go.

1551
01:56:40,395 --> 01:56:42,275
[SPEAKER_20]: So now they want to go from a different angle.

1552
01:56:42,355 --> 01:56:46,917
[SPEAKER_20]: They are not sure what they will do until they get the civil contract on board.

1553
01:56:47,457 --> 01:56:50,557
[SPEAKER_20]: So what I'm saying basically, it may increase to about 10 feet.

1554
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:52,018
[SPEAKER_20]: It may, it may not.

1555
01:56:52,498 --> 01:56:52,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1556
01:56:53,818 --> 01:56:55,879
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1557
01:56:55,999 --> 01:56:58,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so we'll change this.

1558
01:56:58,219 --> 01:56:58,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1559
01:56:58,899 --> 01:57:01,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1560
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:09,662
[SPEAKER_16]: So, the motion by Councilor Marks to increase it from seven to 10 feet

1561
01:57:11,993 --> 01:57:13,833
[SPEAKER_16]: is seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1562
01:57:13,853 --> 01:57:14,713
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1563
01:57:15,734 --> 01:57:16,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Any opposed?

1564
01:57:16,354 --> 01:57:19,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, on the original motion.

01:57:31,339 --> 01:57:32,079
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1568
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:33,939
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1569
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:35,940
[SPEAKER_16]: None.

1570
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:37,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1571
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:37,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

1572
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:47,773
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we got another one.

1573
01:57:47,793 --> 01:57:51,756

01:57:56,118 --> 01:57:59,781

1576
01:58:01,362 --> 01:58:02,422
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a public hearing.

1577
01:58:02,502 --> 01:58:03,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you here in favor of the project?

1578
01:58:04,243 --> 01:58:04,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I am.

1579
01:58:04,724 --> 01:58:05,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

1580
01:58:05,364 --> 01:58:05,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1581
01:58:05,624 --> 01:58:06,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone else in favor of this project?

1582
01:58:07,855 --> 01:58:11,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing none, this part of the hearing is closed.

1583
01:58:11,337 --> 01:58:12,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone opposed to this project?

1584
01:58:14,019 --> 01:58:16,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the hearing.

1585
01:58:16,961 --> 01:58:22,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Sir, if you could just give us a brief synopsis of this project on Magoon Avenue.

1586
01:58:23,425 --> 01:58:25,867
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is an existing customer.

1587
01:58:25,987 --> 01:58:28,328
[SPEAKER_20]: His service goes overhead from the pole line to the house.

1588
01:58:28,909 --> 01:58:32,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Now he wants to relocate to the underground system.

1589
01:58:32,171 --> 01:58:34,953
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're installing approximately eight

1590
01:58:35,717 --> 01:58:41,139
[SPEAKER_20]: feet of one three-inch concrete from the pole towards his house, going across the sidewalk.

1591
01:58:41,259 --> 01:58:41,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1592
01:58:41,619 --> 01:58:47,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, exactly.

1593
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:49,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, exactly.

1594
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:50,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1595
01:58:50,261 --> 01:58:53,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, a quick question as far as

1596
01:59:07,241 --> 01:59:08,562
[SPEAKER_21]: How long will this project take?

1597
01:59:08,922 --> 01:59:10,743
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, less than one day's work.

1598
01:59:10,783 --> 01:59:12,064
[SPEAKER_21]: One day's work, okay, thank you.

1599
01:59:12,344 --> 01:59:12,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1600

1602
01:59:18,629 --> 01:59:18,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1603
01:59:19,349 --> 01:59:19,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1604
01:59:19,489 --> 01:59:20,010
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:20,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:21,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

1607
01:59:21,391 --> 01:59:29,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

01:59:30,176 --> 01:59:30,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1609
01:59:30,877 --> 01:59:35,140
[SPEAKER_16]: 21459, petition for a greater location, Verizon New England, underground cables and fixtures.

1610
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:37,074
[SPEAKER_16]: We hear by notified.

1611
01:59:37,174 --> 01:59:41,196

[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Bax, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1613
01:59:45,038 --> 01:59:45,778

01:59:46,539 --> 01:59:46,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1615
01:59:46,619 --> 01:59:47,039
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1616
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:47,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1617
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:50,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have anybody here from Verizon this evening?

1618
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:54,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table, Mr. President.

1619
01:59:54,662 --> 01:59:54,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold on.

1620
01:59:54,982 --> 01:59:58,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe there's James.

1621
01:59:58,284 --> 02:00:00,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that James?

1622
02:00:04,721 --> 02:00:05,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Councilors.

1623
02:00:05,701 --> 02:00:10,545
[SPEAKER_00]: James Day, Toronto, contract engineer on behalf of Verizon New England.

1624
02:00:11,405 --> 02:00:11,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

1625
02:00:12,446 --> 02:00:17,610
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could give us a brief synopsis of this project.

1626
02:00:18,446 --> 02:00:18,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

1627
02:00:19,687 --> 02:00:36,316
[SPEAKER_00]: So Verizon will be placing approximately 10 feet of two 4-inch conduits from Handhole 1 to the property line in order to connect with underground facilities at the property line of 662 Boston Avenue.

1628
02:00:38,218 --> 02:00:47,343
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing that to provide Verizon service to the new MBTA station of the Green Line, I believe it is.

1629
02:00:49,507 --> 02:00:52,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1630
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:54,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1631
02:00:54,751 --> 02:00:59,395
[SPEAKER_16]: So with this as a hearing, you are in favor of this project, correct?

1632
02:01:00,495 --> 02:01:00,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.

1633
02:01:01,456 --> 02:01:02,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

1634
02:01:02,577 --> 02:01:03,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone else in favor?

1635
02:01:03,498 --> 02:01:06,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing none, motion that part of the hearing closed.

1636
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone opposed to this project?

1637
02:01:08,782 --> 02:01:11,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearing and seeing none, we motion that part of the hearing closed.

1638
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:15,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so any more questions for the petitioner from Verizon?

1639
02:01:15,807 --> 02:01:16,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

1640
02:01:16,993 --> 02:01:17,593
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

1641
02:01:17,653 --> 02:01:18,514
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1642
02:01:18,654 --> 02:01:24,155
[SPEAKER_21]: If I may, how long do you think this will take to complete?

1643
02:01:25,816 --> 02:01:29,237
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I have here, I don't anticipate it will take longer than a day.

1644
02:01:30,117 --> 02:01:31,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, perfect, thank you.

1645
02:01:33,078 --> 02:01:35,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, sure.

1646
02:01:35,579 --> 02:01:38,240
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion by Councilor Scarpelli for approval, seconded by?

1647
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:38,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1648
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Bez.

1649
02:01:40,921 --> 02:01:41,641
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1650
02:01:42,402 --> 02:01:42,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1651
02:01:42,522 --> 02:01:43,922
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1652
02:01:45,202 --> 02:01:46,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes, thank you, sir.

1653
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:48,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1654
02:01:48,131 --> 02:01:48,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

1655
02:01:48,491 --> 02:01:49,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1656
02:01:52,833 --> 02:01:54,193
[SPEAKER_16]: It's time for my stuff.

1657
02:01:54,553 --> 02:02:00,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's it for the petitions.

1658
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:00,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1659
02:02:00,815 --> 02:02:02,015
[SPEAKER_16]: 21491 offered by Councilor Bez.

1660
02:02:02,796 --> 02:02:03,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved.

1661
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:22,197
[SPEAKER_16]: by the Medford City Council that the Cannabis Advisory Commission and or the city administration include labor peace agreement language in any host community agreements made between the city of Medford and any potential recreational or medicinal cannabis dispensaries.

1662
02:02:22,297 --> 02:02:22,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears.

1663
02:02:23,077 --> 02:02:24,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1664
02:02:24,898 --> 02:02:33,522
[SPEAKER_03]: As folks may or may not know, one of the fastest growing unionized industries in the state is the medical and recreational marijuana industry.

1665
02:02:34,322 --> 02:02:44,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, several of our local unions have been, uh, have been going out and organizing workers at these various locations.

1666
02:02:44,596 --> 02:02:51,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, one thing that has been included in many agreements between municipalities and the

1667
02:02:52,674 --> 02:03:02,838
[SPEAKER_03]: owners or license holders of these facilities is that the license holders will not actively, will not try to oppose the unionization effort if it comes to their shop.

1668
02:03:03,518 --> 02:03:16,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the request here of the Cannabis Advisory Commission and the city to include language in our agreements that ask these license holders not to oppose unionization efforts at these facilities.

1669
02:03:17,272 --> 02:03:25,899
[SPEAKER_16]: With all the hearings that have already been completed, I don't know if we have the authority to demand this in that.

1670
02:03:26,059 --> 02:03:37,888
[SPEAKER_16]: The hearings have already been done, so to add new language into, maybe something going forward, but to add new language into the agreement that was already reached with these people, I don't know.

1671
02:03:38,168 --> 02:03:41,471
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we should be seeking a legal opinion on this.

1672
02:03:43,248 --> 02:03:47,371
[SPEAKER_03]: host community agreements have been agreed to, because they would have to have been approved.

1673
02:03:47,391 --> 02:03:49,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's say the hearings have all been done.

1674
02:03:49,673 --> 02:03:51,694
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's for the licensure.

1675
02:03:51,875 --> 02:04:00,201
[SPEAKER_03]: The host community agreements are the, when they decide on the final three applicants, then they would begin negotiations around the host community agreements.

1676
02:04:00,221 --> 02:04:01,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my understanding of the process.

1677
02:04:02,663 --> 02:04:04,904
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so thank you.

1678
02:04:04,984 --> 02:04:06,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion on this?

1679
02:04:06,986 --> 02:04:07,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I would move approval.

1680
02:04:08,567 --> 02:04:10,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I, Mr. President,

1681
02:04:11,227 --> 02:04:11,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1682
02:04:12,347 --> 02:04:26,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I would tend, I would feel more comfortable if we did get an opinion from the city solicitor, you know, and we did create a cannabis advisory commission for purpose and I don't want to overstep our boundaries.

1683
02:04:26,991 --> 02:04:37,913
[SPEAKER_06]: The resolution refers to include, include to me is asking them to put it in there, not asking them whether they would review or take it under advisement.

1684
02:04:38,054 --> 02:04:38,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Changing the rules.

1685
02:04:38,674 --> 02:04:39,914
[SPEAKER_06]: You're asking them to include it.

1686
02:04:40,407 --> 02:04:46,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just would feel more comfortable having city solicitor to take a look at it, yeah.

1687
02:04:47,032 --> 02:04:50,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made a motion to approve, but whatever happens happens.

1688
02:04:52,816 --> 02:04:53,877
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no second on it, so.

1689
02:04:55,838 --> 02:04:59,321
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Bears to approve, seconded by.

1690
02:05:05,706 --> 02:05:06,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll withdraw the motion.

1691
02:05:07,187 --> 02:05:08,448
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion has been withdrawn.

1692
02:05:13,889 --> 02:05:14,670
[SPEAKER_16]: 21492, be it resolved.

1693
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:16,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Offered by councilors, be it resolved.

1694
02:05:16,871 --> 02:05:22,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears, do you want to withdraw the motion?

1695
02:05:22,775 --> 02:05:25,097
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just withdrawing my motion to approve.

1696
02:05:25,397 --> 02:05:26,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's another motion on the floor.

1697
02:05:26,798 --> 02:05:29,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Councilor Marks, you want to, I'm sorry, I thought you were going to draw it over.

1698
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,422
[SPEAKER_03]: No, if there's a motion to refer to the solicitor.

1699
02:05:31,862 --> 02:05:36,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be opposed to that, or I wouldn't be opposed to receiving it and placing it on file, Mr. President.

1700
02:05:36,705 --> 02:05:37,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears, it's your motion.

1701
02:05:37,726 --> 02:05:39,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to receive it and place it on file?

1702
02:05:39,087 --> 02:05:41,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to refer to the city solicitor for an opinion.

1703
02:05:42,408 --> 02:05:50,473
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Bears to refer 214-991 to the city solicitor for an opinion, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1704
02:05:51,314 --> 02:05:52,035
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1705
02:05:52,055 --> 02:05:54,076
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1706
02:05:54,096 --> 02:05:54,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1707
02:05:54,816 --> 02:06:01,361
[SPEAKER_06]: 21- Mr. President, just for the edification, because the city solicitor is going to want to know what we're referring to and for what purpose.

1708
02:06:01,401 --> 02:06:10,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And the purpose, I think, at least for me, is to find out whether or not we have the authority to request that in a separate board.

1709
02:06:11,358 --> 02:06:15,003
[SPEAKER_06]: or a separate commission by state statute that's created.

1710
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:19,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be the question I have, whether we have the authority.

1711
02:06:20,231 --> 02:06:23,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, 21492, offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved.

1712
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:33,523
[SPEAKER_16]: by the Medford City Council that abutters within 250 feet of a city-owned tree be notified at least 14 days in advance if the tree is going to be removed.

1713
02:06:33,563 --> 02:06:34,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears.

1714
02:06:34,403 --> 02:06:35,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1715
02:06:35,903 --> 02:06:43,486
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been many city-owned trees that have been cut down or removed with pretty short notice.

1716
02:06:44,186 --> 02:06:50,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I did receive some communication from the tree warden that the forestry department generally does not

1717
02:06:51,776 --> 02:06:55,759
[SPEAKER_03]: decide to remove a tree until one to two days before they remove that tree.

1718
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:00,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was also a mention of emergency removals with National Grid.

1719
02:07:01,744 --> 02:07:04,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no problem if there's an emergency with something needs to be removed.

1720
02:07:05,126 --> 02:07:13,793
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I do think that abutters, I've run into abutters, there's a tree right in front of their house, they've planted their whole garden based around that tree, they've, you know,

1721
02:07:14,304 --> 02:07:20,208
[SPEAKER_03]: put a table out there based on that tree, and then they come out one day and there's a sign, and the next day the tree's gone.

1722
02:07:20,228 --> 02:07:33,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't seem like enough due process, or at least enough of a notification for abutters that something that provides shade and that they've come to rely on is going to be removed.

1723
02:07:33,117 --> 02:07:36,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask that there at least be more formal notice and the ability of,

1724
02:07:38,024 --> 02:07:46,548
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, residents, if a tree is going to be removed to come to us or come to the tree warden with some advanced notice, I put in 14 days because I felt that was reasonable.

1725
02:07:47,949 --> 02:07:51,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is just a request that they provide a little bit more time.

1726
02:07:51,071 --> 02:08:06,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly have no problem with emergency removals happening if they're an emergency, but if this is something that's being pre-planned and doesn't need to happen in 48 hours or 24 hours, I really do think that residents should get more notice when a tree is going to be removed.

1727
02:08:08,248 --> 02:08:10,810
[SPEAKER_16]: We have Aggie Tudin on the call here.

1728
02:08:13,572 --> 02:08:13,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Aggie?

1729
02:08:16,975 --> 02:08:17,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Aggie, are you here?

1730
02:08:20,838 --> 02:08:26,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Aggie Tudin?

1731
02:08:26,202 --> 02:08:26,462
[SPEAKER_15]: See ya.

1732
02:08:27,003 --> 02:08:27,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Aggie?

1733
02:08:30,806 --> 02:08:33,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Councilor Morell.

1734
02:08:35,197 --> 02:08:35,877
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1735
02:08:35,897 --> 02:08:39,079
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I support the intention of this resolution.

1736
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:48,143
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there's, I know personally there was a tree chipper down the street from me the other day, and he'd go running to the window to see which beloved tree is coming down.

1737
02:08:48,163 --> 02:08:50,184
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that notification is really important.

1738
02:08:51,065 --> 02:08:57,228
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, trees don't benefit just the direct abutters, they direct, you know, they benefit the whole block, they cool the whole block.

1739
02:08:57,248 --> 02:09:00,509
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think just as advanced notification gives people a chance to,

1740
02:09:02,670 --> 02:09:07,233
[SPEAKER_23]: whether it's just get on the list for a new tree, buy their own tree, or just wrap their head around what's happening.

1741
02:09:07,253 --> 02:09:10,115
[SPEAKER_23]: I think this is important just for stewardship in our community.

1742
02:09:10,216 --> 02:09:20,603
[SPEAKER_23]: And I also, I don't know if we need amended language to include the emergency situations or if the tree we're in would offer that if she joins us.

1743
02:09:20,703 --> 02:09:25,246
[SPEAKER_23]: But I do support this, but I also support the inclusion of emergency language.

1744
02:09:26,887 --> 02:09:27,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1745
02:09:27,788 --> 02:09:28,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Aggie, last call.

1746
02:09:28,808 --> 02:09:29,489
[SPEAKER_16]: You were there.

1747
02:09:29,509 --> 02:09:30,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Any opinion, Aggie?

1748
02:09:32,777 --> 02:09:33,457
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not.

1749
02:09:36,219 --> 02:09:36,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, sir.

1750
02:09:39,462 --> 02:09:42,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Gentleman from East Medford, name and address of the record, please.

1751
02:09:43,785 --> 02:09:44,926
[SPEAKER_06]: The mic's on now.

1752
02:09:45,066 --> 02:09:45,726
[SPEAKER_06]: The mic's on?

1753
02:09:46,186 --> 02:09:48,488
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll have to be careful what I say then.

1754
02:09:48,848 --> 02:09:58,055
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, Mr. President, to the chair, off the record, I could tell Councilor Marks, say it ain't so, Joe.

1755
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:03,711
[SPEAKER_18]: We're gonna sorely miss him, but not for long, I hope.

1756
02:10:03,951 --> 02:10:06,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1757
02:10:06,651 --> 02:10:15,693
[SPEAKER_18]: On this tree business, it is my understanding, let me back up, I'm not sure what the ordinance or law is within the city about trees.

1758
02:10:16,313 --> 02:10:22,495
[SPEAKER_18]: I love nature, personally speaking, and I have three trees around my house, city trees.

1759
02:10:23,355 --> 02:10:23,955
[SPEAKER_18]: My question

1760
02:10:24,464 --> 02:10:46,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, my thought was, I remember reading the legal notices all too often, and I thought they were advertised in advance, so at least I want to guesstimate a week, two or three weeks in advance, and usually has a listing of multiple trees at certain addresses in the city, saying and calling them public trees, and they will be

1761
02:10:47,675 --> 02:10:50,816
[SPEAKER_18]: taken down, so that's all I can say.

1762
02:10:50,876 --> 02:10:56,279
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if I was dreaming when I saw this years and years ago, haven't seen any recently.

1763
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:11,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know personally if it existed in the past, but I think that's exactly the kind of practice I would like to see in terms of notification, that a notice go out and give people due notice that something may be removed.

1764
02:11:11,565 --> 02:11:14,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've had residents say, I walked out one morning and my tree was gone.

1765
02:11:14,726 --> 02:11:16,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been there for 30 years and now there's no tree.

1766
02:11:19,701 --> 02:11:20,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1767
02:11:20,582 --> 02:11:22,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I could, Aggie's not on the call.

1768
02:11:23,002 --> 02:11:25,123
[SPEAKER_16]: She's on the call, but she's not answering.

1769
02:11:25,323 --> 02:11:25,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1770
02:11:25,943 --> 02:11:33,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Aggie we know best, but from my previous experience, the state statute is very clear about the removal of a public shade tree.

1771
02:11:34,786 --> 02:11:44,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And Aggie falls that to the T. And my experience states, unless it's an emergency, that it requires the tree be posted.

1772
02:11:44,669 --> 02:11:46,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So the tree will officially get a posting on it,

1773
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:50,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe it requires a public hearing for any removal of the tree.

1774
02:11:51,465 --> 02:11:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is duly posted as well as Mr. Castagnetti said.

1775
02:11:55,708 --> 02:11:58,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've never heard of the one or two day notification.

1776
02:11:59,431 --> 02:12:02,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like seven to 14 or maybe even longer.

1777
02:12:03,635 --> 02:12:15,785
[SPEAKER_06]: So if trees are being removed, it may be an emergent nature or it may be the city's no longer following state statute, which I highly doubt.

1778
02:12:16,868 --> 02:12:22,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, but it's about time we take a look at our own tree ordinance, which we don't have.

1779
02:12:22,612 --> 02:12:27,735
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, we don't have anything that protects public shade trees on.

1780
02:12:27,755 --> 02:12:30,837
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot of talk over the years, but very little action.

1781
02:12:31,437 --> 02:12:43,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is a perfect time, maybe to send something to a subcommittee, maybe the public works subcommittee, um, and have them take a look at the creation of a tree ordinance.

1782
02:12:43,145 --> 02:12:43,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President,

1783
02:12:46,232 --> 02:12:46,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

1784
02:12:47,212 --> 02:12:47,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1785
02:12:47,813 --> 02:12:54,975
[SPEAKER_21]: We do have a pre-ordinance, I think that just got moved to Committee of the Whole, that we reviewed, I think about a month ago.

1786
02:12:56,336 --> 02:12:56,996
[SPEAKER_03]: In subcommittee?

1787
02:12:57,496 --> 02:13:02,098
[SPEAKER_21]: It went from the Woodman subcommittee to Committee of the Whole.

1788
02:13:02,118 --> 02:13:04,238
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was just voted over, I think it was July 17th.

1789
02:13:05,399 --> 02:13:10,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be happy to refer this paper to the same Committee of the Whole and have that discussion as part of the larger pre-ordinance.

1790
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:12,541
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that would make it complete.

1791
02:13:12,601 --> 02:13:13,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Aggie might be on the call now.

1792
02:13:13,762 --> 02:13:14,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Aggie, you on the call now?

1793
02:13:21,161 --> 02:13:21,341
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1794
02:13:21,401 --> 02:13:26,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm trying to committee of the whole refer this to the same meeting.

1795
02:13:27,703 --> 02:13:29,063
[SPEAKER_02]: She's there but she's not answering.

1796
02:13:33,565 --> 02:13:35,185
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so all right, we've been here a while.

1797
02:13:35,205 --> 02:13:36,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to belabor it.

1798
02:13:36,165 --> 02:13:40,766
[SPEAKER_03]: So my motion is to refer to committee of the whole for discussion along with the tree ordinance.

1799
02:13:41,246 --> 02:13:43,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so on the motion by Council of is

1800
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:46,461
[SPEAKER_16]: to refer this to Committee of the Whole with the tree warden.

1801
02:13:47,522 --> 02:13:48,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1802
02:13:48,682 --> 02:13:49,322
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1803
02:13:49,583 --> 02:13:49,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1804
02:13:49,823 --> 02:13:50,563
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1805
02:13:50,623 --> 02:13:51,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1806
02:13:58,286 --> 02:14:02,248
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll skip mine because I got a couple here and then we'll share.

1807
02:14:02,268 --> 02:14:03,929
[SPEAKER_16]: 21494 offered by Councilor Bears.

1808
02:14:04,009 --> 02:14:04,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I withdraw.

1809
02:14:04,469 --> 02:14:06,269
[SPEAKER_16]: You withdraw this?

1810
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:07,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've discussed it enough.

1811
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:08,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay. 21495.

1812
02:14:12,618 --> 02:14:27,708
[SPEAKER_16]: offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we receive an update from Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee regarding Paper 21, not 312, to support state legislation regarding pilot payments.

1813
02:14:28,469 --> 02:14:30,550
[SPEAKER_16]: This paper is in committee.

1814
02:14:31,451 --> 02:14:32,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, who is the chair of that committee?

1815
02:14:35,333 --> 02:14:35,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's the?

1816
02:14:36,274 --> 02:14:38,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I can look on my phone.

1817
02:14:38,295 --> 02:14:39,376
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I am, Mr. Chair.

1818
02:14:40,016 --> 02:14:40,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks, you are the chair?

1819
02:14:41,437 --> 02:14:41,737
[SPEAKER_16]: I think so.

1820
02:14:44,496 --> 02:14:46,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe call a meeting going down the line?

1821
02:14:47,797 --> 02:14:49,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm not quite sure what we're gonna discuss.

1822
02:14:50,799 --> 02:14:59,583
[SPEAKER_06]: The action was to wait for the state legislature to enact a piece of legislation, which never happened.

1823
02:15:01,124 --> 02:15:04,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess we can meet to talk, because we have nothing else to do.

1824
02:15:04,925 --> 02:15:07,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the, well, we have plenty to do.

1825
02:15:07,427 --> 02:15:10,088
[SPEAKER_03]: The resolution was that this council

1826
02:15:10,972 --> 02:15:15,055
[SPEAKER_03]: would contact the legislature and say that we support the legislation that has been filed.

1827
02:15:16,536 --> 02:15:21,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe the issue at the time was that bill numbers had not been issued yet, that kind of thing.

1828
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:25,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just kind of still on a docket number, a temporary number.

1829
02:15:26,043 --> 02:15:38,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill numbers have now been issued and we put a 90 day shot clock on the paper that the subcommittee would meet in 90 days to discuss whether we thought it was reasonable for this council to support such a legislation.

1830
02:15:39,562 --> 02:15:41,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, I believe, where we left it.

1831
02:15:41,975 --> 02:15:46,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't believe that council has the authority to put a 90 day shot clock on a subcommittee.

1832
02:15:47,997 --> 02:15:57,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the council overstepped its boundaries, but needless to say, Mr. President, I'm not sure quite what will be the discussion on a piece of legislation that hasn't been passed.

1833
02:15:58,219 --> 02:16:09,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So that we need to give local cities and towns the authority to make a pilot and in lieu of tax payment mandatory for certain entities.

1834
02:16:09,882 --> 02:16:14,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that legislation is not passed, I'm not sure what the subcommittee's use is.

1835
02:16:14,825 --> 02:16:22,110
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking just for the council to give a vote of support on the legislation, then I don't think that was the correct place to send it to a subcommittee for that.

1836
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:25,613
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not my motion to send it to subcommittee, certainly.

1837
02:16:25,673 --> 02:16:26,893
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what was passed, right?

1838
02:16:27,134 --> 02:16:27,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1839
02:16:27,334 --> 02:16:30,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I'd be happy to file it again.

1840
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:33,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know what we're going to discuss.

1841
02:16:34,098 --> 02:16:34,959
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we discuss?

1842
02:16:35,239 --> 02:16:38,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that may eventually be passed by the state legislature?

1843
02:16:39,009 --> 02:16:46,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was, I mean, it could be a five minute meeting to say, yes, we should send our note of support to the legislature that we think this is something that we should have.

1844
02:16:47,171 --> 02:16:55,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on the substance of it, I do think we need more authority and uniformity in state government and state statute to provide clarity around pilot agreements.

1845
02:16:55,753 --> 02:17:03,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know the pilot agreements are very important to the city bringing in close to $5 million a year in revenue of our $200 million.

1846
02:17:03,395 --> 02:17:07,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I put it forward is the state doesn't have a good framework for this.

1847
02:17:08,427 --> 02:17:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: and this bill would provide a new state framework that then we can operate under.

1848
02:17:12,811 --> 02:17:17,975
[SPEAKER_03]: The request was just that we support these bills and ask that our delegation advance them in the legislature.

1849
02:17:18,235 --> 02:17:18,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1850
02:17:19,056 --> 02:17:30,825
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my opinion, Mr. President, and maybe this is the conversation we're going to have at subcommittee, but in my opinion, Mr. President, the city is what needs to put together a framework regarding in lieu of tax payment.

1851
02:17:31,065 --> 02:17:33,027
[SPEAKER_16]: City Council does not negotiate battle agreements.

1852
02:17:33,127 --> 02:17:34,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is no current, as far as I know,

1853
02:17:37,194 --> 02:17:38,636
[SPEAKER_06]: game plan within the community.

1854
02:17:39,116 --> 02:17:46,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was one of the first members when I first got on the council to request Tufts University, which never gave it a little tax payment.

1855
02:17:47,004 --> 02:17:55,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was one of the first to initiate that Mr. President, and then Mayor McGlynn signed a 10 year pilot program, which was severely

1856
02:17:57,508 --> 02:18:02,330
[SPEAKER_06]: underfunded, in my opinion, or not what it should have been for such an institution.

1857
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:12,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But needless to say, Mr. President, this legislation doesn't say that the cities and towns have the authority to create their own policy or procedures.

1858
02:18:12,674 --> 02:18:16,015
[SPEAKER_06]: This states that it goes from voluntary to mandatory.

1859
02:18:16,576 --> 02:18:22,898
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge change, Mr. President, that could potentially impact every church in the community.

1860
02:18:23,782 --> 02:18:33,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And every nonprofit that's servicing homeless, that's servicing disabled, that's doing yeoman's work, Mr. President, this could have a giant impact.

1861
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:39,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think it's as easy to say we should just support this.

1862
02:18:40,034 --> 02:18:50,522
[SPEAKER_06]: This has really far reaching impact on nonprofits, including churches, Mr. President, in this community.

1863
02:18:51,033 --> 02:18:57,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get into the minutiae, but the legislation that is proposed in the State House would not apply to churches or social service organizations.

1864
02:18:57,218 --> 02:18:59,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So there would not be mandatory payments for either of those groups.

1865
02:19:00,241 --> 02:19:10,450
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from the gentleman I talked to that I think you've been speaking with, and that probably initiated this with you, that will be left up to cities and towns.

1866
02:19:11,310 --> 02:19:15,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I was told that that will be left up to cities and towns.

1867
02:19:15,899 --> 02:19:17,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe he may have been not exempt.

1868
02:19:17,962 --> 02:19:19,064
[SPEAKER_03]: He had not gotten that wrong.

1869
02:19:19,345 --> 02:19:22,370
[SPEAKER_06]: But well, that's that's the feedback I got.

1870
02:19:22,911 --> 02:19:23,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, so

1871
02:19:24,377 --> 02:19:33,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And I as one member, I'm not going to go after churches, Mr. President, or any other nonprofit that's doing social services for our constituency.

1872
02:19:34,422 --> 02:19:42,887
[SPEAKER_03]: If you read the legislation, it explicitly includes a specific category of nonprofits, which is the large educational and medical institutions.

1873
02:19:43,587 --> 02:19:45,889
[SPEAKER_03]: and excludes the church's religious organization.

1874
02:19:45,909 --> 02:19:47,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you provide that language to us?

1875
02:19:47,590 --> 02:19:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I did when I proposed the original.

1876
02:19:49,992 --> 02:19:51,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd ask that you provide it again.

1877
02:19:51,052 --> 02:19:52,493
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not my understanding.

1878
02:19:52,694 --> 02:19:53,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be happy to.

1879
02:19:54,555 --> 02:20:05,643
[SPEAKER_03]: In any case, on your other point, which is the local action that we can take, I do have proposed ordinance language, and I would love to have a committee of the whole on what we could create as a local ordinance around pilot agreements.

1880
02:20:09,123 --> 02:20:11,905
[SPEAKER_16]: City Council does not negotiate pilot agreements.

1881
02:20:11,985 --> 02:20:12,445
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mayor does.

1882
02:20:12,485 --> 02:20:18,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this would create a framework, and actually I have had several discussions with the Mayor and residents on this.

1883
02:20:18,168 --> 02:20:20,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, when the Mayor comes here with her suggestions, we'll take it up.

1884
02:20:20,910 --> 02:20:28,835
[SPEAKER_16]: But meanwhile, the Mayor is the chief negotiating officer of the city, and the Mayor negotiates pilot agreements, not the City Council.

1885
02:20:29,335 --> 02:20:29,615
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1886
02:20:30,496 --> 02:20:37,140
[SPEAKER_16]: So, on the motion by Council of Mayors, to receive a report, that's it.

1887
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I withdraw.

1888
02:20:39,551 --> 02:20:45,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to adjourn.

1889
02:20:45,963 --> 02:20:48,087
[SPEAKER_16]: 21496 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the method...

1890
02:20:49,687 --> 02:20:59,050
[SPEAKER_16]: that Medford Deputy Fire Chief Fran Fosco be recognized on his recent retirement after serving the residents of Medford with distinction for the past 34 years.

1891
02:20:59,691 --> 02:21:00,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1892
02:21:01,011 --> 02:21:02,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1893
02:21:02,251 --> 02:21:11,555
[SPEAKER_06]: For all of us that know Deputy Chief Fosco, he started up through the ranks, Mr. President, and worked his way up to deputy chief.

1894
02:21:12,435 --> 02:21:35,651
[SPEAKER_06]: And you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler man, Mr. President, a man who has raised a family, a man who has dedicated his life to the firefighting profession in the city of Medford, a man that always has been honored and respected in his field, and someone that really is going to be sorely missed.

1895
02:21:36,111 --> 02:21:40,234
[SPEAKER_06]: His breadth of knowledge regarding fire suppression,

1896
02:21:40,954 --> 02:21:48,757
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, regarding, uh, you know, fire management and, uh, just, uh, the administration of a fire department.

1897
02:21:49,458 --> 02:21:59,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it goes on matched and, uh, you know, personally, I wish he had a few more years because I think, uh, he would have made a great chief to be quite frank with him.

1898
02:22:00,062 --> 02:22:03,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, he's loved by, uh, his fellow firefighters.

1899
02:22:03,924 --> 02:22:06,525
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a man of reason, a man of knowledge.

1900
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:11,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think someone that would have really done well in that role.

1901
02:22:11,351 --> 02:22:12,952
[SPEAKER_06]: But however, he is retiring.

1902
02:22:13,012 --> 02:22:14,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to wish him well.

1903
02:22:15,193 --> 02:22:18,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to seeing him around the community, Mr. President.

1904
02:22:19,014 --> 02:22:22,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish him well on any future endeavors.

1905
02:22:22,875 --> 02:22:23,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1906
02:22:23,779 --> 02:22:24,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Belli.

1907
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:25,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1908
02:22:25,759 --> 02:22:27,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Council, for bringing this forward.

1909
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:36,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that Mr. Fusco is someone that I personally would reach out to if we had issues or concerns, and he'd be the first person to call back.

1910
02:22:36,402 --> 02:22:43,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Always had a solution to assist you in not leaving people in the lurch or leaving them dumbfounded.

1911
02:22:43,444 --> 02:22:48,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that Councilor Marks, as his knowledge of what he does, is second to none, and I agree.

1912
02:22:48,805 --> 02:22:49,845
[SPEAKER_11]: He would have been a great chief.

1913
02:22:51,305 --> 02:22:53,266
[SPEAKER_11]: But more than that, I think the respect

1914
02:22:54,247 --> 02:23:02,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And what he gets from his colleagues and the people that work for him, I think is pretty

1915
02:23:04,802 --> 02:23:05,582
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty impressive.

1916
02:23:05,662 --> 02:23:18,905
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that it's again, you celebrate and you applaud and you congratulate him on his retirement, but it's definitely, they're definitely gonna be shoes that need to be filled by a few people, I think.

1917
02:23:18,945 --> 02:23:30,088
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr. Fusco, and again, a great Medford family, and I'm glad he settled in this area to raise his family.

1918
02:23:30,108 --> 02:23:30,988
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much.

1919
02:23:31,468 --> 02:23:31,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1920
02:23:31,768 --> 02:23:32,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1921
02:23:32,689 --> 02:23:33,369
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1922
02:23:33,389 --> 02:23:33,869
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to thank

1923
02:23:35,170 --> 02:23:42,701
[SPEAKER_21]: Deputy Chief Fusco for his many years of commitment to our community, to the fire service, and wish him well in his retirement.

1924
02:23:42,901 --> 02:23:43,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1925
02:23:43,382 --> 02:23:43,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1926
02:23:44,924 --> 02:23:50,532
[SPEAKER_16]: And personally, I see him almost every day now.

1927
02:23:51,383 --> 02:23:55,546
[SPEAKER_16]: even though I wasn't seeing him before, but he had a little different job.

1928
02:23:55,966 --> 02:23:56,967
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a safety officer.

1929
02:23:57,047 --> 02:24:04,053
[SPEAKER_16]: He went around, he did inspections, and always made sure that the best interests of the city always came first.

1930
02:24:04,073 --> 02:24:07,635
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Brian, I'm glad I see you every day.

1931
02:24:07,655 --> 02:24:09,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you're a much more relaxed guy.

1932
02:24:09,577 --> 02:24:10,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Good luck in your retirements.

1933
02:24:13,099 --> 02:24:16,102
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, all in the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by?

1934
02:24:16,957 --> 02:24:17,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1935
02:24:17,377 --> 02:24:17,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1936
02:24:17,618 --> 02:24:17,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

02:24:17,838 --> 02:24:18,078

[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1996
02:24:33,350 --> 02:24:33,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1997
02:24:33,650 --> 02:24:34,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1998
02:24:34,471 --> 02:24:34,891
Thank you.

1999
02:24:34,911 --> 02:24:35,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2000
02:24:35,111 --> 02:24:35,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2001
02:24:35,311 --> 02:24:35,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2002
02:24:35,551 --> 02:24:35,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2003
02:24:35,752 --> 02:24:36,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2004
02:24:36,612 --> 02:24:36,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2005
02:24:36,812 --> 02:24:37,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2006
02:24:37,073 --> 02:24:37,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2007
02:24:37,313 --> 02:24:37,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2008
02:24:38,122 --> 02:24:42,645
[SPEAKER_16]: 21500 offered by Vice President Knight is asked to be tabled.

2009
02:24:43,545 --> 02:24:46,226
[SPEAKER_16]: 21501 by Vice President Knight is asked to be tabled.

2010
02:24:46,467 --> 02:24:50,649
[SPEAKER_16]: 21502 offered by Vice President Knight is asked to be tabled.

2011
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:54,171
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get that part yet, hold on.

2012
02:24:54,951 --> 02:24:56,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I miss one?

2013
02:24:56,712 --> 02:24:57,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

2014
02:24:58,873 --> 02:24:59,393
[SPEAKER_16]: 21497 also be tabled.

2015
02:25:09,188 --> 02:25:13,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, those are all the tables.

2016
02:25:14,731 --> 02:25:21,234
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion, Councilor Falco, you make the motion to table all those for Councilor Knight because he's not here?

2017
02:25:21,454 --> 02:25:27,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'd like to make the motion to table those resolutions offered by Councilor Knight until he returns.

2018
02:25:27,657 --> 02:25:28,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, seconded by?

2019
02:25:28,518 --> 02:25:29,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded.

2020
02:25:30,139 --> 02:25:31,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

2021
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:32,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2022
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,961
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed, motion passes.

2023
02:25:34,981 --> 02:25:36,122
[SPEAKER_16]: 21503, offered by Councilor Morell.

2024
02:25:37,112 --> 02:25:52,042
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all resolved that the city council requests that the administration provide an update on the implementation of the city's bicycle infrastructure master plan or any other comprehensive plans for bicycle infrastructure.

2025
02:25:52,082 --> 02:25:52,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell.

2026
02:25:53,066 --> 02:25:53,946
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2027
02:25:54,246 --> 02:26:00,728
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I have this on here because I've had a number of bike commuters reach out lately just about certain improvements to streets.

2028
02:26:01,248 --> 02:26:14,011
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of those streets are referenced in the infrastructure master plan that was put together by the Bicycle Advisory Commission, which I know was meant to be used as a guide suggestions for DPW and a city engineer.

2029
02:26:14,111 --> 02:26:21,013
[SPEAKER_23]: And it is my understanding that these improvements are generally implemented only when a street is repaved.

2030
02:26:21,133 --> 02:26:21,833
[SPEAKER_23]: And as we know from

2031
02:26:22,353 --> 02:26:30,136
[SPEAKER_23]: this very council, a very small number of streets are repaved each year, and a number of them just aren't even in this plan.

2032
02:26:30,196 --> 02:26:46,203
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, noting that we've got the Great Clippership Connector, which is connecting a number of greenways and a number of bike paths that they, bikes are mentioned in the draft of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

2033
02:26:47,064 --> 02:26:53,450
[SPEAKER_23]: And also just noting that ideally there will be hopefully substantial infrastructure money coming down from the federal level.

2034
02:26:53,890 --> 02:27:06,963
[SPEAKER_23]: I would just love an update from the administration on priorities around these improvements for bikes around the city if it's something that it's just going to keep being done kind of as we slowly repave streets.

2035
02:27:07,483 --> 02:27:13,689
[SPEAKER_23]: or if there is something in the works that if we do get infrastructure money, it'll be something we'll be moving quickly on.

2036
02:27:13,789 --> 02:27:21,276
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would just love an update so that it's something I can, you know, that can be shared with the cyclists and would-be cyclists in Medford.

2037
02:27:21,677 --> 02:27:21,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2038
02:27:22,337 --> 02:27:23,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion?

2039
02:27:24,099 --> 02:27:24,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

2040
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:26,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Castaign, did you want to speak?

2041
02:27:30,785 --> 02:27:31,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, sir.

2042
02:27:31,326 --> 02:27:32,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address of the record, please.

2043
02:27:33,394 --> 02:27:37,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Andrew Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

2044
02:27:38,176 --> 02:27:45,660
[SPEAKER_18]: I sincerely want to thank City Councilor Morell for bringing this up, especially the Clippership Connector part.

2045
02:27:47,281 --> 02:27:51,182
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very personal to me being injured in that location.

2046
02:27:55,785 --> 02:28:02,748
[SPEAKER_18]: I scribbled a few notes, I hope it makes sense, but this missing incomplete

2047
02:28:03,132 --> 02:28:04,372
[SPEAKER_18]: bike community path.

2048
02:28:06,313 --> 02:28:15,616
[SPEAKER_18]: And we in Medford have the best location in all of New England, in my opinion, five miles north of Boston with Route 93 here.

2049
02:28:16,776 --> 02:28:25,778
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know, they can't seem to finish off the missing link, the half mile right behind 99 Riverside Ave.

2050
02:28:25,859 --> 02:28:28,939
[SPEAKER_18]: I was supposed to wave to Mr. Sano, who lives there.

2051
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:30,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyways,

2052
02:28:32,045 --> 02:28:48,301
[SPEAKER_18]: It's sad because you could go from West Method and beyond, actually, you come right through here, if you didn't have the half mile blockage to the Duggar Andrews, you could go clear to the MBTA stations without dealing with Route 16 or Route 28.

2053
02:28:49,141 --> 02:28:51,704
[SPEAKER_18]: That's huge as a safety concern.

2054
02:28:54,090 --> 02:28:56,211
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's long overdue.

2055
02:28:56,852 --> 02:29:10,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Personally, in my opinion, it should have been done 20 years ago about when they built the two new schools, so-called two new schools, with bike paths and footpaths that go underneath Route 16.

2056
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:15,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, they should do this job right.

2057
02:29:17,663 --> 02:29:21,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Finish this half-mile missing link in the center of Medford Square

2058
02:29:23,396 --> 02:29:25,137
[SPEAKER_18]: with the Riparian Right Law.

2059
02:29:25,978 --> 02:29:28,620
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a 1600 Massachusetts law.

2060
02:29:30,302 --> 02:29:42,872
[SPEAKER_18]: And that means we the people have the right of pathway, egress, I believe it's 15 feet alongside waterways.

2061
02:29:43,553 --> 02:29:47,256
[SPEAKER_18]: In this case, the Mystic River and Blessing of the Bay.

2062
02:29:48,777 --> 02:29:51,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, build this missing link

2063
02:29:53,140 --> 02:30:02,022
[SPEAKER_18]: The part that's missing is right next to the Doug Randrew School, that piece of land there.

2064
02:30:02,622 --> 02:30:06,523
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the next piece would be the Riverside Yacht Club.

2065
02:30:08,524 --> 02:30:17,986
[SPEAKER_18]: And then heading towards the square would be two condo buildings, 54 to 68, Ship Ave, I believe.

2066
02:30:18,746 --> 02:30:21,647
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the way, they have two fences on each end of the property.

2067
02:30:22,688 --> 02:30:35,150
[SPEAKER_18]: that go from the sidewalk all the way to the river, which, in my opinion, under riparian rights, is illegally built on the people's egress land.

2068
02:30:36,771 --> 02:30:46,432
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's another building going towards 93 that will be the last building, the 76th shipyard, large condo complex of approximately 20 units.

2069
02:30:46,992 --> 02:30:50,373
[SPEAKER_18]: They have plenty of land and they didn't build any fences

2070
02:30:51,996 --> 02:30:53,317
[SPEAKER_18]: on top of the people's land.

2071
02:30:54,218 --> 02:31:05,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And it continues around where I actually broke my hand with a bike injury when my bike found one of two potholes, four feet wide, one to two feet deep.

2072
02:31:06,046 --> 02:31:06,747
[SPEAKER_18]: They're still there.

2073
02:31:07,287 --> 02:31:08,728
[SPEAKER_18]: They put cones there.

2074
02:31:09,288 --> 02:31:12,190
[SPEAKER_18]: I found one on the river today, took my bike ride again.

2075
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:15,833
[SPEAKER_18]: I put one cone inside the hole.

2076
02:31:17,194 --> 02:31:21,097
[SPEAKER_18]: The DCR, they should at least fill in the potholes, which is grass.

2077
02:31:23,664 --> 02:31:30,186
[SPEAKER_18]: And the storm outfall number is OF04100.

2078
02:31:31,486 --> 02:31:48,891
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it continues, the missing link I should say, does not continue, underneath 93 to behind the senior citizen center, which is the building in the back where Mr. Sano lives at 99 Riverside Avenue, the high affordable rent building.

2079
02:31:50,311 --> 02:31:53,012
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a lousy half a mile, we're talking like

2080
02:31:54,093 --> 02:31:57,876
[SPEAKER_18]: 10, 15 miles beyond Arlington, Lexington possibly.

2081
02:31:59,016 --> 02:31:59,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you kidding?

2082
02:31:59,997 --> 02:32:00,978
[SPEAKER_18]: This is ridiculous.

2083
02:32:02,319 --> 02:32:16,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse my lack of 10 cent words here, but I understand the wheels of government work slowly, but 20 years and still waiting is ridiculous.

2084
02:32:18,470 --> 02:32:19,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on, man.

2085
02:32:21,809 --> 02:32:40,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get the missing half-mile path done now and complete the 10-mile plus route to the MBTA assembly row and station landing, and safely keep with the people off the streets, especially Route 16 and Route 28.

2086
02:32:41,556 --> 02:32:43,317
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a no-brainer.

2087
02:32:44,177 --> 02:32:45,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, city, wake up.

2088
02:32:46,551 --> 02:32:55,234
[SPEAKER_16]: We recently received some funds from the federal government for the station landing area to do a bridge and some more of the walkway.

2089
02:32:55,334 --> 02:32:58,536
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Councilor Falco and myself are there for the dedication.

2090
02:32:59,296 --> 02:33:00,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week's transcript?

2091
02:33:01,877 --> 02:33:03,197
[SPEAKER_18]: No, is that?

2092
02:33:03,938 --> 02:33:10,300
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going underneath Route 28, like some of them already did it at my path to Sunday Road.

2093
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:11,761
[SPEAKER_18]: They already have that.

2094
02:33:12,201 --> 02:33:13,201
[SPEAKER_18]: This is great.

2095
02:33:13,341 --> 02:33:14,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Barbara is the rep?

2096
02:33:15,863 --> 02:33:16,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2097
02:33:16,463 --> 02:33:16,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2098
02:33:17,464 --> 02:33:20,826
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know, I'm talking about the center of method over 20 effing years.

2099
02:33:21,566 --> 02:33:22,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on, people.

2100
02:33:23,527 --> 02:33:24,687
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to speak French no more.

2101
02:33:24,707 --> 02:33:25,608
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a DCR project.

2102
02:33:25,648 --> 02:33:26,729
[SPEAKER_16]: They know they're working on it.

2103
02:33:26,749 --> 02:33:27,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the clippership approved?

2104
02:33:29,370 --> 02:33:29,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2105
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:31,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the clippership, it's approved.

2106
02:33:31,331 --> 02:33:31,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2107
02:33:31,851 --> 02:33:34,613
[SPEAKER_18]: And are they actually going to build it on our property?

2108
02:33:34,633 --> 02:33:39,655
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as the egress next to the river behind those condo complexes?

2109
02:33:39,675 --> 02:33:41,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they were complaining.

2110
02:33:42,817 --> 02:33:42,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2111
02:33:42,997 --> 02:33:43,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2112
02:33:43,537 --> 02:33:45,258
[SPEAKER_18]: Or they have to build a little bit onto the water.

2113
02:33:46,207 --> 02:33:48,888
[SPEAKER_18]: in order to give them a break, which they don't need.

2114
02:33:48,928 --> 02:33:51,368
[SPEAKER_18]: They already built the fence on our land.

2115
02:33:52,469 --> 02:33:54,249
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm speaking straight English here.

2116
02:33:55,089 --> 02:33:55,629
[SPEAKER_18]: That's wrong.

2117
02:33:57,930 --> 02:34:04,732
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, my heart bleeds, my head broke, I was bleeding, broke my hand, I have receipts and bills like this.

2118
02:34:05,212 --> 02:34:07,533
[SPEAKER_18]: I did not sue DCR or the city.

2119
02:34:08,313 --> 02:34:12,014
[SPEAKER_18]: All I'm asking for is common sense 20 years later.

2120
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for listening.

2121
02:34:15,381 --> 02:34:15,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2122
02:34:15,781 --> 02:34:16,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2123
02:34:16,141 --> 02:34:17,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Morell.

2124
02:34:18,523 --> 02:34:21,966
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by?

2125
02:34:22,867 --> 02:34:23,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

2126
02:34:23,327 --> 02:34:24,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

2127
02:34:24,468 --> 02:34:25,268
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2128
02:34:25,629 --> 02:34:25,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2129
02:34:26,189 --> 02:34:26,830
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2130
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:27,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

2131
02:34:27,991 --> 02:34:36,197
[SPEAKER_16]: 21-504 offered by Councilor Morell being so resolved that the City Council receive an update from the administration.

2132
02:34:37,394 --> 02:34:47,079
[SPEAKER_16]: on transportation network company TNC fees anticipated to be allocated to Medford and any plans for said fees.

2133
02:34:47,119 --> 02:34:47,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell.

2134
02:34:48,152 --> 02:34:48,952
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2135
02:34:48,972 --> 02:35:00,335
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, since the implementation of these fees for essentially ride share, these have been used for a number of projects, but because of the pandemic, I know these companies took a hit, they weren't going out as often.

2136
02:35:00,375 --> 02:35:07,916
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm just curious if there's any update that the administration can provide on what those numbers actually look like this year based on the lower rates of use.

2137
02:35:07,976 --> 02:35:14,778
[SPEAKER_23]: I know it was some topic of debate with the transportation bill, but just, it still stands the fact that these,

2138
02:35:15,425 --> 02:35:18,307
[SPEAKER_23]: these companies went out so much less during the pandemic.

2139
02:35:18,347 --> 02:35:25,391
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm curious what we can look at, what we're anticipating with that, and if there are any specific projects that this money is earmarked for.

2140
02:35:25,431 --> 02:35:26,411
[SPEAKER_23]: So just seeking an update.

2141
02:35:27,972 --> 02:35:28,273
[SPEAKER_23]: Second.

2142
02:35:28,833 --> 02:35:29,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2143
02:35:29,353 --> 02:35:32,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Now on the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2144
02:35:32,675 --> 02:35:33,256
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2145
02:35:33,276 --> 02:35:33,756

2146
02:35:33,876 --> 02:35:34,496
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2147
02:35:34,596 --> 02:35:35,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

2148
02:35:35,377 --> 02:35:38,499
[SPEAKER_16]: 21-505 offered by Councilor Falco.

2149
02:35:39,287 --> 02:35:49,032
[SPEAKER_16]: be a result that the administration provide the Medford City Council with an update in regards to the private investigator that was hired by the administration on or before June 23rd, 2021.

2150
02:35:49,072 --> 02:35:51,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco.

2151
02:35:51,193 --> 02:35:52,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2152
02:35:52,653 --> 02:36:04,159
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a simple request to receive an update as to where the investigation stands and when it will be complete with regard to the allegations that were brought by the former CFO.

2153
02:36:04,759 --> 02:36:05,259
[SPEAKER_21]: Move approval.

2154
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:08,581

2156
02:36:10,785 --> 02:36:11,505

2157
02:36:12,225 --> 02:36:12,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

2158
02:36:12,985 --> 02:36:13,666

[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

2160
02:36:17,447 --> 02:36:19,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, if I could withdraw the next resolution.

2161
02:36:19,928 --> 02:36:21,668
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, yeah, we got something in that.

2162
02:36:21,688 --> 02:36:26,310
[SPEAKER_16]: 2-1-5-0-7, an offer by Councilor Bez.

2163
02:36:26,330 --> 02:36:30,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, here we go.

2164
02:36:30,211 --> 02:36:32,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marksley, I've got a couple of things on there if you want to take care of them.

2165
02:36:44,394 --> 02:36:53,321
[SPEAKER_06]: 21498.

2166
02:36:45,935 --> 02:36:53,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper 21498 offered by President Caraviello be it so resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences.

2167
02:37:08,718 --> 02:37:11,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper 21-493 offered by President Caraviello.

2168
02:37:12,119 --> 02:37:20,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that DCR make openings in the guardrail at Duggar Park for easier access into the park.

2169
02:37:20,982 --> 02:37:22,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Council President Caraviello.

2170
02:37:22,282 --> 02:37:22,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2171
02:37:24,703 --> 02:37:32,706
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been approached by some members of the park commission in regards to the guardrail over by Duggar Park.

2172
02:37:32,886 --> 02:37:35,827
[SPEAKER_16]: There's only like one opening or two and the other one is five down.

2173
02:37:38,478 --> 02:37:40,779
[SPEAKER_16]: For some people, it's hard getting over the guardrail.

2174
02:37:41,119 --> 02:37:53,623
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're asking that DCR make a couple of more openings, especially over by the basketball court and a little further down so they can be more openings so people can just a little easier egress into the park.

2175
02:37:54,463 --> 02:38:01,245
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, if we could send that to our state delegation and to DCR to open that up.

2176
02:38:01,873 --> 02:38:02,493
[SPEAKER_11]: I can amend that.

2177
02:38:03,174 --> 02:38:04,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2178
02:38:05,015 --> 02:38:06,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for Councilor Caravielloo bringing that forward.

2179
02:38:07,337 --> 02:38:19,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that, you know, with the updates now with the tennis courts and as you see what goes on at Duggar Park and how much of a vital pocket is the community there.

2180
02:38:21,607 --> 02:38:22,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I often thought why

2181
02:38:23,608 --> 02:38:25,729
[SPEAKER_11]: those guardrails are even there.

2182
02:38:25,789 --> 02:38:29,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that there's gotta be something more pleasing to the eye.

2183
02:38:29,351 --> 02:38:34,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there is the post and reel type of guardrail.

2184
02:38:35,113 --> 02:38:53,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So it'd be interesting to see if we could ask the South State delegations to look at maybe converting that old rod iron, which is pretty dangerous on the other side, very dangerous on the other side, that we can look at more traditional, you know,

2185
02:38:54,747 --> 02:38:56,308
[SPEAKER_11]: fencing that's used.

2186
02:38:56,769 --> 02:38:57,690
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's any even needed.

2187
02:38:59,091 --> 02:39:02,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there's a need because I think there's no sidewalk, I believe.

2188
02:39:03,455 --> 02:39:04,877
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we need something there.

2189
02:39:05,017 --> 02:39:08,560
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that there are so many aesthetically pleasing, you know,

2190
02:39:11,701 --> 02:39:12,781
[SPEAKER_11]: solutions we can use.

2191
02:39:12,821 --> 02:39:18,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that they have just the, it has the wood look that has the post and rail look.

2192
02:39:18,643 --> 02:39:25,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it looks so much classier, more inviting and allows the openings along as you walk.

2193
02:39:25,124 --> 02:39:27,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and provides the safety that's needed.

2194
02:39:27,145 --> 02:39:36,967
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know a few times with kids that are playing basketball and, you know, I know it's further away, but someone's taking a run at that and they run into that guardrail.

2195
02:39:37,347 --> 02:39:39,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm shocked we haven't, at least we haven't heard.

2196
02:39:40,228 --> 02:39:41,409
[SPEAKER_11]: any more serious incidents.

2197
02:39:41,429 --> 02:39:50,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you allow me to amend that to ask the state delegates to look at replacing that altogether.

2198
02:39:52,135 --> 02:39:56,416
[SPEAKER_06]: All in the motion by President Caraviello, further amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

2199
02:39:56,436 --> 02:39:57,216
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

2200
02:39:57,717 --> 02:39:57,837

2201
02:39:58,117 --> 02:39:58,557

02:40:05,539 --> 02:40:13,241

2206
02:40:13,781 --> 02:40:20,163
[SPEAKER_06]: On her recent passing, Mary serviced the city of Medford as treasure collector until 1991.

2207
02:40:21,423 --> 02:40:22,224
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello.

2208
02:40:23,365 --> 02:40:24,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2209
02:40:24,106 --> 02:40:26,349
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to send the condolences to the family of Mary.

2210
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:39,163
[SPEAKER_16]: She was our treasurer for many years and though I didn't know her personally, some friends and family asked me to put that on and I'd just like to send the condolences to her family for her work to the city of Medford.

2211
02:40:40,723 --> 02:40:42,525
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by President Caraviello.

2212
02:40:42,805 --> 02:40:43,526

2223
02:41:11,401 --> 02:41:11,732

2225
02:41:19,034 --> 02:41:30,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council demand that the DCI cut the weeds on Route 16 at the Main Street Bridge and all surrounding areas of the bridge that have not been cut in two years.

2226
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:36,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Please send this correspondence to Senator Jalen and Representative Babba for immediate assistance.

2227
02:41:37,042 --> 02:41:38,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Council President Caraviello.

2228
02:41:38,023 --> 02:41:38,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2229
02:41:38,963 --> 02:41:44,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, this is something I put on last year, and I asked, and now I'm kind of demanding, I mean, the weeds are,

2230
02:41:45,608 --> 02:41:57,598
[SPEAKER_16]: six feet tall, especially on the bridge area, and that whole area all along the Craddock Bridge, the Main Street Bridge and over there, I'd say severely overgrown, the weeds are growing everywhere onto the road.

2231
02:41:58,458 --> 02:42:01,300
[SPEAKER_16]: I say they haven't been cleaned in two years.

2232
02:42:02,221 --> 02:42:04,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, if we can, if they can please get those done.

2233
02:42:05,484 --> 02:42:08,326
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an eyesore for our community.

2234
02:42:09,427 --> 02:42:09,507
[SPEAKER_16]: So

2235
02:42:10,007 --> 02:42:17,537
[SPEAKER_16]: I request that we contact our two separate representatives, represent that area and get the DC out on it just to clean that up.

2236
02:42:17,877 --> 02:42:18,318
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a mess.

2237
02:42:18,919 --> 02:42:20,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2238
02:42:20,861 --> 02:42:21,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

2239
02:42:21,762 --> 02:42:22,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2240
02:42:24,382 --> 02:42:25,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

2241
02:42:25,943 --> 02:42:35,048
[SPEAKER_21]: I was down in that area the past couple of weeks at the farmer's market and also at one of the MFN concerts, and it is really overgrown.

2242
02:42:35,068 --> 02:42:36,449
[SPEAKER_21]: It needs to be addressed.

2243
02:42:36,649 --> 02:42:43,513
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw a parent walking their child on the sidewalk and the weeds were taller than the kid.

2244
02:42:43,833 --> 02:42:45,294
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's just unacceptable.

2245
02:42:46,114 --> 02:42:52,638
[SPEAKER_21]: And the DCR needs to do a better job of actually maintaining their property within our city.

2246
02:42:54,892 --> 02:43:05,997
[SPEAKER_21]: If you go to any of their properties within the city, it's just overgrown, and it has been mowed in ages, and we always have to ask for it to be mowed.

2247
02:43:06,037 --> 02:43:07,077
[SPEAKER_21]: It's never mowed on its own.

2248
02:43:07,858 --> 02:43:24,645
[SPEAKER_21]: So if I could amend the resolution to get some sort of a maintenance schedule from DCR as to how often they come to our city to maintain their properties, because to me, it always seems like they're not maintaining them unless we're asking, and they should be able to manage that on their own,

2249
02:43:25,742 --> 02:43:33,331
[SPEAKER_21]: without us getting involved but I want to see some sort of maintenance schedule so if the Councilor would allow I'd like to amend the resolution.

2250
02:43:33,631 --> 02:43:42,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President, if I could ask one more time, you know, with the advent of you know we have the, the, the people down there with the paddle Boston.

2251
02:43:43,643 --> 02:43:44,504
[SPEAKER_16]: I asked every year.

2252
02:43:45,388 --> 02:43:51,933
[SPEAKER_16]: please get the trees out of the water down there, especially with the Craddock Bridge, where those people rent the canoes and the kayaks.

2253
02:43:52,794 --> 02:43:57,097
[SPEAKER_16]: In that whole area, there's trees that are falling in the water and sticking up.

2254
02:43:58,018 --> 02:43:59,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Someone's gonna get hurt there at one time.

2255
02:43:59,319 --> 02:44:11,489
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I've asked probably three to four different times over the years, send someone down there and get the trees out of the water so nobody gets hurt in that water down there, in that Craddock area where Paddle Boston is.

2256
02:44:14,815 --> 02:44:17,176
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could amend that motion also.

2257
02:44:17,797 --> 02:44:24,860
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, further amended by Councilor Falco, and further amended by President Caraviello.

2258
02:44:25,201 --> 02:44:25,841
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

2259
02:44:26,061 --> 02:44:26,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

2260
02:44:26,581 --> 02:44:27,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

2261
02:44:27,182 --> 02:44:27,802
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

2262
02:44:28,362 --> 02:44:29,643
[SPEAKER_06]: The amendment is adopted.

2263
02:44:30,843 --> 02:44:34,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

2264
02:44:36,546 --> 02:44:37,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have something else?

2265
02:44:37,707 --> 02:44:40,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bear says he was out when it got to him.

2266
02:44:40,628 --> 02:44:41,329
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies.

2267
02:44:44,858 --> 02:44:44,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2268
02:44:45,078 --> 02:44:46,538
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies.

2269
02:44:46,618 --> 02:44:49,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper 21-507 offered by Councilor Bears.

2270
02:44:49,899 --> 02:45:01,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Be resolved by the Medford City Council that the utility pole blocking the middle of the sidewalk on Boston Ave across from the new Greenline Extension Station be moved to ensure full ADA access.

2271
02:45:02,823 --> 02:45:03,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

2272
02:45:03,985 --> 02:45:04,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2273
02:45:05,886 --> 02:45:12,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We have in this specific area, it's kind of right in between the garage where Tufts Police is and the heating and cooling building.

2274
02:45:13,029 --> 02:45:16,791
[SPEAKER_03]: There are three poles in the sidewalk right next to each other.

2275
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:19,252
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is holding a streetlight.

2276
02:45:19,652 --> 02:45:23,514
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two seem to be holding phone lines, electric lines, that kind of thing.

2277
02:45:23,914 --> 02:45:28,096
[SPEAKER_03]: The one holding the streetlight is dead center of the sidewalk, and you have to basically go

2278
02:45:29,401 --> 02:45:30,542
[SPEAKER_03]: in, out, up and around.

2279
02:45:30,642 --> 02:45:33,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't even know if you could fit a wheelchair through there.

2280
02:45:33,683 --> 02:45:35,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So that pole really needs to be removed.

2281
02:45:35,984 --> 02:45:41,106
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those services could be consolidated onto one pole that would not obstruct the access.

2282
02:45:41,646 --> 02:45:48,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially with the Greenline extension coming in, you know, that's gonna be a very highly trafficked area.

2283
02:45:48,969 --> 02:45:53,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope that with the construction and everything going on, that this is something that could be addressed quickly.

2284
02:45:53,311 --> 02:45:53,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

2335
02:49:05,236 --> 02:49:05,836
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

2336
02:49:06,157 --> 02:49:07,157

2338

2344
02:49:37,397 --> 02:49:54,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I think that once the word came out such an event, I think anytime that we have an opportunity to celebrate and stand hand in hand with our veterans, I think we as a community have to stand up and do so.

2345
02:49:54,591 --> 02:50:02,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this initiative forward and giving me the opportunity to spread the word and making sure that we all

[SPEAKER_11]: find our way to supporting our veterans that day and letting them know that the city of Medford truly, truly appreciates everything they've done for us and where we've come, where we are today and where we go tomorrow.

02:51:05,166 --> 02:51:11,489

2368
02:51:31,453 --> 02:51:38,839
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first got elected to the council, Fran was one of the first people I met in city government.

2369
02:51:39,479 --> 02:51:42,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And she always had a welcoming word, a smile on her face.

2370
02:51:43,242 --> 02:51:51,309
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter how many times I may have butt heads with the mayor that she was working for, she was always extremely friendly and kind.

2371
02:51:51,830 --> 02:51:55,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always appreciated that about Fran, and she will be sorely missed.

2411
02:54:18,716 --> 02:54:23,342

2414
02:54:37,570 --> 02:54:49,243
[SPEAKER_03]: communication from local 25 and Vice President Steve South regarding the priority sidewalk program and whether that would be outsourced by the city administration or whether it would be done by union workers.

2415
02:54:49,863 --> 02:54:56,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And we requested that the union and the city administration meet together to discuss the priority sidewalk program.

2416
02:54:57,690 --> 02:55:07,217
[SPEAKER_03]: My hope is that, A, that that meeting has happened, and that the other requests that we made of city staff on this issue have been fulfilled, and we can hopefully meet again relatively soon.

2417
02:55:07,777 --> 02:55:20,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I would guess at this point, probably in the month of September, to at least advance this further, if not, hopefully have the answers we are seeking, and maybe move this, report this out to the larger body.

2418
02:55:21,427 --> 02:55:23,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, on the motion, report this out.

[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be doing a huge fundraiser to support scholarships and other ventures for our kids here in Medford.

2454
02:57:43,652 --> 02:57:45,032

2455
02:57:46,433 --> 02:57:47,914
[SPEAKER_11]: That's still some openings.

2456
02:57:47,974 --> 02:57:50,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the team is working very hard.

2457
02:57:50,915 --> 02:57:55,878
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll have a I know Mr. Tanaka is working very hard.

2458
02:57:56,465 --> 02:58:05,961
[SPEAKER_11]: to prepare the 50 70 field that's in the far corner of car park to be, um, be renamed after Jimmy Maturana.

02:58:06,642 --> 02:58:08,165
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to have, uh,

2460
02:58:09,152 --> 02:58:16,756

[SPEAKER_11]: And then just like I said, just a great community day.

2462
02:58:20,978 --> 02:58:27,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It starts at nine o'clock, and I believe the ceremony is looking to be at two o'clock for the dedication.

2463
02:58:27,682 --> 02:58:33,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be a long day with a lot of fun and a lot of great stories.

2464
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:39,563
[SPEAKER_11]: for a great young man that's gone way too soon.

2465
02:58:39,944 --> 02:58:40,405
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

2466
02:58:41,045 --> 02:58:41,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2467
02:58:42,407 --> 02:58:42,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody else?

2468
02:58:43,008 --> 02:58:43,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything else?

2469
02:58:44,249 --> 02:58:45,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I could.

2470
02:58:46,625 --> 02:58:56,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, recently, the mayor's office submitted a press release regarding the strong stump removal in this community.

2471
02:58:57,368 --> 02:59:04,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I can gather, the mayor is subcontracting out to a private vendor.

2472
02:59:04,829 --> 02:59:10,911
[SPEAKER_06]: The removal of I think the article stated 26 tree stumps in the city of Medford.

2473
02:59:11,711 --> 02:59:19,676
[SPEAKER_06]: The last count that I think I received, which I think is sorely underestimated, was there was about 575 stumps.

2474
02:59:20,516 --> 02:59:22,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe it's much higher than that.

2475
02:59:23,658 --> 02:59:28,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Just from my informal, you know, cursory of the community.

2476
02:59:29,623 --> 02:59:45,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was quite disappointing to see a press release go out that addresses roughly 5% of the stumps that have been in this community for tens of years, to be quite frank.

2477
02:59:46,516 --> 02:59:57,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am very disappointed to see that we couldn't deal with these stumps in one fell swoop rather than just piecemeal it once again

2478
02:59:58,866 --> 03:00:06,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, as we heard today, there's trees being cut down, and those will be added to the stump list, and we're never going to get ahead of this.

2479
03:00:06,952 --> 03:00:23,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to express my disappointment with this latest attempt to get ahead of some of the concerns that I'm hearing from the community, which is stump removal, poor sidewalk conditions, and very poor road conditions in this community, Mr. President.

2480
03:00:23,545 --> 03:00:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that addresses anything by removing 5% of what we have out there.

2481
03:00:30,010 --> 03:00:31,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't sound like a game plan to me.

2482
03:00:32,032 --> 03:00:32,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2483
03:00:32,913 --> 03:00:33,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2484
03:00:33,673 --> 03:00:40,759
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may also just, I know it's in the agenda, but our September meeting is moved to the 21st instead of the 14th.

2485
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:43,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be meeting the 21st of September.

2486
03:00:44,202 --> 03:00:45,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President also.

2487
03:00:45,620 --> 03:00:45,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

2488
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:58,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Just while we're on the topic of tree stumps and poor condition of our city streets and sidewalks, the mayor also came out with a press release recently, Mr. President, asking residents to adopt a catch basin.

2489
03:01:01,412 --> 03:01:13,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are now asking residents to clean catch basins, which I always thought for years, and I've always asked during budget, we have a contract out to clean catch basins.

2490
03:01:14,358 --> 03:01:29,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not quite sure what direction we're going in this community, Mr. President, but we have to start asking residents to clean catch basins, I think is way out of whack Mr. President, and that's not what we should be asking residents to do in this community.

2491
03:01:29,285 --> 03:01:30,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2492
03:01:33,386 --> 03:01:34,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.

2493
03:01:34,547 --> 03:01:34,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, sir.

2494
03:01:37,934 --> 03:01:44,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record please cast a netting on the subject of Councilor Marks about the condition of the city.

2495
03:01:44,739 --> 03:01:46,821
[SPEAKER_18]: I once made a comment is looking.

2496
03:01:47,261 --> 03:01:50,323
[SPEAKER_18]: It's looking like Chelsea around here but I was, I was corrected.

2497
03:01:51,024 --> 03:01:53,626
[SPEAKER_18]: I looked at Chelsea Chelsea looks a lot better.

2498
03:01:55,767 --> 03:02:06,335
[SPEAKER_18]: I can point out defects and, but I don't want to complain too much behind doors with a difference for one example, the bricks are sticking up like eight inches.

2499
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:10,081
[SPEAKER_18]: It's incredible, and with the snow, you don't see that.

2500
03:02:11,562 --> 03:02:17,586
[SPEAKER_18]: But anyways, besides what my wife felt, Mr. Caballero tried to bring up that issue before we went on vacation.

2501
03:02:17,986 --> 03:02:21,088
[SPEAKER_18]: In front of Doris, what a difference, and she ripped her shoulder apart.

2502
03:02:21,828 --> 03:02:25,310
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank you, Councilors, for bringing up these concerns.

2503
03:02:25,791 --> 03:02:26,591
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know something?

2504
03:02:27,512 --> 03:02:31,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Out of 550 tree stumps, and we're going to fix 10%, maybe 50.

2505
03:02:32,074 --> 03:02:35,536
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to be involved with methadoncinitis.

2506
03:02:37,147 --> 03:02:40,389
[SPEAKER_18]: a chairman at that time, 2001 until Councilor Moss recalls.

2507
03:02:41,590 --> 03:02:42,270
[SPEAKER_18]: You know something?

2508
03:02:44,171 --> 03:02:46,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Put a planter with a hanging plant over it.

2509
03:02:46,692 --> 03:02:47,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Good night.

2510
03:02:47,293 --> 03:02:47,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.

2511
03:02:49,034 --> 03:02:51,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

2512
03:02:51,555 --> 03:02:59,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I could, it's not on the agenda, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention I did bump into a resident this morning.

2513
03:03:00,020 --> 03:03:02,521
[SPEAKER_06]: His mother, elderly mother, lives on Dwyer Circle.

2514
03:03:03,022 --> 03:03:04,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It's imperative that she gets out during the day

2515
03:03:05,563 --> 03:03:13,427
[SPEAKER_06]: and exercise, but unfortunately she's unable to because of all the uneven sidewalk panels on Dwyer Circle.

2516
03:03:13,447 --> 03:03:18,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd ask, challenge any of my colleagues to go out and take a walk around Dwyer Circle.

2517
03:03:18,369 --> 03:03:20,009
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a private way.

2518
03:03:20,350 --> 03:03:21,910
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a public road, Mr. President.

2519
03:03:22,270 --> 03:03:25,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in deplorable condition, the road and the sidewalks.

2520
03:03:26,212 --> 03:03:38,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I'm not going to put it formally, but these are the type of things, Mr. President, when you talk about quality of life, here's a woman that can't get out because they're afraid of a trip and fall hazard in front of her own home.

2521
03:03:39,854 --> 03:03:40,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2522
03:03:40,534 --> 03:03:40,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2523
03:03:41,595 --> 03:03:44,695
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I can remind everybody, go out and vote.

2524
03:03:46,956 --> 03:03:48,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Go out and vote on September 14th.

2525
03:03:51,416 --> 03:03:51,756
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry?

2526
03:03:53,257 --> 03:03:53,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2527
03:03:53,657 --> 03:03:54,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

2528
03:03:55,357 --> 03:03:55,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2529
03:03:56,635 --> 03:03:56,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2530
03:03:57,517 --> 03:03:58,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

2531
03:03:58,680 --> 03:03:59,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to adjourn.

2532
03:04:00,886 --> 03:04:03,854
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2533
03:04:03,935 --> 03:04:04,496
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor.
