Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to suspend the rules to take.

To take paper 21490.

23
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:54,334
Do I have a second?

00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,035
Second.

25
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:56,475
Seconded by Councilor Mears.

26
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,176
All those in favor?

27
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:57,756
Aye.

28
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:58,576
All opposed?

29
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:01,097
Motion passes.

30
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:08,681
21490 offered by President Caravaglia and Vice President Knight, being so resolved that the Memphis City Council

31
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:14,088
commend and congratulate the Medford Invitational Tournament on its 25th anniversary.

32
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:22,111
We would also like to thank the men and women who have helped the special needs children of Medford and greater Boston for the past 25 years.

33
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:27,232
Our challenge today will continue in the future, but it'll be run by the

34
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,331
District 12 Little League.

35
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:35,333
And we have a lot of people in the audience tonight that are from the organization.

36
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:42,616
And Ron, if you want to come up and say a few words before we get to say some good things about you.

37
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:47,057
Name and address of the record, please.

38
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:51,479
Ron Giovino, 326 East Porter Road, Medford, Mass.

39
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,339
Thank you.

40
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,360
For those who don't know,

41
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:59,145
Give a little brief synopsis on what the tournament's about and how long you've been doing it.

42
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,106
Yeah, so we began in 1996.

43
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:15,233
There's only one other left from that fateful day, Charlie Chimpaya, but we created a program to allow 12-year-old all-stars to play a very competitive baseball game.

44
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:22,756
Then we moved to running the Tufts Winter Clinic for 10 years.

45
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:31,464
We got involved, we created the Memphis Baseball Council that helped all the baseball leagues in the city join together and talk as one.

46
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:36,549
We took over some fledgling bankrupted leagues.

47
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:46,539
And then we turned on to Challenger Baseball, started in Malden for children with mental and physical health challenges.

48
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:59,890
We brought them here to Medford, had an incredible first game, and now 15 years later, a week from Sunday, we'll do it again for the final time for the Medford Invitational.

49
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,211
Thank you.

50
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:12,471
I want that support of the group.

51
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,493
Having one member of my family has been involved with the group for many years.

52
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:26,504
And thank you and Charlie and the other people involved there to be there on the Sunday and see the amount of work you guys put in and characters and the games and everything that goes on with it.

53
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:32,342
If you've never been before, try to come, it's a week from Sunday.

54
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,443
Try to make it, say it's a fun day.

55
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:37,045
If you'd like to help out, they're always looking for volunteers.

56
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:42,729
And if I may, I just want to say that this group behind me is just a portion of the great volunteers.

57
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,283
The families of the kids are amazing.

58
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,686
Our city officials have been very supportive, both in Medford and in Malden.

59
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:55,450
We couldn't do it without the business community who have given us such great financial backing.

60
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,871
So we're very proud to have done this.

61
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,632
It's a great community event.

62
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:02,655
I'm pleased that I get to be at least part of this.

63
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:03,235
Thank you.

64
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:06,497
You guys have done a great job over the years.

65
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:06,698
Thank you.

66
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:07,678
Thank you.

67
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:09,459
And I'm sorry to see that you're gonna end it.

68
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,661
And hopefully the group,

69
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:14,843
If that takes everything, we'll do just as good a job.

70
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,664
Councilor Mox.

71
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:19,966
Mr. President, maybe if Ron could just mention who's here with him today.

72
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:20,646
Yeah, I will.

73
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:33,412
I don't know if you wanna stand up, but the great Patty Falasca, who... President of the Billy Falasca Foundation, her grandson, little Billy.

74
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:38,474
Diane Butler.

75
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,094
Amel Techi Bariola.

76
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,418
Talk into the mic, talk into the mic.

77
00:04:49,839 --> 00:05:01,728
Kevin Chin, Tommy Russo, and our CFO and partner in crime and co-founder, Charlie Chimpaya.

78
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:07,253
That's it, Charlie.

79
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:10,324
Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:17,506
When you look at 1996, it's amazing what a bunch of volunteers did in our community.

81
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:29,029
To last 25 years and to go as strong as they did over 25 years is a true credit to all the volunteers that stuck it out this long.

82
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:33,590
I know there were some real lean and hard times during this whole process.

83
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:33,990
For sure.

84
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:45,935
You've, not only you, but everyone else here have been a stalwart in making this a real success and benefiting many aspects of our community.

85
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:48,656
And I think that's what goes a long way with me.

86
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:58,660
When you went to the challenger days and saw the smiles and the people that you touched, truly it's an amazing story.

87
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,714
and one that I'm not gonna forget.

88
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:11,043
Since I've been in office right around the same number of years, your group has been synonymous with community involvement.

89
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:18,030
and from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of all the residents of this community, I wanna thank you and all the volunteers here.

90
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:29,177
It's great to see such familiar faces and truly thank you and hopefully the next endeavor you come up with, which I'm sure you're working on right now, right, Ron?

91
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,120
I'll take that as a yes.

92
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,502
I wanna be part of that as well.

93
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,123
I appreciate all your efforts.

94
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:40,324
Thank you, thank you.

95
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:55,720
Now, I'm fortunate enough to know the gentleman at the podium, it's someone that I idolized growing up across the street, probably hit the farthest half ball home runs I've ever seen in life.

96
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,021
So some people looking, what is half ball?

97
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:08,845
But this is what, you know, we talked about the last year and how difficult the last, really the last year has been in really society.

98
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:14,248
And I think that, you know, we talk about, you know, the division in our community and

99
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:22,668
At that time, if you remember back then, Medford's baseball was sort of what the city was about today.

100
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:26,010
And there wasn't anybody really bringing that together.

101
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:26,550
And I think

102
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:34,175
Ronnie and your team really stood up and kind of put baseball back on the map in Medford.

103
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:39,237
I remember as a young man watching this happen and saying, wow, I would love to be part of that.

104
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:43,098
And you could hear the kids that I would teach, they would be so proud to be in that tournament.

105
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:52,042
And then to move it to the next level where you see where it really pays dividends and shows where

106
00:07:53,597 --> 00:08:08,265
the kids that needed it the most found something and reaching out to challenge it and having families, the Alaskans and the Butler's for some that have been supporting it for years and doing great things in our community.

107
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:13,188
And it's been a sad, it's been a sad couple of months here.

108
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:16,070
You know, you're hearing these different, all these

109
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:19,006
different changes in Medford.

110
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:24,668
And for someone who grew up with these great changes, I'm excited to see what the next step will be.

111
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:40,275
But when you see the moving on of a Michael Mox or the end of an era and challenger and the MIT and see what you guys have done, I want you to realize there's a reason why people want to move to Medford.

112
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:47,941
And it's people like yourself, Ron, and your team that made Medford the city that everybody loves and wants to be part of.

113
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,282
So I'm proud of that.

114
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,263
I'm proud to be your friend.

115
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:54,625
And I thank you for everything you've done.

116
00:08:54,945 --> 00:09:00,249
And I can't wait for Sunday's event and support you guys again.

117
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,691
And those people that don't know the reason why I leave,

118
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:05,590
I have a sweating problem.

119
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,551
So I don't know what it is lately.

120
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:14,855
It's like 90 degrees and humid and we have our, and you know, I try to, I've been pawning my kids off now.

121
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:15,955
Hey, we're going to volunteer.

122
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:18,497
And then I try to hide behind a tree.

123
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:28,122
So, but I just got to tell you, again, thank you for everything you do and we're definitely going to miss this.

124
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:28,542
So thanks.

125
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:31,086
Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:34,308
I also want to thank Ron and Charlie and all the volunteers that are here tonight.

127
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:40,952
I know a lot of time, effort, dedication, and commitment go into this on a yearly basis.

128
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:47,256
And to be doing this for 25 years, year after year, that's a long time.

129
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:55,381
But as you, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, and Councilor Marks, this has been a successful tournament year after year after year.

130
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,442
And it's something that you hear throughout the community.

131
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:05,232
Thank you so much for all your time, your commitment to the tournament, to the youth of our community.

132
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:06,674
I can't thank you enough.

133
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:11,360
And I just want to say thank you for your years of service and commitment to our community.

134
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:16,738
That's what we're up.

135
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:17,819
Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,879
I just want to echo what my fellow counselors are saying.

137
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,881
And thank you, Ron and the whole team for the tremendous amount of volunteer hours you've put in over 25 years.

138
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:29,683
Like my fellow counselors, I'm someone who benefited from youth sports, but those things don't happen on their own.

139
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:33,025
Someone has to put that together, hold it together for as long as you all have.

140
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:41,468
So I thank you for the tremendous effort, just this great community offering, and really just this offering, this inclusive offering to our young athletes in Medford.

141
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,309
So thank you and congratulations on 25 years of great work.

142
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,872
And what's the best.

143
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:51,194
I mean, I don't think I could say it any better than that.

144
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,376
The folks have been so involved for a long time.

145
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:55,337
I was only three years old when he started.

146
00:10:56,038 --> 00:11:01,882
So, I know a lot of my friends who played baseball and then friends were involved in the community.

147
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:04,664
I've been a part of the event over the years and I've really appreciated it.

148
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,320
I'm especially grateful that the Challenger Day will be continuing.

149
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,561
I think that's really important.

150
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:10,962
So thank you for your work.

151
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:12,423
Thank you all who are here for your work.

152
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:17,388
And hopefully your next endeavor will be as successful as this one.

153
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:18,729
Thank you.

154
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:24,634
And again, for those who haven't had a chance to look them down, see the special needs kids.

155
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:34,782
I mean, they have characters, and every year, the fire trucks, and I know the Batmobile was down there one year, and everybody pictures a great day.

156
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:42,954
I remember one year, Ron had me cook about 800 hot dogs.

157
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,835
He puts me on this table, this grill's about eight foot long.

158
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:49,736
By the time you turned it, you had to walk back to it again.

159
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,616
But again, thank you, thank you for all you've done for the special needs children.

160
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:58,277
And again, please try to come out on Sunday, next Sunday and help them out.

161
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:02,678
And just, you know, let's go to the chalkboard.

162
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:03,598
The mic's not on, Ron.

163
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:06,408
Thank you.

164
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:07,969
This is for our VIPs.

165
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:13,872
We have opening ceremonies that start at one, and we have closing ceremonies this year that start at three.

166
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:17,375
So you're welcome to join us at any point.

167
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:18,495
Really like to see you all there.

168
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:19,216
Thank you.

169
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,797
Just for the benefit of the viewing public, this is Sunday the 29th?

170
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:26,160
Sunday the 29th at Bruce Field, right in front of Irish American in Malden.

171
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,044
And we go inside after the game and have a nice little lunch and presentation.

172
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:34,930
We'd love you to just stop by and say hi.

173
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,550
Thank you again.

174
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,291
Thank you and your team for all the work that you do.

175
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:37,711
Thank you.

176
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:46,917
While we're on the suspension,

177
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,194
Councilor Scapi, can you make the motion on this?

178
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,835
I can't make the motion.

179
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,036
Is that a motion?

180
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:04,496
No, congratulations.

181
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:05,016
Yeah, right.

182
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:13,479
So make the motion that under special rules, we have a presentation from Councilor Falco to Eagle Scout.

183
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:18,075
No, we need to vote on this one first.

184
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:23,577
On the motion by Councilor Scalia to congratulate and seconded by Councilor Falco.

185
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:25,317
All those in favor.

186
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:27,818
All opposed, motion passes.

187
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:37,622
While we're on suspension, 2-1, 5-1-3 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Desmond Lambert on earning the rank of Eagle Scout.

188
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:39,703
Desmond, where are you?

189
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:41,304
Get up here, come on.

190
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,280
Oh, hi, my name is Desmond Lambert.

191
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,782
I live at 330 Baldwin Street.

192
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:06,005
You didn't have to do that, but thank you very much.

193
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:06,485
That was it.

194
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:09,427
Hey, I feel like the last procedure.

195
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:10,208
We like that.

196
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:11,269
That's perfect.

197
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,950
The clerk appreciates it.

198
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,651
He's a little slow today.

199
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:26,520
I'd like to begin by thanking Desmond Lambert for being here tonight and congratulating him on earning the rank of Eagle Scout.

200
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,622
This never gets tired.

201
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:46,310
We have celebrated, we've had a lot of Eagle Scouts in our community that have come through Troop 416, and a big congratulations to Desmond, and also a big thank you to his parents, Tim and Julie Lambert in the back.

202
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,944
was at the ceremony last night, and it was described as a journey scouting.

203
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:05,571
And it has taken many years, not just for Desmond, but for everyone that begins in scouting and sees it through to the end.

204
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,053
And I've had the

205
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:11,940
the pleasure of knowing Desmond for probably about 16 years now.

206
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:19,985
So I remember when he was just a kid and here he is a young man, he's made it through to the rank of Eagle Scout and he's done a fabulous job.

207
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:28,450
He's someone that is a really, really, I'm really proud of everything that he's done and he's come a long way.

208
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,934
And tonight we're going to be presenting him with the council accommodation from the Memphis City Council.

209
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:40,908
The Memphis City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Desmond Lambert.

210
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,112
Congratulations on being elevated to Eagle Scout.

211
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:50,159
The realization of this outstanding achievement will undoubtedly lead to success in accomplishments throughout your life.

212
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:52,701
Respectfully offered by John C. Falco Jr.'

213
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:53,923
's Memphis City Council.

214
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:55,965
Come on up, Desmond.

215
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:56,485
Thank you very much.

216
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,266
Mr. President, if we can.

217
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:57,706
Yes.

218
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:01,169
Well, Desmond's making his way up there.

219
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:08,496
I think that it's important that I think everybody here really celebrates Desmond's achievements.

220
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:22,128
I think that, you know, first, I've been given the honor in the past to present an Eagle Scout, and I think that was one of my biggest honors, because you realize how amazing and how important and

221
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,976
What an honor this is the great people that have done that.

222
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:34,286
So, and I know Chris Murphy comes out every year, every time there's an Eagle Scout presented as a fellow Eagle Scout he's here to present so here to show his respect.

223
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:38,371
So again, with your family and in the whole team behind you.

224
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:40,760
I know the work that has to be done to do that.

225
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,004
And I know Desmond understands the greatness that is upon you now.

226
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,768
You know, president, vice president, something big is gonna happen, Desmond.

227
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:51,029
Just don't forget Medford.

228
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,270
So thank you.

229
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:06,119
Mr. President, also, if we can get a commitment that Desmond is not going to run for local public office.

230
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,580
What do you have to worry about?

231
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,602
A true politician.

232
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:20,948
Desmond, if you could just relay, we've had other recipients come before us, and I know a big part of becoming an Eagle Scout

233
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,034
are the many adventures that you go on, but also the community service part of it.

234
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:29,978
And what project you've done to obtain the community service aspect.

235
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:37,707
Yeah, so my Eagle Scout project was I built a, like a big bench at the Medford dog park.

236
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,892
The more recent one at the middle schools.

237
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:52,187
And yeah, it served a couple purposes provided more seating, of course, but protected the tree that the dogs are getting at.

238
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:57,256
And yeah, I'd say that was a really cool project.

239
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:06,879
But like, in terms of the community service aspect, like the thing that's going to stick with me is the Veterans Day dinners that the scouts would put on every year.

240
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:11,481
And those, you know, we've been doing it for many years now.

241
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,882
And it's something that we really take pride in.

242
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,423
It comes up every year.

243
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,243
And, and

244
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:26,796
Having that commitment, it shows a lot, but it also teaches the right practices.

245
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:30,177
I think that is something I'd like to highlight a little bit more.

246
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:32,098
That's excellent.

247
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:39,621
And every Eagle Scout that we've spoken with always states that it wasn't just solely their effort.

248
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:43,283
It was other people that helped them along the way.

249
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,444
And I know you have a few people with you today.

250
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:46,726
Yes, yes, of course.

251
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:52,210
I'd like to shout out my parents as well, Julie and Tim Lambert.

252
00:18:53,131 --> 00:19:10,844
It really is a group effort and you can't say it's all one person, but it was everything that all the volunteers put in and all the scouts around you, how they contribute to your journey as well.

253
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:21,850
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the Eagle Scouts before me that that pushed me to, you know, achieve this goal.

254
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,891
And, you know, I owe a lot to them as well.

255
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,432
That's great.

256
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,233
Well, you're truly a fine young gentleman.

257
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,615
I look for great things from you in the future.

258
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:38,838
And I'd also like to thank your parents that are here tonight for their involvement.

259
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:48,762
And I also would like to thank Councilor Falco, who since I've been on the council with them, I think has recognized a number of Eagle Scouts.

260
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,424
And I think he holds that great responsibility.

261
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:58,278
obtaining of that badge as a real high honor.

262
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:00,820
And I want to thank him as well and congratulate you.

263
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,540
Thank you.

264
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:02,741
Thank you, Counselor Marks.

265
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,723
President Caviello.

266
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:05,503
Thank you.

267
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:09,206
Thank you for earning your Eagle Scout.

268
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:17,392
I think there's something in the water in Medford that I think, I don't know, since I've been here 10 years, an awful lot of Eagle Scouts have come through.

269
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:22,124
I don't know if Meffitt has a record or something, but I want to thank you.

270
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:31,970
You did say something which was good, how you enjoy doing the community service and how it feels good to do something for somebody, especially with the veterans.

271
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:35,472
It's a great project you guys got behind.

272
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,514
There's nothing better than the feeling of helping somebody.

273
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:42,596
And again, I want to thank you and your family for everything you did.

274
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,438
And again, congratulations on whatever you,

275
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,912
You moving, are you going to college?

276
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,072
Are you going anywhere?

277
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,614
Yeah, I'm going to Bunker Hill right now.

278
00:20:50,914 --> 00:21:04,362
So I'm, you know, don't really know what exactly I'm gonna pursue, but it's one of those things that why go into a lot of debt?

279
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,325
So yeah, just buy myself a little more time and I don't know.

280
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,252
getting through this pandemic.

281
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:13,615
Good for you.

282
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:15,058
Just keep on doing what you're doing.

283
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:15,840
You're doing a good job.

284
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:16,782
Congratulations.

285
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:17,664
Thank you very much.

286
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:19,488
Thank you, President Caviello.

287
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,534
Thank you, Councilor Fabio, and thank you for bringing this forward.

288
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:25,274
Congratulations, Desmond.

289
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:41,419
As someone who dropped out of the Brownies after about one year, the level of dedication and commitment that it takes to get to the rank of Eagle Scout is just something that will serve you so well in your life, but already serves the city of Medford and will continue to serve us as long as you choose to stay here.

290
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:47,261
So I just congratulate you on such an achievement and all of your hard work to get here.

291
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:48,161
Thank you.

292
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:51,643
Thank you, Mr. President.

293
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:53,044
Congratulations.

294
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,687
I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends at Medford High School who also became Eagle Scouts.

295
00:21:57,727 --> 00:22:03,330
And I think at some point I was in, you know, 10 years ago or so I was back in this audience congratulating them.

296
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,912
So I know what kind of accomplishment it is.

297
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:11,094
And I think your, your attitude is right on about about community service as well.

298
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:12,095
And all I can say about

299
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:14,848
Bunker Hill, I think that's a smart choice.

300
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:23,713
And if you do two years there, and you do well, you can transfer to a public university, know what you wanna do, get out in four, and get a good degree.

301
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,233
So I like that.

302
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:29,856
And if you have any questions about that whole process, I've been involved with it for a few years now.

303
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,878
So my contact information is on the website.

304
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:35,899
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

305
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,281
And to answer your question, Councilor Marks, Councilor Carrillo,

306
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:59,925
The past 10 years, there have been 17 Eagle Scouts that have come from Troop 416, which is a remarkable achievement for Troop 416, for their commitment and dedication to the community and to the Scouts.

307
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,880
And once again, like we said before, it's a journey.

308
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,501
It always takes a good support system.

309
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:06,624
So thanks to mom and dad as well.

310
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:09,306
And we wish you well.

311
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:09,727
Good luck.

312
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,168
And congratulations.

313
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:12,730
We take a picture, Mr. President?

314
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,331
Absolutely.

315
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:13,771
Let's do that.

316
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,222
Thank you, Mr. President.

317
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,981
Mr. President, I'd like to move approval on that motion.

318
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:27,826
All those in favor?

319
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:28,566
Aye.

320
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:29,707
Opposed?

321
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:31,188
Motion passes.

322

00:28:31,891 --> 00:28:35,212
That office will not be part of the September preliminary election.

371
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,650
Do you know what dates those mailings will be going out?

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,691
Should be going out either late this week or the beginning of next week.

373
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:25,556
Can you give me the name and address of the record, please?

00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:29,480
George P. Hassett Drive.

I'm currently the acting city election coordinator.

To the best of my knowledge, those postcards went out today.

377
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:39,284
They went out today, okay.

378
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:39,565
Yes.

379
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:41,305
Is it just one round of postcards?

380
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:42,546
Are there going to be multiple mailings?

381
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,708
One round of postcards for this election and three robocalls.

382
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,089
Is that correct, Mr. Clerk?

383
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:51,110
It's one round of postcards for this election.

384
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,142
One round of postcards and two robocalls.

385
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:08,743

00:30:20,374 --> 00:30:21,976
I can't get it to turn on, Councilor Bearce.

391
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:25,500

Council Meeks.

415

While we're in suspension, we take paper 21-508 communications from city offices and employees.

416
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:11,712

417
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:12,673

Communications from city offices employees, 21-508.

419
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:30,305
To President Caravaglio and members of Memphis City Council, registered voters at Inverter Beach Clerk, early in mail voting, date August 12th,

420
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:47,393
2021.

421
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:47,393
On July 29, Governor Baker signed Chapter 29 of the Acts of 2021 among the items that the legislation extends early voting by mail for all elections through December 15 of this year.

422
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:54,801
The legislation also allows the City Council to designate

423
00:31:56,132 --> 00:32:02,455
in-person early voting for any election upon request or recommendation of the local election official.

424
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:16,102
Within the parameters of the legislation, I am requesting and recommending four days of in-person early voting leading into the preliminary municipal election on September 14th.

425
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:25,267
And I am requesting and recommending five days of in-person early voting leading into the municipal election on November 2nd.

426

For the preliminary municipal election on September 14th, I am requesting and recommending that you designate the following four days and times for in-person early voting.

All in-person early voting would occur as with past practice in the city council chambers.

438
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:25,460
For the municipal election on November 2, I am requesting and recommending that you designate the following five days in time for in-person early voting again in the city

439
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,593
Council Chambers.

00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:31,656

Normal City Hall Business Hours.

449
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:48,263
Wednesday,

450
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,222
October 27th, 8.30 a.m.

451
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:54,525
to 7.30 p.m., normal city hall business hours.

to 4.30 p.m., normal city hall business hours.

454
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:14,723
For both elections, in-person early voting can begin not less than 10 days before the election and must end no later than the business day before the business day preceding the election.

455
00:34:15,564 --> 00:34:19,193
Thank you very much for your consideration of these requests and recommendations.

456
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:24,144
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

457
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:26,532
Absolutely wrong.

458
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:27,893
Thank you, Mr President.

459
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:33,015
I just have a question for the clerk for the chair for the note about for both elections in person.

460
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:36,317
Early voting can begin not less than 10 days before the election.

461
00:34:36,997 --> 00:34:40,779
Um, this it seems for the September election.

462
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:43,100
That's it's in a smaller window of time.

463
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,601
Is that because of the Labor Day holiday?

464
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:46,882
There's like special exception for that.

465
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,043
That is that is correct.

466
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:56,209
Counselor can begin not less than that, because and with Labor Day weekend, uh, right, we wouldn't want to do the voting on a holiday weekend, right?

467
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,730
So that is that is correct.

468
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,610
Okay, thank you.

469
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,920
Any further discussion?

470
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,920
Mr. President?

471
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:04,121
Councilor Marks?

472
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:10,022
We happen to have Sandy Gale that's here, who's the acting elections coordinator.

473
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:24,325
So I was wondering if she could step to the podium, just basically tell this council the need for early voting in this community and her staffing levels.

474
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:30,947
And I want to make sure that we administratively are able to pull this off, Mr. President.

475
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:33,209
in a very important city election.

476
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:38,654
Mr. President, Councilor Marks through the chair.

477
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:46,181
Um, I think that early voting is is a very important aspect of elections.

478
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:47,422
However, given

479
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:56,771
The preliminary election, it's my opinion that I don't believe we need four days.

480
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:00,993
I think in initial talks with the clerk, we were ready to jump on board.

481
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,615
For the full four days, I think five days would have been absolutely impossible.

482
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:15,100
But I think we could achieve the same goal if we drop that to two days, which would be Wednesday, the 8th, and Thursday the 9th.

483
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,102
We still would have over-the-counter voting,

484
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,091
going on in the clerk's office for that Friday and the Tuesday.

485
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:34,094
So people that vote absentee and are accustomed to voting in that office for preliminary elections, they still would have that opportunity to do so.

486
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:47,657
That also would reduce budgetary costs for early voting because I do have to have a minimum of probably eight staff, including myself.

487
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,284
I have the staff.

488
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:52,605
That's not a problem.

489
00:36:52,865 --> 00:37:00,712
But to reduce on a preliminary election some cost, it probably would be a worthy idea.

490
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:04,074
So through you, Mr President.

491
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:11,580
So, Sandy, the coverage of the poll that's gonna be here at City Hall.

492
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,523
Is that done with existing city employees or

493
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,064
of these poll workers that would come in?

494
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:28,219
Mr. President, Councilor Marks, it would be done with existing election workers that have done early voting last year all the way since 2016.

495
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:34,668
It's been an ongoing training process for that early voting.

496
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:39,071
Initially when we started in 2016, everything was on paper.

497
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:44,014
Now we are lucky enough to have poll pads that we use that we can look voters up.

498
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:56,744
There's a barcode so that when we process those ballots downstairs in the registrar voters office after voting has closed, we scan the barcode and it automatically takes that person out of the system.

499
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,627
so they can't come and try to vote early again.

500
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:04,752
So it's an ongoing evolving process.

501
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:12,638
So just so I understand, it's not done with existing registrar voters employees.

502
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,281
It is at night.

503
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,702
At night, okay.

504
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:20,005
When voting is all done for the day.

505
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:24,769
So the process is you come in, you check in through the poll pad,

506
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,104
you are given an affirmation envelope or what we call an EV7.

507
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:36,328
You're affirming on that envelope that you are the registered voter that is listed in the rolls.

508
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,571
You sign the envelope, put your address, print your name.

509
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,053
You are then sent back to a table.

510
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:48,958
And since we all get the same ballot, this time around, there's no confusion about ballots and things like that.

511
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:52,261
So everybody for the preliminary will get exactly the same ballot.

512
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:59,806
They get their ballot, go to the booth, fold it up, put it in the envelope, and then they drop it in the ballot box on their way out the door.

513
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:19,320
We close the gap after voting is over for the day when myself or the clerk, with a police escort, take those ballots downstairs to the Registrar of Voters Office, and we open the VRIS system, which is our state voter registration information system.

514
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:23,067
and we scan each one of those barcodes.

515
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,628
And that generates a list.

516
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:34,854
The difference with the preliminary this time is the plan is to send them out to the precincts to be tabulated on election day.

517
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:38,096
So they would be handled like absentee ballots.

518
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:43,780
And they would go with a checklist that would be created by us.

519
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:50,844
And my other question, I did read through Chapter 29 of the Acts of 2021.

520
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:51,265
Yes.

521
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:59,898
And I thought I read and correct me if I'm wrong, there's language in there for people that are unable to attend the in-person

522
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:08,447
voting that would allow the registrar voters office to actually go out to homes and have people vote by ballot.

523
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:08,968
Is that correct?

524
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:09,848
That is correct.

525
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:12,890
We've always offered that service in Medford.

526
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,232
It depends on I'm last year.

527
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:21,176
It was a little, um, a little more dicey because of Cove it and

528
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:30,723
being in the midst of a pandemic, we had to get a little more creative, like putting things in baggies or having the police drive or something like that.

529
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:39,310
But we've always offered that service, and I personally have done it myself for someone that had a disabled child that could not get to the polls.

530
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:43,294
And I took the ballot out and allowed her to vote.

531
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:48,438
And I do believe that the Board of Registrars also has done that in the past.

532
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:53,284
And does that need to happen in conjunction with the days that we approve?

533
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,045
Or does that happen right up until the election?

534
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:59,927
I think that happens right up until the election and including election day.

535
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:04,168
Because you don't ever know what type of emergency situation.

536
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:09,891
And you certainly don't want to turn a voter away because someone can't get out there.

537
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:17,034
That's one of the reasons why we have registrars and people who are equipped to do that.

538
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:23,580
And that's great, and I think part of offering this is also notifying the public that it exists.

539
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,222
Because when I read the acts, I wasn't familiar with some of it myself, and I've been around for a while.

540
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:40,525
So I think part of the outreach that will be done between now and the plenary and the general election should include that outreach, what options people have available.

541
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,165
So I'd ask that that be done.

542
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:47,267
Have you had the opportunity to put a monetary value on

543
00:41:48,408 --> 00:42:04,279
what it's gonna cost the city to provide each day with having election employees as well as I would assume you'd need a police officer present for the time and any other associated costs with allowing the in-person voting?

544
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:09,763
A rough guesstimate is it probably would cost

545
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,956
roughly it's gonna cost about between 750 and 800.

546
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:26,718
Does that sound fair, Mr. Clerk?

547
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:28,039
That's ballpark.

548
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,640
Yeah, that's ballpark.

549
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,243
And that would be based on the number of days that you offered the full for the preliminary?

550
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,524
No, that's for both days.

551
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:38,746
That's for two days of early voting.

552
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,107
So it's roughly about $400 a day.

553
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,889
So that's for two days of early voting.

554
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:55,753
Based on what you're telling me, I feel very comfortable, especially knowing the preliminary election in this community typically has a real low turnout.

555
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,778
And I think having the early voting in person voting

556
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,106
for four days sounds kind of excessive.

557
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:08,408
Friday to me is kind of a lost day because Friday City Hall closes at 1230.

558
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:10,869
So you're really only getting four hours on a Friday.

559
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:14,790
I much prefer having the extended hours on the Wednesday.

560
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:18,024
for those that may be working and can't make it during the day.

561
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:33,697
So I would support and put it in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we have the early in-person voting for the preliminary on Wednesday, September 8th, from 8.30 to 7.30 p.m.

562
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:35,979
That's normal business hours.

563
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:41,844
And Thursday, September 9th, from 8.30 to 4.30, and that's for the preliminary.

564
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:49,026
and Wednesday, October 27th, 8.30 to 7.30, and Thursday, October 28th, 8.30 to 4.30.

565
00:43:49,106 --> 00:44:04,556
From my tabulations, that's 19 hours of additional in-person options that people have in addition to mail-in ballots and so forth and other options that they may have, Mr. President, for voting.

566
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:08,218
So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

567
00:44:08,258 --> 00:44:10,180
Point of information, Mr. President.

568
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:19,054
What are the information for your early voting in October, which is for your general election in November?

569
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:27,455
The one thing that you want to do is definitely capture at least one weekend day so that those folks who work a regular job.

570
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:37,617
I do think that in the October early voting for the general election, you do need to offer all five days.

571
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:47,919
That's my opinion and based on looking at what the numbers were for early voting last year, we have a much higher turnout.

572
00:44:48,240 --> 00:45:06,925
And without really knowing where we're going to be as far as community health concerns in regards to the Delta variant in Medford, the controlled environment that we have here with help from DPW who comes in and fogs for us every two hours,

573
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:13,772
it's probably a little bit more important for the general to have that five days.

574
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:20,516
I just don't know why this would be any more controlled than any other poll.

575
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:22,137
Don't we follow the same standards?

576
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:24,198
Yes and no.

577
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:35,704
I don't anticipate having sanitizers and spacers in the precincts unless something develops in the next several weeks.

578
00:45:36,389 --> 00:45:41,451
that the governor reissues a mask mandate or reissues closings.

579
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:48,954
So I didn't anticipate having sanitizers and spacers as I did last November.

580
00:45:50,594 --> 00:45:57,617
So the staff in a polling location has changed even from March of last year.

581
00:45:58,517 --> 00:46:05,700
We had a warden and a clerk, two check-in inspectors, and two check-out inspectors.

582
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:13,213
Under these acts, we have eliminated the checkout inspectors, which has worked much better.

583
00:46:14,914 --> 00:46:19,196
So at this point, Mr. President, I'll listen to what my colleagues have to say.

584
00:46:19,216 --> 00:46:26,359
I will withdraw the motion I put forth for the general election and listen to my colleagues.

585
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,523
I do want to say, Mr. President, that it's vital that we have an election coordinator in position

586
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:38,453
which this council has been pushing for for several years now.

587
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:48,820
And Sandy Gill has been our election coordinator for all intents and purposes for a couple of decades now in the community, Mr. President.

588
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,005
As we found out, Sandy is acting and the administration's working on apparently

589
00:46:57,635 --> 00:46:59,477
uh, posting the position and so forth.

590
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:10,686
But we also heard from the city administration less than an hour ago that they like to get people into acting roles and then push them into the role, Mr President.

591
00:47:11,046 --> 00:47:12,348
And here we have someone

592
00:47:12,928 --> 00:47:16,669
that's been acting, doing the job, a very capable person.

593
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:26,150
That's another thing we heard from the city administration, that they wanna make sure if they are gonna put someone in an acting role, they're capable, and then also have the ability to do the job.

594
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,391
And here we have someone that's capable doing the job.

595
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:41,933
I don't know what the hangup is, but in my opinion, 26 years elected in this city, Mr. President, the integrity of our election process is of the utmost importance.

596
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:48,901
And if people lose confidence in how we run an election, Mr. President, I don't want to be around for that.

597
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:56,303
So I think it's important that we have a coordinator, the council recognize that, while waiting for the city administration to follow through.

598
00:47:56,323 --> 00:48:00,265
And it's vital, Mr. President, we have someone in that role.

599
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:10,508
I appreciate Sandy's and the acting role, and I think it's about time the city administration gets off their duff and does something, Mr. President, in order to maintain

600
00:48:10,995 --> 00:48:13,335
of the integrity and security of our elections.

601
00:48:13,395 --> 00:48:13,716
Thank you.

602
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:14,216
Thank you.

603
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:15,156
Councilor Raul.

604
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:16,936
Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:22,717
I understand the rationale of Councilor Marks' motion, as well as what Ms.

606
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:23,837
Gail is sharing.

607
00:48:23,897 --> 00:48:28,898
I personally don't feel comfortable cutting the days for early voting for the preliminary.

608
00:48:28,998 --> 00:48:32,299
I would support the original four days that were recommended.

609
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:36,760
And that's just, as an elected official, I don't feel comfortable limiting the days.

610
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,640
Thank you.

611
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:39,258
Councilor Behrs.

612
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,298
Thank you, Mr. President.

613
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:49,680
Through you to Coordinator Gale, my first question is on the mail-in voting.

614
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:57,641
Are we or is the Secretary of State's office going to be sending a postcard out to let people know that they can apply for a mail ballot?

615
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:06,663
At this time, I'm sorry, through the Chair, Councilor Behrs, at this time, the only

616
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:19,004
advertisement is the Secretary of State making infomercials or having on their website that you can vote by mail.

617
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,565
There is a link.

618
00:49:21,385 --> 00:49:23,145
I did work with Ms.

619
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:31,708
Peeks like a week and a half ago on putting some information up on our Medford website where you could click the link, download the application.

620
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:36,409
It's very important that when voters download that application,

621
00:49:36,983 --> 00:49:44,328
that they don't type their name in, they have to sign it, physically sign it, or we will be returning it, the application will be rejected.

622
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:47,310
We did run into some of that last year.

623
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,853
The mail-in is an evolving process.

624
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:52,013
We are learning.

625
00:49:52,194 --> 00:49:55,556
Last year, it was done on a scale that had never been done before.

626
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:58,298
But by November, we were perfect.

627
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:03,862
So we've learned and made notes, and we have the plan.

628
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:20,861
It's just getting the information out there, which also brings me to, the clerk and I have already ordered a large banner to hang, reminding people that September the 14th is preliminary election day.

629
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:30,389
We have lawn signs to go throughout the city and two larger signs that are gonna be put on frames in the front lawn to get voter awareness out there.

630
00:50:31,982 --> 00:50:40,425
But as of right now, in my last account from the state, which was earlier today, no, they are not sending out any postcards.

631
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:57,751
But it is important for voters to know on this platform that if you're applying for a mail-in ballot for the preliminary election, that one application covers you for preliminary and general.

632
00:50:58,351 --> 00:50:59,752
So you only have to do it once.

633
00:51:00,943 --> 00:51:05,985
That's helpful, yeah, and I have full confidence in the mail process and the votes being all of that.

634
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:09,906
I think it's the question of do people know that it's still an option?

635
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:12,927
So I'm glad to hear that there's gonna be some efforts made.

636
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:16,909
I think for the, I guess my question, then I'll make my comment.

637
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:22,531
How, is there a date, can I request a mail ballot today for these elections?

638
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:25,532
Through the chair, yes, Councilor Behrs, you can.

639
00:51:25,692 --> 00:51:26,452
Okay.

640
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:29,073
You can request one right up until,

641
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,930
I believe it's the eighth, Mr. Clerk.

642
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,231
I have to check the exact schedule.

643
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:45,132
I think it's five days before the election.

644
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:48,193
Five days before, I believe it is the eighth of September.

645
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,834
It might be six days before the election.

646
00:51:50,034 --> 00:51:55,936
So that would be, yeah, it's the eighth of the ninth, but I think Sandy's right, I think it's the eighth.

647
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:57,356
All right, that's great.

648
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,117
Yeah, and I would just maybe suggest, I know,

649
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:10,421
It may incur a cost, maybe even a pretty significant cost, but letting voters know the options, maybe via a postcard or a robocall of some kind, I think would be helpful.

650
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:14,723
Just because the law, I mean, it's right here.

651
00:52:15,563 --> 00:52:18,724
This came to us August 12th, the law was signed July 29th.

652
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:20,364
There's kind of been some back and forth.

653
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:23,305
There's some concerns that some options may not be available.

654
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:28,247
So I do think just to make sure voters know all their options, that could be helpful.

655
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,448
we can we council bears.

656
00:52:30,468 --> 00:52:40,031
We can request a we can request reverse 911 postcard would be, um, might be prohibitively prohibitively expensive on this one.

657
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:48,433
Um, last year, as you'll recall, the Secretary of State's office, in other words, the Commonwealth covered the cost for all those postcards, which was a which is a very large cost.

658
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:54,075
But I think we can definitely do some reverse 911 citywide alerting people to this.

659
00:52:54,555 --> 00:52:54,615
Um,

660
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:57,736
part of the reason and we'd be more than happy to do that.

661
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:05,320
Um, particularly if you act tonight on the early voting dates, because we can get all that we can get all that information out at once, and we could do it more than once.

662
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:06,781
Fantastic.

663
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:15,325
And then on early voting, I personally I hear Council marks on the low turnout, but this is the first election I can remember

664
00:53:16,523 --> 00:53:19,966
in many, many years where we've had a preliminary election for the office of mayor.

665
00:53:20,886 --> 00:53:25,929
So I think that may significantly increase turnout from a preliminary elections in the past.

666
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:32,334
So I personally would like to maintain the four days of early voting for the preliminary election.

667
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:44,882
I know that I respect your view on it, and I understand that it would save about $1,000, but I just don't think we know what turnout might be and having three candidates

668
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:47,543
is is unusual.

669
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:49,384
Custom rope.

670
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:51,425
Thank you, Mr President.

671
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:52,825
Council bears job.

672
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:53,246
My memory.

673
00:53:53,306 --> 00:53:57,088
I've seen some people if I could for coordinator Gail through the chair.

674
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:01,470
People voted absentee for the first time last November.

675
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,792
They still need to request to vote absentee to vote mail in ballot again.

676
00:54:05,872 --> 00:54:06,092
Correct.

677
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,653
They're not going to automatically get something.

678
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:10,339
Through the chair, Councilor Morrell, yes.

679
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:14,300
They need to request a new application for this year.

680
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:21,321
And that application will cover them for the preliminary election and for the general November 2nd.

681
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:26,643
So they only need to do it once and it stays checked in our file system.

682
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:33,067
in VRIS so that we know, okay, they requested we have to mail this out.

683
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:37,348
There have been no ballots mailed out as of this time because they were just ordered today.

684
00:54:37,868 --> 00:54:45,331
Great, thank you, because I've seen that question posed in a number of places, and I just want to thank you and the clerk for doing the work on the banner and the signs.

685
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:49,372
That's a request I've seen for a number of years, so I'm really excited to see those go out.

686
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:50,072
Thank you.

687
00:54:51,032 --> 00:54:51,393
Thank you.

688
00:54:51,473 --> 00:54:52,553
Chair recognizes Councilor Fevella.

689
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:57,863
Thank you, Mr. President, and miss Gail, thank you so much for your presentation and the clerk as well.

690
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:11,568
And we've been talking about advertising elections for a while, and it's it's great to see that this is occurring, and it's, you know, it's I said we're reaching out trying to engage people, and you know being part of the process of voting.

691
00:55:12,189 --> 00:55:14,529
I for one, I completely understand the rationale for.

692
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:31,556
reducing the number of days, but for me, I like to see that this flexibility, so I would be in favor of keeping the four days in person early voting as stated here, the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th for the preliminary.

693
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:32,277
That would be

694
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:38,927
I think it's great that we have the flexibility, especially with concerns of COVID and whatnot.

695
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:44,589
If someone's weary, they had the flexibility of coming over a multiple number of days.

696
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:49,351
So I think four days is ideal, and I would be in favor of the four days.

697
00:55:49,891 --> 00:55:50,211
Thank you.

698
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:52,692
Through the chair, thank you, Councilor Thompson.

699
00:55:54,032 --> 00:55:56,453
Have we been in contact with the post office yet?

700
00:55:56,473 --> 00:56:00,154
I know last time we had some issues with the post office.

701
00:56:02,857 --> 00:56:04,218
Mr. President, I do.

702
00:56:04,338 --> 00:56:08,763
I have a direct contact now at the post office when the issues began to arise.

703
00:56:09,684 --> 00:56:20,894
I went in person to the post office and I have a direct contact here and we've made an agreement how our in city mail will be handled, especially if it's ballots.

704
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:24,758
So generally the track of mail

705
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:33,524
in Medford is it goes to Forest Street, and then from Forest Street it goes into Boston, and from Boston it comes back out to Medford.

706
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:46,014
So my contact at the Forest Street post office, as long as we keep it separated as to local mail and non-local mail, meaning non-Medford delivery, they will deliver immediately.

707
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:52,900
I also have a postal connection that I made last year at the urging of the clerk

708
00:56:53,650 --> 00:57:00,492
to establish some groundwork with another gentleman at the post office in Boston.

709
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:10,136
And he oversees all cities and towns in any mailing through the Secretary of State's office, and I have a very good rapport with both of them.

710
00:57:11,156 --> 00:57:14,417
So I don't anticipate that to be an issue at all.

711
00:57:15,578 --> 00:57:15,778
Thank you.

712
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:16,758
You're welcome.

713
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:18,919
Any further discussion?

714
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,720
Okay.

715
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:33,612
Council Marks, you have a motion on the floor to have the yearly voting for just Wednesday and Thursday, correct?

716
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:42,536
Based on the recommendation of our elections coordinator for the preliminary, I withdrew my recommendations for the general election.

717
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:50,079
So, on the motion by Council Marks,

718
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:57,042
As amended, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

719
00:57:57,362 --> 00:57:58,382
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

720
00:57:58,902 --> 00:58:02,643
So I need some clarification.

721
00:58:03,343 --> 00:58:10,024
Are you voting on the two days of early voting for September and then all the additional days for October, or are they separate votes?

722
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:11,324
No, it's one vote.

723
00:58:12,344 --> 00:58:15,305
So the motion is to reduce it to two?

724
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:16,005
The two days.

725
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:16,665
For the preliminary.

726
00:58:17,365 --> 00:58:21,426
For the preliminary, for the Wednesday and the Thursday on the recommendation

727
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:23,907
of the election coordinator.

728
00:58:33,452 --> 00:58:33,592
Yes.

729
00:59:05,252 --> 00:59:06,712
Wait, wait, wait, what?

730
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:14,994
I had a question about if it was severed or not, because I wanna, I don't know what, okay.

731
00:59:15,254 --> 00:59:15,915
Are we voting?

732
00:59:18,195 --> 00:59:20,116
The motion is by Councilor Marks.

733
00:59:20,376 --> 00:59:22,516
He supported the motion as amended.

734
00:59:22,936 --> 00:59:30,098
He's amending the motion to reduce the early voting in four days to two on the Wednesday and Thursday.

735
00:59:30,618 --> 00:59:34,721
I would like to vote on the amendment first and then vote on the... Do you want to sever?

736
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:40,645
I don't... They asked me a motion to sever the vote.

737
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:45,848
Wait a second, we're voting on the whole package at once.

738
00:59:46,509 --> 00:59:59,357
Yeah, I would like to vote on the amendment proposed by Councilor Marks and then vote on the final paper, depending on... And then that version of the final paper will be determined on the vote of the amendment, if that makes sense.

739
00:59:59,457 --> 01:00:00,238
I'm not opposed to that.

740
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:09,638
Okay, so on the amendment, a motion by Councilor Maxwell to reduce the days from four to two.

741
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,202
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

742
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:14,844
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

743
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:19,009
So this is to reduce from four to two, for the preliminary.

744
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:19,649
For the preliminary.

745
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:33,391
Councilor Bears?

746
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:34,151
No.

747
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:36,033
Councilor Falco?

748
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:36,373
No.

749
01:00:37,374 --> 01:00:38,435
Vice President Knight is absent.

750
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:39,156
Councilor Marks?

751
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:40,017
Yes.

752
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:41,378
Councilor Morrell?

753
01:00:41,598 --> 01:00:41,798
No.

754
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:43,680
Councilor Scarpelli?

755
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,040
Yes.

756
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:48,184
President Caraballo?

757
01:00:48,484 --> 01:00:48,664
Yes.

758
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:51,647
It's a tie, we have a tie.

759
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:54,330
Motion fails.

760
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,452
That generally means motion fails.

761
01:00:57,092 --> 01:00:57,613
Motion fails.

762
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:02,717
So does that mean that there's no early voting?

763
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:04,978
No, I'm now moving to approve.

764
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,679
There'll be four days now.

765
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:08,099
I move to approve.

766
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,220
We gotta vote on it.

767
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,721
Approve.

768
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:12,201
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

769
01:01:12,221 --> 01:01:17,964
Motion to approve all nine days of early voting, four for the preliminary, five for the general.

770
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:19,945
I'd ask that we sever that vote, Mr. President.

771
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:23,327
What do you want to sever out of that?

772
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,831
take them as two distinct votes, Mr. President.

773
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:27,892
Preliminary and the general election.

774
01:01:27,932 --> 01:01:28,532
That's fine with me.

775
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:40,658
Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Beers to vote on the preliminary dates, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

776
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:44,960
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

777
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:51,063
And this is for the dates of the preliminary only, the four dates.

778
01:01:51,663 --> 01:01:52,544
Mr. President, if I could.

779
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:53,531
Council Max.

780
01:01:53,931 --> 01:02:03,416
Just if I could, it was only roughly, I think less than a month ago that a member of this council offered a resolution to do away with the preliminary altogether.

781
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:17,303
And here we have a preliminary that's gonna take place and now we're adding days, which I'm not opposed to, I'm opposed to that many days, but now we're adding days from going to eliminating the preliminary to adding days.

782
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:19,484
I just think, you know,

783
01:02:21,632 --> 01:02:31,255
I don't know where we're going, Mr. President, you know, unless it's just, you know, on a whim that we go back and forth, but it doesn't make much sense to me.

784
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:37,737
If I may, Mr. President, I actually took a page from the book of Councilor Marks on that one.

785
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:41,078
And my resolution was that the preliminary election be discussed.

786
01:02:42,399 --> 01:02:46,720
And I just wanted to feel out the room to see if there may be interest in not having a preliminary election.

787
01:02:47,742 --> 01:02:48,783
and clearly there was not.

788
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:50,865
So we discussed it.

789
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:51,926
We decided against it.

790
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:55,530
I think if we're going to have the election, we should make it as flexible and open as possible.

791
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:56,811
So that's my position, right?

792
01:02:56,891 --> 01:02:58,633
But that wasn't the original intent.

793
01:02:58,953 --> 01:03:01,135
The original intent was to have a vote on it.

794
01:03:01,516 --> 01:03:03,618
And this council thought better because

795
01:03:04,121 --> 01:03:07,682
We didn't even have the full number of people that were gonna run.

796
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:10,043
We didn't even know if we were gonna have a preliminary election.

797
01:03:10,063 --> 01:03:12,885
We discussed it and decided it was a bad idea and I stand by it.

798
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:13,385
Right, right.

799
01:03:13,465 --> 01:03:20,268
But I don't know how we go from one extreme to another, but I guess everyone's entitled to their opinion, Mr. President.

800
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:27,591
But my vote is based on the recommendation from our election coordinator that's been in this community for a number of years.

801
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:33,593
And to think that because of the election in this preliminary, that there's gonna be some strange turnout

802
01:03:34,426 --> 01:03:38,048
I think is misguided, very misguided, Mr. President, but that's my own opinion.

803
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:40,009
We shall see.

804
01:03:41,129 --> 01:03:43,590
On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

805
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,011
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

806
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,773
And this is to approve the- To approve the four days of preliminary voting.

807
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:52,994
Councilor Behrs.

808
01:03:53,895 --> 01:04:03,379
Just before you call, so if this happens to get voted down, Mr. President, in the spirit of cooperation, if this happens to get voted down, there will be no early,

809
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:07,709
in voting at all for the poll.

810
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,553
And so a three to three vote is eliminating it altogether.

811
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:16,476
So rather than having four days or two days, we're gonna have zero days.

812
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:23,861
So in the interest of negotiation, Mr. President, I just wanna put that out there.

813
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:28,505
So no one's caught off guard because I know what I'm gonna do.

814
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,223
I'd rather have 19 hours of in-person voting than zero.

815
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:45,288
But if I were to move to reconsider before the end of the meeting, would we be able to take up the vote again at this meeting?

816
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:48,851
No, because you're not on the prevailing side.

817
01:04:48,911 --> 01:04:50,692
You have to be on the prevailing side.

818
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:52,494
I may end up on the prevailing side.

819
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,235
I may or may not.

820
01:04:54,275 --> 01:04:54,656
Who knows?

821
01:04:58,779 --> 01:04:59,400
It's a risk.

822
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:02,202
Let's go.

823
01:05:06,764 --> 01:05:07,684
Mr. Clerk, you saw the vote?

824
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:11,647
The motion is for four days of early voting, September.

825
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:12,367
Yes, that's correct.

01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:50,217
All right, so this is for something that, Mr. Clark?

882
01:07:50,257 --> 01:07:52,778
I believe so, let me just take a look.

883
01:07:55,583 --> 01:08:01,365
This is to expand the board.

884
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:02,606
Do we have any discussion on this?

885
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:24,215
So we have a communication from the, from Andrea LaRue, Chair, in regards to Council Paper 2190, proposed amendment to revise zoning onto the City of Bedford, Chapter 94, Zoning, Section 94-35A, to change member structure of the Bedford Zoning Board of Appeals.

886
01:08:25,728 --> 01:08:44,685
Following a duly advertised public hearing conducted on July 21, 2021, the Community Development Board voted to recommend that the Memphis City Council adopt the proposed amendment to change the structure of the Memphis Zoning Board of Appeals from three members and one associate to five members and two associate members.

887
01:08:45,145 --> 01:08:50,510
The board recommends that the council consider reincorporating language related to staggering terms

888
01:08:51,253 --> 01:09:05,398
that is present in the existing ordinance by inserting the following second sentence after the phrase, term of three years, which shall be staggered so that terms of not more than two members expire annually.

889
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:09,539
Thank you for your consideration of this recommendation, Andre LaRue, Chair.

890
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:13,040
Do we have any discussion on this?

891
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:17,842
Okay, no, do we have a motion on the floor?

892
01:09:21,868 --> 01:09:27,053
Just to clarify, the CD board wants us to amend this to make sure the terms are staggered?

893
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:41,406
It says they want to insert the following in the sentence after the phrase term of three years, which will be staggered so the terms of not more than two members expire annually.

894
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:42,146
Okay.

895
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:42,807
Okay?

896
01:09:44,088 --> 01:09:46,290
So, do we have any discussion?

897
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,512
No, we have a motion.

898
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:51,907
Motion to accept.

01:09:53,228 --> 01:09:55,910
On the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly to accept, seconded by?

900
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,291

Councilor Behrs, Councilor Morrell.

904
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:03,015
It's a motion to accept the suggested language.

905
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:03,876
Okay.

906
01:10:03,896 --> 01:10:06,258
The language by the CD board chair.

907
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:08,199
Yeah.

908
01:10:08,599 --> 01:10:09,059
Yeah.

909
01:10:14,366 --> 01:10:21,369
Yes, and having a mass exodus with our board would be devastating, so I'd support this, thank you.

910
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:27,051
I'm unclear whether this vote is gonna approve the whole amendment or is it just gonna accept the recommendation?

911
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:28,452
It'll accept the recommendation of the whole.

912
01:10:28,472 --> 01:10:29,472
Do we have a second vote?

913
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:29,732
Yes.

914
01:10:30,532 --> 01:10:36,275

LLC doing business as a laundromat, 281 Boston Ave, Method Mass.

967
01:12:35,995 --> 01:12:37,136
Do we have anyone here?

968
01:12:37,176 --> 01:12:39,778
I thought I saw, I see Gwendolyn Chin here.

969
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:41,839
Good evening, sir.

970
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,743
If we can unmute Mr. Chin.

971
01:12:50,105 --> 01:12:51,266
Just one second, sir.

972
01:12:54,748 --> 01:12:58,891
Hi everyone, sorry about that.

973
01:12:59,031 --> 01:12:59,812
I couldn't unmute myself.

974
01:13:01,102 --> 01:13:01,862
Good evening, sir.

975
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:03,343
Name and address of the record, please.

976
01:13:04,163 --> 01:13:06,124
Evening.

977
01:13:06,884 --> 01:13:08,585
Sorry, it's on my paperwork.

978
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:13,527
It is 281 Boston, Medford, Massachusetts.

979
01:13:14,387 --> 01:13:14,947
And your name is?

980
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:16,288
Gilwood Chen.

981
01:13:17,068 --> 01:13:17,648
Gilwood Chen.

982
01:13:17,888 --> 01:13:18,149
Okay.

983
01:13:18,169 --> 01:13:18,549
Yes.

984
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,251
Councilor Scott Pelli is the licensing chairman.

985
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:24,651
Yeah.

986
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:25,531
Scott Pelli.

987
01:13:26,012 --> 01:13:28,293
Thank you, Mr. President, but maybe Mr. Chen can...

988
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:32,978
We're asking for your name and address.

989
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:34,259
Oh, I'm sorry.

990
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:39,221
My current address where I live is 1119 Skyline Drive, Daly City, California, 94015.

991
01:13:41,081 --> 01:13:42,162
And my name is Gilwood Chen.

992
01:13:42,662 --> 01:13:47,644
Camilla is currently busier at the moment, so she couldn't fill in on the council meeting.

993
01:13:48,487 --> 01:13:50,528
Okay, so a couple of few questions.

994
01:13:50,568 --> 01:13:54,850
I know that now this is just changing over from one.

995
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:55,390
Yes.

996
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:56,851
The other correct.

997
01:13:57,912 --> 01:13:59,012
I know the word when it comes.

998
01:13:59,032 --> 01:13:59,833
Yes, correct.

999
01:14:00,413 --> 01:14:04,355
I think that's just just the term that we use cleaning dying.

1000
01:14:04,715 --> 01:14:05,255
Yeah.

1001
01:14:05,295 --> 01:14:07,517
You know, yeah.

1002
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:23,921
The biggest, you know, in this area is what's happened in years of water so people may see dying, but just to be sure this is just a legal form a formality for cleaning and laundry.

1003
01:14:25,522 --> 01:14:26,722
Sorry, excuse me.

1004
01:14:27,402 --> 01:14:28,382
How many employees do you have?

1005
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:29,723
How many employees we have?

1006
01:14:31,173 --> 01:14:38,758
It's just me and Camilla, we're co-owners, and it's just a straight laundromat, there's no dry cleaning, there's no other special chemicals that we're using, just detergent and soap.

1007
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:41,360
All right, and your hours of operations?

1008
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:42,920
Six to 11.

1009
01:14:44,562 --> 01:14:45,642
Six to 11, okay.

1010
01:14:45,662 --> 01:14:46,703
6 a.m.

1011
01:14:46,723 --> 01:14:47,343
to 11 p.m., sorry.

1012
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:48,144
Great.

1013
01:14:48,924 --> 01:14:52,627
And so, I know the service is a lot of the college, Tufts University.

1014
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:53,747
Exactly.

1015
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:53,847
Yes.

1016
01:14:54,688 --> 01:14:58,891
Okay, I know that the business there was good,

1017
01:15:01,488 --> 01:15:04,070
respectful and there were no issues.

1018
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:07,113
I know that moving forward, we see everything in order.

1019
01:15:07,293 --> 01:15:10,416
I don't see anything holding this petition up.

1020
01:15:10,616 --> 01:15:13,979
I just wait for my colleagues if they have any questions.

1021
01:15:14,339 --> 01:15:22,086
Do we have any further discussion on the license for hearing and seeing none?

1022
01:15:22,626 --> 01:15:25,328
I move to accept this move forward.

1023
01:15:26,069 --> 01:15:27,070
On the motion by

1024
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:31,773
Licensed and Chairman, Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by?

1025
01:15:33,975 --> 01:15:35,315
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

1026
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:36,857

1027
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:37,637
Aye.

1028
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:39,318
All those opposed?

1029
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,000
Motion passes.

1030
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:41,480
Thank you, sir.

1031
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,080
Good luck, Mr. Chairman.

1032
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,041
Thank you very much, guys.

1033
01:15:43,141 --> 01:15:47,904
Appreciate it.

1034
01:15:48,485 --> 01:15:50,226
We're up to regular order of business, Mr. President.

1035
01:15:50,366 --> 01:15:54,389
Motion to revert back to regular order of business by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Baez.

1036
01:15:54,829 --> 01:15:55,410
All those in favor?

1037
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,490
Aye.

1038
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,831
Motion passes.

1039
01:15:58,897 --> 01:16:10,080
2-1, 4-2-2, petition for a grant of location, 257 Spring Street Citizen Bank, doing business as ADA upgrades.

1040
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:28,205
You are hereby notified that by order of the Memphis City Council, a continued public hearing will be given by a Zoom and in-person in Howard F. Alden Memorial Chambers on the second floor of Memphis City Council, 85 George B. Assett Drive, at seven o'clock on Tuesday, August 17th,

1041
01:16:29,587 --> 01:16:45,014
2020, a link posted no later than Friday, August 13th, 2021, on a petition of LR Construction, Inc., on behalf of the Citizens Bank, for permission to construct the proposed ADA upgrades at 257 Spring Street, Citizens Bank.

1042
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:48,496
Proposed plans have been filed in the office of the city clerk.

1043
01:16:49,296 --> 01:16:52,658
Wherefore, it prays that after the due notice and hearing,

1044
01:16:53,215 --> 01:17:03,680
by law, they'd be granted permission to complete the project in accordance with the plans available for inspection in the office of the City Clerk of the City Hall room 103 George Piazza Drive, FMS 02155.

1045
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:09,223
The entire scope of this project includes ABA upgrades of three locations.

1046
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:15,708
front ATM vestibule and lobby, rear parking lot, and the front entrance along Spring Street.

1047
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:20,292
The work at the front entrance includes modifying city sidewalks.

1048
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:23,695
The scope of the work at the front entrance is as follows.

1049
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:33,645
Demo existing sidewalks in three sections along the building, 108 square feet, install a new ADA compliant landing and ramp,

1050
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:43,488
install a new EDA compliant handrail around landing along the ramp.

1051
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,113
Approved city engineer with the following conditions, recommendations.

1052
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:56,841
One, the engineering division provided a suggested process to assist the city council in our October 21, 2020 memo.

1053
01:17:57,342 --> 01:18:00,445
As indicated in that process, if approved by the city council,

1054
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:09,162
the petitioner would be required to draft a proposed licensing agreement in coordination with the legal department and engineering division.

1055
01:18:09,782 --> 01:18:20,345
The engineering division recommends that the city council determine if this process is adequate and reasonable pursuant to section 74-63 of the city ordinances.

1056
01:18:21,165 --> 01:18:28,267
Two, the engineering division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situated

1057
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,201
for as long as they remain in good condition.

1058
01:18:31,602 --> 01:18:35,045
If they fall into disrepair or poor conditions, the city will revoke the license.

1059
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:42,670
The existing encroachments will include a metal fire escape, building cornices, and signs attached to the building three.

1060
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:50,837
The easement plan indicates an easement area that extends beyond the existing projections into the public way, the engineering division.

1061
01:18:51,531 --> 01:18:53,172
takes no exception to this approach.

1062
01:18:53,392 --> 01:19:06,302
However, the license agreement should indicate that no new encroachments or expansion of the existing encroachments is allowed beyond the limits of the existing encroachments as shown on the eastern plan.

1063
01:19:06,503 --> 01:19:06,683
Four,

1064
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:13,071
The license agreement should indicate that the licensee will maintain the encroaching items in good condition.

1065
01:19:13,131 --> 01:19:19,992
Five, the license agreement should indicate that the city will revoke the license upon removal of the encroaching items.

1066
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:27,113
Six, the city council should decide if the license agreement should include a renewal period or expiration.

1067
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:35,395
Seven, the city council should recommend a reasonable fee be charged by the city for use of public property for the benefit of the petitioner.

1068
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:41,282
The licensed area must include the level landing at the base of the ramp.

1069
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:50,368
Nine, the license agreement should acknowledge that the potential presence of underground utilities beneath the proposed ramp should not restrict access to these utilities.

1070
01:19:50,388 --> 01:20:01,595
10, the notification for the public hearing regarding this approval process should include utility companies that have infrastructure in this block of Spring Street.

1071
01:20:01,615 --> 01:20:06,078
11, the sidewalk work associated with this ramp is adjacent to a cracked sidewalk panels.

1072
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,091
adjacent crack panels should be replaced.

1073
01:20:09,111 --> 01:20:13,314
12, the ramp is a projection of the building and is associated with the building.

1074
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:15,455
Entrance and exit.

1075
01:20:15,835 --> 01:20:23,059
The ramp must be built per applicable building code and inspected by the building department for code compliance.

1076
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:28,842
13, the plan indicates a national grid manhole near the proposed ramp.

1077
01:20:29,223 --> 01:20:32,765
The licensee should not restrict access to this manhole.

1078
01:20:34,313 --> 01:20:40,454
The plan indicates relocating a tree pit on Spring Street that conflicts with clearances needed for the ramp.

1079
01:20:41,074 --> 01:20:45,195
The new location appears reasonable and should be confirmed with the tree ward.

1080
01:20:46,535 --> 01:20:54,457
15, the license agreement should indicate the minimum clearance between the ramp and the front of the curb to be 72 inches.

1081
01:20:55,877 --> 01:20:57,377
Call 781-393-2425 for any further accommodations.

1082
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,500
Do we have any discussion on this?

1083
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,422
The petitioner is on call.

1084
01:21:09,442 --> 01:21:10,943
Where is the petitioner?

1085
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:13,625
Ammar Salam?

1086
01:21:13,645 --> 01:21:14,185
Yes, sir.

1087
01:21:14,885 --> 01:21:16,006
Yeah, I'm here.

1088
01:21:17,047 --> 01:21:18,087
This is Ammar Salam.

1089
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,109
I'm from Senior Project Manager from Citizen Financial Group.

1090
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:32,356
I'm the one who's managing the project at this location, and I reviewed the comments provided by the engineer.

1091
01:21:34,904 --> 01:21:41,147
Comments no, I will kind of like if we go from number one and down Common number one.

1092
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:44,949
We have no issue about this common back to the consulate.

1093
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:45,890
Yes, sir.

1094
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,751
Can you hold on one second?

1095
01:21:48,051 --> 01:21:53,874
We're just dying to hear Are you here speaking in favor of this hearing?

1096
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:55,835
Yes, sir

1097
01:21:56,397 --> 01:21:57,258
Yeah, thank you very much.

1098
01:21:57,638 --> 01:22:00,481
Is there anyone else here speaking in favor?

1099
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:02,924
Hearing and seeing none, we close that portion of the hearing.

1100
01:22:03,344 --> 01:22:05,947
Is there anyone here opposed to this?

1101
01:22:07,628 --> 01:22:10,932
Hearing and seeing none, we close that portion.

1102
01:22:11,813 --> 01:22:13,054
Thank you, Mr. Salam.

1103
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:15,196
If you can continue with the presentation.

1104
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:17,639
Sure.

1105
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:18,760
Item number two,

1106
01:22:19,966 --> 01:22:43,698
uh the engineering division uh recommending metal fire escape uh building cornish and signs attached to the building the metal fire escape was constructed in this building from day one and i just want to kind of like uh uh present citizen bank side we are leasing this building triple net so we pay lease we maintain it

1107
01:22:44,578 --> 01:22:54,944
And when we leased the place, which is constructed, I think 1934 or around this time, the metal fire escape was already existing over there.

1108
01:22:55,165 --> 01:23:00,048
So my thought in this case, the metal fire escape, it's a landlord issue.

1109
01:23:00,528 --> 01:23:01,208
It's not citizen.

1110
01:23:02,289 --> 01:23:11,114
The building coronation signage, we removed it and we installed more modern design, which less much less projection.

1111
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:12,135
So

1112
01:23:13,218 --> 01:23:24,064
For item number two, we have no problem in regards to the signage or the cornish because we already took them out and installed newer version with much less projection than the existing one.

1113
01:23:24,665 --> 01:23:33,970
And this work was done like early this year, and a permit being pulled from the township, approved, and the work is done.

1114
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:38,273
For item number three, we have no issue.

1115
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:38,333
No.

1116
01:23:39,093 --> 01:23:41,635
We have information Councilor Scapelli.

1117
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:44,635
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

1118
01:23:45,135 --> 01:23:50,797
Are you saying that there's a discrepancy that we're not, we're not, it's not, I'm confused.

1119
01:23:50,817 --> 01:24:00,580
You're saying that there's an issue with the fire escape that has no reflection to citizens, but to the landlord, what does that have to do with, I'm confused with this project.

1120
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,641
Yeah, I mean, metal fire escape, it's existing condition in the building.

1121
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:07,802
When the building is built like 19, mid 1900, is the original landlord,

1122
01:24:12,101 --> 01:24:20,003
or the Lakarta landlord, when it's built, they build the fire escape, and at the time, probably, the permit officer approved it.

1123
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:26,905
It's existing condition, and usually, it's not related to our project at all.

1124
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:30,165
So Citizens Bank does not agree with number two, then?

1125
01:24:31,706 --> 01:24:41,608
Part of it, because the mental fire escape, it's a part of the building that's been constructed since 1934, and probably has been approved at that time.

1126
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:48,505
I'm not sure why the engineer would like to include it in the scope of work that we're doing.

1127
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:52,008
He is pointing out some violation.

1128
01:24:53,129 --> 01:25:00,035
And from Citizen Bank, the fine and Cornish building, it's already been demoed earlier this year.

1129
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:01,316
We have a brand new signage.

1130
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:04,819
If you guys allow me, I can share my screen with a new picture.

1131
01:25:06,314 --> 01:25:15,021
My only comment here, I agree with the building coordination signage, but the metal fire escape, it's existing part of the building.

1132
01:25:16,663 --> 01:25:18,545
It was happening before we leave the building.

1133
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:26,392
Okay, do you realize this is a hearing that will depend whether this council supports us or not?

1134
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:31,396
A city engineer is requesting that this be one of the stipulations.

1135
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:32,217
You understand that, right?

1136
01:25:33,838 --> 01:25:51,454
Yeah, I mean if you guys want to include it because but in this case if you if some deterioration happened to it We are liable to fix it because we are leasing the building triple net So we are liable of fixing any item in the building that could cause any hazard to the public Yeah, I mean

1137
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:06,386
We can maintain it, but when our lease expire, we're not responsible for the metal fire escape after that.

1138
01:26:07,547 --> 01:26:09,028
We have Chris Schultz on the call.

1139
01:26:10,769 --> 01:26:11,410
Yeah.

1140
01:26:13,031 --> 01:26:14,973
From LR Construction.

1141
01:26:15,553 --> 01:26:16,173
Yeah, I'm here too.

1142
01:26:16,233 --> 01:26:16,514
Yeah.

1143
01:26:17,775 --> 01:26:19,916
Name and address of the record, please.

1144
01:26:21,618 --> 01:26:25,140
Chris Schultz, 346 Lake Street in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.

1145
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,262
Okay.

1146
01:26:28,407 --> 01:26:33,511
Chris, I think there's a, maybe you could enlighten us about the fire escape issue.

1147
01:26:33,551 --> 01:26:41,758
It's just a lot of these comments were brought up by the city engineer in our approval process for this job.

1148
01:26:41,978 --> 01:26:44,660
And a lot of them, they have nothing to do with the work that we're doing.

1149
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:48,744
It's just these, all these comments were addressed or brought up.

1150
01:26:50,245 --> 01:26:55,269
As armor said, their existing conditions that have nothing with this job that we're trying to get completed.

1151
01:26:56,733 --> 01:27:00,096
So why are you bringing it up?

1152
01:27:00,136 --> 01:27:02,317
We didn't feel the need to bring it up.

1153
01:27:02,398 --> 01:27:05,460
This was the stuff that was brought up in our review by the city.

1154
01:27:08,662 --> 01:27:13,506
I'm trying, I'm just, I don't know.

1155
01:27:17,209 --> 01:27:20,592
I can clarify more if you allow me to share my screen.

1156
01:27:20,672 --> 01:27:23,294
I have a picture of the building with the fire escape.

1157
01:27:24,818 --> 01:27:38,805
And you guys can see it is that Citizen Bank hired LR Construction to build a ramp on the front of the branch and the landing based on a registered architect drawing.

1158
01:27:39,986 --> 01:27:43,688
And this is the scope of work that we requesting approval on.

1159
01:27:45,108 --> 01:27:52,592
I believe like the engineer, when they went over there, they find existing enroachment and they incorporated on this hearing.

1160
01:27:54,993 --> 01:28:03,379
does not relate to the scope of work that has been noted in the beginning of the petition, which is scope of work at front entrance is as follows.

1161
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:15,589
Demo existing sidewalk, three section, install new ADA compliant landing and ramp, install new ADA compliant handrail around landing along the ramp.

1162
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:17,331
This is all what we're doing.

1163
01:28:18,311 --> 01:28:21,614
Item number two, it's pointing existing condition.

1164
01:28:23,144 --> 01:28:28,930
been built like from day one from the building, except of course, time, which is maybe.

1165
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,020
Yeah, no problem.

1166
01:28:32,781 --> 01:28:45,704
Unfortunately, the city engineer isn't on the call, and as I'm reading this, our city engineer division recommends that existing encroachments be allowed to remain so situate for as long as they remain in good condition.

1167
01:28:46,244 --> 01:28:49,364
If they fall into disrepair or poor condition, the city will revoke the license.

1168
01:28:49,865 --> 01:28:55,326
The existing encroachment includes a metal fire escape building and sign attached to the building.

1169
01:28:56,046 --> 01:29:00,612
So you're saying that, um, so I just want to make sure we're clear on this.

1170
01:29:00,632 --> 01:29:06,921
So you're saying that citizens bank does not agree with number two and will not.

1171
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:11,487
I'm just, no, I'm clarifying that the metal fire escape, it is not.

1172
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,473
something new we're building.

1173
01:29:13,773 --> 01:29:21,096
It's existing, and for item number two, the engineer is giving us direction as a council.

1174
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:30,741
These are steps that the engineer is giving us that you would abide by, so we would give you this permit.

1175
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:31,922
We would allow this to happen.

1176
01:29:31,942 --> 01:29:33,583
Do you understand what we're saying?

1177
01:29:34,683 --> 01:30:00,224
Yeah, yeah, yeah 100% I'm not agreeing with his comment where we need to maintain it in good condition So I'm agreeing with that He's saying that yeah already on the building and it is in good repair so if it does correct They will have to fix it

1178
01:30:01,975 --> 01:30:05,256
We, Citizen Bank, will have to fix it as long as we are leasing the building.

1179
01:30:06,056 --> 01:30:07,236
If I understand that correctly.

1180
01:30:07,596 --> 01:30:16,198
Right, but I'm understanding that Mr. Salaam said that they do not support what that is because that is... He's saying that that's not part of his scope of work.

1181
01:30:16,939 --> 01:30:18,319
He's only doing the sidewalk.

1182
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:20,319
He's not touching the fire extinguishers.

1183
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:21,940
I mean, the fire escape.

1184
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:24,800
All he's doing is a sidewalk and ABA.

1185
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,841
I'm going to yield to my fellow consultants.

1186
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:28,281
Maybe I'm overthinking this.

1187
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:29,281
If I understand that right.

1188
01:30:29,301 --> 01:30:31,402
If I'm correct, though, with this paper here,

1189
01:30:33,089 --> 01:30:37,290
These are the recommendations for approval by the city engineer.

1190
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:54,394
So the papers here, these are the recommendations that he's basically- The engineer has said that as long as these things remain in good condition, which the fire escape is one of them, they will be allowed to keep their license.

1191
01:30:55,494 --> 01:30:57,775
And Citizen Bank will agree with that.

1192
01:30:58,323 --> 01:31:02,626
This is not Citizens Bank's concerns, it's the landlord's concerns.

1193
01:31:03,406 --> 01:31:06,188
So obviously, so they're not taking responsibility for that, if that happens.

1194
01:31:07,068 --> 01:31:07,929
Am I confused with that?

1195
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:13,212
No, these are already on the building, the existing encroachments.

1196
01:31:13,653 --> 01:31:15,274
What he's saying is- It's not a question, Ricky.

1197
01:31:15,714 --> 01:31:17,415
This stuff is already there.

1198
01:31:17,915 --> 01:31:23,599
We know that, but if the petitioner just said, this is what I'm getting at, he said that

1199
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,921
This is a disagreement with the landlord.

1200
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:28,382
That's the landlord's responsibility.

1201
01:31:28,622 --> 01:31:30,343
Well, the landlord's not here for this permit.

1202
01:31:31,003 --> 01:31:35,145
Citizens Bank, if they're not gonna take responsibility for this, then they're not gonna support this.

1203
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,006
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1204
01:31:37,046 --> 01:31:38,887
No, no, no, no.

1205
01:31:38,947 --> 01:31:39,787
Excuse me, sir.

1206
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:43,729
We're gonna take responsibility for it as long we are leasing the building.

1207
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,091
If they move out, it's not their responsibility.

1208
01:31:49,752 --> 01:31:52,033
Why would you bring up the landlord?

1209
01:31:52,053 --> 01:31:53,294
What would this council need that for?

1210
01:31:58,093 --> 01:32:15,884
We are not we were maintaining the building any Deterioration to fire escape or any other item within the building or outside of the building is the citizen bank responsibility As long as we are leasing the building So you agree with that?

1211
01:32:16,545 --> 01:32:21,068
Yes How is that so difficult

1212
01:32:22,327 --> 01:32:22,587
Okay.

1213
01:32:23,047 --> 01:32:27,530
No, I just want to clarify that the metal fire escape was existing structure from the building originally.

1214
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:31,212
It wasn't part of the project, but we are maintaining it.

1215
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:32,453
We know.

1216
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:32,993
Thank you.

1217
01:32:33,013 --> 01:32:33,173
Okay.

1218
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:33,633
Thank you.

1219
01:32:34,254 --> 01:32:35,894
Thanks.

1220
01:32:36,215 --> 01:32:37,816
Number four, we agree with it.

1221
01:32:38,036 --> 01:32:39,677
Number five, we agree with it.

1222
01:32:41,177 --> 01:32:45,420
Number six, we agree with it.

1223
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:49,502
Number seven, we kind of like

1224
01:32:51,202 --> 01:33:03,530
don't agree with it because we notice other property within the township have ramp and landing, and I don't believe that the township charging fee for it.

1225
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:09,873
In addition to that, our lease, we pay in taxes, all the taxes required for the building.

1226
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:13,556
Mr. Slavkin, Councilor Falco has a question.

1227
01:33:13,636 --> 01:33:14,376
Thank you, Mr. President.

1228
01:33:14,676 --> 01:33:17,578
It's not a question for Ghalam.

1229
01:33:18,038 --> 01:33:18,959
I believe last time we

1230
01:33:19,948 --> 01:33:23,351
In the last meeting, we asked for some guidance on, I think, point number seven.

1231
01:33:23,451 --> 01:33:27,554
Yes, and Ellen Bourdeaux is on the line to give us some guidance for that.

1232
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:30,817
Okay, if we could hear from Ellen with regards to point number seven, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1233
01:33:30,877 --> 01:33:32,158
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Ellen, please?

1234
01:33:32,178 --> 01:33:34,740
I don't know if she's still muted.

1235
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:47,051
Ellen, can you give us some guidance on a reasonable fee that should be charged by the city for this?

1236
01:33:47,768 --> 01:33:54,153
Yeah, good evening counselors and I apologize for the mute thing I have a three year old grandson being very vocal in the background.

1237
01:33:54,233 --> 01:34:03,560
So, um, I, I apologize that I'm probably not going to give you the information that you want to hear this evening, um, I received this request.

1238
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:09,344
Prior to going on vacation I came back from vacation this week from, and I did provide.

1239
01:34:10,948 --> 01:34:17,610
the mayor's office, and then Adam had contacted me this evening, earlier today for my notes.

1240
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:20,612
I have reviewed the parcel.

1241
01:34:22,232 --> 01:34:29,475
I don't have market data that would support providing an estimate of the cost to rent 108 square foot sidewalk.

1242
01:34:29,775 --> 01:34:38,058
I don't gather market data on the value of sidewalks, roadways, or anything that's used as a public right of way.

1243
01:34:38,998 --> 01:34:49,953
And honestly, for me to do some wild guess number, I would be guessing at something that I, you know, I'd be in violation of Uniswap.

1244
01:34:50,854 --> 01:34:53,137
So I truly cannot give you a number of what

1245
01:34:54,263 --> 01:34:55,604
that kind of what that would be.

1246
01:34:56,485 --> 01:35:12,639
And the best guidance I could say would, if that's something that the city council wanted to pursue would be to find an appraiser that has expertise and valuing that would not be an easy thing to do but I'm sure there's probably somebody out there that could offer some kind of number.

1247
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:16,642
And, and that's really all I can can add to that.

1248
01:35:17,918 --> 01:35:21,642
Ellen, is this a common practice in other cities to rent the sidewalk?

1249
01:35:22,462 --> 01:35:29,169
Not, I contacted other peers, certainly I only call on three, I've just got back from vacation.

1250
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:35,535
They do not have any data in their communities of knowledge of renting sidewalk space.

1251
01:35:36,155 --> 01:35:37,276
It's a public right of way.

1252
01:35:41,062 --> 01:35:47,804
I was kind of, like I said, I received this right before vacation, so I apologize for not getting back to city council earlier.

1253
01:35:47,844 --> 01:35:49,165
I just returned yesterday.

1254
01:35:49,185 --> 01:35:53,766
It's not, yeah.

1255
01:35:54,366 --> 01:35:54,906
Councilor Baez.

1256
01:35:55,587 --> 01:36:06,750
Ellen, do you think that if we were to just decide on some sort of nominal flat fee, that that would be an irresponsible decision or would it be, you know,

1257
01:36:07,568 --> 01:36:11,610
Do you really feel like we have to go the route of getting this area appraised?

1258
01:36:13,491 --> 01:36:18,694
I would ask, you have members that have been with this council much longer than I've been with the city.

1259
01:36:19,354 --> 01:36:25,697
Is this a practice that does the city have, is the city leasing this type of space to anyone else today?

1260
01:36:25,717 --> 01:36:28,879
My understanding is it's a unique situation.

1261
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:29,219
Yeah.

1262
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:29,679
Okay.

1263
01:36:32,519 --> 01:36:36,641
Yeah, I truly, I wouldn't know how to advise you on that.

1264
01:36:36,821 --> 01:36:37,521
I apologize.

1265
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:39,402
Councilor Falco.

1266
01:36:39,682 --> 01:36:40,443
Thank you, Mr. President.

1267
01:36:41,503 --> 01:36:45,945
When I look at this here, this is a recommendation that has been made by the city engineer.

1268
01:36:46,285 --> 01:36:53,028
So the city engineer must know of some community that is taking this type of action currently.

1269
01:36:54,389 --> 01:36:56,350
So I think we need to either reach back to him

1270
01:36:56,873 --> 01:37:09,398
and find out what community is going through this process and how do they arrive at the fee that they charge the particular company in that city or town.

1271
01:37:11,019 --> 01:37:12,180
He must have come up with this somehow.

1272
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,780
It must be done in other cities and towns.

1273
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,862
We need to get more information with regard to how much we should be charging.

1274
01:37:19,963 --> 01:37:20,683
If you guys allow me,

1275
01:37:26,533 --> 01:37:27,394
Councilor Scott.

1276
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:31,439
I think this is such a big issue because I have also reached.

1277
01:37:31,459 --> 01:37:38,147
I did talk to a few residents that welcome the ramp because, uh, you know, handicapped accessible.

1278
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:44,014
I think it's very important, but I think it's unfinished business between the petitioner and the city engineer.

1279
01:37:45,055 --> 01:38:03,406
uh I think it might behoove us that both parties that we table this so we get further clarification so this possibly could go to no vote which would then extend this longer than we should so I don't know if um if that might be the course I just put it out to my colleagues to to

1280
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:18,584
maybe contemplate that without the engineer being here with the assessor really not gauging, you know, the understanding of this as much as we should right now, because understandable factors.

1281
01:38:20,245 --> 01:38:24,848
And, you know, I don't, I see the sides on both sides.

1282
01:38:25,128 --> 01:38:26,989
It's a city sidewalk.

1283
01:38:27,209 --> 01:38:31,772
It's taking land that not everybody will now traverse because it's being,

1284
01:38:33,378 --> 01:38:35,921
uh, handicap ramp, which I think it's very important.

1285
01:38:35,941 --> 01:38:42,269
I think that I want to move this forward, but I just want to make sure that, you know, there seems some discrepancies and some, uh,

1286
01:38:43,963 --> 01:38:47,685
to be gone, but the negotiations shouldn't be done at this level.

1287
01:38:48,106 --> 01:38:54,670
This should be done by the city engineer who are the professionals in this situation with our city administration, the council.

1288
01:38:54,710 --> 01:39:05,858
So I truly think we should table this and until we get this information that Mr Salam and his team sit together with the engineer and the city administration to clean up these fine issues.

1289
01:39:05,918 --> 01:39:09,240
So this isn't in jeopardy of failing this evening.

1290
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,763
So if you guys allow me,

1291
01:39:14,636 --> 01:39:16,417
Good.

1292
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:20,400
I'm an architect for 30 years and a project manager for 15 years.

1293
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:27,225
And I've been doing this project, I'm running the program for the ADA, for Citizen Bank for the past six years.

1294
01:39:28,126 --> 01:39:33,709
I've been done work in Pennsylvania, like over 250 branches, Philadelphia, Central City.

1295
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:37,672
And we have the same situation when we approach the township.

1296
01:39:38,553 --> 01:39:41,515
As long as not intervening with the path of the public,

1297
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:47,922
In addition, it maintaining the building, there was no other option for us to make it accessible in the building.

1298
01:39:48,642 --> 01:39:50,983
They approve it, they give us a variance, they never charge us.

1299
01:39:51,283 --> 01:40:03,068
Actually, next to your township, West Medford, one of our branches, the landlord, we designed it, we find the issue over there, and the landlord approached the township, he got the permit and built it.

1300
01:40:03,948 --> 01:40:05,429
And there's no charge to the landlord.

1301
01:40:06,589 --> 01:40:08,590
In addition, I built at least like 10 or

1302
01:40:09,747 --> 01:40:16,912
20 ramp like this in our building in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where it was infeasible to do the ADA compliance through the lobby.

1303
01:40:17,713 --> 01:40:20,875
And we use the city sidewalk and they never charge us.

1304
01:40:21,495 --> 01:40:23,677
It's a public service to make the building accessible.

1305
01:40:24,277 --> 01:40:26,419
Especially we have this issue with the old building.

1306
01:40:26,939 --> 01:40:37,306
They were never designed all before like the 2000 or 1999 was concept of making the building accessible to challenge persons.

1307
01:40:38,765 --> 01:40:39,305
and seniors.

1308
01:40:39,766 --> 01:40:41,967
So this is what citizen bank doing now.

1309
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:44,689
We're running the entire program along our entire portfolio.

1310
01:40:45,309 --> 01:40:50,133
And we try, we are making it compliant based on the new code for the AD.

1311
01:40:50,493 --> 01:40:58,958
I mean, before we had option to make it one entrance only compliant, but now require 60% of the entrance to be compliant.

1312
01:40:59,159 --> 01:41:01,840
And with two entrances mean a hundred percent compliant.

1313
01:41:03,822 --> 01:41:05,683
And when I talked to Tim, yes.

1314
01:41:07,277 --> 01:41:10,619
Sorry, you can finish your sentence Mr. Salama when you talk to Tim.

1315
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:23,808
I talked to Tim and I pointed out to him about the issue of the fee because we are, as I mentioned, we are leasing the property triple net so we are liable to pay all the required taxes for the property.

1316
01:41:24,809 --> 01:41:30,673
I talked to him that in other communities, we built this we take the variance as long as the ramp and the sidewalk.

1317
01:41:31,523 --> 01:41:35,684
is no, there is any conflict and everything is moving with a public path.

1318
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:38,425
And it's plus it's a public service to the public.

1319
01:41:38,545 --> 01:41:42,986
It's not like for our special purpose, the customer will still come from all entrants anyway.

1320
01:41:44,267 --> 01:41:49,508
And I pointed out to him like this project started in 2019.

1321
01:41:50,368 --> 01:41:56,490
And all of this been dragging across Citizen Bank so far, way beyond the project cause that we started and

1322
01:41:57,504 --> 01:42:00,486
The cost of the ramp and the landing, it costs between $25,000.

1323
01:42:00,606 --> 01:42:08,572
It costs us way more than that for me bringing the consultant in the meetings, preparing the document.

1324
01:42:08,712 --> 01:42:09,713
I just want to point it out.

1325
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:14,776
Mr. Salaam, you mentioned West Medford.

1326
01:42:16,137 --> 01:42:18,959
When was that project completed?

1327
01:42:18,979 --> 01:42:21,121
This is like 2019.

1328
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:24,991
A couple of years ago.

1329
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:26,312
That's when that ramp was installed?

1330
01:42:26,532 --> 01:42:26,712
Yes.

1331
01:42:26,992 --> 01:42:27,333
Okay.

1332
01:42:27,513 --> 01:42:27,833
Yeah.

1333
01:42:27,893 --> 01:42:28,634
Ramp and a landing.

1334
01:42:28,674 --> 01:42:35,439
And actually it's a little bit bigger than ours and the sidewalk is less than this location.

1335
01:42:35,459 --> 01:42:38,802
Well, that should have... West Medford is part of Medford.

1336
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:43,445
So what was the process when that project was approved?

1337
01:42:44,246 --> 01:42:52,853
It was a part of my project, but the landlord decided to do the exterior under his scope of work.

1338
01:42:53,664 --> 01:43:03,711
because the exterior is part of his scope of work, our lease, so he developed a growing approach, a township, got the permit, built it up, and we inspected a citizen bank.

1339
01:43:04,392 --> 01:43:06,514
It's compliant, we agreed, and that's it.

1340
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:11,938
All right, and I mean, I meant also to my fellow councilors, did that come before the council?

1341
01:43:12,198 --> 01:43:13,779
I do not recall that coming before the council.

1342
01:43:13,799 --> 01:43:15,120
I don't remember that.

1343
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,201
It never came before the council.

1344
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:18,883
I would be fine having, I mean, I think,

1345
01:43:19,659 --> 01:43:26,506
So, Mr. Salam, are you in agreement with everything, the exception of six and seven, which should be the renewal fee?

1346
01:43:26,526 --> 01:43:26,726
Yes, sir.

1347
01:43:26,766 --> 01:43:28,508
I mean, yeah.

1348
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:31,811
I mean, everything else we're complying with, everything I agree with.

1349
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:37,497
We have registered architect, LI construction, Chris did like dig safe for the site.

1350
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:40,620
All of the item below, we agree on it and we're confirming it.

1351
01:43:41,188 --> 01:43:41,948
know exists.

1352
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:42,389
Right.

1353
01:43:42,409 --> 01:43:44,110
So what are we trying to do here?

1354
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:50,393
We don't have Mr. President, I would say, you know, number six, I would be fine with it be five years or something.

1355
01:43:50,413 --> 01:43:54,996
Number seven, I'm taking early but at this point, yeah, I mean, you know, again, I hate to tie this guy up.

1356
01:43:55,036 --> 01:43:56,537
They want to get the work done.

1357
01:43:56,957 --> 01:43:59,358
I mean, they're doing their work.

1358
01:43:59,518 --> 01:44:00,939
We're setting precedent right now.

1359
01:44:01,419 --> 01:44:03,621
This council setting precedent something we don't know.

1360
01:44:04,596 --> 01:44:06,137
know that we've never done before.

1361
01:44:06,217 --> 01:44:09,239
So I think we need guidance and we don't have anyone right now.

1362
01:44:09,259 --> 01:44:10,100
We don't have the engineer.

1363
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:16,904
Our assessor has just told us that there's not enough time right now to get the information that she needs to help us with this.

1364
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:25,169
And I understand West Medford, but I also know that Salem Street encompasses a lot more of the sidewalk.

1365
01:44:25,269 --> 01:44:27,370
It's a smaller sidewalk than it was in West Medford.

1366
01:44:27,731 --> 01:44:28,951
But it's a longer sidewalk.

1367
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:29,392
Mr. President.

1368
01:44:30,813 --> 01:44:31,253
Councilor Max.

1369
01:44:32,363 --> 01:44:33,364
Thank you, Mr. President.

1370
01:44:34,444 --> 01:44:40,326
The petitioner just mentioned variance, and we as a body do not issue variances.

1371
01:44:40,986 --> 01:44:43,968
That is done by the Zoning Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1372
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,588
So that is not something that's under our purview.

1373
01:44:46,669 --> 01:44:54,832
So if something was done in West Medford through a variance, it's possible that it never made its way to the Medford City Council.

1374
01:44:55,472 --> 01:44:58,273
This request is for a petition for a grant of location.

1375
01:44:58,913 --> 01:45:00,657
which would be approved by this council.

1376
01:45:01,198 --> 01:45:04,244
So maybe it is a matter of how this was presented.

1377
01:45:04,705 --> 01:45:10,596
The original one in West Method was presented as a variance and that was voted on by a separate board and commission.

1378
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:23,167
and this one is being presented differently, I don't know, but it doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President, because Mr. Salaam just mentioned a variance and we have nothing to do with variances.

1379
01:45:23,908 --> 01:45:30,892
And regarding Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and everywhere else, to be quite frank with you, that's not the city of Medford.

1380
01:45:31,433 --> 01:45:34,935
And in my opinion, if you're gonna use public land, you should pay.

1381
01:45:35,735 --> 01:45:36,576
That's my own opinion.

1382
01:45:37,563 --> 01:45:46,009
If I wanted to build a porch, Mr. President, on my house, and it was one inch on a public sidewalk, one inch, it would not be approved.

1383
01:45:46,629 --> 01:45:48,030
It would not be approved.

1384
01:45:49,331 --> 01:45:55,795
So I think to sit back and say that they don't pay in other areas and this and that, that's up to them.

1385
01:45:56,396 --> 01:45:59,038
But in this city, Mr. President, if you're going to use public land,

1386
01:45:59,935 --> 01:46:01,236
for private entity.

1387
01:46:01,616 --> 01:46:08,082
Since when is it our responsibility to make sure a citizen's bank has proper ADA compliance?

1388
01:46:09,282 --> 01:46:10,383
It's not our responsibility.

1389
01:46:10,563 --> 01:46:14,667
We're willing to work with them, Mr. President, but it's not our responsibility.

1390
01:46:15,918 --> 01:46:18,039
So I think there has to be some give and take here.

1391
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:35,247
And my question, Mr. President, if we could, I agree with Councilor Scott Pelley and my other council colleagues that this probably should be sent back, but definitely, Mr. President, we should find out regarding what West Medford, how it was approved.

1392
01:46:35,627 --> 01:46:41,550
Was it approved by a petition for grant the location or was it approved by a variance?

1393
01:46:42,482 --> 01:46:45,445
And that's key if we move forward on this.

1394
01:46:45,605 --> 01:46:47,446
We can't answer this question.

1395
01:46:47,466 --> 01:46:48,107
Right, right.

1396
01:46:48,227 --> 01:46:50,669
But I would make that, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.

1397
01:47:00,036 --> 01:47:00,736
Oh, sorry.

1398
01:47:00,776 --> 01:47:01,297
I'm sorry.

1399
01:47:01,577 --> 01:47:01,857
Thank you.

1400
01:47:01,937 --> 01:47:03,038
I just want to say thank you.

1401
01:47:03,138 --> 01:47:04,258
I agree with Councilor Scarpelli.

1402
01:47:04,278 --> 01:47:06,320
I think it may seem like this is a simple one off.

1403
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:08,521
But what we're doing right now is setting precedent.

1404
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:15,745
And if we don't get this right this time, the next time a petitioner comes before us, they're going to cite this case for their reason for why they're doing something a certain way.

1405
01:47:15,825 --> 01:47:17,046
So we need to get it right.

1406
01:47:17,066 --> 01:47:18,907
And I agree with Councilor Marks that this is

1407
01:47:19,706 --> 01:47:23,890
this is a public right of way, and we need to treat it as such and figure out the right way to do this.

1408
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:25,911
And if that's charging, then that's charging.

1409
01:47:26,752 --> 01:47:32,557
But I agree that I don't think we should move on this without just insight from our city engineer at this point.

1410
01:47:33,397 --> 01:47:39,703
I would add, if possible, to the motion that, I don't know, Engineer McGivern

1411
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:51,649
asked us to come up with the renewal period and the fee, I would actually ask that he make a proposal for what might be reasonable, and we could consider that as part of sending it back.

1412
01:47:51,749 --> 01:47:52,510
With the assessor.

1413
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:53,611
Right, right.

1414
01:47:53,631 --> 01:47:55,953
All right, so the chair waives the motion.

1415
01:47:56,434 --> 01:47:57,655
Well, let's vote on these motions.

1416
01:47:59,496 --> 01:48:01,939
I add one thing, if I have a quick second.

1417
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:03,240
Yes, sir.

1418
01:48:04,803 --> 01:48:11,935
In regards to the comment about Tim, the engineer, what the last person just said, it is correct.

1419
01:48:11,975 --> 01:48:13,498
He's the one who brought this up to you guys.

1420
01:48:13,558 --> 01:48:15,681
So I don't know if he can actually advise on.

1421
01:48:16,892 --> 01:48:21,576
and what to recommend for the situation, because I know he was looking to you guys for guidance on that.

1422
01:48:23,057 --> 01:48:24,918
So we might just be going back around in a circle here.

1423
01:48:25,179 --> 01:48:33,625
But in regards to the comment about if you go one inch into the sidewalk from your house, the city might say no.

1424
01:48:33,645 --> 01:48:37,849
I think that's more like extending your house.

1425
01:48:38,229 --> 01:48:39,690
It's still a public sidewalk.

1426
01:48:39,911 --> 01:48:40,611
We're just making it 80.

1427
01:48:41,612 --> 01:48:44,814
The building isn't extending to get more square footage so they have more,

1428
01:48:45,575 --> 01:48:46,636
office space on the inside.

1429
01:48:46,956 --> 01:48:50,057
It's just to upgrade the sidewalks to make it safer.

1430
01:48:50,657 --> 01:48:59,302
And if we're doing, we were doing a little give and take back and forth, we agreed to replace additional damaged concrete sidewalk sections around it, making the whole area safer.

1431
01:48:59,962 --> 01:49:03,063
It's kind of a, you know, we'll help you guys out.

1432
01:49:03,083 --> 01:49:06,245
We'll replace more sidewalk if we're allowed to put the ramp out front.

1433
01:49:07,793 --> 01:49:08,053
was it?

1434
01:49:08,093 --> 01:49:09,214
We're not extending the building.

1435
01:49:09,254 --> 01:49:16,879
It's just we're making this the city's safer and we're going to replace panels around it to make the entire sidewalls because it is it is in rough shape.

1436
01:49:20,942 --> 01:49:25,706
If I can, Mr President, I know that I'd like to vote on the motion, so it is out.

1437
01:49:25,726 --> 01:49:27,987
And then I truly think, you know, we

1438
01:49:29,127 --> 01:49:31,390
Like the gentleman said, I think we get everybody involved.

1439
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,213
We don't want to go in circles, but we think we bring Tim.

1440
01:49:34,733 --> 01:49:36,055
We have the city assessor.

1441
01:49:36,115 --> 01:49:37,796
We have city administration.

1442
01:49:37,917 --> 01:49:41,540
We bring in, you know, even the ADA compliance officer.

1443
01:49:41,561 --> 01:49:44,023
I think that it's important that he's here right now.

1444
01:49:44,103 --> 01:49:49,849
So, you know, we get all these answers, these questions answered because it does, it is important.

1445
01:49:49,869 --> 01:49:50,610
I think that it's,

1446
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:57,103
you know, not the idea is very important, but I think the process has to be done the right way.

1447
01:49:57,203 --> 01:50:03,747
So this council doesn't set precedent for something that's leading us in a bad path moving forward.

1448
01:50:03,767 --> 01:50:06,188
So I, you know, if I can.

1449
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:08,529
Yeah, I understand.

1450
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:08,989
We understand.

1451
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:11,291
Thank you.

1452
01:50:11,331 --> 01:50:13,412
Motion to table?

1453
01:50:13,892 --> 01:50:15,093
We've motioned to table.

1454
01:50:15,253 --> 01:50:16,393
Our motions won't fall out, correct?

1455
01:50:17,474 --> 01:50:19,295
Motion to table until we

1456
01:50:21,391 --> 01:50:43,450
I'm going to I'm going to motion the table and, um, have the if we can ask promotion that we have the city engineer, the ADA officer and the city sister and the city administration work together to try to find, um, uh, common ground so we can, uh,

1457
01:50:44,213 --> 01:50:48,456
not chase the tail all day, so we can get this project moving forward.

1458
01:50:48,476 --> 01:50:54,079
I know it's a delay, but I don't wanna go to a vote, the vote's no, and then we can't bring this up for a long time.

1459
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:56,881
So if we can do that, I vote to table.

1460
01:50:57,161 --> 01:50:57,681
Mr. President?

1461
01:50:58,422 --> 01:50:58,842
Second.

1462
01:50:59,142 --> 01:51:02,024
So if I may, Councilor Scarpelli, through you to Councilor Scarpelli.

1463
01:51:02,044 --> 01:51:07,928
So we're looking for specific recommendations for 0.6 and 0.7 from our city engineer?

1464
01:51:08,068 --> 01:51:08,388
Correct.

1465
01:51:08,688 --> 01:51:08,948
Perfect.

1466
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:10,850
And while we're there, I personally,

1467
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:15,311
you know, for my edification to get the understanding of point number two.

1468
01:51:15,811 --> 01:51:22,172
So that's a little bit clearer in my eyes, you know, but my thing is moving past two, six and seven, we need that clarification.

1469
01:51:22,312 --> 01:51:23,032
Perfect, thank you.

1470
01:51:23,572 --> 01:51:33,114
And so on the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley to table this until the engineer makes his recommendations on number two, six and seven.

1471
01:51:33,134 --> 01:51:35,955
Yeah, that's it.

1472
01:51:38,309 --> 01:51:50,294
Do you want to repeat your motion back with the clerk?

1473
01:51:50,915 --> 01:51:51,895
It wasn't variance.

1474
01:51:52,035 --> 01:51:54,396
I don't know if it was variance for West Medford.

1475
01:51:55,057 --> 01:51:56,537
It was handled by the landlord.

1476
01:51:57,378 --> 01:52:00,019
Plus there's multiple other sites within the township.

1477
01:52:00,059 --> 01:52:01,780
Probably you guys have the same thing.

1478
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:02,640
So

1479
01:52:08,459 --> 01:52:13,362
on the motion by, on the motion table by Councilor Scarpelli as amended.

1480
01:52:15,043 --> 01:52:25,730
You want to put it in with his or you want to report it out as amended by Councilor Marks on how the project of West Bedford was completed.

1481
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:29,292
If it never came before the council, I don't recall it coming before the council.

1482
01:52:31,654 --> 01:52:31,994
Second.

1483
01:52:32,334 --> 01:52:33,395
Second by Councilor Baird.

1484
01:52:33,435 --> 01:52:34,115
All those in favor.

1485
01:52:34,596 --> 01:52:34,676
Aye.

1486
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,954
All those opposed, motion passes.

1487
01:52:39,516 --> 01:52:42,919
Okay.

1488
01:52:45,182 --> 01:52:45,923
Thank you.

1489
01:52:45,943 --> 01:52:46,543
Thank you.

1490
01:52:46,563 --> 01:52:54,552
21457, petition for a grant of location, national grid, north end of Massachusetts, location of underground electrical condoms.

1491
01:52:56,134 --> 01:52:57,135
Do I hear notified?

1492
01:52:58,303 --> 01:53:07,545
that by order of the Memphis City Council, the Council of the Memphis City Council will hold a public hearing in Howard Hall left chambers at Memphis City Hall, 85 George B. Henson Drive, Memphis.

1493
01:53:08,186 --> 01:53:13,687
And- President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading and just to give a brief synopsis.

1494
01:53:13,827 --> 01:53:16,008
Do we have anybody here from National Grid?

1495
01:53:16,028 --> 01:53:17,908
Excuse me, thank you, sir.

1496
01:53:20,429 --> 01:53:24,570
I'm gonna vote to waive the motion on the table.

1497
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:30,960
We deal on the motion by Council Marks to waive the reading seconded by Council Mayors.

1498
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:31,620
All those in favor.

1499
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:32,120
Aye.

1500
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:32,600
All those opposed.

1501
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:33,320
Motion passes.

1502
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:34,281
Good evening, sir.

1503
01:53:34,301 --> 01:53:35,401
Name and address of the record, please.

1504
01:53:35,501 --> 01:53:36,361
Good evening, councillors.

1505
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:37,862
My name is Moses Okokoro.

1506
01:53:38,042 --> 01:53:39,822
I'm here from National Grid Electric.

1507
01:53:40,582 --> 01:53:43,463
My address is 170 Medford Street in Malden.

1508
01:53:44,264 --> 01:53:47,304
Can you give us a brief synopsis of this project?

1509
01:53:48,505 --> 01:53:55,327
So National Grid is petitioning to install two four-inch conduits from my existing manhole on the sidewalk towards the building.

1510
01:53:56,971 --> 01:54:03,616
Yeah, so basically we, I've actually indicated here though, the conduit length would be approximately seven feet.

1511
01:54:04,316 --> 01:54:10,981
But after we submitted the petition, we did a manhole survey and we'll be hitting the building from a different angle.

1512
01:54:11,001 --> 01:54:20,548
So potentially that may increase to not something significantly different, but probably about 10 feet from an existing manhole to the building.

1513
01:54:20,929 --> 01:54:24,051
This is for the purpose of providing the electric service to that customer.

1514
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:25,452
Thank you.

1515
01:54:27,415 --> 01:54:28,676
You have questions for the gentleman?

1516
01:54:30,236 --> 01:54:32,537
It's present.

1517
01:54:33,258 --> 01:54:35,419
Oh, one second.

1518
01:54:35,999 --> 01:54:37,360
You are in favor of the project, correct?

1519
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:39,141
Yes, sir.

1520
01:54:39,761 --> 01:54:41,001
Anyone else in favor of the project?

1521
01:54:42,242 --> 01:54:43,283
Thank you, sir.

1522
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:46,844
Hearing and seeing many more, is there anyone here opposed to the project?

1523
01:54:48,785 --> 01:54:51,146
Hearing and seeing none, we motion that by the hearing closed.

1524
01:54:51,506 --> 01:54:53,908
So, sure, if you can come back here.

1525
01:54:55,783 --> 01:55:01,530
So you have the conditions by the engineer in the back here?

1526
01:55:02,591 --> 01:55:03,772
Yes, I saw the conditions.

1527
01:55:05,855 --> 01:55:06,936
Do we have questions for the gentleman?

1528
01:55:07,617 --> 01:55:08,278
Councilor Falco.

1529
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:08,979
Thank you, Mr. President.

1530
01:55:08,999 --> 01:55:10,941
I have a couple of quick questions.

1531
01:55:10,981 --> 01:55:15,867
The first being, if this is approved, when will the work begin and how long will it take?

1532
01:55:18,379 --> 01:55:21,641
Potentially, I mean, it shouldn't take more than one day's worth of work.

1533
01:55:22,462 --> 01:55:31,168
Yes, and as soon as it's approved, we will ask our civil contractor to get the permits and we can start almost immediately.

1534
01:55:32,469 --> 01:55:32,769
Thank you.

1535
01:55:32,969 --> 01:55:35,211
You're welcome, sir.

1536
01:55:35,851 --> 01:55:36,111
Thank you.

1537
01:55:36,131 --> 01:55:37,272
Councilor Bass.

1538
01:55:38,413 --> 01:55:44,277
And in terms of the sidewalk, the new sidewalk has not gone in yet, so is that correct?

1539
01:55:45,618 --> 01:55:49,339
I'm not sure, I've not been to that location for a while.

1540
01:55:49,399 --> 01:55:54,741
Okay, but if it has, and you have to dig it up, you'll replace with concrete, correct?

1541
01:55:54,761 --> 01:55:55,662
Yes, definitely, we will.

1542
01:55:55,902 --> 01:55:56,342
Thank you.

1543
01:55:56,562 --> 01:55:56,922
Thank you.

1544
01:55:58,403 --> 01:55:59,563
Any further questions for the gentleman?

1545
01:55:59,583 --> 01:56:04,065
Okay, so, Chair, what's the motion?

1546
01:56:04,445 --> 01:56:12,448
At this time, I would ask that we amend the petition to include what the petitioner just mentioned, that it's not seven feet, it's 10 feet.

1547
01:56:13,635 --> 01:56:18,940
and that reflected in the approval by the city engineers, he also refers to seven feet.

1548
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:21,222
So it's 10 feet, not seven.

1549
01:56:21,502 --> 01:56:27,567
Yeah, I mean, it may still be seven feet, you know, it may, I mean, increase to 10 feet.

1550
01:56:27,907 --> 01:56:39,837
The issue is, when we did like a manhole survey, they actually discovered the underground submersible transformers will not allow them to go in the direction we intended to go.

1551
01:56:40,395 --> 01:56:42,275
So now they want to go from a different angle.

1552
01:56:42,355 --> 01:56:46,917
They are not sure what they will do until they get the civil contract on board.

1553
01:56:47,457 --> 01:56:50,557
So what I'm saying basically, it may increase to about 10 feet.

1554
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:52,018
It may, it may not.

1555
01:56:52,498 --> 01:56:52,938
Yeah.

1556
01:56:53,818 --> 01:56:55,879
Yeah.

1557
01:56:55,999 --> 01:56:58,179
Okay, so we'll change this.

1558
01:56:58,219 --> 01:56:58,579
Thank you.

1559
01:56:58,899 --> 01:57:01,320
Okay, thank you.

1560
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:09,662
So, the motion by Councilor Marks to increase it from seven to 10 feet

1561
01:57:11,993 --> 01:57:13,833
is seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1562
01:57:13,853 --> 01:57:14,713
All those in favor?

1563
01:57:15,734 --> 01:57:16,234
Any opposed?

1564
01:57:16,354 --> 01:57:19,055
Okay, on the original motion.

1565
01:57:24,756 --> 01:57:28,538
On the motion by Councilor Beers to approve as amended, seconded by?

1566
01:57:29,818 --> 01:57:30,898
Seconded by Councilor Marks.

1567
01:57:31,339 --> 01:57:32,079
All those in favor?

1568
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:33,939
All those opposed?

1569
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:35,940
None.

1570
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:37,320
Motion passes.

1571
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:37,881
Thank you, sir.

1572
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:47,773
All right, we got another one.

1573
01:57:47,793 --> 01:57:51,756
21458, petition for a grant of location, National Grid, North Andover, Massachusetts.

1574
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:56,058
Motion to waive the remainder of the brief, Mr. President, to give a brief synopsis.

1575
01:57:56,118 --> 01:57:59,781
I'm running out of breath here.

1576
01:58:01,362 --> 01:58:02,422
This is a public hearing.

1577
01:58:02,502 --> 01:58:03,883
Are you here in favor of the project?

1578
01:58:04,243 --> 01:58:04,704
Yes, I am.

1579
01:58:04,724 --> 01:58:05,144
Thank you, sir.

1580
01:58:05,364 --> 01:58:05,604
Thank you.

1581
01:58:05,624 --> 01:58:06,825
Anyone else in favor of this project?

1582
01:58:07,855 --> 01:58:11,057
Hearing and seeing none, this part of the hearing is closed.

1583
01:58:11,337 --> 01:58:12,558
Anyone opposed to this project?

1584
01:58:14,019 --> 01:58:16,120
Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the hearing.

1585
01:58:16,961 --> 01:58:22,465
Sir, if you could just give us a brief synopsis of this project on Magoon Avenue.

1586
01:58:23,425 --> 01:58:25,867
So this is an existing customer.

1587
01:58:25,987 --> 01:58:28,328
His service goes overhead from the pole line to the house.

1588
01:58:28,909 --> 01:58:32,091
Now he wants to relocate to the underground system.

1589
01:58:32,171 --> 01:58:34,953
So we're installing approximately eight

1590
01:58:35,717 --> 01:58:41,139
feet of one three-inch concrete from the pole towards his house, going across the sidewalk.

1591
01:58:41,259 --> 01:58:41,599
Thank you.

1592
01:58:41,619 --> 01:58:47,900
Yep, exactly.

1593
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:49,061
Yes, exactly.

1594
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:50,101
Thank you.

1595
01:58:50,261 --> 01:58:53,082
Mr. President, a quick question as far as

1596
01:59:07,241 --> 01:59:08,562
How long will this project take?

1597
01:59:08,922 --> 01:59:10,743
Yeah, less than one day's work.

1598
01:59:10,783 --> 01:59:12,064
One day's work, okay, thank you.

1599
01:59:12,344 --> 01:59:12,645
Thank you.

1600
01:59:13,245 --> 01:59:16,387
Okay, the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

1601
01:59:17,628 --> 01:59:18,308
All those in favor?

1602
01:59:18,629 --> 01:59:18,729
Aye.

1603
01:59:19,349 --> 01:59:19,409
Aye.

1604
01:59:19,489 --> 01:59:20,010
All those opposed?

1605
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:20,730
Motion passes.

1606
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:21,371
Thank you, sir.

1607
01:59:21,391 --> 01:59:29,996
Thank you.

1608
01:59:30,176 --> 01:59:30,857
Okay.

1609
01:59:30,877 --> 01:59:35,140
21459, petition for a greater location, Verizon New England, underground cables and fixtures.

1610
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:37,074
We hear by notified.

1611
01:59:37,174 --> 01:59:41,196
Motion to waive the remainder of the reading, Mr. President, and to give a brief synopsis.

1612
01:59:41,576 --> 01:59:44,978
On the motion by Councilor Bax, seconded by Councilor Beers.

1613
01:59:45,038 --> 01:59:45,778
All those in favor?

1614
01:59:46,539 --> 01:59:46,599
Aye.

1615
01:59:46,619 --> 01:59:47,039
All those opposed?

1616
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:47,739
Motion passes.

1617
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:50,420
Do we have anybody here from Verizon this evening?

1618
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:54,382
Motion to table, Mr. President.

1619
01:59:54,662 --> 01:59:54,962
Hold on.

1620
01:59:54,982 --> 01:59:58,044
Maybe there's James.

1621
01:59:58,284 --> 02:00:00,465
Is that James?

1622
02:00:04,721 --> 02:00:05,661
Good evening, Councillors.

1623
02:00:05,701 --> 02:00:10,545
James Day, Toronto, contract engineer on behalf of Verizon New England.

1624
02:00:11,405 --> 02:00:11,926
Thank you, sir.

1625
02:00:12,446 --> 02:00:17,610
If you could give us a brief synopsis of this project.

1626
02:00:18,446 --> 02:00:18,986
Absolutely.

1627
02:00:19,687 --> 02:00:36,316
So Verizon will be placing approximately 10 feet of two 4-inch conduits from Handhole 1 to the property line in order to connect with underground facilities at the property line of 662 Boston Avenue.

1628
02:00:38,218 --> 02:00:47,343
We're doing that to provide Verizon service to the new MBTA station of the Green Line, I believe it is.

1629
02:00:49,507 --> 02:00:52,609
Okay.

1630
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:54,471
Okay.

1631
02:00:54,751 --> 02:00:59,395
So with this as a hearing, you are in favor of this project, correct?

1632
02:01:00,495 --> 02:01:00,876
Yes, sir.

1633
02:01:01,456 --> 02:01:02,537
Thank you, sir.

1634
02:01:02,577 --> 02:01:03,438
Anyone else in favor?

1635
02:01:03,498 --> 02:01:06,120
Hearing and seeing none, motion that part of the hearing closed.

1636
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,521
Anyone opposed to this project?

1637
02:01:08,782 --> 02:01:11,864
Hearing and seeing none, we motion that part of the hearing closed.

1638
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:15,627
Okay, so any more questions for the petitioner from Verizon?

1639
02:01:15,807 --> 02:01:16,288
Mr. President.

1640
02:01:16,993 --> 02:01:17,593
Councilor Falcone.

1641
02:01:17,653 --> 02:01:18,514
Thank you, Mr. President.

1642
02:01:18,654 --> 02:01:24,155
If I may, how long do you think this will take to complete?

1643
02:01:25,816 --> 02:01:29,237
From what I have here, I don't anticipate it will take longer than a day.

1644
02:01:30,117 --> 02:01:31,158
Okay, perfect, thank you.

1645
02:01:33,078 --> 02:01:35,559
Of course, sure.

1646
02:01:35,579 --> 02:01:38,240
The motion by Councilor Scott Pele for approval, seconded by?

1647
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:38,860
Second.

1648
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,281
Seconded by Councilor Bez.

1649
02:01:40,921 --> 02:01:41,641
All those in favor?

1650
02:01:42,402 --> 02:01:42,502
Aye.

1651
02:01:42,522 --> 02:01:43,922
All those opposed?

1652
02:01:45,202 --> 02:01:46,483
Motion passes, thank you, sir.

1653
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:48,111
Thank you.

1654
02:01:48,131 --> 02:01:48,411
Good evening.

1655
02:01:48,491 --> 02:01:49,992
Okay.

1656
02:01:52,833 --> 02:01:54,193
It's time for my stuff.

1657
02:01:54,553 --> 02:02:00,055
I think that's it for the petitions.

1658
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:00,795
Okay.

1659
02:02:00,815 --> 02:02:02,015
21491 offered by Councilor Bez.

1660
02:02:02,796 --> 02:02:03,636
Be it resolved.

1661
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:22,197
by the Memphis City Council that the Cannabis Advisory Commission and or the city administration include labor peace agreement language in any host community agreements made between the city of Memphis and any potential recreational or medicinal cannabis dispensaries.

1662
02:02:22,297 --> 02:02:22,937
Councilor Baez.

1663
02:02:23,077 --> 02:02:24,038
Thank you, Mr. President.

1664
02:02:24,898 --> 02:02:33,522
As folks may or may not know, one of the fastest growing unionized industries in the state is the medical and recreational marijuana industry.

1665
02:02:34,322 --> 02:02:44,075
Um, several of our local unions have been, uh, have been going out and organizing workers at these various locations.

1666
02:02:44,596 --> 02:02:51,304
Um, one thing that has been included in many agreements between municipalities and the

1667
02:02:52,674 --> 02:03:02,838
owners or license holders of these facilities is that the license holders will not actively, will not try to oppose the unionization effort if it comes to their shop.

1668
02:03:03,518 --> 02:03:16,063
So that is the request here of the Cannabis Advisory Commission and the city to include language in our agreements that ask these license holders not to oppose unionization efforts at these facilities.

1669
02:03:17,272 --> 02:03:25,899
With all the hearings that have already been completed, I don't know if we have the authority to demand this in that.

1670
02:03:26,059 --> 02:03:37,888
The hearings have already been done, so to add new language into, maybe something going forward, but to add new language into the agreement that was already reached with these people, I don't know.

1671
02:03:38,168 --> 02:03:41,471
I think we should be seeking a legal opinion on this.

1672
02:03:43,248 --> 02:03:47,371
host community agreements have been agreed to, because they would have to have been approved.

1673
02:03:47,391 --> 02:03:49,333
Let's say the hearings have all been done.

1674
02:03:49,673 --> 02:03:51,694
But that's for the licensure.

1675
02:03:51,875 --> 02:04:00,201
The host community agreements are the, when they decide on the final three applicants, then they would begin negotiations around the host community agreements.

1676
02:04:00,221 --> 02:04:01,802
So that's my understanding of the process.

1677
02:04:02,663 --> 02:04:04,904
All right, so thank you.

1678
02:04:04,984 --> 02:04:06,105
Any further discussion on this?

1679
02:04:06,986 --> 02:04:07,746
I would move approval.

1680
02:04:08,567 --> 02:04:10,489
Mr. President, I, Mr. President,

1681
02:04:11,227 --> 02:04:11,787
Councilor Marks.

1682
02:04:12,347 --> 02:04:26,131
I would tend, I would feel more comfortable if we did get an opinion from the city solicitor, you know, and we did create a cannabis advisory commission for purpose and I don't want to overstep our boundaries.

1683
02:04:26,991 --> 02:04:37,913
The resolution refers to include, include to me is asking them to put it in there, not asking them whether they would review or take it under advisement.

1684
02:04:38,054 --> 02:04:38,654
Changing the rules.

1685
02:04:38,674 --> 02:04:39,914
You're asking them to include it.

1686
02:04:40,407 --> 02:04:46,792
So I just would feel more comfortable having city solicitor to take a look at it, yeah.

1687
02:04:47,032 --> 02:04:50,515
I've made a motion to approve, but whatever happens happens.

1688
02:04:52,816 --> 02:04:53,877
There's no second on it, so.

1689
02:04:55,838 --> 02:04:59,321
On the motion by Council Beers to approve, seconded by.

1690
02:05:05,706 --> 02:05:06,526
I'll withdraw the motion.

1691
02:05:07,187 --> 02:05:08,448
The motion has been withdrawn.

1692
02:05:13,889 --> 02:05:14,670
21492, be it resolved.

1693
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:16,491
Offered by councilors, be it resolved.

1694
02:05:16,871 --> 02:05:22,735
Councilor Baez, do you want to withdraw the motion?

1695
02:05:22,775 --> 02:05:25,097
No, I was just withdrawing my motion to approve.

1696
02:05:25,397 --> 02:05:26,738
So if there's another motion on the floor.

1697
02:05:26,798 --> 02:05:29,800
Oh, Councilor Marks, you want to, I'm sorry, I thought you were going to draw it over.

1698
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,422
No, if there's a motion to refer to the solicitor.

1699
02:05:31,862 --> 02:05:36,425
I wouldn't be opposed to that, or I wouldn't be opposed to receiving it and placing it on file, Mr. President.

1700
02:05:36,705 --> 02:05:37,706
Councilor Baez, it's your motion.

1701
02:05:37,726 --> 02:05:39,047
Do you want to receive it and place it on file?

1702
02:05:39,087 --> 02:05:41,689
Motion to refer to the city solicitor for an opinion.

1703
02:05:42,408 --> 02:05:50,473
On the motion by Councilor Behrs to refer 214-991 to the city solicitor for an opinion, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1704
02:05:51,314 --> 02:05:52,035
All those in favor?

1705
02:05:52,055 --> 02:05:54,076
All those opposed?

1706
02:05:54,096 --> 02:05:54,796
Motion passes.

1707
02:05:54,816 --> 02:06:01,361
21- Mr. President, just for the edification, because the city solicitor is going to want to know what we're referring to and for what purpose.

1708
02:06:01,401 --> 02:06:10,607
And the purpose, I think, at least for me, is to find out whether or not we have the authority to request that in a separate board.

1709
02:06:11,358 --> 02:06:15,003
or a separate commission by state statute that's created.

1710
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:19,149
So that would be the question I have, whether we have the authority.

1711
02:06:20,231 --> 02:06:23,656
Okay, 21492, offered by Councilor Baez, be it resolved.

1712
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:33,523
by the Memphis City Council that abutters within 250 feet of a city-owned tree be notified at least 14 days in advance if the tree is going to be removed.

1713
02:06:33,563 --> 02:06:34,163
Councilor Baird.

1714
02:06:34,403 --> 02:06:35,343
Thank you, Mr. President.

1715
02:06:35,903 --> 02:06:43,486
There have been many city-owned trees that have been cut down or removed with pretty short notice.

1716
02:06:44,186 --> 02:06:50,688
I did receive some communication from the tree warden that the forestry department generally does not

1717
02:06:51,776 --> 02:06:55,759
decide to remove a tree until one to two days before they remove that tree.

1718
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:00,803
And there was also a mention of emergency removals with National Grid.

1719
02:07:01,744 --> 02:07:04,606
I have no problem if there's an emergency with something needs to be removed.

1720
02:07:05,126 --> 02:07:13,793
But you know, I do think that abutters, I've run into abutters, there's a tree right in front of their house, they've planted their whole garden based around that tree, they've, you know,

1721
02:07:14,304 --> 02:07:20,208
put a table out there based on that tree, and then they come out one day and there's a sign, and the next day the tree's gone.

1722
02:07:20,228 --> 02:07:33,037
And that doesn't seem like enough due process, or at least enough of a notification for abutters that something that provides shade and that they've come to rely on is going to be removed.

1723
02:07:33,117 --> 02:07:36,800
So I would ask that there at least be more formal notice and the ability of,

1724
02:07:38,024 --> 02:07:46,548
you know, residents, if a tree is going to be removed to come to us or come to the tree warden with some advanced notice, I put in 14 days because I felt that was reasonable.

1725
02:07:47,949 --> 02:07:51,051
So it is just a request that they provide a little bit more time.

1726
02:07:51,071 --> 02:08:06,919
I certainly have no problem with emergency removals happening if they're an emergency, but if this is something that's being pre-planned and doesn't need to happen in 48 hours or 24 hours, I really do think that residents should get more notice when a tree is going to be removed.

1727
02:08:08,248 --> 02:08:10,810
We have Aggie Tudin on the call here.

1728
02:08:13,572 --> 02:08:13,833
Aggie?

1729
02:08:16,975 --> 02:08:17,676
Aggie, are you here?

1730
02:08:20,838 --> 02:08:26,142
Aggie Tudin?

1731
02:08:26,202 --> 02:08:26,462
See ya.

1732
02:08:27,003 --> 02:08:27,283
Aggie?

1733
02:08:30,806 --> 02:08:33,528
Okay, Councilor Morrell.

1734
02:08:35,197 --> 02:08:35,877
Thank you, Mr. President.

1735
02:08:35,897 --> 02:08:39,079
Yeah, I support the intention of this resolution.

1736
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:48,143
I think there's, I know personally there was a tree chipper down the street from me the other day, and he'd go running to the window to see which beloved tree is coming down.

1737
02:08:48,163 --> 02:08:50,184
And I think that notification is really important.

1738
02:08:51,065 --> 02:08:57,228
You know, trees don't benefit just the direct abutters, they direct, you know, they benefit the whole block, they cool the whole block.

1739
02:08:57,248 --> 02:09:00,509
So I think just as advanced notification gives people a chance to,

1740
02:09:02,670 --> 02:09:07,233
whether it's just get on the list for a new tree, buy their own tree, or just wrap their head around what's happening.

1741
02:09:07,253 --> 02:09:10,115
I think this is important just for stewardship in our community.

1742
02:09:10,216 --> 02:09:20,603
And I also, I don't know if we need amended language to include the emergency situations or if the tree we're in would offer that if she joins us.

1743
02:09:20,703 --> 02:09:25,246
But I do support this, but I also support the inclusion of emergency language.

1744
02:09:26,887 --> 02:09:27,167
Thank you.

1745
02:09:27,788 --> 02:09:28,588
Aggie, last call.

1746
02:09:28,808 --> 02:09:29,489
You were there.

1747
02:09:29,509 --> 02:09:30,950
Any opinion, Aggie?

1748
02:09:32,777 --> 02:09:33,457
No, it's not.

1749
02:09:36,219 --> 02:09:36,860
Good evening, sir.

1750
02:09:39,462 --> 02:09:42,084
Gentleman from East Medford, name and address of the record, please.

1751
02:09:43,785 --> 02:09:44,926
The mic's on now.

1752
02:09:45,066 --> 02:09:45,726
The mic's on?

1753
02:09:46,186 --> 02:09:48,488
I'll have to be careful what I say then.

1754
02:09:48,848 --> 02:09:58,055
By the way, Mr. President, to the chair, off the record, I could tell Councilor Mox, say it ain't so, Joe.

1755
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:03,711
We're gonna sorely miss him, but not for long, I hope.

1756
02:10:03,951 --> 02:10:06,511
Thank you.

1757
02:10:06,651 --> 02:10:15,693
On this tree business, it is my understanding, let me back up, I'm not sure what the ordinance or law is within the city about trees.

1758
02:10:16,313 --> 02:10:22,495
I love nature, personally speaking, and I have three trees around my house, city trees.

1759
02:10:23,355 --> 02:10:23,955
My question

1760
02:10:24,464 --> 02:10:46,675
Actually, my thought was, I remember reading the legal notices all too often, and I thought they were advertised in advance, so at least I want to guesstimate a week, two or three weeks in advance, and usually has a listing of multiple trees at certain addresses in the city, saying and calling them public trees, and they will be

1761
02:10:47,675 --> 02:10:50,816
taken down, so that's all I can say.

1762
02:10:50,876 --> 02:10:56,279
I'm not sure if I was dreaming when I saw this years and years ago, haven't seen any recently.

1763
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:11,505
I don't know personally if it existed in the past, but I think that's exactly the kind of practice I would like to see in terms of notification, that a notice go out and give people due notice that something may be removed.

1764
02:11:11,565 --> 02:11:14,686
I mean, I've had residents say, I walked out one morning and my tree was gone.

1765
02:11:14,726 --> 02:11:16,467
It's been there for 30 years and now there's no tree.

1766
02:11:19,701 --> 02:11:20,502
Okay.

1767
02:11:20,582 --> 02:11:22,962
Mr. President, if I could, Aggie's not on the call.

1768
02:11:23,002 --> 02:11:25,123
She's on the call, but she's not answering.

1769
02:11:25,323 --> 02:11:25,603
Okay.

1770
02:11:25,943 --> 02:11:33,946
Because Aggie we know best, but from my previous experience, the state statute is very clear about the removal of a public shade tree.

1771
02:11:34,786 --> 02:11:44,109
And Aggie falls that to the T. And my experience states, unless it's an emergency, that it requires the tree be posted.

1772
02:11:44,669 --> 02:11:46,530
So the tree will officially get a posting on it,

1773
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:50,804
And I believe it requires a public hearing for any removal of the tree.

1774
02:11:51,465 --> 02:11:54,948
And that is duly posted as well as Mr. Castanetti said.

1775
02:11:55,708 --> 02:11:58,951
And I've never heard of the one or two day notification.

1776
02:11:59,431 --> 02:12:02,854
It's more like seven to 14 or maybe even longer.

1777
02:12:03,635 --> 02:12:15,785
So if trees are being removed, it may be an emergent nature or it may be the city's no longer following state statute, which I highly doubt.

1778
02:12:16,868 --> 02:12:22,572
Mr President, but it's about time we take a look at our own tree ordinance, which we don't have.

1779
02:12:22,612 --> 02:12:27,735
By the way, we don't have anything that protects public shade trees on.

1780
02:12:27,755 --> 02:12:30,837
There's been a lot of talk over the years, but very little action.

1781
02:12:31,437 --> 02:12:43,125
And I think this is a perfect time, maybe to send something to a subcommittee, maybe the public works subcommittee, um, and have them take a look at the creation of a tree ordinance.

1782
02:12:43,145 --> 02:12:43,705
Mr President,

1783
02:12:46,232 --> 02:12:46,852
Councilor Falcone.

1784
02:12:47,212 --> 02:12:47,793
Thank you, Mr. President.

1785
02:12:47,813 --> 02:12:54,975
We do have a pre-ordinance, I think that just got moved to Committee of the Whole, that we reviewed, I think about a month ago.

1786
02:12:56,336 --> 02:12:56,996
In subcommittee?

1787
02:12:57,496 --> 02:13:02,098
It went from the Woodman subcommittee to Committee of the Whole.

1788
02:13:02,118 --> 02:13:04,238
So it was just voted over, I think it was July 17th.

1789
02:13:05,399 --> 02:13:10,320
I would be happy to refer this paper to the same Committee of the Whole and have that discussion as part of the larger pre-ordinance.

1790
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:12,541
I think that would make it complete.

1791
02:13:12,601 --> 02:13:13,702
I think Aggie might be on the call now.

1792
02:13:13,762 --> 02:13:14,602
Aggie, you on the call now?

1793
02:13:21,161 --> 02:13:21,341
No.

1794
02:13:21,401 --> 02:13:26,083
Again, I'm trying to committee of the whole refer this to the same meeting.

1795
02:13:27,703 --> 02:13:29,063
She's there but she's not answering.

1796
02:13:33,565 --> 02:13:35,185
All right, so all right, we've been here a while.

1797
02:13:35,205 --> 02:13:36,105
I don't want to belabor it.

1798
02:13:36,165 --> 02:13:40,766
So my motion is to refer to committee of the whole for discussion along with the tree ordinance.

1799
02:13:41,246 --> 02:13:43,067
Okay, so on the motion by Council of is

1800
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:46,461
to refer this to Committee of the Whole with the tree warden.

1801
02:13:47,522 --> 02:13:48,662
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1802
02:13:48,682 --> 02:13:49,322
All those in favor?

1803
02:13:49,583 --> 02:13:49,703
Aye.

1804
02:13:49,823 --> 02:13:50,563
All those opposed?

1805
02:13:50,623 --> 02:13:51,323
Motion passes.

1806
02:13:58,286 --> 02:14:02,248
I'll skip mine because I got a couple here and then we'll share.

1807
02:14:02,268 --> 02:14:03,929
21494 offered by Councilor Behrs.

1808
02:14:04,009 --> 02:14:04,449
I withdraw.

1809
02:14:04,469 --> 02:14:06,269
You withdraw this?

1810
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:07,890
Yeah, we've discussed it enough.

1811
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:08,030
Okay. 21495.

1812
02:14:12,618 --> 02:14:27,708
offered by Councilor Behrs, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that we receive an update from Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee regarding Paper 21, not 312, to support state legislation regarding pilot payments.

1813
02:14:28,469 --> 02:14:30,550
This paper is in committee.

1814
02:14:31,451 --> 02:14:32,892
Mr. Clerk, who is the chair of that committee?

1815
02:14:35,333 --> 02:14:35,693
Who's the?

1816
02:14:36,274 --> 02:14:38,035
I can look on my phone.

1817
02:14:38,295 --> 02:14:39,376
I think I am, Mr. Chair.

1818
02:14:40,016 --> 02:14:40,997
Councilor Marks, you are the chair?

1819
02:14:41,437 --> 02:14:41,737
I think so.

1820
02:14:44,496 --> 02:14:46,457
Maybe call a meeting going down the line?

1821
02:14:47,797 --> 02:14:49,998
Yeah, I'm not quite sure what we're gonna discuss.

1822
02:14:50,799 --> 02:14:59,583
The action was to wait for the state legislature to enact a piece of legislation, which never happened.

1823
02:15:01,124 --> 02:15:04,125
I mean, I guess we can meet to talk, because we have nothing else to do.

1824
02:15:04,925 --> 02:15:07,046
I believe the, well, we have plenty to do.

1825
02:15:07,427 --> 02:15:10,088
The resolution was that this council

1826
02:15:10,972 --> 02:15:15,055
would contact the legislature and say that we support the legislation that has been filed.

1827
02:15:16,536 --> 02:15:21,900
And I believe the issue at the time was that bill numbers had not been issued yet, that kind of thing.

1828
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:25,423
So it was just kind of still on a docket number, a temporary number.

1829
02:15:26,043 --> 02:15:38,433
Bill numbers have now been issued and we put a 90 day shot clock on the paper that the subcommittee would meet in 90 days to discuss whether we thought it was reasonable for this council to support such a legislation.

1830
02:15:39,562 --> 02:15:41,017
So that's, I believe, where we left it.

1831
02:15:41,975 --> 02:15:46,936
And I don't believe that council has the authority to put a 90 day shot clock on a subcommittee.

1832
02:15:47,997 --> 02:15:57,699
So I think the council overstepped its boundaries, but needless to say, Mr. President, I'm not sure quite what will be the discussion on a piece of legislation that hasn't been passed.

1833
02:15:58,219 --> 02:16:09,222
So that we need to give local cities and towns the authority to make a pilot and in lieu of tax payment mandatory for certain entities.

1834
02:16:09,882 --> 02:16:14,285
And if that legislation is not passed, I'm not sure what the subcommittee's use is.

1835
02:16:14,825 --> 02:16:22,110
If you're looking just for the council to give a vote of support on the legislation, then I don't think that was the correct place to send it to a subcommittee for that.

1836
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:25,613
That was not my motion to send it to subcommittee, certainly.

1837
02:16:25,673 --> 02:16:26,893
That's what was passed, right?

1838
02:16:27,134 --> 02:16:27,294
Right.

1839
02:16:27,334 --> 02:16:30,956
Well, I mean, I'd be happy to file it again.

1840
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:33,898
I just don't know what we're going to discuss.

1841
02:16:34,098 --> 02:16:34,959
What do we discuss?

1842
02:16:35,239 --> 02:16:38,301
Something that may eventually be passed by the state legislature?

1843
02:16:39,009 --> 02:16:46,711
Well, that was, I mean, it could be a five minute meeting to say, yes, we should send our note of support to the legislature that we think this is something that we should have.

1844
02:16:47,171 --> 02:16:55,053
Just on the substance of it, I do think we need more authority and uniformity in state government and state statute to provide clarity around pilot agreements.

1845
02:16:55,753 --> 02:17:03,075
And we know the pilot agreements are very important to the city bringing in close to $5 million a year in revenue of our $200 million.

1846
02:17:03,395 --> 02:17:07,316
So that's why I put it forward is the state doesn't have a good framework for this.

1847
02:17:08,427 --> 02:17:12,010
and this bill would provide a new state framework that then we can operate under.

1848
02:17:12,811 --> 02:17:17,975
The request was just that we support these bills and ask that our delegation advance them in the legislature.

1849
02:17:18,235 --> 02:17:18,836
Right.

1850
02:17:19,056 --> 02:17:30,825
So in my opinion, Mr. President, and maybe this is the conversation we're going to have at subcommittee, but in my opinion, Mr. President, the city is what needs to put together a framework regarding in lieu of tax payment.

1851
02:17:31,065 --> 02:17:33,027
City Council does not negotiate battle agreements.

1852
02:17:33,127 --> 02:17:34,648
And there is no current, as far as I know,

1853
02:17:37,194 --> 02:17:38,636
game plan within the community.

1854
02:17:39,116 --> 02:17:46,323
And I was one of the first members when I first got on the council to request Tufts University, which never gave it a little tax payment.

1855
02:17:47,004 --> 02:17:55,353
And I was one of the first to initiate that Mr. President, and then Mayor McGlynn signed a 10 year pilot program, which was severely

1856
02:17:57,508 --> 02:18:02,330
underfunded, in my opinion, or not what it should have been for such an institution.

1857
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:12,274
But needless to say, Mr. President, this legislation doesn't say that the cities and towns have the authority to create their own policy or procedures.

1858
02:18:12,674 --> 02:18:16,015
This states that it goes from voluntary to mandatory.

1859
02:18:16,576 --> 02:18:22,898
That's a huge change, Mr. President, that could potentially impact every church in the community.

1860
02:18:23,782 --> 02:18:33,729
And every nonprofit that's servicing homeless, that's servicing disabled, that's doing yeoman's work, Mr. President, this could have a giant impact.

1861
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:39,694
So I don't think it's as easy to say we should just support this.

1862
02:18:40,034 --> 02:18:50,522
This has really far reaching impact on nonprofits, including churches, Mr. President, in this community.

1863
02:18:51,033 --> 02:18:57,138
I don't want to get into the minutiae, but the legislation that is proposed in the State House would not apply to churches or social service organizations.

1864
02:18:57,218 --> 02:18:59,821
So there would not be mandatory payments for either of those groups.

1865
02:19:00,241 --> 02:19:10,450
That's from the gentleman I talked to that I think you've been speaking with, and that probably initiated this with you, that will be left up to cities and towns.

1866
02:19:11,310 --> 02:19:15,658
Um, so I was told that that will be left up to cities and towns.

1867
02:19:15,899 --> 02:19:17,662
I believe he may have been not exempt.

1868
02:19:17,962 --> 02:19:19,064
He had not gotten that wrong.

1869
02:19:19,345 --> 02:19:22,370
But well, that's that's the feedback I got.

1870
02:19:22,911 --> 02:19:23,793
Um, you know, so

1871
02:19:24,377 --> 02:19:33,902
And I as one member, I'm not going to go after churches, Mr. President, or any other nonprofit that's doing social services for our constituency.

1872
02:19:34,422 --> 02:19:42,887
If you read the legislation, it explicitly includes a specific category of nonprofits, which is the large educational and medical institutions.

1873
02:19:43,587 --> 02:19:45,889
and excludes the church's religious organization.

1874
02:19:45,909 --> 02:19:47,450
Why don't you provide that language to us?

1875
02:19:47,590 --> 02:19:49,852
I believe I did when I proposed the original.

1876
02:19:49,992 --> 02:19:51,032
I'd ask that you provide it again.

1877
02:19:51,052 --> 02:19:52,493
That's not my understanding.

1878
02:19:52,694 --> 02:19:53,494
I would be happy to.

1879
02:19:54,555 --> 02:20:05,643
In any case, on your other point, which is the local action that we can take, I do have proposed ordinance language, and I would love to have a committee of the whole on what we could create as a local ordinance around pilot agreements.

1880
02:20:09,123 --> 02:20:11,905
City Council does not negotiate pilot agreements.

1881
02:20:11,985 --> 02:20:12,445
The Mayor does.

1882
02:20:12,485 --> 02:20:18,148
Yes, this would create a framework, and actually I have had several discussions with the Mayor and residents on this.

1883
02:20:18,168 --> 02:20:20,890
Well, when the Mayor comes here with her suggestions, we'll take it up.

1884
02:20:20,910 --> 02:20:28,835
But meanwhile, the Mayor is the chief negotiating officer of the city, and the Mayor negotiates pilot agreements, not the City Council.

1885
02:20:29,335 --> 02:20:29,615
All right.

1886
02:20:30,496 --> 02:20:37,140
So, on the motion by Council of Mayors, to receive a report, that's it.

1887
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,461
I withdraw.

1888
02:20:39,551 --> 02:20:45,722
Motion to adjourn.

1889
02:20:45,963 --> 02:20:48,087
21496 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the method...

1890
02:20:49,687 --> 02:20:59,050
that Medford Deputy Fire Chief Fran Fosco be recognized on his recent retirement after serving the residents of Medford with distinction for the past 34 years.

1891
02:20:59,691 --> 02:21:00,291
Councilor Marks.

1892
02:21:01,011 --> 02:21:02,091
Thank you, Mr. President.

1893
02:21:02,251 --> 02:21:11,555
For all of us that know Deputy Chief Fosco, he started up through the ranks, Mr. President, and worked his way up to deputy chief.

1894
02:21:12,435 --> 02:21:35,651
And you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler man, Mr. President, a man who has raised a family, a man who has dedicated his life to the firefighting profession in the city of Method, a man that always has been honored and respected in his field, and someone that really is going to be sorely missed.

1895
02:21:36,111 --> 02:21:40,234
His breadth of knowledge regarding fire suppression,

1896
02:21:40,954 --> 02:21:48,757
uh, regarding, uh, you know, fire management and, uh, just, uh, the administration of a fire department.

1897
02:21:49,458 --> 02:21:59,402
Uh, it goes on matched and, uh, you know, personally, I wish he had a few more years because I think, uh, he would have made a great chief to be quite frank with him.

1898
02:22:00,062 --> 02:22:03,504
Um, he's loved by, uh, his fellow firefighters.

1899
02:22:03,924 --> 02:22:06,525
He's a man of reason, a man of knowledge.

1900
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:11,291
And I think someone that would have really done well in that role.

1901
02:22:11,351 --> 02:22:12,952
But however, he is retiring.

1902
02:22:13,012 --> 02:22:14,392
I want to wish him well.

1903
02:22:15,193 --> 02:22:18,213
And I look forward to seeing him around the community, Mr. President.

1904
02:22:19,014 --> 02:22:22,715
And I wish him well on any future endeavors.

1905
02:22:22,875 --> 02:22:23,095
Thank you.

1906
02:22:23,779 --> 02:22:24,839
Councilor Scott Belli.

1907
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:25,739
Thank you, Mr. President.

1908
02:22:25,759 --> 02:22:27,300
Thank you, Council, for bringing this forward.

1909
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:36,342
I think that Mr. Fusco is someone that I personally would reach out to if we had issues or concerns, and he'd be the first person to call back.

1910
02:22:36,402 --> 02:22:43,404
Always had a solution to assist you in not leaving people in the lurch or leaving them dumbfounded.

1911
02:22:43,444 --> 02:22:48,745
I think that Councilor Marks, as his knowledge of what he does, is second to none, and I agree.

1912
02:22:48,805 --> 02:22:49,845
He would have been a great chief.

1913
02:22:51,305 --> 02:22:53,266
But more than that, I think the respect

1914
02:22:54,247 --> 02:23:02,464
And what he gets from his colleagues and the people that work for him, I think is pretty

1915
02:23:04,802 --> 02:23:05,582
pretty impressive.

1916
02:23:05,662 --> 02:23:18,905
So I think that it's again, you celebrate and you applaud and you congratulate him on his retirement, but it's definitely, they're definitely gonna be shoes that need to be filled by a few people, I think.

1917
02:23:18,945 --> 02:23:30,088
So thank you, Mr. Fusco, and again, a great Memphis family, and I'm glad he settled in this area to raise his family.

1918
02:23:30,108 --> 02:23:30,988
So thank you so much.

1919
02:23:31,468 --> 02:23:31,748
Thank you.

1920
02:23:31,768 --> 02:23:32,368
Councilor Falcone.

1921
02:23:32,689 --> 02:23:33,369
Thank you, Mr. President.

1922
02:23:33,389 --> 02:23:33,869
I'd like to thank

1923
02:23:35,170 --> 02:23:42,701
Deputy Chief Fusco for his many years of commitment to our community, to the fire service, and wish him well in his retirement.

1924
02:23:42,901 --> 02:23:43,241
Thank you.

1925
02:23:43,382 --> 02:23:43,742
Thank you.

1926
02:23:44,924 --> 02:23:50,532
And personally, I see him almost every day now.

1927
02:23:51,383 --> 02:23:55,546
even though I wasn't seeing him before, but he had a little different job.

1928
02:23:55,966 --> 02:23:56,967
He was a safety officer.

1929
02:23:57,047 --> 02:24:04,053
He went around, he did inspections, and always made sure that the best interests of the city always came first.

1930
02:24:04,073 --> 02:24:07,635
So, Brian, I'm glad I see you every day.

1931
02:24:07,655 --> 02:24:09,256
Now you're a much more relaxed guy.

1932
02:24:09,577 --> 02:24:10,577
Good luck in your retirements.

1933
02:24:13,099 --> 02:24:16,102
All right, all in the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by?

1934
02:24:16,957 --> 02:24:17,357

1935

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

1993

Thank you.

1994
02:24:32,949 --> 02:24:33,130
Thank you.

1995
02:24:33,150 --> 02:24:33,330
Thank you.

1996
02:24:33,350 --> 02:24:33,630
Thank you.

1997
02:24:33,650 --> 02:24:34,451
Thank you.

1998
02:24:34,471 --> 02:24:34,891
Thank you.

1999
02:24:34,911 --> 02:24:35,091
Thank you.

2000
02:24:35,111 --> 02:24:35,291
Thank you.

2001
02:24:35,311 --> 02:24:35,531
Thank you.

2002
02:24:35,551 --> 02:24:35,732
Thank you.

2003
02:24:35,752 --> 02:24:36,592
Thank you.

2004
02:24:36,612 --> 02:24:36,792
Thank you.

2005
02:24:36,812 --> 02:24:37,053
Thank you.

2006
02:24:37,073 --> 02:24:37,293
Thank you.

2007
02:24:37,313 --> 02:24:37,493
Thank you.

2008
02:24:38,122 --> 02:24:42,645
21500 offered by Vice President Knight is asked to be tabled.

2009
02:24:43,545 --> 02:24:46,226
21501 by Vice President Knight is asked to be tabled.

2010
02:24:46,467 --> 02:24:50,649
21502 offered by Vice President Knight is asked to be tabled.

2011
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:54,171
I didn't get that part yet, hold on.

2012
02:24:54,951 --> 02:24:56,692
Did I miss one?

2013
02:24:56,712 --> 02:24:57,752
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

2014
02:24:58,873 --> 02:24:59,393
21497 also be tabled.

2015
02:25:09,188 --> 02:25:13,050
Yeah, those are all the tables.

2016
02:25:14,731 --> 02:25:21,234
So on the motion, Councilor Fevella, you make the motion to table all those for Councilor Knight because he's not here?

2017
02:25:21,454 --> 02:25:27,457
Yes, I'd like to make the motion to table those resolutions offered by Councilor Knight until he returns.

2018
02:25:27,657 --> 02:25:28,498
Thank you, seconded by?

2019
02:25:28,518 --> 02:25:29,198
Seconded.

2020
02:25:30,139 --> 02:25:31,880
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

2021
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:32,200
Aye.

2022
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,961
All those opposed, motion passes.

2023
02:25:34,981 --> 02:25:36,122
21503, offered by Councilor Morrell.

2024
02:25:37,112 --> 02:25:52,042
It's all resolved that the city council requests that the administration provide an update on the implementation of the city's bicycle infrastructure master plan or any other comprehensive plans for bicycle infrastructure.

2025
02:25:52,082 --> 02:25:52,603
Councilor Morrell.

2026
02:25:53,066 --> 02:25:53,946
Thank you, Mr. President.

2027
02:25:54,246 --> 02:26:00,728
Yeah, I have this on here because I've had a number of bike commuters reach out lately just about certain improvements to streets.

2028
02:26:01,248 --> 02:26:14,011
A lot of those streets are referenced in the infrastructure master plan that was put together by the Bicycle Advisory Commission, which I know was meant to be used as a guide suggestions for DPW and a city engineer.

2029
02:26:14,111 --> 02:26:21,013
And it is my understanding that these improvements are generally implemented only when a street is repaved.

2030
02:26:21,133 --> 02:26:21,833
And as we know from

2031
02:26:22,353 --> 02:26:30,136
this very council, a very small number of streets are repaved each year, and a number of them just aren't even in this plan.

2032
02:26:30,196 --> 02:26:46,203
So, you know, noting that we've got the Great Clippership Connector, which is connecting a number of greenways and a number of bike paths that they, bikes are mentioned in the draft of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

2033
02:26:47,064 --> 02:26:53,450
And also just noting that ideally there will be hopefully substantial infrastructure money coming down from the federal level.

2034
02:26:53,890 --> 02:27:06,963
I would just love an update from the administration on priorities around these improvements for bikes around the city if it's something that it's just going to keep being done kind of as we slowly repave streets.

2035
02:27:07,483 --> 02:27:13,689
or if there is something in the works that if we do get infrastructure money, it'll be something we'll be moving quickly on.

2036
02:27:13,789 --> 02:27:21,276
So I would just love an update so that it's something I can, you know, that can be shared with the cyclists and would-be cyclists in Medford.

2037
02:27:21,677 --> 02:27:21,997
Thank you.

2038
02:27:22,337 --> 02:27:23,118
Any further discussion?

2039
02:27:24,099 --> 02:27:24,439
Second.

2040
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:26,381
Mr. Castaign, did you want to speak?

2041
02:27:30,785 --> 02:27:31,306
Good evening, sir.

2042
02:27:31,326 --> 02:27:32,307
Name and address of the record, please.

2043
02:27:33,394 --> 02:27:37,336
Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

2044
02:27:38,176 --> 02:27:45,660
I sincerely want to thank City Councilor Morrell for bringing this up, especially the Clippership Connector part.

2045
02:27:47,281 --> 02:27:51,182
It's very personal to me being injured in that location.

2046
02:27:55,785 --> 02:28:02,748
I scribbled a few notes, I hope it makes sense, but this missing incomplete

2047
02:28:03,132 --> 02:28:04,372
bike community path.

2048
02:28:06,313 --> 02:28:15,616
And we in Medford have the best location in all of New England, in my opinion, five miles north of Boston with Route 93 here.

2049
02:28:16,776 --> 02:28:25,778
But you know, they can't seem to finish off the missing link, the half mile right behind 99 Riverside Ave.

2050
02:28:25,859 --> 02:28:28,939
I was supposed to wave to Mr. Sano, who lives there.

2051
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:30,680
Anyways,

2052
02:28:32,045 --> 02:28:48,301
It's sad because you could go from West Method and beyond, actually, you come right through here, if you didn't have the half mile blockage to the Duggar Andrews, you could go clear to the MBTA stations without dealing with Route 16 or Route 28.

2053
02:28:49,141 --> 02:28:51,704
That's huge as a safety concern.

2054
02:28:54,090 --> 02:28:56,211
So it's long overdue.

2055
02:28:56,852 --> 02:29:10,659
Personally, in my opinion, it should have been done 20 years ago about when they built the two new schools, so-called two new schools, with bike paths and footpaths that go underneath Route 16.

2056
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:15,162
Also, they should do this job right.

2057
02:29:17,663 --> 02:29:21,185
Finish this half-mile missing link in the center of Memphis Square

2058
02:29:23,396 --> 02:29:25,137
with the Riparian Right Law.

2059
02:29:25,978 --> 02:29:28,620
It's a 1600 Massachusetts law.

2060
02:29:30,302 --> 02:29:42,872
And that means we the people have the right of pathway, egress, I believe it's 15 feet alongside waterways.

2061
02:29:43,553 --> 02:29:47,256
In this case, the Mystic River and Blessing of the Bay.

2062
02:29:48,777 --> 02:29:51,319
Please, build this missing link

2063
02:29:53,140 --> 02:30:02,022
The part that's missing is right next to the Doug Randrew School, that piece of land there.

2064
02:30:02,622 --> 02:30:06,523
And then the next piece would be the Riverside Yacht Club.

2065
02:30:08,524 --> 02:30:17,986
And then heading towards the square would be two condo buildings, 54 to 68, Ship Ave, I believe.

2066
02:30:18,746 --> 02:30:21,647
And by the way, they have two fences on each end of the property.

2067
02:30:22,688 --> 02:30:35,150
that go from the sidewalk all the way to the river, which, in my opinion, under riparian rights, is illegally built on the people's egress land.

2068
02:30:36,771 --> 02:30:46,432
And then there's another building going towards 93 that will be the last building, the 76th shipyard, large condo complex of approximately 20 units.

2069
02:30:46,992 --> 02:30:50,373
They have plenty of land and they didn't build any fences

2070
02:30:51,996 --> 02:30:53,317
on top of the people's land.

2071
02:30:54,218 --> 02:31:05,566
And it continues around where I actually broke my hand with a bike injury when my bike found one of two potholes, four feet wide, one to two feet deep.

2072
02:31:06,046 --> 02:31:06,747
They're still there.

2073
02:31:07,287 --> 02:31:08,728
They put cones there.

2074
02:31:09,288 --> 02:31:12,190
I found one on the river today, took my bike ride again.

2075
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:15,833
I put one cone inside the hole.

2076
02:31:17,194 --> 02:31:21,097
The DCR, they should at least fill in the potholes, which is grass.

2077
02:31:23,664 --> 02:31:30,186
And the storm outfall number is OF04100.

2078
02:31:31,486 --> 02:31:48,891
And then it continues, the missing link I should say, does not continue, underneath 93 to behind the senior citizen center, which is the building in the back where Mr. Sano lives at 99 Riverside Avenue, the high affordable rent building.

2079
02:31:50,311 --> 02:31:53,012
It's a lousy half a mile, we're talking like

2080
02:31:54,093 --> 02:31:57,876
10, 15 miles beyond Arlington, Lexington possibly.

2081
02:31:59,016 --> 02:31:59,577
Are you kidding?

2082
02:31:59,997 --> 02:32:00,978
This is ridiculous.

2083
02:32:02,319 --> 02:32:16,488
Excuse my lack of 10 cent words here, but I understand the wheels of government work slowly, but 20 years and still waiting is ridiculous.

2084
02:32:18,470 --> 02:32:19,090
Come on, man.

2085
02:32:21,809 --> 02:32:40,736
Let's get the missing half-mile path done now and complete the 10-mile plus route to the MBTA assembly row and station landing, and safely keep with the people off the streets, especially Route 16 and Route 28.

2086
02:32:41,556 --> 02:32:43,317
This is a no-brainer.

2087
02:32:44,177 --> 02:32:45,558
Please, city, wake up.

2088
02:32:46,551 --> 02:32:55,234
We recently received some funds from the federal government for the station landing area to do a bridge and some more of the walkway.

2089
02:32:55,334 --> 02:32:58,536
I think Councilor Falcone and myself are there for the dedication.

2090
02:32:59,296 --> 02:33:00,316
Last week's transcript?

2091
02:33:01,877 --> 02:33:03,197
No, is that?

2092
02:33:03,938 --> 02:33:10,300
It's going underneath Route 28, like some of them already did it at my path to Sunday Road.

2093
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:11,761
They already have that.

2094
02:33:12,201 --> 02:33:13,201
This is great.

2095
02:33:13,341 --> 02:33:14,862
Barbara is the rep?

2096
02:33:15,863 --> 02:33:16,043
Yes.

2097
02:33:16,463 --> 02:33:16,723
Right.

2098
02:33:17,464 --> 02:33:20,826
But you know, I'm talking about the center of method over 20 effing years.

2099
02:33:21,566 --> 02:33:22,446
Come on, people.

2100
02:33:23,527 --> 02:33:24,687
I don't want to speak French no more.

2101
02:33:24,707 --> 02:33:25,608
That's a DCR project.

2102
02:33:25,648 --> 02:33:26,729
They know they're working on it.

2103
02:33:26,749 --> 02:33:27,709
Is the clippership approved?

2104
02:33:29,370 --> 02:33:29,890
Yeah.

2105
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:31,271
Yeah, the clippership, it's approved.

2106
02:33:31,331 --> 02:33:31,531
Right.

2107
02:33:31,851 --> 02:33:34,613
And are they actually going to build it on our property?

2108
02:33:34,633 --> 02:33:39,655
As far as the egress next to the river behind those condo complexes?

2109
02:33:39,675 --> 02:33:41,716
Because they were complaining.

2110
02:33:42,817 --> 02:33:42,957
Yes.

2111
02:33:42,997 --> 02:33:43,217
Yeah.

2112
02:33:43,537 --> 02:33:45,258
Or they have to build a little bit onto the water.

2113
02:33:46,207 --> 02:33:48,888
in order to give them a break, which they don't need.

2114
02:33:48,928 --> 02:33:51,368
They already built the fence on our land.

2115
02:33:52,469 --> 02:33:54,249
I'm speaking straight English here.

2116
02:33:55,089 --> 02:33:55,629
That's wrong.

2117
02:33:57,930 --> 02:34:04,732
I'm sorry, my heart bleeds, my head broke, I was bleeding, broke my hand, I have receipts and bills like this.

2118
02:34:05,212 --> 02:34:07,533
I did not sue DCR or the city.

2119
02:34:08,313 --> 02:34:12,014
All I'm asking for is common sense 20 years later.

2120
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,361
Thank you for listening.

2121
02:34:15,381 --> 02:34:15,721
Thank you.

2122
02:34:15,781 --> 02:34:16,121
Thank you.

2123
02:34:16,141 --> 02:34:17,402
Thank you, Mr. Morrell.

2124
02:34:18,523 --> 02:34:21,966
On the motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by?

2125
02:34:22,867 --> 02:34:23,187
Second.

2126
02:34:23,327 --> 02:34:24,428
Seconded by Councilor Baez.

2127
02:34:24,468 --> 02:34:25,268
All those in favor?

2128
02:34:25,629 --> 02:34:25,869
Aye.

2129
02:34:26,189 --> 02:34:26,830
All those opposed?

2130
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:27,970
Motion passes.

2131
02:34:27,991 --> 02:34:36,197
21-504 offered by Councilor Morrell being so resolved that the City Council receive an update from the administration.

2132
02:34:37,394 --> 02:34:47,079
on transportation network company TNC fees anticipated to be allocated to Medford and any plans for said fees.

2133
02:34:47,119 --> 02:34:47,679
Councilor Morrell.

2134
02:34:48,152 --> 02:34:48,952
Thank you, Mr. President.

2135
02:34:48,972 --> 02:35:00,335
Yeah, since the implementation of these fees for essentially ride share, these have been used for a number of projects, but because of the pandemic, I know these companies took a hit, they weren't going out as often.

2136
02:35:00,375 --> 02:35:07,916
So I'm just curious if there's any update that the administration can provide on what those numbers actually look like this year based on the lower rates of use.

2137
02:35:07,976 --> 02:35:14,778
I know it was some topic of debate with the transportation bill, but just, it still stands the fact that these,

2138
02:35:15,425 --> 02:35:18,307
these companies went out so much less during the pandemic.

2139
02:35:18,347 --> 02:35:25,391
So I'm curious what we can look at, what we're anticipating with that, and if there are any specific projects that this money is earmarked for.

2140
02:35:25,431 --> 02:35:26,411
So just seeking an update.

2141
02:35:27,972 --> 02:35:28,273
Second.

2142
02:35:28,833 --> 02:35:29,093
Thank you.

2143
02:35:29,353 --> 02:35:32,615
Now on the motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2144
02:35:32,675 --> 02:35:33,256
All those in favor?

2145
02:35:33,276 --> 02:35:33,756
Aye.

2146
02:35:33,876 --> 02:35:34,496
All those opposed?

2147
02:35:34,596 --> 02:35:35,357
Motion passes.

2148
02:35:35,377 --> 02:35:38,499
21-505 offered by Councilor Falco.

2149
02:35:39,287 --> 02:35:49,032
be a result that the administration provide the Memphis City Council with an update in regards to the private investigator that was hired by the administration on or before June 23rd, 2021.

2150
02:35:49,072 --> 02:35:51,113
Councilor Falco.

2151
02:35:51,193 --> 02:35:52,513
Thank you, Mr. President.

2152
02:35:52,653 --> 02:36:04,159
This is a simple request to receive an update as to where the investigation stands and when it will be complete with regard to the allegations that were brought by the former CFO.

2153
02:36:04,759 --> 02:36:05,259
Move approval.

2154
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:08,581
So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by

2155
02:36:09,304 --> 02:36:10,765
Seconded by Councilor Scott Pele.

2156
02:36:10,785 --> 02:36:11,505
All those in favor?

2157
02:36:12,225 --> 02:36:12,325
Aye.

2158
02:36:12,985 --> 02:36:13,666
All those opposed?

2159
02:36:14,666 --> 02:36:15,566
Motion passes.

2160
02:36:17,447 --> 02:36:19,187
Mr. President, if I could withdraw the next resolution.

2161
02:36:19,928 --> 02:36:21,668
Okay, yeah, we got something in that.

2162
02:36:21,688 --> 02:36:26,310
2-1-5-0-7, an offer by Councilor Bez.

2163
02:36:26,330 --> 02:36:30,151
Oh, here we go.

2164
02:36:30,211 --> 02:36:32,572
Councilor Moxley, I've got a couple of things on there if you want to take care of them.

2165
02:36:44,394 --> 02:36:53,321
21498.

2166
02:36:45,935 --> 02:36:53,321
Paper 21498 offered by President Caviello be it so resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences.

2167
02:37:08,718 --> 02:37:11,599
Paper 21-493 offered by President Caviello.

2168
02:37:12,119 --> 02:37:20,442
Be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council request that DCR make openings in the guardrail at Duggar Park for easier access into the park.

2169
02:37:20,982 --> 02:37:22,042
Council President Caviello.

2170
02:37:22,282 --> 02:37:22,962
Thank you, Mr. President.

2171
02:37:24,703 --> 02:37:32,706
I've been approached by some members of the park commission in regards to the guardrail over by Duggar Park.

2172
02:37:32,886 --> 02:37:35,827
There's only like one opening or two and the other one is five down.

2173
02:37:38,478 --> 02:37:40,779
For some people, it's hard getting over the guardrail.

2174
02:37:41,119 --> 02:37:53,623
So we're asking that DCR make a couple of more openings, especially over by the basketball court and a little further down so they can be more openings so people can just a little easier egress into the park.

2175
02:37:54,463 --> 02:38:01,245
So again, if we could send that to our state delegation and to DCR to open that up.

2176
02:38:01,873 --> 02:38:02,493
I can amend that.

2177
02:38:03,174 --> 02:38:04,975
Councilor Scott Pelli.

2178
02:38:05,015 --> 02:38:06,997
Thank you for Councilor Carvelo bringing that forward.

2179
02:38:07,337 --> 02:38:19,966
I know that, you know, with the updates now with the tennis courts and as you see what goes on at Duggar Park and how much of a vital pocket is the community there.

2180
02:38:21,607 --> 02:38:22,567
I often thought why

2181
02:38:23,608 --> 02:38:25,729
those guardrails are even there.

2182
02:38:25,789 --> 02:38:29,291
I think that there's gotta be something more pleasing to the eye.

2183
02:38:29,351 --> 02:38:34,653
I know that there is the post and reel type of guardrail.

2184
02:38:35,113 --> 02:38:53,281
So it'd be interesting to see if we could ask the South State delegations to look at maybe converting that old rod iron, which is pretty dangerous on the other side, very dangerous on the other side, that we can look at more traditional, you know,

2185
02:38:54,747 --> 02:38:56,308
fencing that's used.

2186
02:38:56,769 --> 02:38:57,690
If there's any even needed.

2187
02:38:59,091 --> 02:39:02,815
I know that there's a need because I think there's no sidewalk, I believe.

2188
02:39:03,455 --> 02:39:04,877
But I think we need something there.

2189
02:39:05,017 --> 02:39:08,560
But I think that there are so many aesthetically pleasing, you know,

2190
02:39:11,701 --> 02:39:12,781
solutions we can use.

2191
02:39:12,821 --> 02:39:18,583
I know that they have just the, it has the wood look that has the post and rail look.

2192
02:39:18,643 --> 02:39:25,064
I think it looks so much classier, more inviting and allows the openings along as you walk.

2193
02:39:25,124 --> 02:39:27,085
So, and provides the safety that's needed.

2194
02:39:27,145 --> 02:39:36,967
But I know a few times with kids that are playing basketball and, you know, I know it's further away, but someone's taking a run at that and they run into that guardrail.

2195
02:39:37,347 --> 02:39:39,148
I'm shocked we haven't, at least we haven't heard.

2196
02:39:40,228 --> 02:39:41,409
any more serious incidents.

2197
02:39:41,429 --> 02:39:50,637
So if you allow me to amend that to ask the state delegates to look at replacing that altogether.

2198
02:39:52,135 --> 02:39:56,416
All in the motion by President Caviello, further amended by Councilor Scott Pelli.

2199
02:39:56,436 --> 02:39:57,216
All those in favor?

2200
02:39:57,717 --> 02:39:57,837
Aye.

2201
02:39:58,117 --> 02:39:58,557
Opposed?

2202
02:39:59,017 --> 02:39:59,637
The ayes have it.

2203
02:39:59,737 --> 02:40:01,478
The motion is adopted.

2204
02:40:02,038 --> 02:40:04,979
Paper 21-498, authored by President Caviello.

2205
02:40:05,539 --> 02:40:13,241
Be it so resolved that the Meffitt City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Mary D. DeFranzo Coletta.

2206
02:40:13,781 --> 02:40:20,163
On her recent passing, Mary serviced the city of Meffitt as treasure collector until 1991.

2207
02:40:21,423 --> 02:40:22,224
President Caviel.

2208
02:40:23,365 --> 02:40:24,046
Thank you, Mr. President.

2209
02:40:24,106 --> 02:40:26,349
I just wanted to send the condolences to the family of Mary.

2210
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:39,163
She was our treasurer for many years and though I didn't know her personally, some friends and family asked me to put that on and I'd just like to send the condolences to her family for her work to the city of Medford.

2211
02:40:40,723 --> 02:40:42,525
On the motion by President Caviello.

2212
02:40:42,805 --> 02:40:43,526
All those in favor?

2213
02:40:44,187 --> 02:40:45,809
Second by Councilor Scott Kelly.

2214
02:40:45,829 --> 02:40:46,489

Aye.

2216
02:40:47,711 --> 02:40:48,111
Opposed?

2217
02:40:48,311 --> 02:40:48,872
The ayes have it.

2218
02:40:49,152 --> 02:40:50,393
The motion is adopted.

2219
02:40:51,074 --> 02:40:53,997
Paper 21-499 offered by President Caviello.

2220
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:56,760
I'm sorry.

2221
02:40:56,780 --> 02:40:57,741
I'm sorry.

2222
02:40:58,682 --> 02:41:00,084
Please rise for a moment of silence.

2223
02:41:11,401 --> 02:41:11,732
Thank you.

2224
02:41:15,532 --> 02:41:18,453
Paper 21-499 offered by President Caviello.

2225
02:41:19,034 --> 02:41:30,879
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council demand that the DCI cut the weeds on Route 16 at the Main Street Bridge and all surrounding areas of the bridge that have not been cut in two years.

2226
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:36,742
Please send this correspondence to Senator Jalen and Representative Babba for immediate assistance.

2227
02:41:37,042 --> 02:41:38,003
Council President Caviello.

2228
02:41:38,023 --> 02:41:38,943
Thank you, Mr. President.

2229
02:41:38,963 --> 02:41:44,466
Mr. President, this is something I put on last year, and I asked, and now I'm kind of demanding, I mean, the weeds are,

2230
02:41:45,608 --> 02:41:57,598
six feet tall, especially on the bridge area, and that whole area all along the Craddock Bridge, the Main Street Bridge and over there, I'd say severely overgrown, the weeds are growing everywhere onto the road.

2231
02:41:58,458 --> 02:42:01,300
I say they haven't been cleaned in two years.

2232
02:42:02,221 --> 02:42:04,623
Please, if we can, if they can please get those done.

2233
02:42:05,484 --> 02:42:08,326
It's an eyesore for our community.

2234
02:42:09,427 --> 02:42:09,507
So

2235
02:42:10,007 --> 02:42:17,537
I request that we contact our two separate representatives, represent that area and get the DC out on it just to clean that up.

2236
02:42:17,877 --> 02:42:18,318
It's a mess.

2237
02:42:18,919 --> 02:42:20,000
Thank you, Mr. President.

2238
02:42:20,861 --> 02:42:21,622
Councilor Falco.

2239
02:42:21,762 --> 02:42:22,543
Thank you, Mr. President.

2240
02:42:24,382 --> 02:42:25,903
Councilor Caviello for bringing this forward.

2241
02:42:25,943 --> 02:42:35,048
I was down in that area the past couple of weeks at the farmer's market and also at one of the MFN concerts, and it is really overgrown.

2242
02:42:35,068 --> 02:42:36,449
It needs to be addressed.

2243
02:42:36,649 --> 02:42:43,513
I saw a parent walking their child on the sidewalk and the weeds were taller than the kid.

2244
02:42:43,833 --> 02:42:45,294
And that's just unacceptable.

2245
02:42:46,114 --> 02:42:52,638
And the DCR needs to do a better job of actually maintaining their property within our city.

2246
02:42:54,892 --> 02:43:05,997
If you go to any of their properties within the city, it's just overgrown, and it has been mowed in ages, and we always have to ask for it to be mowed.

2247
02:43:06,037 --> 02:43:07,077
It's never mowed on its own.

2248
02:43:07,858 --> 02:43:24,645
So if I could amend the resolution to get some sort of a maintenance schedule from DCR as to how often they come to our city to maintain their properties, because to me, it always seems like they're not maintaining them unless we're asking, and they should be able to manage that on their own,

2249
02:43:25,742 --> 02:43:33,331
without us getting involved but I want to see some sort of maintenance schedule so if the counselor would allow I'd like to amend the resolution.

2250
02:43:33,631 --> 02:43:42,222
Thank you, Mr President, if I could ask one more time, you know, with the advent of you know we have the, the, the people down there with the paddle Boston.

2251
02:43:43,643 --> 02:43:44,504
I asked every year.

2252
02:43:45,388 --> 02:43:51,933
please get the trees out of the water down there, especially with the Craddock Bridge, where those people rent the canoes and the kayaks.

2253
02:43:52,794 --> 02:43:57,097
In that whole area, there's trees that are falling in the water and sticking up.

2254
02:43:58,018 --> 02:43:59,299
Someone's gonna get hurt there at one time.

2255
02:43:59,319 --> 02:44:11,489
And again, I've asked probably three to four different times over the years, send someone down there and get the trees out of the water so nobody gets hurt in that water down there, in that Craddock area where Paddle Boston is.

2256
02:44:14,815 --> 02:44:17,176
If I could amend that motion also.

2257
02:44:17,797 --> 02:44:24,860
On the motion of President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli, further amended by Councilor Falco, and further amended by President Caviello.

2258
02:44:25,201 --> 02:44:25,841
All in favor?

2259
02:44:26,061 --> 02:44:26,401
Aye.

2260
02:44:26,581 --> 02:44:27,001
Opposed?

2261
02:44:27,182 --> 02:44:27,802
The ayes have it.

2262
02:44:28,362 --> 02:44:29,643
The amendment is adopted.

2263
02:44:30,843 --> 02:44:34,325
Motion to take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

2264
02:44:36,546 --> 02:44:37,627
Do we have something else?

2265
02:44:37,707 --> 02:44:40,368
Councilor Bear says he was out when it got to him.

2266
02:44:40,628 --> 02:44:41,329
My apologies.

2267
02:44:44,858 --> 02:44:44,998
Yep.

2268
02:44:45,078 --> 02:44:46,538
My apologies.

2269
02:44:46,618 --> 02:44:49,479
Paper 21-507 offered by Councilor Beers.

2270
02:44:49,899 --> 02:45:01,963
Be resolved by the Memphis City Council that the utility pole blocking the middle of the sidewalk on Boston Ave across from the new Greenline Extension Station be moved to ensure full ADA access.

2271
02:45:02,823 --> 02:45:03,403
Councilor Beers.

2272
02:45:03,985 --> 02:45:04,925
Thank you, Mr. President.

2273
02:45:05,886 --> 02:45:12,469
We have in this specific area, it's kind of right in between the garage where Tufts Police is and the heating and cooling building.

2274
02:45:13,029 --> 02:45:16,791
There are three poles in the sidewalk right next to each other.

2275
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:19,252
One of them is holding a streetlight.

2276
02:45:19,652 --> 02:45:23,514
The other two seem to be holding phone lines, electric lines, that kind of thing.

2277
02:45:23,914 --> 02:45:28,096
The one holding the streetlight is dead center of the sidewalk, and you have to basically go

2278
02:45:29,401 --> 02:45:30,542
in, out, up and around.

2279
02:45:30,642 --> 02:45:33,203
And I don't even know if you could fit a wheelchair through there.

2280
02:45:33,683 --> 02:45:35,283
So that pole really needs to be removed.

2281
02:45:35,984 --> 02:45:41,106
All of those services could be consolidated onto one pole that would not obstruct the access.

2282
02:45:41,646 --> 02:45:48,729
And especially with the Greenline extension coming in, you know, that's gonna be a very highly trafficked area.

2283
02:45:48,969 --> 02:45:53,030
So I would hope that with the construction and everything going on, that this is something that could be addressed quickly.

2284
02:45:53,311 --> 02:45:53,591
Thank you.

2285
02:45:55,789 --> 02:45:58,732
On the motion by Councilor Abuez, seconded by Councilor Felco.

2286
02:45:59,472 --> 02:46:00,133
All in favor?

2287
02:46:00,533 --> 02:46:00,733
Aye.

2288
02:46:01,013 --> 02:46:01,414
Opposed?

2289
02:46:01,674 --> 02:46:02,275
The ayes have it.

2290
02:46:02,815 --> 02:46:04,156
The motion is adopted.

2291
02:46:05,577 --> 02:46:07,459
We have papers in the hands of the clerk.

2292
02:46:15,105 --> 02:46:17,327
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk, Councilor Felco.

2293
02:46:17,647 --> 02:46:19,269
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

2294
02:46:19,309 --> 02:46:19,809
All in favor?

2295
02:46:19,889 --> 02:46:22,391
Seconded by Councilor, President Felk.

2296
02:46:22,531 --> 02:46:22,972
Caviello.

2297
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:25,150
All in favor?

2298
02:46:25,431 --> 02:46:26,191
Ayes have it.

2299
02:46:27,132 --> 02:46:28,693
Mr. Clerk, papers in the hands of the clerk.

2300
02:46:31,455 --> 02:46:34,677
Those are seconded, Councilor Scapelli is a second in those.

2301
02:46:36,018 --> 02:46:38,040
As a co-sponsor in those.

2302
02:46:38,420 --> 02:46:41,923
So this is Vice President Knight and Councilor Scapelli under suspension.

2303
02:46:41,943 --> 02:46:44,184
Vice President Knight, Councilor Scapelli under suspension.

2304
02:46:44,865 --> 02:46:46,766
President Kerrio under suspension.

2305
02:46:48,207 --> 02:46:48,888
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

2306
02:46:50,233 --> 02:47:15,125
Paper 21-510 offered by under suspension by Vice President Knight and Councilor Scott Kelly, be it so resolved that the Meffitt City Council recognize Michael McDevitt for his ongoing and unparalleled support to the veterans in the city of Meffitt and be it further resolved that the Meffitt City Council extend its gratitude and congratulations to Michael McDevitt for being named post 45 member of the year.

2307
02:47:17,212 --> 02:47:32,120
Thank you, Mr President, I know Council and I wanted to be a talk on his good friend Mike McDevitt, I think that Mike is a fixture, and his family's method method icons I think that Mike deserves.

2308
02:47:32,680 --> 02:47:36,622
Congratulations, and a pat on the back because he uses.

2309
02:47:39,103 --> 02:47:45,287
the post for so many outreach events for community events to bring our community together.

2310
02:47:45,327 --> 02:47:47,248
And he's a catalyst behind that.

2311
02:47:47,348 --> 02:47:51,210
So I just want to thank him and congratulate him.

2312
02:47:51,891 --> 02:47:54,912
And I hope that my colleagues join me with that.

2313
02:47:56,633 --> 02:47:57,754
Thank you, Councilor Scott Felly.

2314
02:47:57,774 --> 02:47:58,435
Councilor Falcone.

2315
02:47:58,475 --> 02:47:59,755
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2316
02:47:59,795 --> 02:48:03,117
I'd also like to thank, well, congratulate Michael McDevitt-Falcone.

2317
02:48:03,197 --> 02:48:06,079
It's hard work with the veterans and congratulate him.

2318
02:48:08,233 --> 02:48:17,420
Congratulate him for being named with the honor that Councilor Scott mentioned earlier, and I wanted to thank him for all his hard work with regard to the veterans in our community.

2319
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:17,841
Thank you.

2320
02:48:18,741 --> 02:48:19,502
Thank you, Councilor.

2321
02:48:19,962 --> 02:48:21,123
Council President Caviello.

2322
02:48:21,324 --> 02:48:22,184
Thank you, Mr. President.

2323
02:48:22,244 --> 02:48:26,428
Again, I want to thank Michael for all his work with the veterans, being the veteran subcommittee chairman.

2324
02:48:27,749 --> 02:48:32,973
I see the work that he does out there, and again, it's a good honor for him, and congratulations to him.

2325
02:48:34,065 --> 02:48:35,566
And if I could from the chair, anyone else?

2326
02:48:36,047 --> 02:48:42,133
If I could from the chair, I want to thank Vice President Knight and Councilor Scott Pelley for putting this on.

2327
02:48:42,253 --> 02:48:49,720
Mike Devitt has been absolutely stalwart when it comes to veteran affairs in our community for many, many years.

2328
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:51,702
And his name is synonymous with

2329
02:48:52,131 --> 02:48:56,753
assisting veterans and keeping the memory of veterans alive in this community.

2330
02:48:56,773 --> 02:48:57,973
So I want to personally thank him.

2331
02:48:58,534 --> 02:49:02,615
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2332
02:49:03,215 --> 02:49:04,016
All those in favor?

2333
02:49:04,436 --> 02:49:04,536
Aye.

2334
02:49:04,696 --> 02:49:05,096
Opposed?

2335
02:49:05,236 --> 02:49:05,836
The ayes have it.

2336
02:49:06,157 --> 02:49:07,157
The motion is adopted.

2337
02:49:07,677 --> 02:49:12,979
Paper 21-511 offered under suspension by Vice President Knight and Councilor Scott Pelly.

2338
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:19,402
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council make the following announcement in support of Medford's veterans.

2339
02:49:20,062 --> 02:49:24,585
There will be a veterans rally on Thursday, September 2nd between 10 a.m.

2340
02:49:24,966 --> 02:49:25,986
and 12 p.m.

2341
02:49:26,467 --> 02:49:31,170
at Medford City Hall to raise awareness concerning veterans rights and benefits.

2342
02:49:31,750 --> 02:49:35,113
All are welcome to attend in support of our local heroes.

2343
02:49:35,693 --> 02:49:36,614
Councilor Scott Pelley.

2344
02:49:37,397 --> 02:49:54,491
Again, I think that once the word came out such an event, I think anytime that we have an opportunity to celebrate and stand hand in hand with our veterans, I think we as a community have to stand up and do so.

2345
02:49:54,591 --> 02:50:02,678
So I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this initiative forward and giving me the opportunity to spread the word and making sure that we all

2346
02:50:03,593 --> 02:50:20,207
find our way to supporting our veterans that day and letting them know that the city of Medford truly, truly appreciates everything they've done for us and where we've come, where we are today and where we go tomorrow.

2347
02:50:20,988 --> 02:50:27,293
I think our veterans are a key part and a cornerstone of that vision.

2348
02:50:27,353 --> 02:50:29,455
So thank you, Mr. President.

2349
02:50:31,296 --> 02:50:34,537
All in the motion by Councilor Scott Peli, seconded by President Caviello.

2350
02:50:34,577 --> 02:50:35,337
All those in favor?

2351
02:50:35,617 --> 02:50:35,757
Aye.

2352
02:50:36,017 --> 02:50:36,437
Opposed?

2353
02:50:36,977 --> 02:50:37,577
The ayes have it.

2354
02:50:37,838 --> 02:50:38,958
The motion is adopted.

2355
02:50:39,418 --> 02:50:43,699
Paper 21-512 offered under suspension by Vice President Caviello.

2356
02:50:44,379 --> 02:50:53,261
Be it so resolved that the Meffitt City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Frances Gianetti on her recent passing.

2357
02:50:53,661 --> 02:51:00,383
Frances served the city of Meffitt for 20 years as an employee of the city of Meffitt under Mayor Parika and Mayor McGlynn.

2358
02:51:00,843 --> 02:51:02,024
in various positions.

2359
02:51:02,344 --> 02:51:03,525
Council President Caviello.

2360
02:51:03,645 --> 02:51:04,625
Thank you, Mr. President.

2361
02:51:05,166 --> 02:51:11,489
Just want to know, I knew Fran, and Fran, she was a fixture of this building for many years.

2362
02:51:11,529 --> 02:51:13,310
She worked with two different mayors.

2363
02:51:14,751 --> 02:51:20,335
She held many positions there, and she was a well-loved member of this building and the community.

2364
02:51:20,355 --> 02:51:22,776
So just send my condolences to the family.

2365
02:51:23,857 --> 02:51:24,517
She will be missed.

2366
02:51:25,498 --> 02:51:25,778
Thank you.

2367
02:51:26,769 --> 02:51:30,892
And if I could from the chair, Mr. President, I wanna thank you for offering this.

2368
02:51:31,453 --> 02:51:38,839
When I first got elected to the council, Fran was one of the first people I met in city government.

2369
02:51:39,479 --> 02:51:42,762
And she always had a welcoming word, a smile on her face.

2370
02:51:43,242 --> 02:51:51,309
No matter how many times I may have butt heads with the mayor that she was working for, she was always extremely friendly and kind.

2371
02:51:51,830 --> 02:51:55,253
And I always appreciated that about Fran, and she will be sorely missed.

2372
02:51:55,694 --> 02:52:02,360
On the motion by Council President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

2373
02:52:02,980 --> 02:52:03,741
All those in favor?

2374
02:52:03,901 --> 02:52:04,402
Aye.

2375
02:52:04,682 --> 02:52:06,183
Opposed?

2376
02:52:06,203 --> 02:52:07,605
Please rise for a moment of silence.

2377
02:52:33,252 --> 02:52:35,734
The motion by Councillor Bailão to take papers 21, 4, 5, 0 off the table.

2378
02:52:35,754 --> 02:52:36,294
Seconded by.

2379
02:52:36,334 --> 02:52:36,694
Seconded.

2380
02:52:36,835 --> 02:52:36,995
Okay.

2381
02:52:37,015 --> 02:52:36,995
21, 4, 5, 0.

2382
02:53:00,072 --> 02:53:01,793
It's taking its third reading this evening.

2383
02:53:02,934 --> 02:53:10,840
Personal ordinance amendments A, B, and D. They were advertised on January, July 13th, August 5th, and August 17th.

2384
02:53:10,901 --> 02:53:13,863

Yes.

2395
02:53:44,846 --> 02:53:45,906
Vice president is absent.

2396
02:53:46,507 --> 02:53:47,067
Councilor Marks.

2397
02:53:48,207 --> 02:53:48,507
Yes.

2398
02:53:49,248 --> 02:53:49,808
Councilor Morrell.

2399
02:53:50,008 --> 02:53:50,228
Yes.

2400
02:53:50,528 --> 02:53:51,269
Councilor Scarpelli.

2401
02:53:51,289 --> 02:53:51,429

2402
02:53:51,629 --> 02:53:52,389

2403
02:53:52,489 --> 02:53:52,709
Yes.

2404
02:53:53,189 --> 02:53:54,490
Six affirmative one absent.

2405
02:53:55,050 --> 02:53:55,870
Motion passes.

2406
02:53:56,671 --> 02:53:57,491
What's the committees?

2407
02:54:00,852 --> 02:54:01,453
Two zero.

2408
02:54:03,384 --> 02:54:07,487
573 July 20 21 public works subcommittee Council biz.

2409
02:54:07,927 --> 02:54:14,232
Thank you, Mr. President, this is our strong crew working on snow removal ordinance.

2410
02:54:15,293 --> 02:54:17,975
Thank you to counselors marks and Falco for the continued work.

2411
02:54:18,716 --> 02:54:23,342
we got to, I believe, an agreement on the first section of language for our new ordinance.

2412
02:54:23,983 --> 02:54:34,015
We requested that the building commissioner and the city solicitor provide language around the enforcement and fee structure for snow removal going forward.

2413
02:54:34,616 --> 02:54:36,639
And we also received, you know,

2414
02:54:37,570 --> 02:54:49,243
communication from local 25 and Vice President Steve South regarding the priority sidewalk program and whether that would be outsourced by the city administration or whether it would be done by union workers.

2415
02:54:49,863 --> 02:54:56,891
And we requested that the union and the city administration meet together to discuss the priority sidewalk program.

2416
02:54:57,690 --> 02:55:07,217
My hope is that, A, that that meeting has happened, and that the other requests that we made of city staff on this issue have been fulfilled, and we can hopefully meet again relatively soon.

2417
02:55:07,777 --> 02:55:20,366
I would guess at this point, probably in the month of September, to at least advance this further, if not, hopefully have the answers we are seeking, and maybe move this, report this out to the larger body.

2418
02:55:21,427 --> 02:55:23,529
Okay, on the motion, report this out.

2419
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:26,351
By Councilor Baez, second and by.

2420
02:55:28,009 --> 02:55:28,309
Second.

2421
02:55:28,829 --> 02:55:29,910
Second by Councilor Falco.

2422
02:55:29,930 --> 02:55:30,530
All those in favor?

2423
02:55:30,910 --> 02:55:31,051
Aye.

2424
02:55:32,031 --> 02:55:33,352
All those opposed?

2425
02:55:33,872 --> 02:55:35,413
Motion passes.

2426
02:55:35,433 --> 02:55:41,336
20568, July 14th, Committee of the Whole, report regarding zoning with Jay Hrabowski.

2427
02:55:41,776 --> 02:55:51,281
We are coming close to finishing this up and hopefully we're waiting for him to give us a date for hopefully the last meeting before we send it to the OCD board.

2428
02:55:51,701 --> 02:55:57,764
So Councilor Scott Pele on the motion to report this out, report this favorably.

2429
02:55:58,499 --> 02:55:58,959
Second.

2430
02:55:58,979 --> 02:55:59,920
Seconded by Councillor Baird.

2431
02:55:59,960 --> 02:56:00,520
All in favour?

2432
02:56:00,760 --> 02:56:00,880
Aye.

2433
02:56:01,501 --> 02:56:05,163
Motion passes.

2434
02:56:05,183 --> 02:56:10,126
19-070, July 28th, Subcommittee on Zoning report to follow.

2435
02:56:11,187 --> 02:56:12,667
Councillor Falco, is that you?

2436
02:56:13,088 --> 02:56:13,268
Yes.

2437
02:56:13,968 --> 02:56:17,490
We met on live.

2438
02:56:24,435 --> 02:56:25,055
Maggie Tootin.

2439
02:56:31,071 --> 02:56:31,411
Okay.

2440
02:56:32,753 --> 02:56:38,518
Second, on the motion by Councilor Falco for approval seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli all those in favor.

2441
02:56:38,938 --> 02:56:42,441
All those opposed motion passes.

2442
02:56:42,962 --> 02:56:45,744
I think records to Adam.

2443
02:56:46,004 --> 02:56:49,688
I think I got everything yes, anything.

2444
02:56:49,728 --> 02:56:54,972
Council is not here on the motion by Council of bears, the table the records, Mr President.

2445
02:56:58,798 --> 02:57:08,764
I'm sorry, I jumped the gun table the records and then I have something to share on the motion by counselor bears seconded by Councilor Scott play the table the records.

2446
02:57:09,544 --> 02:57:10,125
All in favor.

2447
02:57:10,145 --> 02:57:10,805
All right.

2448
02:57:11,906 --> 02:57:13,807
All those opposed motion passes.

2449
02:57:13,967 --> 02:57:17,088
Mr. President just want to share a date with everyone.

2450
02:57:18,029 --> 02:57:24,693
Saturday morning, we'll be celebrating the, the life of Jimmy Madonna.

2451
02:57:26,059 --> 02:57:27,743
uh, method, legend, and, uh, um,

2452
02:57:30,345 --> 02:57:32,906
unbelievable young man who passed way too soon.

2453
02:57:34,267 --> 02:57:43,212
They'll be doing a huge fundraiser to support scholarships and other ventures for our kids here in Medford.

2454
02:57:43,652 --> 02:57:45,032
It'll be a wiffle ball tournament.

2455
02:57:46,433 --> 02:57:47,914
That's still some openings.

2456
02:57:47,974 --> 02:57:50,235
I know that the team is working very hard.

2457
02:57:50,915 --> 02:57:55,878
And then we'll have a I know Mr. Tanaka is working very hard.

2458
02:57:56,465 --> 02:58:05,961
to prepare the 50 70 field that's in the far corner of car park to be, um, be renamed after Jimmy Maturana.

2459
02:58:06,642 --> 02:58:08,165
And we're going to have, uh,

2460
02:58:09,152 --> 02:58:16,756
Billy O'Keefe and Babe Ruth is going to do a two inning ceremonial baseball game with Method Babe Ruth players.

2461
02:58:17,437 --> 02:58:20,958
And then just like I said, just a great community day.

2462
02:58:20,978 --> 02:58:27,642
It starts at nine o'clock, and I believe the ceremony is looking to be at two o'clock for the dedication.

2463
02:58:27,682 --> 02:58:33,085
So it's going to be a long day with a lot of fun and a lot of great stories.

2464
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:39,563
for a great young man that's gone way too soon.

2465
02:58:39,944 --> 02:58:40,405
So thank you.

2466
02:58:41,045 --> 02:58:41,386
Thank you.

2467
02:58:42,407 --> 02:58:42,888
Anybody else?

2468
02:58:43,008 --> 02:58:43,408
Anything else?

2469
02:58:44,249 --> 02:58:45,070
Mr. President, if I could.

2470
02:58:46,625 --> 02:58:56,507
Um, recently, the mayor's office submitted a press release regarding the strong stump removal in this community.

2471
02:58:57,368 --> 02:59:04,329
And from what I can gather, the mayor is subcontracting out to a private vendor.

2472
02:59:04,829 --> 02:59:10,911
The removal of I think the article stated 26 tree stumps in the city of Method.

2473
02:59:11,711 --> 02:59:19,676
The last count that I think I received, which I think is sorely underestimated, was there was about 575 stumps.

2474
02:59:20,516 --> 02:59:22,317
And I believe it's much higher than that.

2475
02:59:23,658 --> 02:59:28,901
Just from my informal, you know, cursory of the community.

2476
02:59:29,623 --> 02:59:45,555
And so it was quite disappointing to see a press release go out that addresses roughly 5% of the stumps that have been in this community for tens of years, to be quite frank.

2477
02:59:46,516 --> 02:59:57,924
And I am very disappointed to see that we couldn't deal with these stumps in one fell swoop rather than just piecemeal it once again

2478
02:59:58,866 --> 03:00:06,472
Mr President, as we heard today, there's trees being cut down, and those will be added to the stump list, and we're never going to get ahead of this.

2479
03:00:06,952 --> 03:00:23,005
So I have to express my disappointment with this latest attempt to get ahead of some of the concerns that I'm hearing from the community, which is stump removal, poor sidewalk conditions, and very poor road conditions in this community, Mr President.

2480
03:00:23,545 --> 03:00:29,670
And I don't think that addresses anything by removing 5% of what we have out there.

2481
03:00:30,010 --> 03:00:31,732
It doesn't sound like a game plan to me.

2482
03:00:32,032 --> 03:00:32,893
Thank you, Mr. President.

2483
03:00:32,913 --> 03:00:33,653
Thank you, Mr. President.

2484
03:00:33,673 --> 03:00:40,759
If I may also just, I know it's in the agenda, but our September meeting is moved to the 21st instead of the 14th.

2485
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:43,401
So we will be meeting the 21st of September.

2486
03:00:44,202 --> 03:00:45,043
Mr. President also.

2487
03:00:45,620 --> 03:00:45,900
Yes, sir.

2488
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:58,950
Just while we're on the topic of tree stumps and poor condition of our city streets and sidewalks, the mayor also came out with a press release recently, Mr. President, asking residents to adopt a catch basin.

2489
03:01:01,412 --> 03:01:13,522
So we are now asking residents to clean catch basins, which I always thought for years, and I've always asked during budget, we have a contract out to clean catch basins.

2490
03:01:14,358 --> 03:01:29,164
So I'm not quite sure what direction we're going in this community, Mr President, but we have to start asking residents to clean catch basins, I think is way out of whack Mr President, and that's not what we should be asking residents to do in this community.

2491
03:01:29,285 --> 03:01:30,445
Thank you.

2492
03:01:33,386 --> 03:01:34,267
Excuse me.

2493
03:01:34,547 --> 03:01:34,827
Yes, sir.

2494
03:01:37,934 --> 03:01:44,239
Name and address of the record please cast a netting on the subject of counselor marks about the condition of the city.

2495
03:01:44,739 --> 03:01:46,821
I once made a comment is looking.

2496
03:01:47,261 --> 03:01:50,323
It's looking like Chelsea around here but I was, I was corrected.

2497
03:01:51,024 --> 03:01:53,626
I looked at Chelsea Chelsea looks a lot better.

2498
03:01:55,767 --> 03:02:06,335
I can point out defects and, but I don't want to complain too much behind doors with a difference for one example, the bricks are sticking up like eight inches.

2499
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:10,081
It's incredible, and with the snow, you don't see that.

2500
03:02:11,562 --> 03:02:17,586
But anyways, besides what my wife felt, Mr. Caballero tried to bring up that issue before we went on vacation.

2501
03:02:17,986 --> 03:02:21,088
In front of Doris, what a difference, and she ripped her shoulder apart.

2502
03:02:21,828 --> 03:02:25,310
I want to thank you, counselors, for bringing up these concerns.

2503
03:02:25,791 --> 03:02:26,591
But you know something?

2504
03:02:27,512 --> 03:02:31,914
Out of 550 tree stumps, and we're going to fix 10%, maybe 50.

2505
03:02:32,074 --> 03:02:35,536
I used to be involved with methadoncinitis.

2506
03:02:37,147 --> 03:02:40,389
a chairman at that time, 2001 until Councilor Moss recalls.

2507
03:02:41,590 --> 03:02:42,270
You know something?

2508
03:02:44,171 --> 03:02:46,372
Put a planter with a hanging plant over it.

2509
03:02:46,692 --> 03:02:47,053
Good night.

2510
03:02:47,293 --> 03:02:47,773
Thank you, sir.

2511
03:02:49,034 --> 03:02:51,155
Motion to adjourn.

2512
03:02:51,555 --> 03:02:59,600
Mr. President, if I could, it's not on the agenda, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention I did bump into a resident this morning.

2513
03:03:00,020 --> 03:03:02,521
His mother, elderly mother, lives on Dwyer Circle.

2514
03:03:03,022 --> 03:03:04,983
It's imperative that she gets out during the day

2515
03:03:05,563 --> 03:03:13,427
and exercise, but unfortunately she's unable to because of all the uneven sidewalk panels on Dwyer Circle.

2516
03:03:13,447 --> 03:03:18,029
And I'd ask, challenge any of my colleagues to go out and take a walk around Dwyer Circle.

2517
03:03:18,369 --> 03:03:20,009
This is not a private way.

2518
03:03:20,350 --> 03:03:21,910
It's a public road, Mr. President.

2519
03:03:22,270 --> 03:03:25,732
It's in deplorable condition, the road and the sidewalks.

2520
03:03:26,212 --> 03:03:38,074
And, you know, I'm not going to put it formally, but these are the type of things, Mr. President, when you talk about quality of life, here's a woman that can't get out because they're afraid of a trip and fall hazard in front of her own home.

2521
03:03:39,854 --> 03:03:40,214
Thank you.

2522
03:03:40,534 --> 03:03:40,895
Thank you.

2523
03:03:41,595 --> 03:03:44,695
And if I can remind everybody, go out and vote.

2524
03:03:46,956 --> 03:03:48,556
Go out and vote on September 14th.

2525
03:03:51,416 --> 03:03:51,756
I'm sorry?

2526
03:03:53,257 --> 03:03:53,617
Thank you.

2527
03:03:53,657 --> 03:03:54,717
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

2528
03:03:55,357 --> 03:03:55,637
Thank you.

2529
03:03:56,635 --> 03:03:56,996
Thank you.

2530
03:03:57,517 --> 03:03:58,159
Thank you very much.

2531
03:03:58,680 --> 03:03:59,703
Motion to adjourn.

2532
03:04:00,886 --> 03:04:03,854
On the motion by Councilor Baird, seconded by Councilor Scott Pele.

2533
03:04:03,935 --> 03:04:04,496
All those in favor.
