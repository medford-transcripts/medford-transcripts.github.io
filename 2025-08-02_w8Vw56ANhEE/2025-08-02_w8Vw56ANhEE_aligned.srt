1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:07,376
For much of his political career, Donald Trump carefully cultivated an alliance with America's conspiracy-minded fringe.

2
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:17,122
He didn't just tolerate them for his political purposes, he activated them, stoned them, he brought them out of the shadows, he fed their fears, he made them feel seen.

3
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:25,108
He launched his political rise on the lie of birtherism, the idea that Barack Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim.

4
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:27,870
Now let me tell you from a place of authority,

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:35,400
I actually am a Kenyan-born Muslim, and for what it's worth, Barack Obama was never at any of the meetings.

6
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,682
But Trump knew that.

7
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:42,250
It was just a ploy, signaling early on that he was willing to go wherever the fringe's paranoia would take him.

8
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:50,214
voter base that was convinced that a global elite protected by the deep state was running a dark web of trafficking and exploitation.

9
00:00:50,474 --> 00:01:00,197
It started with a conspiracy about Hillary Clinton, who was, they alleged, running a pedophilia ring centered in the basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria in D.C.

10
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:08,619
On December 4th, 2016, a gunman from South Carolina entered the pizzeria to rescue the children from the basement.

11
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,240
Shots were fired.

12
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,027
There were no children.

13
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:13,727
There were no pedophiles.

14
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:16,768
The restaurant didn't have a basement.

15
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,588
That conspiracy, Pizzagate, was a bust.

16
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:25,029
But what wasn't a bust was the conspiracy that Trump and his supporters helped flourish with Jeffrey Epstein at its center.

17
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:28,650
Trump gave the Epstein conspiracy's wildest belief airtime.

18
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,130
In return, they backed him.

19
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,391
They reposted.

20
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:31,831
They voted.

21
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:32,551
They got elected.

22
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:33,571
He got elected.

23
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:38,772
In part on the strength of a base of conspiracy theorists he groomed.

24
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:44,233
But now he's president again, and those same conspiracists are becoming a big headache for him.

25
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:48,055
They're out of control, and he's poised to toss them aside.

26
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:59,058
He's lashing out at some of his most loyal supporters, calling them stupid, foolish, weaklings, all because they are pressing him on one issue, the Epstein files.

27
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,308
This isn't just another kooky day in MAGA land.

28
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,729
This moment marks a significant rupture.

29
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,072
For all his authoritarian instincts, Trump has always relied on one illusion.

30
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,593
That he was one of them.

31
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:15,313
A truth teller.

32
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:16,414
A rebel.

33
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,995
A man fighting the man.

34
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:21,445
But that was always a con.

35
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,050
Trump never saw the base as partners in a cause.

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,972
He saw them as marks.

37
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:26,595
A means to an end.

38
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:32,466
A block of loyal, gullible voters he could exploit to win power that he couldn't and wouldn't have won without them.

39
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:41,334
Now that his own base is turning the lens back on him, what they're seeing is just another rich, powerful man protecting himself.

40
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:44,535
And Trump knows that that's what they see.

41
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:49,857
That's why even as he insults them, he still tries to manipulate them, floating a brand new conspiracy.

42
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:53,118
That it's all just a setup, this Epstein stuff.

43
00:02:53,965 --> 00:03:00,267
During a press conference in Scotland on Monday, Trump called the growing outrage over the Epstein files a hoax.

44
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:12,151
And then, in classic fashion, he pointed the finger at the previous Biden administration, claiming they may have tampered with the evidence that they could have, quote, easily put something in the files that's a phony, end quote.

45
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:17,553
But this time, the excuses and the distractions don't seem to be working.

46
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:22,452
Because the Epstein story doesn't divide neatly along left versus right lines.

47
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:24,734
It cuts much deeper for MAGA diehards.

48
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,116
This isn't about politics.

49
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:26,897
It's about power.

50
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,199
It's about who gets protected in the system.

51
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:35,506
And you can hear the disillusionment in the voices of the same right-leaning influencers on whom Trump once counted.

52
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:41,903
Joe Rogan, arguably the most influential podcaster in America, hosted Trump before the last election.

53
00:03:42,143 --> 00:03:43,084
He once defended him.

54
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:45,566
Now he calls the Epstein scandal a line in the sand.

55
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,129
He's accusing the Trump camp of gaslighting the public.

56
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:57,276
Comedian Andrew Schultz, who also gave Trump a warm podcast welcome back in October, had this to say to his listeners last weekend.

57
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:07,718
If I wanted to vote for somebody that was going to keep the Epstein files under wrap, that was going to extend the foreign wars, that was going to increase the budget, I would have voted for Kamala.

58
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:17,162
Theo Vaughn, another major voice among the younger male demographic, is openly calling out GOP lawmakers for shielding Trump on Epstein.

59
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:23,384
These are the very same voices Trump relied on to reach young, independent men, and now they are calling him out.

60
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,564
The numbers back up this shift.

61
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:31,866
A Washington Post poll this week found just 38% of Republicans approve of Trump's handling of the Epstein files.

62
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:35,847
Even among MAGA Republicans, it's only 43%.

63
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:47,149
And a Yahoo YouGov poll published on Thursday found that a whopping 67% of Americans believe the government is hiding information about Epstein's death.

64
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:51,470
Trump's once-invincible MAGA machine is glitching.

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,481
Even the QAnon shaman has turned on him, calling Trump a fraud.

66
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,842
I mean, when you've lost the QAnon shaman.

67
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:09,923
This is the same base from which Trump once bragged he would not lose any voters, even if he were to stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone.

68
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:15,585
Well, now he's aiming at them, mocking them, gaslighting them, calling them names.

69
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,145
And guess what?

70
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,505
He's losing them.

71
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:21,018
That's what makes this scandal different.

72
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:31,101
The hush money, the tariffs, the authoritarian power grabs, even January 6th, through it all, many of his followers convinced themselves it was all part of the plan, that Trump was still one of them.

73
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:34,723
But the Epstein files have shattered that myth.

74
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:47,207
Now even his most loyal supporters are seeing Trump for what he has always been, not a crusading outsider, just another rich guy, in power now, protecting himself.

75
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,917
Predictably, Trump's propagandists are scrambling to clean up Trump's mess.

76
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:57,803
His White House press secretary, Carolyn Leavitt, Trump's fiercest hype woman, has been deployed to wave it all away.

77
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:05,991
On Thursday, during a White House press briefing, she insisted that the Nobel Committee hand over a Peace Prize to Donald Trump.

78
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,975
After all, she says, Trump has ended six conflicts.

79
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:23,859
The President has now ended conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia.

80
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:31,846
This means President Trump has brokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office.

81
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:36,050
It's well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

82
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:44,549
Except that those conflicts are still very much ongoing, not to mention that Trump nearly triggered a war with one of them.

83
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:55,596
As the New Republic's Greg Sargent put it this way, quote, we can always tell when Trump is in a shaky situation when Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt rushes in to praise him with absurdly over-the-top obsequious flattery.

84
00:06:55,636 --> 00:06:58,158
And boy, she did not disappoint this time.

85
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,503
Levitt isn't alone in this political theater, by the way.

86
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:15,987
The sort of shunned conspiracist Kash Patel, now head of the FBI, has conveniently reappeared this week to let us know that he stumbled into secret burn bags of Russia documents in some locked room somewhere.

87
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:27,431
And then there's the sort of shunned Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who's working hard to get back into Trump's good graces by resurrecting the long-debunked claim that Barack Obama manufactured evidence in Russiagate.

88
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:31,638
The desperation is as palpable as it is revealing.

89
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:36,979
What you're witnessing are the reflexes of a White House in crisis grasping for any narrative that might stick.

90
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,020
And it all begs one simple question.

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,941
If Trump has nothing to hide, why is he hiding?

92
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,462
Because the problem isn't Obama.

93
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,222
The problem is not the media.

94
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,983
The problem is not burn bags at the FBI.

95
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,323
The problem is not the Democrats.

96
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:58,025
The problem is the perception among Trump's own base that he is covering something up.

97
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:10,899
In his book, The Conspiracy to End America, Stuart Stevens, a former GOP strategist, writes, quote, in Donald Trump's world, to be an American was to be a victim of powerful forces, globalist conspiracies, and wealthier countries.

98
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:16,122
Electing Trump was an act of grievance, a way to settle the score, end quote.

99
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:29,680
But what happens when the man you handed the keys to power starts pushing policy after policy that hurts the very working class Americans that he claimed to protect, slashing the social safety net, gutting the protections that stand between everyday people and corporate predators?

100
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,002
Stevens offers this warning, quote, the collapse of American democracy is like the pandemic.

101
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:41,783
Whatever you say at the beginning will sound alarmist, but likely prove inadequate by the end, end quote.

102
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:43,844
Sit with that for a moment.

103
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:49,671
Whatever you say at the beginning will sound alarmist, but likely prove inadequate by the end.

104
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:53,134
Stewart follows with a quote from Abraham Lincoln.

105
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:59,000
In 1864, President Lincoln wrote, you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.

106
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:01,583
We should listen and act accordingly.

107
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:06,072
With more on this, I'm joined by Stuart Stevens himself, senior advisor for the Lincoln Project.

108
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:09,773
He served as the chief strategist for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.

109
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:17,156
He's the author of numerous books, including The Conspiracy to End America, Five Ways My Old Party is Driving Our Democracy to Autocracy.

110
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,296
Stuart, welcome back to the show.

111
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,297
Thank you for being with us.

112
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:24,378
You described very well Trump's political appeal as being rooted in grievance.

113
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:30,080
But many of the people who supported him because of that are now feeling conned.

114
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:31,461
Something has changed.

115
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:41,357
Yeah, look, I think that there's a dividing line here in society, that the pro-pedophile section is pretty small.

116
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:47,280
And, you know, Trump has always had this ability to and need to humiliate people.

117
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:53,019
I think that a lot of the reasons he appoints people like Pete Hedgeshead or RFK Jr.

118
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:58,060
is not because he doesn't know that they're idiots and are going to hurt America.

119
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,721
He does it to prove that he can break these Republican senators and make them do what they know is wrong.

120
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:12,982
And this is a moment where, if you don't say this is wrong, if you don't call on Donald Trump not to pardon Maxwell, you're for it.

121
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:13,922
That's the assumption.

122
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,263
Because you went along with everything else with Trump.

123
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:21,027
So, I think this really is a different moment for Trump.

124
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:33,372
And I think it's a moment where you either have to say everything that we believed about the world was wrong and Donald Trump was right, or you have to say, well, there are pedophiles there.

125
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,763
Are we going to find out who they are?

126
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:40,284
I mean, the answer to most people is, are you on the Epstein list?

127
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,946
Most of us have a pretty easy way of just saying no.

128
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:56,530
I think it's going to come down to when these congressmen and senators who are vulnerable, and it's an increasing number for a lot of factors, feel that they can't defend Trump on this.

129
00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:02,573
And what Democrats need to be doing is asking each of these Republican senators and congressmen,

130
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:05,374
Are you for pardoning Maxwell or not?

131
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:06,475
It's an easy answer.

132
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:07,535
It's a yes or no answer.

133
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:11,497
And if you are not for it, then you need to tell the president not to do it.

134
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:13,938
The same with moving Maxwell.

135
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,400
The same with releasing all of the Epstein information.

136
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,863
And this idea that Democrats are somehow hesitant about this, I think you've sort of passed that moment.

137
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:27,885
I think now they've sort of turned this corner, let the chips fall where they may, which is exactly where they should be.

138
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,567
So go to these districts.

139
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:37,934
You know, ask the pastors of the churches of these congressmen and these senators where they stand.

140
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:40,317
And I think that really hurts these people at their base.

141
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,341
You know, a lot of politics is about small numbers.

142
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:49,108
And when you look at these districts, Trump can't lose very much of these voters.

143
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,933
And I think it's going to hurt him.
