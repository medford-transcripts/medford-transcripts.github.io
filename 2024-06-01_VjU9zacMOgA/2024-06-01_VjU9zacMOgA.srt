[SPEAKER_09]: present.

13
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:38,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to recognize Emily Lazzaro as our vice chair.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,892
[SPEAKER_09]: We will go on to the action and discussion items.

15
00:00:45,594 --> 00:00:47,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And the primary one here is

16
00:00:48,826 --> 00:01:02,072
[SPEAKER_09]: is 24-006 offered by Isaac bears Council President, the resolution that each council committee review the 2024 2025 Council governing agenda as amended at the January 24 2024 committee of the whole meeting.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,621
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have that agenda in front of us.

18
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:23,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And as with the other committee meetings, we can go ahead and just run through those items to discuss how we are going to move forward on them for the next year or two.

19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,553
[SPEAKER_09]: We will start with our major projects, and I'll start with the street and sidewalk repair and accessibility.

20
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:34,012
[SPEAKER_09]: and sidewalk repairs.

21
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:41,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Um while we don't implement street and sidewalk repair as a city council, um, we do want to be, um.

22
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:50,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Aware of and to also provide residents some awareness of what the city is planning to do in terms of street and sidewalk repair.

23
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:52,983
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the

24
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:21,579
[SPEAKER_09]: the administration, which of the proposed plans in the 2021 payment management study we have chosen, or if we haven't chosen any of those plans specifically, then what are our plans for the next five years, including both the funding as well as which streets or category of streets we will be repairing?

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from city councilors?

26
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,190
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears.

27
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Chair Callahan.

28
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:32,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think this is so important.

29
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:33,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an issue.

30
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:37,539
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're asking me if there was a top three issue, this is one of the one of the three.

31
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:44,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, regardless of whatever else they may believe, is frustrated with the condition of our streets and sidewalks.

32
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:47,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really the ultimate question.

33
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:51,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been trying to, I think, and trying to get it from multiple angles, I think it's really valuable.

34
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,773
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trying to get at it from the budget side.

35
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:59,364
[SPEAKER_02]: What's our what's our investment going to be in streets and sidewalks, we have this payment management plan.

36
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:06,775
[SPEAKER_02]: It says we need to start spending x by x to maintain the mediocre condition of our streets and sidewalks, nevermind to.

37
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:14,867
[SPEAKER_02]: actually start making improvements in the condition or the rating, they have this numerical rating of condition.

38
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:37,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would move based on your statement, Madam Chair, to request that we receive, and let me see if I can get this exactly right, and I don't have this in advance, so I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk, to create a new paper

39
00:03:39,551 --> 00:04:06,041
[SPEAKER_02]: in committee and the Public Works and Facilities Committee to request an update on the payment management plan from the Department of Public Works, including the plan, the financial plan recommendation that the city adopted based on the payment management plan, what that financial investment has looked like

40
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:11,876
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fiscal year since that plan was published and when the plan will be updated.

41
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:27,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we can get answers to those questions and also have Commissioner McGivern or whomever from maybe multiple folks from DPW to present some answers to those questions and also allow us to have a discussion.

42
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:32,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that we can request that for a month from now when we have our next

43
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:48,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, you know, I'm happy to, at the discretion of the chair, to forward that motion to the commissioner, and if he says I need this much time to get answers to your questions, then we can put it on an agenda for next month or two months, whatever they need.

44
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,222
[SPEAKER_02]: But the timeline, the discretion of the chair is fine with me, and based on availability and capacity of the city staff.

45
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, do we have, this is a motion, do we have?

46
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:58,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a motion, yes.

47
00:04:58,904 --> 00:04:59,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second?

48
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:00,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

49
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:01,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpella?

50
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:03,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconds the motion.

51
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:05,937
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

52
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:06,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, please do.

53
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:08,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Read it back, and then we can have a discussion.

54
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:08,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

55
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and I think also,

56
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:41,222
[SPEAKER_02]: what the city has spent relative to payment management since the plan was published.

57
00:05:41,442 --> 00:06:01,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also include what the city has spent on payment management since the plan was published.

58
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and like by fiscal year.

59
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:11,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you don't, you could also, we could discuss my motion more if people have further discussion.

60
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:20,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that probably first, maybe on its own paper, I think that's something that was relevant years ago.

61
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:24,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're seeing the fact that our roads, especially our sidewalks,

62
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:29,506
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing the negative impact, especially after all the bonding that we've provided.

63
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:39,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the feedback that we've heard back was that a lot of the lack of functioning of the projects is due to lack of

64
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:43,099
[SPEAKER_08]: license contractors that can do the job.

65
00:06:43,619 --> 00:07:01,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And then see because the season, something I put out a few years ago, I'd like to bring it back and maybe put it as a motion or with this or a separate motion that we asked the commissioner to do a cost analysis of starting again, our own sidewalk and hot top crew.

66
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:07,890
[SPEAKER_08]: When we presented this, I think my first term, I had a

67
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:31,058
[SPEAKER_08]: the ability to take the DPW director in the neighboring community who actually broke down the equipment that's needed, the type of vehicle that would be needed, the three staff members plus their benefits, and what it came down to is having a crew that worked through the warmer weather

68
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:50,953
[SPEAKER_08]: and working at our pace to do that, the sidewalk repairs and sidewalk management plan, it really benefited neighboring communities where Medford, what my bone of contention is, I'm sure Councilor Bears remembers that when we keep

69
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:59,797
[SPEAKER_08]: when the administration keeps coming to us with $2.5 million bonds to redo sidewalks and stump removal.

70
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:06,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And to this day, another piece to this is having that list updated and reporting back to us.

71
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:10,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it'll be good for the new council to see what we've done with that $2.5 million and

72
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,351
[SPEAKER_08]: how little gets done with that in a certain amount of time.

73
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:32,445
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if we can add that or maybe as a second motion, ask follow up with the director of DPW commissioner to maybe put together a budget request for a hot top and sidewalk crew.

74
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:35,753
[SPEAKER_08]: with the staffing and materials needed.

75
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:43,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And that doesn't have to be done by next month, but it might be something we could look at for the budget season and saying, well, look at this impact.

76
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do the math.

77
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:55,408
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's 2.5 million and we've only done 400 panels, sidewalk panels, and what's equivalent to neighbor communities,

78
00:08:56,328 --> 00:09:04,475
[SPEAKER_08]: what does it take to do 400 panels, and we see that there's a drastic financial difference, I think that we should really entertain that.

79
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:12,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we've offered it, and I know some DPW directors in the past have wanted to do it, but it's always been frozen at the administration level.

80
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:17,706
[SPEAKER_08]: The other piece to that is the benefit of having a sidewalk

81
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:33,828
[SPEAKER_08]: and hot top crew with potholes all year round, if there are down times that those three staff members could also be used in the parks department if needed, could be used in different departments when needed, you know, when you do see a lag.

82
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that's okay with.

83
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, thank you so much.

84
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that idea.

85
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:47,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I might suggest that we add to this motion that we have a report back not only on the pavement management,

86
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:51,820
[SPEAKER_09]: study, which is specifically roads, but there's also a sidewalk study.

87
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:02,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe that belongs in it and then maybe a separate motion for a comparison of the price of having our own sidewalk.

88
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:04,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah.

89
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:28,525
[SPEAKER_02]: versus uh the way that we're currently doing it that's a good idea add the sidewalks to that and then i'll i'll make the second motion okay yeah and my apologies for the i intended it to be pavement management and sidewalk management um i like that i think um and we could add that further amendment the sidewalk management we could also add when we talk about the spending over the

90
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:41,651
[SPEAKER_02]: since those plans were released, including the bond orders as part of that, like how much work was done on each bond order, how much remains to be bonded.

91
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really it.

92
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:45,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

93
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:47,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

94
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:57,434
[SPEAKER_08]: the time for our new members is that weather got in the way.

95
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:15,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Lack of I believe at one point we're hiring landscape contractors to do sidewalks because there were so limited for for licensed contractors that typically do this with having some time to do it.

96
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we got that desperate.

97
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would hate to do that.

98
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:28,528
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because I think we might see the ramifications a few years down the line when you bring in people that didn't do things the proper way if that's the case.

99
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:42,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it would be the bond, what was done under each bond, how much remains to be bonded, and whether or not the availability of licensed contractors affected what projects were conducted.

100
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

101
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:46,453
[SPEAKER_05]: This motion is only about two full pages.

102
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you could leave the motion

103
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make sure that that's the one you send me what you've written.

104
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:04,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also was wondering if, when you make your next motion on the as chair Kelly and said on the sidewalk payment hot top crew.

105
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:11,168
[SPEAKER_02]: whether potentially they could also serve.

106
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:22,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Another PPW priority that we had was the main streets and sidewalk, the major sidewalks, snow removal pilot that we had.

107
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

108
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:26,964
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big map in that desk from Commissioner Karen's

109
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:36,563
[SPEAKER_02]: of these are the main routes in the city, and could the city take responsibility for sending out a Luke sidewalker, for example?

110
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:41,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the name of one of our sidewalkers, by the way.

111
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:44,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Look it up, Google it.

112
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when we had a newspaper that was newsworthy, somehow.

113
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:58,038
[SPEAKER_02]: But could this crew potentially also, in addition to being available to the other departments, would that maybe be also an alternative?

114
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,139
[SPEAKER_08]: As part of their equipment.

115
00:12:59,379 --> 00:12:59,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

116
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of their equipment, part of their duties could just be a sidewalk maintenance.

117
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:06,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

118
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:07,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Zero.

119
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:25,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I support all of the requests for reports, just I would want to keep an eye toward not giving the city staff enough time to generate those reports.

120
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:33,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not overwhelming as we request them, just like with respect for how much work they

121
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,042
[SPEAKER_10]: have to put up to do those reports.

122
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:38,943
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, this is something for budget season, my request.

123
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,744
[SPEAKER_08]: So it still gets some time, so.

124
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:42,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

125
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:43,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

126
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:44,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there more discussion?

127
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:48,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people feel comfortable, even though this is a very long motion, do people feel comfortable voting on the motion?

128
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:53,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I love listening to Adam get cramps in his fingers, so I think it's great.

129
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think for timing's sake, we should split them.

130
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,207
[SPEAKER_02]: One is like, what is the information of the stuff we've already done?

131
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:03,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And one is like, can you come up with an estimate and an idea of a new thing?

132
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:07,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might, as Councilor Scarpelli and Lazzaro noted, take more time.

133
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's waiting on the deputy commissioner to be hired.

134
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,011
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of factors there.

135
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But I believe that currently we're only considering your motion right now.

136
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:17,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, OK.

137
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:17,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

138
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:17,512
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good.

139
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:17,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

140
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:18,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

141
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:27,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, any more discussion on the first motion of President Bears?

142
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:30,334
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

143
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

144
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:32,054
[SPEAKER_09]: All opposed?

145
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:33,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

146
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:38,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, do you want to make that motion now?

147
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:44,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like me to repeat that motion?

148
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give you what I have.

149
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not able to capture everything.

150
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:01,177
[SPEAKER_04]: in house.

151
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:01,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

152
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:13,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And to add Council business comment that other look at the cost for a Luke sidewalker.

153
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:20,594
[SPEAKER_08]: to also add as one of their duties.

154
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,175
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that rounds off a whole team.

155
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:33,538
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at sidewalk, hop-top crew, slash snow removal on main sidewalks, that's a pretty complete position.

156
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:35,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did Google it.

157
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:36,539
[SPEAKER_08]: He is right.

158
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,084
[SPEAKER_04]: please use loot sidewalker.

159
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:49,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you want to use Chewbacca shovel, is that in there too?

160
00:15:52,613 --> 00:16:06,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the intent is to say what would the equipment and the personnel cost be for in-house maintenance sidewalks on top and snow removal on priority sidewalks?

161
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:17,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anybody else watching this?

162
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:18,998
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a second gavel.

163
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me the second gavel.

164
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, second gavel.

165
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the second drawer.

166
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:25,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smaller.

167
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:26,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it go boing?

168
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually just hit me right now.

169
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, isn't it?

170
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,325
[SPEAKER_04]: He did say snow be one for nobody.

171
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I said nothing of the sort.

172
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that.

173
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:36,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

174
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:37,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Any more discussion on this motion?

175
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:39,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

176
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:42,353
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

177
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:43,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

178
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:43,934
[SPEAKER_09]: All opposed?

179
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:45,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

180
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:49,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, let's go ahead and breeze through some of these other ones.

181
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:52,176
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one under City Facilities and Equipment.

182
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:53,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone who wants to speak on this one?

183
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I'm happy to volunteer as the lead on this.

184
00:16:57,757 --> 00:17:02,299
[SPEAKER_02]: This has again been something we're trying to get our hands around in the budget side of things.

185
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,161
[SPEAKER_02]: What are all of the facilities we own?

186
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:11,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is the cost for us to bring them all up to a state of good repair?

187
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:14,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what is the annual cost to maintain them in a state of good repair?

188
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Big questions, but also essential questions.

189
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:22,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw we had an email from Mr. Krause about Chevalier and about Condon Shell.

190
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:29,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe he wants to talk about that as part of this as a member of the council's representative on the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust Board.

191
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:40,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another property that is city owned that has needed significant support to get to a state of good repair to get into a functioning business model.

192
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:45,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Chevalier has come a long way, obviously, in the last 30 years to where it is now really.

193
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:53,717
[SPEAKER_02]: an economic heart of our downtown, but it still needs serious maintenance.

194
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:58,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an old building, it needs new things, it needs maintenance.

195
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are just two properties.

196
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:04,364
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Hegner Center, which is abandoned functionally.

197
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:08,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all of our fire stations.

198
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,169
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the new police station, the new library.

199
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Maintenance was an issue for the new library in the last budget.

200
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's difficult.

201
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:20,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We now have a facilities manager.

202
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:21,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 1 person show.

203
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:31,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of I'm sure his time is spent actively managing minor repair projects on, you know, and maintenance projects across the city's facilities inventory.

204
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but.

205
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Figuring that that main question out of, uh.

206
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,670
[SPEAKER_02]: What is everything that we own?

207
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,971
[SPEAKER_02]: What would it cost to bring them all up to a state of good repair?

208
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:48,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what is the cost to maintain those buildings at a state of good repair?

209
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:54,333
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in another building right now where we have punched out panels in 80 to 100-year-old windows.

210
00:18:54,413 --> 00:19:03,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pervasive across all of the city-owned facilities except for basically the library, the police station, and I don't even know anymore about the DPW yard.

211
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:07,916
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming up on 15 years, 10 years of that being a new facility.

212
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,588
[SPEAKER_02]: One, if we're going to be building new, we're going to be building a new fire headquarters.

213
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:16,170
[SPEAKER_02]: If we've just built these new buildings, we need to be investing in maintenance.

214
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:33,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're going to have, you know, Brooks estate has no devoted line item right now from the city, the Chevalier, I believe Mr. Krause said that the custodian line item that got paid not out of the general fund last year that came from money that should have been going from the casino fund to Chevalier.

215
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:33,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

216
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:58,783
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when we talk about not having the resources we need, whether it's on the operational side to have a hot top crew and the equipment that we need, or we're talking on the capital side to have, you know, on the operating side for maintenance, for capital expenditures, and then the capital side of like deep investments in renovations or reconstruction, we need to be able to answer those questions to give the scope to the community of, of where we're going to go.

217
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:03,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a motion, but that's just, I'm happy to take this one on.

218
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a major project.

219
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:13,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should do something similar maybe at our next meeting to not necessarily have him at our next meeting, but the motion we just made around streets and sidewalks where we have a little more progress.

220
00:20:14,476 --> 00:20:23,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps in our next meeting, we can have a discussion about and maybe I'll put something on the agenda to refer to this committee to invite the facilities manager to have a similar discussion.

221
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:35,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I can, Madam Chair, I think that what's important is I don't know if you can effectively do that job unless you have a true understanding of what, like you said.

222
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:49,269
[SPEAKER_08]: the facilities, what's needed, how to have a working document, because as we said, it could be windows one day, but as the windows need repair, it might be flooring, and then understanding how that breaks down.

223
00:20:49,309 --> 00:21:05,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that, I know that we've in the past had a comprehensive study done for all the buildings, but I think if we invite the, I've yet to meet the facilities director, maybe inviting him to one of our next meetings and asking them if they do have a comprehensive plan,

224
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:10,608
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, with what Councilor Bears was saying, so we can see.

225
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:21,493
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, what a working document looks like to maintain or bring these buildings back up to par and making sure that we stay ahead of things.

226
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:39,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the other piece of that, there are so many things that we need, and there are so many avenues that we can use, but there truly isn't a point person that, at least I haven't heard yet, that can look at different grants and different avenues that we can use to fund these projects.

227
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:39,707
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

228
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:46,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a good start to have a facilities manager, but I would love to see what other communities have.

229
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:56,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, most communities have a facilities manager that has an assistant manager that also has a facilities crew that does electrical.

230
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:08,174
[SPEAKER_08]: They have an electrician, a plumber, and a carpenter that's on staff that you're not wasting time or money bringing outside contractors to do things we need.

231
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,357
[SPEAKER_08]: in most cases at a minute's notice.

232
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:18,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that's how most facilities teams work in most communities.

233
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:26,286
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I remember when Medford, the school department, used to have its own maintenance team.

234
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:34,613
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a locksmith, an electrician, we had a plumber, we had a carpenter, we had a painter, that they worked.

235
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:41,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, this is with the old schools, the neighborhood schools, that they kept them up as much as they could.

236
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:48,284
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're looking at what's so-called the new schools now that are now outdated and in desperate need of upgrades.

237
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:49,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that

238
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:57,227
[SPEAKER_08]: having the new facilities manager come to us, and believe me, I don't expect the person to come up and say, yeah, this is what we need.

239
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:18,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we might have to look at asking the mayor to bring in a consultant that goes through the whole building, like Weston and Sampson, that other communities use, that go through all of our buildings and come through with the honest assessment of what we need in our priorities, starting high priority first.

240
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:19,231
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

241
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:22,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

242
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:23,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I completely agree.

243
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:27,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I think having some sort of assessment.

244
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:42,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think that if with a new facilities manager, that is exactly the time for them to be given a task like this, as long as they have enough time, because it really sets them on the right path of being aware of all of our facilities and the shape that each one of them is in.

245
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,573
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll help them to get all that information on board quickly.

246
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:46,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

247
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:50,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other discussion around this one?

248
00:23:53,180 --> 00:24:05,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to public restrooms in Parks and Squares, and Councilor Tseng is not here, but it is fairly self-descriptive, just developing plans to have more public restrooms in our parks and squares.

249
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to ordinances, is there any discussion?

250
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:12,032
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

251
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:17,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Ordinances, the lead ordinance, Councilor Beres, do you want to introduce this one?

252
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:19,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

253
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:23,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe this one is awaiting a paper number.

254
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:25,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's been formally introduced yet.

255
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

256
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:30,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to work on it with you, Madam Chair.

257
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:36,729
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as our water and sewer superintendent, DBW commissioner.

258
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:49,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are communities that have adopted lead ordinances, neighboring communities pursuant to federal regulations and similar ordinances around lead in water.

259
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:53,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have kind of a template document that they're looking at.

260
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:59,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be interested to sit down with, get that template, work with them.

261
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:00,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the two of us can sit down with them

262
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:09,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We can bring that here to this committee to begin the process of passing that ordinance.

263
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:11,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Any discussion?

264
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:13,568
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be about private.

265
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,273
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about private connections to the public.

266
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:18,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

267
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:22,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

268
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:26,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to a homeown petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks.

269
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,293
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Vice President Collins taking the lead on this.

270
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone that wants to introduce this one?

271
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:36,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to.

272
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:37,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that's my true title.

273
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:38,679
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what rings in my head.

274
00:25:47,233 --> 00:26:08,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Councilor Collins' intent here is that because of the significant, that we know that very large vehicles and heavy vehicles damage our roads much more than lighter, smaller vehicles should, given the impact on road conditions, should those, should we all be paying the same flat rate on our excise tax just based on the value?

275
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:10,192
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could have a, I could have a,

276
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:15,530
[SPEAKER_02]: $100,000 sports car that weighs very light.

277
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:16,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

278
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:22,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Councilor Scarpelli can get me in on the solar industry and we can figure that out.

279
00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:24,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could have a 5,000, 6,000 pound

280
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:30,184
[SPEAKER_02]: 25-year-old truck, right?

281
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:38,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm paying almost nothing on the truck because it's worth almost nothing, but it's damaging the road way more than the lighter, more expensive higher value car.

282
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:49,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So the intent here is to at least ask the legislature if they would let us assess our excise tax based on impact on road condition in addition to just the value of the vehicle.

283
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:52,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other discussion?

284
00:26:55,094 --> 00:27:00,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to the oversight and engagement, public utility accountability.

285
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:11,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Cerulli is looking at holding utility companies accountable to provide services and benefits to the community and mitigate impact of their assets and poor asset condition on the city.

286
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:15,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we've seen, Madam President, through the chair, I believe it's a

287
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:34,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we're seeing our city engineer being more proactive when we're opening our streets to private entities, let's say a resident wanting to change from a lead pipe to copper water pipe.

288
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:48,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the new policies in place now that the homeowner now has to pay the contractor to go curb to curb, which if what bothers me with that is that I don't know.

289
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:54,925
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still question, I think, to ask the city engineer that when the utilities come in,

290
00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:00,521
[SPEAKER_08]: are they mandated for the same type of restoration?

291
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:03,883
[SPEAKER_08]: If they open the street from what I've been told, they're not.

292
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:14,948
[SPEAKER_08]: They open up the area that needs to be open that they can get to, they resurface it, they let it sit one cycle, and they come back and resurface it.

293
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,409
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's not fair.

294
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:22,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the basic resident, the homeowner, or, you know,

295
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:30,433
[SPEAKER_08]: The landlord that has to pay for the safer, you know, transfer of lead to copper has now

296
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:42,177
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing up the rate that's falling back on the consumer because now the contract is not saying, okay, let's keep it the same price.

297
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:47,040
[SPEAKER_08]: They're boosting the price to an unimaginable fee.

298
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:52,024
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to know if we're seeing the same with utilities.

299
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:57,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Our biggest issue right now that we've seen and heard from time and time again, using Winthrop Street as a good example,

300
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:02,111
[SPEAKER_08]: That street has been opened up, I think, maybe 10 times in the last 10 years.

301
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:05,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're looking at the same.

302
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:11,538
[SPEAKER_08]: The same areas being opened up, but there isn't collaboration with.

303
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:26,664
[SPEAKER_08]: national grid gas work to Medford's infrastructure, water pipes that I think that if there could be a better way to communicate that to minimize any of the resurfacing of the roads.

304
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:33,909
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that the biggest thing with I believe this is the having the utilities coming in and going curb to curb as well.

305
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,012
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I believe that's something that

306
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:59,455
[SPEAKER_08]: we need a better understanding, maybe through a motion, is just asking some clarity with the city engineer just to give us a report of what the utility standards are when opening streets and for private residents that want to make, you know, change their water lines.

307
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so we have an understanding and then

308
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:15,867
[SPEAKER_08]: because I, you know, we've heard it for years now, the biggest concerns and issues we have in our roads and sidewalks are the fraudulent work done by the utilities when they come in and not being held accountable.

309
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:29,434
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest part of that is also that most communities have what's called a clerk of the works, that when they are doing a job, permitted a job, you have a clerk of the works for the DPW that

310
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:37,552
[SPEAKER_08]: watches and oversees the opening of the area, the closing, then the cleaning of the area.

311
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:41,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something we asked for in the past.

312
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:53,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we asked for that if we could ask for a fee to be added to any road work that would pay for Clerk of the Works and we were told that can't happen.

313
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,500
[SPEAKER_08]: So that they told us that that's,

314
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:58,886
[SPEAKER_08]: something that we can't request.

315
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:10,292
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we can get that motion to the city engineer to give us a better understanding of the utility side of the roads, and hopefully we can police that a little bit better.

316
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:13,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for mentioning that.

317
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:23,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It also reminds me that I heard this same thing that you say that you have heard for many years I also heard this talking to neighbors at their doors.

318
00:31:24,523 --> 00:31:26,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And also I wonder if we can fold into this.

319
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:39,617
[SPEAKER_09]: to understand from the administration how much coordination there is, because in some other cities, they put a moratorium once a road is truly repaved and brought up to like a number one.

320
00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:41,478
[SPEAKER_08]: There is, I believe it's five years, a new road.

321
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:47,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And my understanding is that then there are a lot of emergencies, and that this happens all the time.

322
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:59,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So to really have an understanding from the administration of what that moratorium is, what can get in the way of it, how often it happens, that, in fact, it's torn up much more quickly than every five years.

323
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:02,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that might fold into that, or it could be separate.

324
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

325
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:11,467
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to the ripping up the roads issue of public utility stuff, I think there's something

326
00:32:12,503 --> 00:32:26,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big concern about the functioning of the substances themselves, like the gas, the gas leaks, and various things like that.

327
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be very curious to keep track of.

328
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,748
[SPEAKER_10]: that everything is moving along properly.

329
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:41,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when I worked for Christine Barber, she was working on a gas leak spill and I was just trying to research if that ever passed.

330
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:41,857
[SPEAKER_10]: This was like 2017, 2018.

331
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:44,120
[SPEAKER_10]: But that Somerville at the time was one of the

332
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:52,740
[SPEAKER_10]: one of the municipalities that had the highest density of gas leaks.

333
00:32:53,181 --> 00:33:06,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was, what happened was some of the residents or every resident pays for the leaks that as the gas leaks, the rate payers pay for it, the utility doesn't pay for it.

334
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:15,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So the bill was to say, you know, fix the leaks obviously first, but also if you can't fix the leaks, you pay for the leaks and then the rate payers shouldn't pay for it.

335
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:18,989
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that that wasn't happening was utterly insane.

336
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even sure if it passed.

337
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still trying to research it.

338
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,692
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, yes.

339
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:35,179
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do have and if they can update us with that, because they have in the past where they tell us what level we have.

340
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So that might be helpful to that.

341
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:41,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we could see, you know, sorry.

342
00:33:41,404 --> 00:33:41,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Adam.

343
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:43,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an update.

344
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:43,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good.

345
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:50,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Several years ago, it creates feedback when I turn it off.

346
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:52,163
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

347
00:33:52,923 --> 00:34:03,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Several years ago, you were on the council, and the council passed an ordinance asking utilities to report gas leaks within the city, and they had to be reported to the clerk's office.

348
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent out a round of letters, didn't get a response.

349
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:29,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So then last year, I sent out another round of letters, and I got a response from one utility that said federal law says we don't even have to respond to this because there's a whole different standard for utilities, and they're governed by federal law more than state law, and they don't even have to respond to municipal legislative inquiries.

350
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm about to send out this year's letters, but I'm going to get the same response.

351
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:34,388
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to.

352
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:37,416
[SPEAKER_08]: allow permits.

353
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:42,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's very simple, like, what's good for the goose?

354
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:47,309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if I could to that point, I've had some good conversations.

355
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe the clerk and I and, and the engineer had a conversation in the hall a couple weeks ago.

356
00:34:52,856 --> 00:34:53,938
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically where we're at.

357
00:34:55,208 --> 00:35:05,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So things are not being issued until backlogs of promised repairs and maintenance begin to happen is essentially my understanding.

358
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:12,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go beyond the scope of a short, informal conversation versus what I agree with the motion to have a full conversation.

359
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:14,035
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know.

360
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:21,435
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my understanding of where we're at, certainly with our friends at National Grid.

361
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:30,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I don't think the MWRA and others are of the same scope, but I'll leave it at that.

362
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:39,246
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also, and I'm trying to find it in here, there is some stuff in the, there's some provisions in the,

363
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:48,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Municipal Empowerment Act proposed by the governor regarding

364
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,730
[SPEAKER_02]: some accountability for the utility companies.

365
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have just been double poles.

366
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:05,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to find it right now, but it would give the city more authority around double pole enforcement.

367
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:10,954
[SPEAKER_02]: The section allows cities and towns to enforce the statutory prohibition on double poles.

368
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:14,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Penalties authorized to be imposed are limited to $1,000 per occurrence.

369
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:22,357
[SPEAKER_08]: To that, I believe Councilor Marks spearheaded that process, and I don't believe we have many double polls left.

370
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:23,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's probably true.

371
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:36,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that with that announcement, I think Councilor Marks was very proactive with making sure, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that all of the double polls have been

372
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:38,799
[SPEAKER_08]: converted back to the single pole.

373
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:46,462
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's get an idea, maybe ask, I think, I think, Mr. Randazzo might be the person to ask, you know, I'd be happy to.

374
00:36:46,482 --> 00:36:55,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just pulling this up, because I couldn't remember if it was just double poles, or if there was a more expansive state law around giving us a little bit more authority over the utilities.

375
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:57,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's just double poles.

376
00:36:57,387 --> 00:37:01,789
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny because when we asked the gas company, I think the, uh, was it Harvard street?

377
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:07,192
[SPEAKER_08]: We had the issues with some serious, uh, high level, uh, gas leaks.

378
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:11,594
[SPEAKER_08]: They were pretty forthcoming with the report of how many we had.

379
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:20,559
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think it was really meant to poke the bear, but it was really made for just, uh, information gathering.

380
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:24,021
[SPEAKER_08]: So we stay at the top of things with the neighbors that called.

381
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:24,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

382
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:27,622
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little alarming that the utilities would say that, though.

383
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:28,662
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty disheartening.

384
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

385
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:33,424
[SPEAKER_09]: So there, yes, Councilor Lazzaro?

386
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:51,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean to interrupt you, but I do think that if we can, as this active council now sort of pick up the work that's been done without replicating it and carry it forward, I think that's really important and keep staying on top of the utility companies as

387
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:54,219
[SPEAKER_10]: as we move through this term.

388
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's really important.

389
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be happy to do that, or I don't know if Ken's script probably fills that part.

390
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:04,042
[SPEAKER_10]: You do have the institutional knowledge.

391
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:07,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd be eager to do that.

392
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:18,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I wouldn't want to waste the energy of like, if somebody's been doing it, and this kind of the double pole thing is already covered, and stuff that has been discussed is, you know.

393
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:20,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can pull old papers back

394
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:34,419
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think maybe bringing in the representatives that we work with, with especially National Grid, was super, super helpful when we had the Harvard Street issue.

395
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:45,281
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe just having an open conversation with one of their leaders to say that might have been policy sent from a letter, but more of a personal level, maybe there's a way that we can get some information that we need.

396
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:50,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, like once people are just talking to each other, it's not, it doesn't need to be contentious.

397
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:53,663
[SPEAKER_10]: You can just give us the information you have and we can go from there.

398
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:54,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

399
00:38:56,151 --> 00:39:07,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli has a motion on the floor and as we read it back, if you wanna, no, no, just let me know if you think it makes any sense to add in something about the moratorium and how often it is broken.

400
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:10,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go ahead and read that back.

401
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:23,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli moved to ask the city engineer for what the utility standards are for utilities open to streets and for private residents who meet the streets open for work on their water lines and other issues.

402
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:29,667
[SPEAKER_08]: for the engineer, motion for the engineer.

403
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:34,368
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea is the discrepancy between the utilities, what the utilities have to do, what private residents have to do.

404
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:35,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Just understanding the policy.

405
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the first thing.

406
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:39,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we understand the policy, then I think we can move on something to this committee.

407
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:41,049
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

408
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Councilor Lazzaro had maybe something that.

409
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:50,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to have a second for this motion?

410
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:51,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a second.

411
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:53,632
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to second that too.

412
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:55,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

413
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:00,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

414
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:02,840
[SPEAKER_09]: We can always add my stuff as a different motion or something.

415
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:03,381
That's fine.

416
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:04,962
[SPEAKER_02]: My little joke gavel.

417
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:08,665
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the blow up ones.

418
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:13,249
[SPEAKER_05]: One that goes, eek, eek.

419
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:14,911
[SPEAKER_05]: The squeaky ones.

420
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:18,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, when we get to the budget, it'll feel like that for all of us.

421
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:22,477
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll all be wearing big red noses.

422
00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:25,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Any more discussion on the Councilor Scarapelli's motion?

423
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:27,543
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

424
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:27,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

425
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:28,804
[SPEAKER_09]: All opposed?

426
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

427
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:36,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, we are near the end here.

428
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:40,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have a motion?

429
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you?

430
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:54,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I need a motion to say that I and I would move to, let's see, I would move to lead the oversight and engagement of public utility accountability.

431
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,401
[SPEAKER_10]: with Councilor Scarpelli.

432
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:00,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I'll make that motion.

433
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:03,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So moved.

434
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:04,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a second?

435
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:06,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't, I don't know what it was.

436
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:21,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to co-lead the oversight and engagement of public utility accountability with Councilor Scarpelli.

437
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

438
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:27,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded.

439
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:28,331
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Councilor.

440
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:28,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Already?

441
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:35,695
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to do it.

442
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:45,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a second.

443
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to read that back, and then we'll take a vote?

444
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:49,281
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a discussion and vote.

445
00:41:51,562 --> 00:41:53,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro moved to decode.

446
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:59,440
[SPEAKER_05]: for the oversight and engagement of public utility accountability with Councilor Scarpella.

447
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,520
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a second from Councilor Scarpella.

448
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Any discussion?

449
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:05,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

450
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:05,761
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

451
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:06,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

452
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:07,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

453
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:08,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

454
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:13,324
[SPEAKER_09]: The final thing on our list is simply the tree planting volunteer network.

455
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:18,389
[SPEAKER_09]: That is really something that we're at a very early phase.

456
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:30,803
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just at the point of like talking to city staff and kind of seeing, you know, they're like talking to city staff and also looking at what other cities have done just to get an idea.

457
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:35,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not, I think, at the point of any kind of an ordinance or taking action.

458
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: So the idea is that the city would allow certain volunteers, residents to, with training, with the proper placement, with the proper trees, with the proper depth, and with all the training to be enabled to participate in the planting of certain city trees.

459
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:12,400
[SPEAKER_08]: just I know that just probably having the union president involved and making sure that that's the biggest issue we talk about any sort of volunteer work, especially when it comes to DPW.

460
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember that.

461
00:43:14,701 --> 00:43:17,383
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of the time, it's not a big deal.

462
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:21,206
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that even cleaning up behind the high school, remember the hill?

463
00:43:22,106 --> 00:43:33,569
[SPEAKER_08]: And we came in with about three teams full of kids that wanted to clean that area, and just making sure that DPW gets paid overtime to do that, just we're informed and they understand.

464
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:40,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that it's ever been a problem, but I think it's something that just they want to be part of the information.

465
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:48,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So whenever we do anything with volunteering, I think making sure we have that as a priority just to make sure that they're in the loop.

466
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:50,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, wonderful.

467
00:43:50,578 --> 00:44:12,619
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think also that as a, like if this becomes something of a resolution or who knows what exactly it will become, that it will be for, it's kind of stopgap measure, that the purpose really is to have a larger tree planting crew, but that at the moment, while we are dealing with budgetary difficulties, that this might be able to help us to increase our tree canopy.

468
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,921
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears?

469
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:22,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, just 2 things 1 on this topic, you know, we have, we have seen some very, very targeted increase in the forestry department.

470
00:44:22,896 --> 00:44:26,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we added 2 tree climbers last budget.

471
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a ton, but a little bit of movement there.

472
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:30,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I know.

473
00:44:30,723 --> 00:44:45,756
[SPEAKER_02]: and Representative Donato and the administration and I were able to pull together a bunch of money for tree planting and stump removal last year, a combination of CDBG, state ARPA earmark, a little bit of bonding that we did.

474
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:49,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been some movement on this.

475
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:51,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other thing I wanted to add was I just wanted to note

476
00:44:52,441 --> 00:45:02,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I put it in as there's a paper and committee holdover from actually now three councils ago 19-554 is a resolution to add noise barriers along Route 93.

477
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:06,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually was a resolution offered by Councilor Scarpelli end of 2019.

478
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:11,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It is you handed out the the item report.

479
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:12,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Chair Callahan.

480
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:13,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to note

481
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,902
[SPEAKER_02]: that's still in committee that has not been done.

482
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:25,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe we were on some emails with Rep Donato in 2020 or 2021 about an update, but we were still very far down the list.

483
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

484
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:27,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

485
00:45:38,789 --> 00:46:01,791
[SPEAKER_02]: panels then yeah but then it fell apart so it again was still in yeah that's still going and they ripped all the trees down so there's even less really it's even worse now yeah so that whole fountain street area all the way up to gillis field all the way down to salem street rotary really and down from the river something rotary to the river quite frankly could use it too but um

486
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:13,994
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny if you go down the road further to more affluent communities, they have the soundproof barriers all the way down 128 supporting their city.

487
00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:15,696
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little disheartening.

488
00:46:16,216 --> 00:46:22,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, and that's not Councilor Donato, I mean, Representative Donato, he worked his tail off to get what we have right now.

489
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:26,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we first did 93, when they first did the 93 project,

490
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:32,706
[SPEAKER_08]: They, for some reason, they asked for it on that side of the highway.

491
00:46:33,426 --> 00:46:36,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But for some reason, we didn't ask for it on this side of the highway.

492
00:46:36,607 --> 00:46:37,807
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the biggest issue.

493
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:44,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, but when I worked at the transportation department, he called me and asked me.

494
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:46,249
[SPEAKER_08]: He called everyone.

495
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody have an idea for what is the next step for this?

496
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:54,313
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just wanted to note that it's, it's, it's still there.

497
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:59,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not on the governing agenda, but it is a paper and committee that has been held over as an active paper from prior councils.

498
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:05,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it might be something we can ask the state representative just to get us an update.

499
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:06,797
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I don't think it's.

500
00:47:07,537 --> 00:47:11,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think he's pulled every rabbit out of every hat to try to make it work.

501
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:12,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

502
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:17,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you know, if I won the megabucks, that was one of the things on my list.

503
00:47:17,803 --> 00:47:18,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

504
00:47:18,823 --> 00:47:20,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, $500 million gets you a lot.

505
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to buy me a house first.

506
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:22,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I already bought that.

507
00:47:23,186 --> 00:47:24,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, already?

508
00:47:24,726 --> 00:47:24,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

509
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:25,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Already.

510
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:32,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to live under a solar panel at the Scarpelli residence.

511
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:35,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Butler Street, rear.

512
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:49,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other public comment, any discussion of anything else as we've reached the end of our sort of list of things that we hope to cover in this committee?

513
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:01,489
[SPEAKER_09]: What we were just talking about just now.

514
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I apologize.

515
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:09,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, 19-554, resolution to add noise barriers along Route 93.

516
00:48:12,383 --> 00:48:13,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

517
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not formally called.

518
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:15,745
[SPEAKER_09]: It was discussed.

519
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:17,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was not.

520
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:17,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

521
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:18,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It was discussed.

522
00:48:18,786 --> 00:48:20,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not call it from my chair.

523
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:26,670
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on for discussion tonight, but it was meant to, yes, it's a new way of doing the agenda.

524
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of an unfinished business item, but I'm sure we can entertain any comment.

525
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:30,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

526
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:32,132
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had an informal conversation about it.

527
00:48:33,556 --> 00:48:33,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

528
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:34,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

529
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:34,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.

530
00:48:38,737 --> 00:48:39,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

531
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:41,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you state your name and address for the record?

532
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:42,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.

533
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:08,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to congratulate all the new Councilors that were elected, first of all.

534
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:17,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank all the other political figures that ran and spent a lot of time and effort and cash.

535
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:20,539
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank them for trying hard.

536
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I came because on this agenda, it does say 19-554.

537
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:33,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it was six years ago when I brought this up.

538
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:45,340
[SPEAKER_00]: and before that, and it says resolution to add noise barriers along Route 93 on the north side.

539
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:58,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here to correct this because it was done, well, first of all, I should back up to like more than 10 years ago, I believe, when, as you mentioned,

540
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:12,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Donato, the state rep, he had done great things for the city, including getting Chevalier all kinds of seats, and you're speaking about trees, et cetera.

541
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:14,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's had some good clout in the state house.

542
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:29,715
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when he came forward and said, I have the cash in place in order to add a sound barrier on one side only, and that was the west side.

543
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:35,802
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the West Medford side of 93, in my opinion.

544
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:42,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said to him, and he didn't like it.

545
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:50,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Mr. Donato, if you're gonna give it to one child, why not give it to the other side of the Route 93 child?

546
00:50:50,854 --> 00:51:03,261
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made a comment, I don't want to misquote him, but it's something to the effect like, oh, I've had a few complaints from some East side residents on the East Medford side.

547
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:10,586
[SPEAKER_00]: So my reply to him was, I can't see how a few people can sway

548
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:17,816
[SPEAKER_00]: You, as an individual, not to give it to our east side.

549
00:51:19,116 --> 00:51:22,479
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't recollect if there was any comment after the fact.

550
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,180
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, there probably was not.

551
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:33,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was ecstatic to see this on the agenda yesterday, and that's why I am here.

552
00:51:35,086 --> 00:51:37,828
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'd like to see this corrected

553
00:51:41,235 --> 00:51:54,659
[SPEAKER_00]: to state that on the east side of 93, not the north side, because this is west, east is on the opposite side, and it's not north.

554
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Councilor Bears, I believe, mentioned certain areas that should have it.

555
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:08,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe he said, and he's right, where I am near Riverside Avenue, it should start

556
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:17,948
[SPEAKER_00]: not just at Riverside Avenue, further south, about a football field, three, four, 500 feet, probably.

557
00:52:19,488 --> 00:52:37,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we're right on top of the river, on the bridge, behind the Senior Citizen Center, because there's at least five condominium complexes there, and houses on the Ship Ave and Marine Street area, which is, that alone has gotta be,

558
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:40,827
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 units.

559
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:45,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that our clerk actually has some some answers for you.

560
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:51,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I can give you an answer on that at least at least on why it says 93 north as opposed to the east side of the west side.

561
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:52,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

562
00:52:52,310 --> 00:53:03,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because it's because when the petition goes into the transportation department it's identified by the road and so the road is 93 north that which is why which is why the petition goes in that way.

563
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:12,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't make, when you look at the petitions that go into the DOT, it's identified by the road, not by the location on the road.

564
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:16,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Also 93 goes in the opposite direction towards Boston South.

565
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:19,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But South has noise barriers.

566
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:20,772
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could read.

567
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

568
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:47,096
[SPEAKER_02]: if I could I just have it here the full resolution from 2019 was be it resolved that the city administration looking to adding noise barriers along route 93 on the north side to mirror what is on the south side of route 93 and I believe it if something we're saying it's it's 93 north and 93 south there's barriers on the 93 south side but not on the 93 north side which would be the east side right

569
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:53,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a semantics by my mentality.

570
00:53:53,642 --> 00:53:56,744
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's worded properly to satisfy the Department of Transportation.

571
00:53:56,764 --> 00:54:01,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you that that that the 93 North is on the east side.

572
00:54:01,147 --> 00:54:03,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a pretty good compass rose in my head.

573
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:05,070
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know my directions quite well.

574
00:54:06,572 --> 00:54:09,675
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, who wrote up the resolution?

575
00:54:09,695 --> 00:54:12,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it state where it starts and where it finishes?

576
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:15,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I was councilor Scarpelli in 2019, not to put it anywhere.

577
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:18,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it state where this barrier would start and where it finishes?

578
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:19,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not.

579
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:23,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Who makes that determination, us?

580
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:29,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, unfortunately, I think that the reason this has been stalled for six years is because it's really up to the state.

581
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:32,396
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not something that we can decide and our administration can implement.

582
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:42,638
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole federal formula involved with noise barriers.

583
00:54:42,718 --> 00:54:48,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little rusty on it because it's been a while since I did that when I was on the transportation side of things for the state.

584
00:54:49,363 --> 00:55:04,035
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's an entire federal formula involving traffic and age of the road and how recently it was updated and when it's scheduled to be updated again or when it's scheduled to be overhauled or repaired again.

585
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:05,336
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole big

586
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:08,697
[SPEAKER_04]: numerical formula goes into play on it.

587
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:13,119
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we know when this, if it ever gets started, when this will start?

588
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:14,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the answer to that one.

589
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

590
00:55:15,741 --> 00:55:18,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you ballpark that timeline?

591
00:55:18,644 --> 00:55:20,305
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we can't because it's really up to the state.

592
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:22,185
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't have any control over it.

593
00:55:22,645 --> 00:55:28,948
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we're suggesting is that we reach out again to our state representatives to ask them for some information, but it's nothing that we are able to.

594
00:55:28,988 --> 00:55:34,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I really would appreciate that for at least half the population of the city, over 30,000 on the east side.

595
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,510
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep getting the short end of the stick.

596
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:36,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

597
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:42,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And we supply more real estate taxes than all the other three sections of Medford combined probably.

598
00:55:43,052 --> 00:55:43,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

599
00:55:44,193 --> 00:55:44,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

600
00:55:45,086 --> 00:55:50,907
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say thank you, but it would be nice if it was done from day one, east meets west.

601
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:52,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantastic.

602
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other public comment?

603
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:55,348
Great.

604
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

605
00:55:58,149 --> 00:56:01,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street, Medford.

606
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:05,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also on the board of directors of the Francis Schreiber Auditorium in Gene Mack Gym.

607
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank the members of the council

608
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:27,573
[SPEAKER_01]: present and past for putting this agenda, the governing agenda together and for kind of revamping the committees and committing to regular scheduled meetings where I can see some potential for a lot of productive work to be done.

609
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:31,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited about this particular committee.

610
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:43,459
[SPEAKER_01]: As was mentioned, Shibaiya Theater has a lot of needs, many of which there's no really dedicated funding source to address them.

611
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:45,720
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shibaiya Commission's

612
00:56:46,860 --> 00:57:07,954
[SPEAKER_01]: capital improvements committee was recently reconstituted and as probably 25 items on a on a capital plan project list that we're starting to look for funding for them as Council President Bears mentioned we have the facilities director now on hand for 13 months has had a very

613
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:23,935
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed introduction to the facilities particularly Shabir and I think his insight now into what would be most useful to have in the budget to enable us to kind of catch up on things that haven't been addressed and also put in the budget.

614
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:31,400
[SPEAKER_01]: funds for preventive maintenance so we're not, you know, kind of chasing problems and doing things in a reactive fashion.

615
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:44,807
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just really want to say that the commission, the friends, the arts community is very eager to contribute and participate and give insight and support to this effort.

616
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:51,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the capital improvements plan that came out a year or two ago actually didn't mention Cheballier at all and that was

617
00:57:52,441 --> 00:58:10,247
[SPEAKER_01]: disappointing to see, so I think we can correct that here by looking at the facility holistically, and I think this will be a very useful exercise, and I look forward to being engaged, and thank you again for putting this out.

618
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:11,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.

619
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:12,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

620
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:13,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ken.

621
00:58:14,629 --> 00:58:19,671
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, yeah, and I just want to mention, yeah, there's, and this is where it's kind of,

622
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:35,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the crux of this whole issue around facilities and streets and sidewalks, we have a capital improvement plan or investment plan, whatever the acronym stands for.

623
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:53,382
[SPEAKER_02]: that is not attached to, at least in a way that I can meaningfully see, and if I or we cannot meaningfully see it, I would guess that most cannot meaningfully see it, to the assessments, pavement management plan assessment, the sidewalk assessment, and then the yet-to-be-completed facilities assessment.

624
00:58:53,402 --> 00:59:00,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it's, I think I said this when the call-in center was on, the call-in center was like, oh, well, that's impossible, basically.

625
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:03,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that can't be impossible.

626
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:04,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just math.

627
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:13,971
[SPEAKER_02]: to say, okay, yes, so we're investing a hundred whatever million over the next six years of capital improvements, great.

628
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:17,392
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does that accomplish?

629
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:21,493
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of the actual need does that get us down the road to fixing?

630
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:32,015
[SPEAKER_02]: How, what does that, and what are we getting from that investment where we're bringing something to state of good repair, where we're not spending good money after bad, or we're not being penny smart and pound foolish.

631
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:35,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, again, just where the real frustration for me comes in is,

632
00:59:36,636 --> 00:59:55,112
[SPEAKER_02]: great we're spending you know it's we all we can all say it's the same thing i think i said the other night about the budget it's the biggest budget ever of course it's the biggest budget ever inflation is the highest it's ever been everything costs more than it's ever cost before every sequential budget better be the biggest budget ever otherwise we just cut a bunch of stuff

633
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same question here.

634
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,474
[SPEAKER_02]: We're spending $140 million on capital improvements.

635
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:00,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

636
01:00:01,234 --> 01:00:05,436
[SPEAKER_02]: If we need $2 billion, then we're getting 5% of the way over five years.

637
01:00:05,516 --> 01:00:08,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll take us 100 years to get there, which means we'll never get there.

638
01:00:09,178 --> 01:00:13,159
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry to rant, but thank you, Madam Chair.

639
01:00:13,299 --> 01:00:15,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm missing my position down here on the floor.

640
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:20,082
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, all rants aside, cut you off, President Perkins.

641
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:23,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been up at the podium all month.

642
01:00:23,243 --> 01:00:23,703
[SPEAKER_02]: All rants aside.

643
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get it all out.

644
01:00:27,697 --> 01:00:29,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any other discussion?

645
01:00:29,938 --> 01:00:30,538
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's not.

646
01:00:30,598 --> 01:00:34,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone move to adjourn?

647
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins is not here, so.

648
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:43,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping the leadership team happy.

649
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:44,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

650
01:00:45,906 --> 01:00:46,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

651
01:00:46,126 --> 01:00:48,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Zach Bears.

652
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:49,187
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

653
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:49,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

654
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:50,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

655
01:00:50,728 --> 01:00:51,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

656
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:52,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much to everyone.

657
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:54,430
[SPEAKER_09]: See you all next month.
