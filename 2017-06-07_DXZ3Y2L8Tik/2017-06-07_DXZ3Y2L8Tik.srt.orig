32
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:28,198
[SPEAKER_10]: To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis Mass, dear Mr. President and City Councilors,

33
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:44,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $49,000 for Riverbend Contamination LSP services.

34
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:47,828
[SPEAKER_10]: The balance in certified cash prior to this vote is $8,239,329.

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, will be present to answer any questions.

36
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:04,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

37
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:04,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Hunt, please.

38
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:10,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please note Mr. Counselor Scott Pelley's presence.

39
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

40
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:19,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, 41 Watson Street, Medford.

41
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:27,366
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure how much background is helpful for the council.

42
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:39,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you all received the press release that was sent out about a month ago, that contamination lead was found in the soil at Riverbend Park, that part of the park has been fenced off.

43
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And in order to take the fencing down, we need to do a series of testing.

44
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, there's a weird echo on the mic.

45
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:52,593
[SPEAKER_12]: To do a series of testing, borings to

46
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:57,933
[SPEAKER_12]: understand just how deep the contamination goes, what the contamination is, and the extent of it.

47
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:03,935
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we can have a solution developed, depending on exactly what is there.

48
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:17,358
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to get that moving, so you will see there is money actually in my budget for next fiscal year to continue with this program of moving this project forward.

49
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:22,459
[SPEAKER_12]: However, the question that everybody wants to know is how soon can we take that fence down?

50
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:40,064
[SPEAKER_12]: And in order to take it down soonest, we want to begin the work with our LSP, the testing and the reporting as soon as possible so that we can determine what the solution is and then come back and say, here's what the solution, here's what we're recommending to do.

51
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:47,747
[SPEAKER_12]: But we basically didn't want to wait until July to get started on this, but really get started as soon as possible.

52
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:48,835
[SPEAKER_12]: on this work.

53
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know how long it'll take to actually do the testing?

54
00:03:55,078 --> 00:04:00,501
[SPEAKER_12]: So he said it would be about, he'd be out there like two to three days with the equipment.

55
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,801
[SPEAKER_12]: They're actually going to do borings.

56
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:06,844
[SPEAKER_12]: They have to go down 15 feet, but they would be small borings.

57
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:13,527
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it would take about on the order of two weeks to get the test results back.

58
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:20,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's also a series of reports that have to happen at certain prescribed times with the state.

59
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

61
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

62
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:25,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nice.

63
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:26,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

64
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:27,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

65
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:28,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt, thank you for being here this evening.

66
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:35,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if you can explain to us a little bit about what the contaminants are in the ground there and what you're aware of the contaminants in the ground right there.

67
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:39,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause apparently it sounds like you're going to have to do a little bit more research to figure out exactly what we're dealing with.

68
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:40,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one.

69
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:41,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two,

70
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:55,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping you can also explain to the council a little bit as to whether or not this need for funding is in direct correlation to the extension of the Clippership Connector, or if this is work that would be done regardless of whether or not the Clippership Connector project was in the design stages.

71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:06,324
[SPEAKER_12]: So to begin with the first question about the contamination, what we found there when we did testing was lead and a small amount of arsenic.

72
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:15,429
[SPEAKER_12]: So we know that that is there, and we know that that is spread at the surface level throughout this area, which is why it's fenced off.

73
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,091
[SPEAKER_12]: When we say surface level, we mean the top eight inches of the dirt.

74
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:24,233
[SPEAKER_12]: So they take testing in the top eight inches, and they consider that to be the surface.

75
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,457
[SPEAKER_12]: There could be other contaminants there.

76
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,558
[SPEAKER_12]: We honestly don't know where it's from.

77
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:36,720
[SPEAKER_12]: There are speculations around the fact that clipper ships used to be built here, and they used lead in the painting of those.

78
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,400
[SPEAKER_12]: But we don't actually know.

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:50,763
[SPEAKER_12]: And part of this is once you know that there's some contamination, in order to design an appropriate remediation plan, you have to understand the full extent, the depth, what it is.

80
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:54,804
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll do a full suite of tests for more than just lead at that location.

81
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:57,367
[SPEAKER_12]: to look at the whole area.

82
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Your second question was about the clipper ship.

83
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:03,269
[SPEAKER_12]: So none of this actually had anything to do with the clipper ship connector.

84
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And another question that I have, Mr. President, this will be it for me.

85
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:15,414
[SPEAKER_07]: In the area that we're discussing here, was any of this surface level dirt, or was this any of this dirt disrupted to make it surface level dirt?

86
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:18,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there any digging excavation work or anything like that going on there that made this

87
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:22,246
[SPEAKER_07]: contaminated product come up to surface level?

88
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:34,069
[SPEAKER_12]: That was my first original gut question because we did what's called two test pits in that area where we did dig deeply and we tested that soil in preparation for a different project.

89
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:39,270
[SPEAKER_12]: We were going to do a green infrastructure project, a project to clean stormwater that we had a grant for.

90
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we did dig down to about seven feet and tested.

91
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,212
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where actually we first saw the lead.

92
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,312
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when

93
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:52,940
[SPEAKER_12]: that occurred, the state said to us, you now need to test this whole area, the whole surface.

94
00:06:53,401 --> 00:07:11,312
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that there are two areas about this big, but the practice of the way the test works when they come back and they do surface level is they did a grid of 35 test locations throughout this entire section of the park.

95
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:16,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And they actively avoided those two spots of turned up dirt

96
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,700
[SPEAKER_12]: because they knew that that was dirt that had been surfaced by those test pits.

97
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:25,583
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is testing from 35 locations throughout this entire section.

98
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, did you have a second question on that?

99
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:37,830
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it safe to say that the state is going to be requiring us to test and remediate this situation regardless of what's going on in the area?

100
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

101
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,511
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's exactly it.

102
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:44,314
[SPEAKER_12]: So as soon as we realized that there was lead in those two test pits,

103
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:47,903
[SPEAKER_12]: We said, we cannot afford, we can't do this green infrastructure here.

104
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:49,464
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a good location for it.

105
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:51,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we suspended that project.

106
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:57,928
[SPEAKER_12]: But the state, we actually had to tell them that we had found lead because of the levels.

107
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:05,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they were the ones, the State Department of Environmental Protection, that said, here's where we want you to test.

108
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:06,973
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the grid we want you to do.

109
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,334
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the area we want you to test.

110
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We gave them the results from the surface level testing.

111
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,694
[SPEAKER_12]: They're the ones who said you must put up a fence, you must put up a sign that says contamination and keep out.

112
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:26,921
[SPEAKER_12]: You must now do this boring, this more extensive looking at the thing.

113
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:35,608
[SPEAKER_12]: They can spread this work out over many years, but it is our desire to not have a portion of one of our public parks fenced off for many years.

114
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:39,911
[SPEAKER_12]: So we would like to move the project forward as quickly as we can.

115
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:43,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And not wait for, it's part of Riverbend Park.

116
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:48,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And this part, I did bring picture maps in case anybody wasn't sure.

117
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,076
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be very helpful.

118
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:50,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

119
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:21,968
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you look at this picture, and this was up on the city's website, it went out as a press release, you can see the River Bend Yacht Club is at one end of the property at Ship Ave.

120
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:39,101
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this area, so for people who are not looking at this picture, I would tell you that if you were standing at the Andrews School and looking at it, and decided to walk down the right side of the school towards the river, so past its loading dock towards the river down that path,

121
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:44,123
[SPEAKER_12]: All of this is to the right of that asphalt path, to the right of the soccer fields.

122
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,910
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got condos there with big white fences.

123
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,715
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the white fences are essentially the property line.

124
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:56,881
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this is the area between those fences and the river.

125
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:02,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't have any active recreation on it, like no kind of play equipment.

126
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:09,408
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is, we've been told by the condo residents that they use it for their children to play back there.

127
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:23,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know, we've observed huge numbers of people cut through there on bicycles, with dogs, with strollers, off of Ship Ave and into River Bend Park and vice versa through there.

128
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,438
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can even, in that photo,

129
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:30,110
[SPEAKER_12]: see like a dirt path, that's been made by people who walk through that area.

130
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:36,034
[SPEAKER_12]: People from that neighborhood are quite upset that they're not supposed to walk through that right now.

131
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:40,116
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's part of why we'd like to move it forward quickly.

132
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:44,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And if, Mr. President, I could just ask the Director of Public Health, Ms.

133
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:48,321
[SPEAKER_07]: O'Connor, if she could explain some of the health risks that are associated with this type of contamination.

134
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,835
[SPEAKER_07]: what her office's position is relative to the record.

135
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:52,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

136
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:56,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Mary Ann O'Connor, the Director of the Board of Health for the City of Medford.

137
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:58,859
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

138
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,520
[SPEAKER_22]: So lead is naturally occurring, right?

139
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:06,043
[SPEAKER_22]: And on most homes that were built before 1980, lead-based paint was used.

140
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:11,566
[SPEAKER_22]: And lead gas was in the air until the 1980s, so there's exhaust.

141
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:16,068
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're going to find in most cities that there is lead contamination.

142
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:25,914
[SPEAKER_22]: Children under six are most susceptible, obviously, to lead poisoning, and that's because their brains and the nervous systems are still producing so.

143
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:31,438
[SPEAKER_22]: But you can get lead poisoning through ingestion and through inhaling.

144
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:41,245
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, with children, you know, the fact that they're playing outside in the dirt, then coming in and eating their lunch and not washing their hands and putting their hands in their mouth, that's where the lead becomes ingested.

145
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:43,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, this particular situation,

146
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:47,706
[SPEAKER_22]: There are certain spots that the lead is higher than others.

147
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:57,413
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, there's variations that contribute to, so the seasonal variations, so when that area is covered with snow, you don't have any worries about being infected by lead.

148
00:11:58,194 --> 00:12:04,018
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have nice grass, which most of the area does have grass, that's another barrier that you don't have to worry about.

149
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:11,324
[SPEAKER_22]: So really what you're concerned about is bare soil and kids playing in that bare soil and then putting their hands in their mouth and ingesting the lead.

150
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, may I rest?

151
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:15,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

152
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate your help and understanding.

153
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Caravaglio.

154
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we just get a breakdown?

155
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:27,999
[SPEAKER_18]: How will the 49,000 be spent and what exactly is that going towards?

156
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,981
[SPEAKER_18]: And what are we looking at for, I'm sure we don't know exactly, but for costs down the line?

157
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,786
[SPEAKER_12]: So I sort of thought you were going to ask that.

158
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:41,147
[SPEAKER_12]: There's several different pieces of it.

159
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:46,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of it actually covers some of the consulting that he's already been doing.

160
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:53,710
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you find an emergency situation like this, your LSP, they're a licensed site professional.

161
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,351
[SPEAKER_12]: So we hire them, but they hold a license like many other professionals do.

162
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:03,732
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have to do the right thing and not what their client necessarily wants them to do.

163
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:11,351
[SPEAKER_12]: So they come out and they start helping us with the testing, with the immediate response action.

164
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:19,096
[SPEAKER_12]: We had some of the testing that has already occurred we've paid for, but then some of this consulting that's going to go into the reporting.

165
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,417
[SPEAKER_12]: They monitored us putting up the fence.

166
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,900
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been having communications with DEP.

167
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:32,104
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of that has already, some of it's happened, but there's, I'm going to get it.

168
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:33,725
[SPEAKER_18]: How much did we expend so far?

169
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:35,432
[SPEAKER_12]: He hasn't actually billed us.

170
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:42,434
[SPEAKER_12]: He's basically said, you know, I know that, you know, frankly, if he has to bill us in July for it, he will.

171
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:45,775
[SPEAKER_12]: But the preference would be to really get this moving.

172
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:49,075
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want to delay this entire project.

173
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:54,816
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, sorry, I should have had it called up already.

174
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.

175
00:13:57,117 --> 00:14:01,758
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's, I'm afraid to speak to the numbers off the top of my head, even though

176
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:03,454
[SPEAKER_12]: I know most of them.

177
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:14,016
[SPEAKER_12]: There's $12,000 for the report, the immediate response outcome report that is due at the end of June.

178
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:21,858
[SPEAKER_12]: There's $4,000 for the consulting that goes into doing that report.

179
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:30,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Then there is two days of drilling assessment, all the labor, laboratory analysis, equipment, groundwater sampling, and well survey.

180
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's $27,000 and change.

181
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,573
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an IRA status report that's due August 22nd.

182
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:41,414
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's an immediate risk report that's due at the end of June.

183
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:44,056
[SPEAKER_12]: There's another report that's due at the end of August.

184
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:44,697
[SPEAKER_12]: That's $4,500.

185
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:50,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so that those two, the 27 and 45 are 31,586.

186
00:14:50,580 --> 00:15:00,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other, uh, sorry, what numbers that I don't have in front of me where his original quotes to us.

187
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:10,255
[SPEAKER_18]: So the 49,000 is really just to figure out what we've done so far and to figure out the extent of it once we drill down to the level that we need.

188
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:14,396
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the characterization of the extent of the problem.

189
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:19,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Once we are clear on that, then we will work on developing a solution.

190
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,738
[SPEAKER_12]: And everybody wants to know, so what are you going to do about it?

191
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:25,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's the natural, I want to know, what are we going to do about it?

192
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:30,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when I've talked to him about it, there are truly two things you can do with lead.

193
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:34,505
[SPEAKER_12]: and that is you can remove it or you can cover it.

194
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:43,152
[SPEAKER_12]: If this was a different location and we wanted a paved basketball court, that would be great.

195
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,113
[SPEAKER_12]: We would pave it.

196
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,714
[SPEAKER_12]: We would put a nice coating over it.

197
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:46,735
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be wonderful.

198
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,837
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not doing that next to the river here, unfortunately.

199
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:59,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Removing this amount of soil and disposing of it, because it's lead-contaminated, is probably going to be cost-prohibitive, although we've been talking about some ideas

200
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,052
[SPEAKER_12]: of mixing stuff to make it, make that you could do that.

201
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:13,658
[SPEAKER_12]: What we'd really like to do is maybe remove some of it, put down a barrier layer, and then put clean fill on top of it.

202
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:23,144
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually we probably have clean fill up at the cemetery that we could use and would be a lovely way to dispose of the excess soil up there.

203
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:26,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Whether that's enough or not, we don't know.

204
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,767
[SPEAKER_12]: But that also has,

205
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,881
[SPEAKER_12]: complications that we would need to go to Conservation Commission.

206
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,224
[SPEAKER_12]: They will need to approve it, because it's right next to the river.

207
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,545
[SPEAKER_12]: This is probably going down to the river's edge.

208
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:44,769
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's people's yards, so you can't just raise the level of the dirt and have water run into their yards.

209
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:50,033
[SPEAKER_12]: So there would need to be engineering to look at it to figure out what's the best way to do this.

210
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:55,957
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's kind of what we're hoping, that we'll take some out, we'll cover it, we'll put some clean stuff down.

211
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:58,259
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you asked about the clipper ship connector,

212
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:09,615
[SPEAKER_12]: This part, frankly, putting a 10 foot wide path in would be just an area where we wouldn't need as much fill or it would be easier to cover for this section here behind these condos.

213
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,596
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's not part of this project.

214
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,437
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the information Councilor Knight?

215
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:20,500
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my understanding that the design phases of the Clippership connector have not been completed yet.

216
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:20,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

217
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:25,224
[SPEAKER_07]: there's now an assumption that it's going to go back behind this residence?

218
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:30,009
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is perhaps I should be clear, not one of the areas where it's disputed.

219
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:37,135
[SPEAKER_12]: If you see the dirt path in the ground there, those residents in general want to know when could we pay pave a path?

220
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:42,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them have strong reservations about where the other parts of the path are going to go.

221
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:47,265
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't feel it's right to disrupt neighborhoods for their neighbors, but

222
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,791
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't actually object to it back here for the most part.

223
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,633
[SPEAKER_12]: There have been a few neighbors who've said they don't understand.

224
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:59,798
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can see from that dirt path that people walk through there constantly.

225
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,740
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been out there now because of the contamination and the rain.

226
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are people walking their dogs and biking through there in the rain, even on the nice, not just the nice days.

227
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,441
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is it.

228
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say it's not in design.

229
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:19,145
[SPEAKER_12]: This is part of the location where the intention has always been to connect into Riverbend Park.

230
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:27,170
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, there is a design meeting on Thursday night at the Andrews School.

231
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:38,456
[SPEAKER_12]: So people who have interest or concerns or questions about the Clippership Connector, this Thursday at 7 o'clock at the Andrews School is a meeting that the DCR is organizing.

232
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be there.

233
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:42,899
[SPEAKER_12]: and the consultants, the design consultants are going to be there.

234
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:43,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

235
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Lococo.

236
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you just explain the 35 test locations?

237
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Was there lead found at every single one?

238
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Not at every single one, but at a liberal distribution of them.

239
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:03,985
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was no ability to say, well, it's not at this end, it's not in this corner.

240
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,927
[SPEAKER_12]: They were done in a grid fashion, and it seemed fairly random.

241
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:13,630
[SPEAKER_12]: as to where the levels were higher or lower, there was no clear pattern to it.

242
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:19,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything in that white, they were distributed throughout that white area.

243
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,136
[SPEAKER_18]: So then did we test further down, obviously?

244
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:29,261
[SPEAKER_12]: We did not test on the other side of the asphalt sidewalk there, the path.

245
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:30,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Right here.

246
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:37,447
[SPEAKER_12]: So outside, so I think that line should be following the asphalt path that goes down between the fields.

247
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,357
[SPEAKER_12]: and this area.

248
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:49,219
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the area from the asphalt path in has been part of testing that occurred when those schools were built.

249
00:19:49,779 --> 00:20:02,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was actually a response action outcome in 1999 that determined it was a small amount of arsenic in that it was not of any kind of concern and it was closed out.

250
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:07,062
[SPEAKER_12]: So because of that, DEPF did not ask us to test

251
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,297
[SPEAKER_12]: on the other side of that path.

252
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:14,198
[SPEAKER_18]: What are the cost estimates for this lodge of a piece of property with contamination?

253
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,039
[SPEAKER_18]: Any of the three options, I guess.

254
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:22,440
[SPEAKER_12]: We have not really asked him for cost estimates yet, because he keeps saying it's premature.

255
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,101
[SPEAKER_12]: If we find something else in there, it might change the answers.

256
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:33,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Frankly, in order to get cost estimates, you have to do a bunch of engineering and design work, and that costs money.

257
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:37,443
[SPEAKER_12]: So he really needs us to say, here's the plan.

258
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:46,056
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what we want to look at, and then set up a purchase order to pay him to do that kind of engineering and those sorts of estimates.

259
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:47,516
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not an off-the-cuff number.

260
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:53,138
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're looking at the $49,000, then cost for engineering and design, and then the fix.

261
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:54,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

262
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess my last question then, has there been any discussion to test?

263
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:07,443
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, obviously, if there's just a small sidewalk, you would potentially argue that there may be lead.

264
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:11,016
[SPEAKER_18]: or arsenic in the lower section?

265
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:11,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to?

266
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:12,436
[SPEAKER_12]: On the other side.

267
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:14,857
[SPEAKER_18]: On the other side of the sidewalk.

268
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:18,498
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right behind the, I'm assuming, I believe this is the school right here.

269
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,158
[SPEAKER_12]: And so those are the soccer fields, right?

270
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:22,339
[SPEAKER_12]: That path runs down along the soccer fields.

271
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,580
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you also see the soccer fields, for those of you who are familiar with them, are raised up.

272
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,181
[SPEAKER_12]: We understand that clean fill was brought in to that area.

273
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:33,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, they did testing in 1999.

274
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:38,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to tell you, my heart is always torn in a situation like this.

275
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:43,671
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not want it to cost the city more money, because that's just money that can be used for other things.

276
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:49,054
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm the environmental director, and I want us to deal with any problems that are out there.

277
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:53,217
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm not really trying to go looking for problems.

278
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:55,318
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a tough situation.

279
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:59,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, you're probably talking to the wrong person.

280
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:05,295
[SPEAKER_18]: three young kids, but I would just, through the chair, I mean, I would request that we do some testing.

281
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:28,988
[SPEAKER_18]: There's soccer fields, kids are there all the time, and it is pretty well grasped, but there are a number of kids in the back of the school where I'm not sure if they have recess, that some testing, and we need, because we can't do all this work and then just come to find lead a couple of years later, find the school, and when we could have done it all,

282
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:36,893
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of that, so that area, the other sidewalk was the limit of work for where they did testing in 1999.

283
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:45,255
[SPEAKER_12]: We have copies of those reports where they found a little bit of limited arsenic and nothing else.

284
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:49,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where they said it was not enough to be of concern to anybody.

285
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:53,736
[SPEAKER_12]: And they, uh, the state at that time closed it off.

286
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I wasn't here at that time, but I have copies of those reports in my office.

287
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:00,649
[SPEAKER_12]: and the maps of where they did that testing.

288
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:09,175
[SPEAKER_18]: And health, like Councilor Knight asked about the health concerns with lead, health concerns with arsenic.

289
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:12,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, for children especially.

290
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:13,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

291
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:21,562
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, again, the same concerns about ingesting and the other exposure would have to be over many years.

292
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:26,825
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're walking on it, it would take many, many years of exposure that way.

293
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:27,746
[SPEAKER_22]: And it would do what?

294
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:32,986
[SPEAKER_22]: What would the effect be?

295
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:46,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, in 1999, the state determined that the levels that were there were more like background levels and were not an amount that was going to be of risk to anybody.

296
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,532
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have different levels that they have concerns about depending what the category of use is.

297
00:23:52,992 --> 00:23:54,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it's a backyard, it's one level.

298
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:56,013
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's a park, it's different.

299
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:02,242
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's a parking lot, you know, what's on top of it, you know?

300
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:04,944
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they approved it.

301
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:10,628
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the other side of the pathway for school and park use.

302
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:20,855
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will say that some of the same people from the state have been looking at this and helping us to do some of the research.

303
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:25,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I am thankful to DEP because some of what you need to do, you would hire your consultant to do.

304
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:30,575
[SPEAKER_12]: is the background research on what is at this location, what's been done here in the past.

305
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:39,643
[SPEAKER_12]: And they've actually been doing a bunch of that research for us and feeding us the information so that we don't have to pay the consultant as much to do it.

306
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:40,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

307
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:48,470
[SPEAKER_18]: I would just request that we do some test pourings behind the Andrews Middle School as a condition of the paper.

308
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,671
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it needs to be cleaned up.

309
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:50,331
[SPEAKER_18]: We have homes.

310
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:51,732
[SPEAKER_18]: We have people.

311
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,463
[SPEAKER_18]: living there, going to school there, teaching there.

312
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:58,965
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe the dog park isn't going to be too far away.

313
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:14,794
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we need to just, if there's a problem behind that school where kids are playing soccer six months out of the year, I think we need to at least, I don't know how much the test location costs, 35 test locations, but I think we need to figure it all out at once.

314
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:22,619
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a connected, besides that small pathway, it's a connected piece of green space that I think needs to be handled

315
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,278
[SPEAKER_18]: all at the same time.

316
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:26,779
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, I too, I, I agree with Ms.

317
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,020
[SPEAKER_18]: Hunt.

318
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:39,068
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't want to go looking for problems, but when it comes to thousands of children's children playing on that, on that field, um, I think we need, need to, we owe them to at least investigate a bit.

319
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:39,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

320
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:49,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I just might, so that you're aware, increase the price because they related to the borings.

321
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:52,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I don't have an estimate on that, but it would,

322
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:56,200
[SPEAKER_12]: probably have me requesting additional money.

323
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:12,189
[SPEAKER_12]: They had to, for the two days of the drilling, which is 20 soil borings in this, and four soil borings that are groundwater monitoring wells, and then all the tests that go with that and all that work, that was $27,000.

324
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:22,074
[SPEAKER_18]: But the 35 test locations, I mean, I'm saying, even if we did 10, you know, five, two rows of five along the pathway,

325
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:30,627
[SPEAKER_18]: go in 20 feet, I mean, at least we'll know has passed that pathway, you know, those were the 35, those were the surface testing.

326
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:39,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So those order of $6,000 for 35 foot.

327
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:40,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

328
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:46,133
[SPEAKER_18]: So bring that down by a third, we're talking to grant maybe test 10, seven feet

329
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:58,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have to confirm with them and get an actual quote, but you're right that the surface level testing is much less expensive, which is why we just did it with money that we had available.

330
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:08,378
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think $2,000 is money well spent just for peace of mind and for thousands and thousands of parents that are going to have children.

331
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:14,241
[SPEAKER_18]: So, $19.99, 17 years, do the 10 tests for $2,000 and we have reassurance, but don't do it and you'll never know.

332
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor DelaRusso.

333
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you.

334
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:28,106
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I want to congratulate my colleague for expressing concern for the children back there.

335
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:43,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we should follow, quite frankly, I believe we should follow the schema of testing and not scaling back that will allow us to get a proper sample and do proper statistical study of the land back there.

336
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:46,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're going to do it, we're going to do it right.

337
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:59,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, the people in this neighborhood have been under considerable duress over the whole issue of this Clippership connector, infringements on their property, infringements on the security.

338
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:07,169
[SPEAKER_09]: not having an ample opportunity to discuss and explore questions and not being allowed to speak for themselves.

339
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:14,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I would rather hear from them about their intentions of pathways and where they go rather than anybody else first.

340
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:24,223
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, they're now faced with additional duress in their living space because they're faced with ancient contaminants that have been there from the days of

341
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:30,015
[SPEAKER_09]: masted sailing ships that conducted crimes in our community and around the world.

342
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:38,137
[SPEAKER_09]: This soil is clearly contaminated, the extent to which we'll learn further once we do further testing.

343
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:51,402
[SPEAKER_09]: So to ameliorate and find a plan of action to take care of this poison in the soil and to bring the residents down there to a peace of mind, I support this paper and move approval.

344
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:52,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

345
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:55,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

346
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

347
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:58,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick question.

348
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:06,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia, you just tell us how we notified our neighbors that what was happening and what were the, what could be the outcomes?

349
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:07,516
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we do that?

350
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:16,862
[SPEAKER_12]: So we put together a letter from the mayor's office explaining actually with Mary Ann's contact information,

351
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:23,218
[SPEAKER_12]: because we knew that all of their concerns would be health-related concerns, and I am not appropriate.

352
00:29:23,358 --> 00:29:25,280
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have the background to address the health concerns.

353
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,421
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Mary Ann's office.

354
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:28,142
[SPEAKER_12]: So we put together a letter.

355
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:34,188
[SPEAKER_12]: It was hand-delivered to everybody on Ship Ave.

356
00:29:34,328 --> 00:29:41,634
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have to call up a map to give you the names of the streets, but the two streets there that go out to Riverside Ave.

357
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:44,737
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that side of Riverside Ave as well.

358
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:48,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Those letters were hand-delivered by city staff one afternoon.

359
00:29:48,978 --> 00:29:56,460
[SPEAKER_12]: That same afternoon, it was mailed to those addresses as well, because we don't always trust hand-delivering.

360
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:05,283
[SPEAKER_12]: The mailing went to the property owners, so anything that was hand-delivered would have been picked up by whoever is residing there.

361
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:11,217
[SPEAKER_12]: The mailing was a list from the assessor's office of the property owners in that neighborhood.

362
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:18,119
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there was, we have a lot of email addresses because of the Clippership Connector Project.

363
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:22,680
[SPEAKER_12]: So every email address we had from that area was emailed that notice as well.

364
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:31,822
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we sent it out to the press, put it on the city's website, and put out a Facebook about it so that people in general would know about it.

365
00:30:32,642 --> 00:30:35,523
[SPEAKER_12]: We then followed that up with fencing the area off

366
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,511
[SPEAKER_12]: and putting up signs that say, Dangerous Oil Contamination.

367
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:40,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, perfect.

368
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

369
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:43,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I second that, Mr. President.

370
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:44,653
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll move forward.

371
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

372
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:48,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

373
00:30:48,574 --> 00:31:03,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was mentioned earlier that when we built the schools, the McGlynn and the Andrews School, this city hired an LSP back, I think it was in 1999 or maybe even a year prior to that.

374
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:05,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did extensive boring.

375
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,465
[SPEAKER_08]: and that entire site.

376
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:18,135
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be quite frank, I'm not sure if it includes this little Riverbend Park area here, but I can tell you firsthand that there was extensive boring done.

377
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:23,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And we knew back 20 years ago that there was contaminants of lead and arsenic.

378
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:30,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is no surprise, at least to me, that that area is heavily contaminated with lead and arsenic.

379
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:37,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you mentioned, soil was cotted in to mitigate rather than dig up because of the expense.

380
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:46,018
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to put down at the top level a certain amount that allowed us to use the ballparks, as you mentioned, the soccer fields and so forth.

381
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's happening now is any time we dig or disturb the area, all of a sudden now we're raising up red flags.

382
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:58,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever was being done there, you mentioned there was some digging going on for a new project.

383
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if there was some hindsight there saying, you know what?

384
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:04,394
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an area that we know is contaminated.

385
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:06,636
[SPEAKER_08]: The city is high in an LSP.

386
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:08,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We know it's in the area.

387
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:12,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe before we dig, maybe we should do some due diligence.

388
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:16,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Because any digging down there is going to raise a red flag.

389
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:20,408
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, we're going to be in the same predicament.

390
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:25,653
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question is, if and when this happens,

391
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, how long will it take place?

392
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:31,573
[SPEAKER_12]: How long will which?

393
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:33,955
[SPEAKER_12]: The act of boring?

394
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:35,875
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not the boring, the remediation.

395
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:37,396
[SPEAKER_08]: How long will that take place?

396
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,898
[SPEAKER_12]: So it depends how fast the city moves on it.

397
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:46,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, you can drag this out for years if you want to under state law.

398
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:52,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Our preference would be to do this testing now in June, have results by early July,

399
00:32:53,102 --> 00:33:04,846
[SPEAKER_12]: spend July and August figuring out what a good solution is, and then determine is this a solution we can put in place in the fall, what's the financial cost of it, and how long will it take?

400
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,447
[SPEAKER_12]: We would love to take that fence down and have this fixed by the fall.

401
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:21,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if we can, but the LSP says to me that that is not an irrational hope, that as long as we keep moving on it and don't drop, you know, we theoretically could, also as long as there's no,

402
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,621
[SPEAKER_12]: other surprises that come up, things that he wasn't anticipating.

403
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:36,463
[SPEAKER_12]: There is some concern with when you're right next to the river, how do you properly do things so that you're not completely ruining the ecosystem there?

404
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:46,205
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to look at flood levels and riverbanks and heights and not draining water into people's yards because we've now built up a level.

405
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,726
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a bunch of things that need to be taken into consideration.

406
00:33:50,646 --> 00:33:52,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I could imagine that we would have

407
00:33:52,636 --> 00:34:04,060
[SPEAKER_12]: solutions in the fall and then spend the fall having public meetings and debate as to which solution is the best and the right one, identifying money and then not being able to implement it in the spring.

408
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:16,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, the reason why I asked that question, and I appreciate your response, is that for those of us that have been behind this reel have dealt with the issue in the West Medford parking lot for over three and a half years now.

409
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:20,085
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're finally getting to a point where we're going to remediate the area.

410
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:23,123
[SPEAKER_08]: and a great disruption to the businesses in West Meffitt.

411
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:28,606
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reason why I ask is because, as you mentioned, this is a highly traversed area.

412
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:33,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would hate to see this go on any longer than it has to.

413
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:38,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And I as one member will approve this, but I'd like to see a time frame.

414
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to see something in writing that's gonna say, we're gonna start on this date.

415
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:45,693
[SPEAKER_08]: By then the boring will be done.

416
00:34:45,973 --> 00:34:50,335
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna start August 1st with the choosing of a plan.

417
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,702
[SPEAKER_08]: or sending out a request for proposal for work.

418
00:34:53,282 --> 00:35:07,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have to see a timeframe before we vote on anything because potentially we could be looking at another West Medford Bargain Spot liquor issue that lingers on for three, four, five years in this community, an area that's fenced off, saying contaminants.

419
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:18,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned about the neighbors and so forth, about notification, I think it's important that residents not only know what's going on there,

420
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,646
[SPEAKER_08]: but also have an idea of a timeframe.

421
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:27,810
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not prepared to vote on this unless you're prepared tonight to at least give us some timeframe of the boring.

422
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:29,851
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the process?

423
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:31,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any paperwork in front of me.

424
00:35:31,892 --> 00:35:32,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

425
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,173
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what I asked.

426
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:36,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I've been sort of asking what are the different, where are the bottlenecks?

427
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:42,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so my first thing is that I would need a purchase order in order for the, um,

428
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:45,395
[SPEAKER_12]: consultant to start doing drillings.

429
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:50,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Consulting, giving me advice he's willing to just do, knowing that we'll make him whole eventually.

430
00:35:51,199 --> 00:36:01,426
[SPEAKER_12]: So I asked finance, they said if it was approved tonight, they could have something cut for me by Friday, which would mean that he could mobilize during the last two weeks of June.

431
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:07,730
[SPEAKER_12]: He has to schedule it, but it will either be next week or the week after that, that he could have borings done.

432
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:10,112
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a report that's due June 23rd,

433
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:16,466
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when we have an IRA plan due to DEP that the consultant will work on.

434
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:29,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I would, it's my expectation that if we move at this rate where we are out there in the next two weeks, we will have the results before the 1st of July, and that's when we'll start the planning.

435
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:36,562
[SPEAKER_12]: How long that planning takes will be dependent on what the results of these tests are.

436
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:41,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Depending what the tests are will dramatically change that piece of it.

437
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:51,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So for this first part, I would ask my council colleagues to put a condition that the boring and test results be received by this council by July 1st.

438
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:55,584
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a date that you just said that seems realistic.

439
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:58,965
[SPEAKER_08]: And that way we know the process is going to keep moving.

440
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:02,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that as a condition, Mr. President.

441
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:06,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, my last point is,

442
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:21,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Recently, the community voted by way of election that we created a Community Preservation Act, and that's for open space, community preservation, and a number of issues.

443
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:26,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Could that money be used to work on a project like this?

444
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:30,448
[SPEAKER_12]: I would want to check, but I don't think so.

445
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:36,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't say definitively not, but it's used for improving recreation areas,

446
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:40,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's used for acquiring land.

447
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:51,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've never asked, because before now, before this occurred, the brownfield that we had concern about was a West Bedford parking lot.

448
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would tell you, no, you can't use it.

449
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,521
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a parking lot.

450
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:55,781
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a recreation area.

451
00:37:56,241 --> 00:38:01,582
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will say that I have not actually thought to ask whether we would be able to use that money.

452
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:03,997
[SPEAKER_12]: on something like this?

453
00:38:04,997 --> 00:38:25,008
[SPEAKER_08]: You can ask, but Mr. President, if we can make that part of also the condition that we receive a report back or response from the city solicitor asking whether or not we can use Community Preservation Act to pay for this ongoing process of remediation on this particular site.

454
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:28,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

455
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

456
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a couple of last questions.

457
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, is all of this property, is this all City of Medford property?

458
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:37,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Is any of this property owned by DCR?

459
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:56,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was actually... So, in fact, when we started this project, we were under the impression it was all City of Medford, and it turns out that there is an amount near the Yacht Club, so we thought the border was the line between the gravel and the grass.

460
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:00,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I've actually now had it flagged where the property line is.

461
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:07,122
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had a surveyor out there this week, last week, last week to mark where the property line is.

462
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:14,846
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's about 100 feet in from the Riverside Yacht Club into the park where the DEP property is.

463
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:18,188
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been in DCR.

464
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:27,354
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have been talking with DCR about their property ownership of that 100 feet there and how they want to handle that piece of it.

465
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:33,066
[SPEAKER_12]: We will not be doing any of our borings past that property line.

466
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:34,487
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we had it marked.

467
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:38,408
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're trying to coordinate with DCR that last 100 feet.

468
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:41,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So DCR will hopefully eventually do borings in that area?

469
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:47,250
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm certain that the state DEP will require them to, just like they're requiring us to.

470
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,930
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

471
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:53,240
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as, you mentioned there are two reports, one in June and one in August?

472
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:53,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

473
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:56,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And can we receive copies of both of those when they are?

474
00:39:56,342 --> 00:39:58,183
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to do that.

475
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:03,806
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, they are public reports, so we will submit them to state DEP.

476
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:06,867
[SPEAKER_12]: DEP reviews them, and then they put them on their website.

477
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,048
[SPEAKER_12]: They're available for everybody.

478
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,350
[SPEAKER_12]: The city is also perfectly welcome.

479
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,111
[SPEAKER_12]: We can send it to you guys and post them on the city's website as well.

480
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:16,112
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could send us copies, I'd greatly appreciate it.

481
00:40:16,192 --> 00:40:17,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And just be good to

482
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:19,047
[SPEAKER_02]: read those as soon as we get them.

483
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:29,093
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of residents that live in that area, so it would be ideal to see what exactly, we know what the concerns are, but to see how bad it is and what's eventually going to be done.

484
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:32,194
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do just want to warn you, I don't write those reports.

485
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:34,336
[SPEAKER_12]: The licensee professional does.

486
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:37,637
[SPEAKER_12]: When I've read others of these reports, they're kind of heavy.

487
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:41,440
[SPEAKER_12]: They're kind of heavy in the technical terms.

488
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:44,219
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not written for the general public.

489
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:48,822
[SPEAKER_12]: They're written for the state agency that monitors this stuff.

490
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:50,843
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but yeah, we're happy to share them.

491
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:52,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Just following on the topic.

492
00:40:53,025 --> 00:41:01,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we had the committee, the whole meeting regarding the Clippership Connector a couple of months ago, I believe, they talked about the other side of the river as well.

493
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:05,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, 93 side of the river.

494
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:07,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that DCR property or is that?

495
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,862
[SPEAKER_12]: That is DCR property over there.

496
00:41:09,062 --> 00:41:12,364
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole other side of the river between 93 and the river.

497
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:12,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

498
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:15,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know if there are any plans for the DCR to test that side?

499
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:16,186
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

500
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:22,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually people don't start testing soil until you're going to remove it and move it out of the way.

501
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:24,792
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what triggers somebody.

502
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:31,876
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you move soil and you're getting rid of it, you can't just move it unless you know that it's clean.

503
00:41:32,397 --> 00:41:35,900
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're going to dispose of it somewhere, you have to test it.

504
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,241
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to do a characterization.

505
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:41,125
[SPEAKER_12]: So usually you don't unless you have a reason to test it.

506
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:49,332
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I ask is because that night I think they did talk about putting a lane of a trail that went on that side of the river as well.

507
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:53,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if that's going to come before or after the Clippership Connector.

508
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:56,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would think that would be a concern as well that needs to be addressed.

509
00:41:57,908 --> 00:42:03,790
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would have to refer that to DCR and what they would choose to do on their property.

510
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:11,273
[SPEAKER_12]: The agency that would oversee that contamination, et cetera, is the State Department of Environmental Protection.

511
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:19,757
[SPEAKER_12]: And while I'm the environmental director in Medford, I don't actually have oversight over that, and I can't tell the state agency to go test

512
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,261
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be the other state agency that would tell them.

513
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:23,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that.

514
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:29,604
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if they're going to run, because they made it sound like that during the meeting, I think they were going to run that path down that side.

515
00:42:30,444 --> 00:42:32,986
[SPEAKER_12]: They would also like to investigate that path.

516
00:42:33,026 --> 00:42:36,867
[SPEAKER_12]: They would also like to consider designing on that side as well.

517
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:38,848
[SPEAKER_12]: That is not currently funded.

518
00:42:38,948 --> 00:42:42,089
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not currently a project in process.

519
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:45,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

520
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:45,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

521
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:46,831
[SPEAKER_18]: What was the question?

522
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:47,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Member Kern.

523
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,091
[SPEAKER_18]: One last question.

524
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Vice President Marks.

525
00:42:51,453 --> 00:43:08,226
[SPEAKER_18]: With regards to the many, many condos that are on the other side of this white line, I see that a lot of it's paved and obviously built on, but has there been any concerns from the property owners that this led on their property and underneath their property?

526
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:12,890
[SPEAKER_12]: This state has been in touch with them and has been talking to them directly.

527
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,512
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not been a party to those conversations.

528
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:18,964
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was told they were contacting the Condo Association.

529
00:43:20,084 --> 00:43:26,646
[SPEAKER_12]: They have actually groundwater contamination under those condos that they have been dealing with.

530
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:30,928
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have a licensed site professional engaged because of that.

531
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:42,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that the state told me that they were going to speak to the Condo Owners Association and to that LSP about the lead.

532
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:47,098
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know what he actually said or what their plans are.

533
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:50,880
[SPEAKER_18]: So the groundwater contamination that they have is most likely lead?

534
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,261
[SPEAKER_12]: It's completely unrelated.

535
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:54,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, completely unrelated.

536
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:56,343
[SPEAKER_12]: It is completely unrelated.

537
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,024
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's hydrochloric acid.

538
00:43:58,164 --> 00:43:59,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you remember?

539
00:44:00,065 --> 00:44:00,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

540
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,086
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a completely different contamination.

541
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,767
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were, frankly, we were shocked.

542
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:11,612
[SPEAKER_12]: We thought that when we dug right next to the first test pit that we were going to see their contamination, if anything.

543
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:12,742
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't.

544
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:13,843
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw this other thing.

545
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:14,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Completely different.

546
00:44:14,803 --> 00:44:22,667
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was because all of the test borings that were done in 1999 and before then through that project were on the other side.

547
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:27,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I have all of those reports in my office, and there was nothing done on this side of the pathway.

548
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:40,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I know people keep telling me that we know there was lead there, but the actual report sitting in my desk doesn't say that there was lead there on the rest of the property.

549
00:44:41,568 --> 00:44:43,709
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's perplexing.

550
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,651
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not the first time I've had people say that, by far.

551
00:44:48,072 --> 00:44:54,036
[SPEAKER_18]: I move approval of the paper as well, or second it, with those two or three conditions.

552
00:44:55,457 --> 00:45:04,783
[SPEAKER_18]: And make sure we have a report back from the mayor's office stating that she's going to give the extra $2,000 to do 10 additional test borings, seven feet deep.

553
00:45:04,883 --> 00:45:05,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

554
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:07,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

555
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:08,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

556
00:45:09,146 --> 00:45:12,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I too feel as though that this is an appropriate paper to approve this evening.

557
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:14,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel as though it's a good use of free cash.

558
00:45:15,347 --> 00:45:19,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, ultimately it's an unforeseen situation that does require immediate action.

559
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:21,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the residents of the neighborhood deserve it.

560
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:30,191
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a recurrent theme in our community here that, um, the residents want to see us tap into one of the most underutilized resources that we have here in Metro, which is our river.

561
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that coupled with the fact that the residents along ship Avenue,

562
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:39,599
[SPEAKER_07]: that are abutting this property are going to see a drastic impact on their quality of life and their property value.

563
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:48,862
[SPEAKER_07]: The longer that this fence stays up that says contamination would lead me to believe that it's a good vote this evening to take, uh, to approve the $49,000 for Riverbend contamination LSP services.

564
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:51,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, as such, I would support the amendments as well.

565
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:52,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval.

566
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:52,663
[SPEAKER_07]: The question.

567
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:53,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, counselor.

568
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:55,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank you.

569
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:57,284
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a gentleman that would like to speak.

570
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:01,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

571
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:06,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street Method Mass.

572
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:19,070
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm very dismayed all of a sudden we may have a dirty 21E at this river site after 200 to 300 years of the area being a dumping site.

573
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:33,095
[SPEAKER_21]: And if there is a problem, although is this not the DCR state of Massachusetts problem and their cost to clean up, believe in that

574
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:44,438
[SPEAKER_21]: In the 1677 law, Massachusetts had said, we the people have rights of 20 feet above mean high tide along all waterways.

575
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:55,823
[SPEAKER_21]: P.S., I, we have been fishing, my son and many of my neighbors, and biking there for over 50 years.

576
00:46:55,843 --> 00:47:02,726
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm further dismayed being on the eve of finally getting our East Medford

577
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:11,954
[SPEAKER_21]: connect the bike path, the missing link, which happens to be the center of the city, mind you, connecting West to assembly road.

578
00:47:16,076 --> 00:47:28,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, we had already built bike paths behind adjacent and adjoining that possible dirty 21 E area behind the new schools, the McGlynn and the Andrews.

579
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:50,832
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's sad, coincidentally, when we're finally having a Thursday meeting to hopefully finalize and connect the middle part that we have the situation that I've noticed the fences and I couldn't negotiate with my bicycle for the last couple of weeks.

580
00:47:53,193 --> 00:47:55,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Please, let's try to make some sense of this.

581
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:56,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

582
00:47:56,594 --> 00:48:00,595
[SPEAKER_21]: And hopefully this year and not in 10 years.

583
00:48:01,155 --> 00:48:01,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

584
00:48:03,857 --> 00:48:05,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

585
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:07,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, G News 035 Parris Street.

586
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,741
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, through the chair, just a question on clarification.

587
00:48:10,502 --> 00:48:20,969
[SPEAKER_01]: When Alicia was going over the details of the borings that were going to happen, I believe she indicated there were four that were going to go down to groundwater level.

588
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:24,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just curious if we're testing that groundwater at the same time.

589
00:48:25,512 --> 00:48:30,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, what type of additional implications could that open up for that same area?

590
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:31,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

591
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:31,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

592
00:48:43,308 --> 00:48:44,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we testing the groundwater?

593
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:48,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't hear the end of it.

594
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And if so, if we were testing groundwater, yes.

595
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:53,716
[SPEAKER_12]: And what type of implication could that have on overall cost?

596
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:57,499
[SPEAKER_12]: So the, basically there are different kinds of contamination.

597
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Some are soil contaminations and some are groundwater contaminations.

598
00:49:02,117 --> 00:49:08,610
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we need to test the groundwater because we need to test for everything per the state DEP.

599
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:13,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if you find contamination in groundwater, then the question is, what is it?

600
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:14,948
[SPEAKER_12]: How is it?

601
00:49:15,008 --> 00:49:15,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it coming out?

602
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:17,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it getting out into the air?

603
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:17,789
[SPEAKER_12]: How is it?

604
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:21,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, that's one of those things that could change.

605
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:37,078
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when I say, oh, we could dig up the soil and put new soil on top, but then if we find groundwater contamination, that could change totally what we're doing and totally what the solution is, which is why I hesitate to say this is what our solution is and this is how long we're going to take.

606
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,413
[SPEAKER_12]: My hope is that we don't find anything.

607
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:47,336
[SPEAKER_12]: If we find stuff in the groundwater that's related to what's actually being treated for under those condos, then that would be connected.

608
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:50,617
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's actually being paid for by an insurance company.

609
00:49:52,418 --> 00:50:00,140
[SPEAKER_12]: The company that insured the construction of those condos originally is paying for that current work that's going on.

610
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,681
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we found the same contaminant, it would be linked and become part of that.

611
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,413
[SPEAKER_12]: It could get complicated.

612
00:50:05,893 --> 00:50:06,973
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hoping that it doesn't.

613
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:15,955
[SPEAKER_12]: We can all do what we do to hope that we don't find contamination and that this is just, the lead is the only thing there.

614
00:50:15,975 --> 00:50:17,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

615
00:50:18,355 --> 00:50:33,018
[SPEAKER_10]: The question offered by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelly, as amended by Councilor Mox, Councilor Longo Kern, and Councilor Mox again,

616
00:50:34,216 --> 00:50:35,017
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

617
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,260
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

618
00:50:39,023 --> 00:50:40,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call has been requested.

619
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:44,391
[SPEAKER_10]: We do need a roll call vote.

620
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

621
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:51,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

622
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:52,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

623
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:53,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Kern.

624
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:53,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

625
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:54,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

626
00:50:55,175 --> 00:50:55,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

627
00:50:56,035 --> 00:50:56,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

628
00:50:56,935 --> 00:50:57,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

629
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:58,376
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caviello.

630
00:50:58,636 --> 00:50:58,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

631
00:50:59,716 --> 00:51:02,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

632
00:51:02,718 --> 00:51:03,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

633
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:09,420
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Councilor Scarpelli, while we're on the suspension.

634
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,442
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-511 petition by Robert Moore for

635
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:30,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Clematis Avenue, Method Mass, to address the council about a business being run out of a residential neighborhood home.

636
00:51:32,385 --> 00:51:34,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Moore, if you would please.

637
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:37,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Bob Moore for Clematis Road.

638
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:38,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

639
00:51:39,148 --> 00:51:43,649
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a business being run of one Clematis Road, Perez Landscaping.

640
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,570
[SPEAKER_13]: A landscaping company?

641
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Their name is Perez Landscaping.

642
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:51,533
[SPEAKER_13]: September through fall, it is landscaping.

643
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:52,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Winter, there's snow removal.

644
00:51:54,053 --> 00:52:01,396
[SPEAKER_13]: In the year-round, scrap metal retrieval, cutting up metal, what have you, on-site.

645
00:52:01,436 --> 00:52:04,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Originally, it was just small push mowers, leaf blowers, stuff like that.

646
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:06,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they have heavy equipment.

647
00:52:06,317 --> 00:52:12,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Blobcat, grass cutting tractor, wood chipper, which they use on-site.

648
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:21,396
[SPEAKER_13]: a trailer to haul back and forth, a two and a half ton truck to pull the trailer.

649
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:24,638
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a residential area, it's not zoned for business.

650
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it stopped.

651
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:33,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, Councilor Scarpelli.

652
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

653
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:40,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that I went out and visited the site, and I talked to Mr. Moore, and there

654
00:52:43,688 --> 00:53:08,498
[SPEAKER_04]: There is equipment, and if we can, I'd like to ask Mr. Mavuso to give us a report back and what the history has been and what is being done moving forward to make sure that this is being investigated properly so the neighbors in that area aren't being woken up at 5 o'clock in the morning due to heavy trucking and beeping.

655
00:53:10,508 --> 00:53:15,632
[SPEAKER_04]: stump grinding during the weeknights and weekends, and so on and so forth.

656
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:21,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I know I've been out there, Mr. Barreto and Mr. Moore, and I've seen the house.

657
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:27,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried to talk to the person, and if we could just get a report back from Mr. — Has Mr. Mavuso been called yet?

658
00:53:27,482 --> 00:53:29,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe he has, and I believe he's already issued tickets.

659
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:39,451
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if we could just get an update, and if we can ask for a plan moving forward to make sure that those residents aren't being affected in such a negative way.

660
00:53:39,777 --> 00:53:40,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

661
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:40,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

662
00:53:41,157 --> 00:53:41,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

663
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:45,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, this past Memorial, they started building a structure in the yard.

664
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:47,680
[SPEAKER_13]: For what purpose, I don't know.

665
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Storage?

666
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,460
[SPEAKER_13]: They got a permit?

667
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I doubt it.

668
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:54,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I have pictures of that from another neighbor that took them.

669
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:57,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I did forward those pictures to Paul Mookie.

670
00:53:58,943 --> 00:54:00,504
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if he passed them on to you or not.

671
00:54:00,564 --> 00:54:02,344
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not have them.

672
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,425
[SPEAKER_13]: You can have these if you'd like.

673
00:54:03,445 --> 00:54:04,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we take a look?

674
00:54:11,118 --> 00:54:11,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

675
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

676
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Moore, thank you for coming here this evening.

677
00:54:15,262 --> 00:54:15,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

678
00:54:15,943 --> 00:54:18,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can certainly understand your frustration.

679
00:54:18,886 --> 00:54:25,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, grew up in a home that lived next door to a person that ran a junkyard out of his backyard.

680
00:54:25,252 --> 00:54:28,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And my next door neighbor on the other side parked an 18-wheeler in his driveway every night.

681
00:54:29,036 --> 00:54:33,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can certainly understand the impact that it's having on your quiet enjoyment and peace in your neighborhood.

682
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:39,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, in addition to referring this matter to the code enforcement officers suggested by councilor Scott Pelley, I'd also like to amend the paper.

683
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:43,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President requests that the board of health go out and do an examination out there.

684
00:54:43,326 --> 00:54:47,849
[SPEAKER_07]: If the gentleman is in fact collecting junk and debris, then there may be border health issues that are coming along with that as well.

685
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:56,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to ask them as O'Connor, uh, send one of the inspectors out there to take a look and make sure that they're in compliance with all, um, border health regulations that are in place as well.

686
00:54:57,177 --> 00:54:57,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

687
00:54:57,537 --> 00:54:59,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor vice president marks.

688
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

689
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:04,855
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have a clean it or lean it ordinance.

690
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:11,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there is debris or building materials or anything in that yard, we can enforce the clean it or lean it.

691
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:20,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the appropriate avenue is for the building commissioner and the building inspector to go out there and code enforcement officer and check out what's going on the property.

692
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:29,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll deem whether or not there's sufficient facts to prove that there's a business being run out of that location and then be able to find them accordingly.

693
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:32,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that doesn't work, you can end up taking them to court.

694
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a number of avenues that they can do.

695
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:38,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And that really is the first step.

696
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

697
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're the taxpayers.

698
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,420
[SPEAKER_08]: They only rent the property.

699
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,540
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an absentee landlord.

700
00:55:44,481 --> 00:55:44,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

701
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:45,881
[SPEAKER_08]: We could go after the property.

702
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:46,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

703
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:48,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you.

704
00:55:48,641 --> 00:55:51,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying the building department is really the enforcing authority.

705
00:55:52,822 --> 00:55:54,742
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, police department can't come and go out there.

706
00:55:56,163 --> 00:55:57,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Building department that would enforce that.

707
00:55:58,225 --> 00:56:01,526
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've been successful in the past on other properties in the community.

708
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:04,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they'll get our message loud and clear.

709
00:56:04,587 --> 00:56:04,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

710
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:08,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Mohr.

711
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:09,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

712
00:56:09,629 --> 00:56:12,230
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another gentleman that wants to speak.

713
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the wreckage, please.

714
00:56:15,731 --> 00:56:19,472
[SPEAKER_16]: It was buried at 102 Harrison Street, up in the heights.

715
00:56:20,052 --> 00:56:22,013
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm talking about the same problem we have here.

716
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:25,354
[SPEAKER_16]: They moved into our neighborhood probably about four or five years ago.

717
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:27,175
[SPEAKER_16]: It started out with chickens.

718
00:56:28,436 --> 00:56:31,878
[SPEAKER_16]: I get pictures here, chickens in my yard, chickens in the streets.

719
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:37,780
[SPEAKER_16]: They brought refrigerators, stoves, hot water heaters.

720
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:41,482
[SPEAKER_16]: The code enforcement come up, they got them to get rid of all that crap.

721
00:56:42,343 --> 00:56:45,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Then they started with wood chippers.

722
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:53,428
[SPEAKER_16]: We had trees that they cut down, they bring them home, they run them through the big chipper into the truck.

723
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:56,609
[SPEAKER_16]: And we tell them, you can't do that stuff.

724
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:57,750
[SPEAKER_16]: They're foreign people.

725
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,011
[SPEAKER_16]: I got nothing against anybody.

726
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:00,973
[SPEAKER_16]: I got nothing against the family.

727
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:03,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Just this is a residential area.

728
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:05,737
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been up there 74 years.

729
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:07,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Never had any problems.

730
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we get this problem.

731
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:11,122
[SPEAKER_16]: You got these trucks coming in.

732
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:12,804
[SPEAKER_16]: My daughter works on Friday night late.

733
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:15,907
[SPEAKER_16]: She tries to come up the street, which is I'm on a dead end.

734
00:57:17,036 --> 00:57:20,039
[SPEAKER_16]: The trucks, they're trying to get them in the yard, put a bobcat in the yard.

735
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:22,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Took her one half hour to get up the street.

736
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:25,324
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm only one house away from my house.

737
00:57:26,505 --> 00:57:32,871
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd appreciate it if people would do something about this because we've gone to the commission downstairs to the building department.

738
00:57:33,271 --> 00:57:35,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I've gone to the mayor's office three times.

739
00:57:35,353 --> 00:57:36,374
[SPEAKER_16]: They said they were going to handle it.

740
00:57:36,814 --> 00:57:37,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And we still have the problem.

741
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:39,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we're here.

742
00:57:39,296 --> 00:57:40,838
[SPEAKER_16]: We hope this is our last stop.

743
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,900
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to have to go to any court.

744
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:54,274
[SPEAKER_16]: The owner, he allowed them to bring rubbish from his property up in Woburn, Winchester, one or the other, and dump it behind car park, because it backs up car park.

745
00:57:54,934 --> 00:57:56,155
[SPEAKER_16]: We're told you can't do that.

746
00:57:57,156 --> 00:58:00,798
[SPEAKER_16]: The kid that lives in the house says he said it was OK to do that.

747
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:04,681
[SPEAKER_16]: So now every once in a while, they slip some rubbish in there, which is leaves.

748
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:10,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had fires behind my house, almost come down to my house throughout the years I've been there.

749
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:14,690
[SPEAKER_16]: But if they keep putting all these leaves back there, they're going to take me else.

750
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,911
[SPEAKER_16]: So I appreciate if you can take care of it.

751
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:17,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

752
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:17,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

753
00:58:18,513 --> 00:58:28,280
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly that we inform the building inspector and the health inspector to go down and check the property out.

754
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Vice President Mox.

755
00:58:31,643 --> 00:58:32,403
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

756
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:32,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

757
00:58:32,864 --> 00:58:33,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

758
00:58:33,624 --> 00:58:34,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

759
00:58:35,105 --> 00:58:38,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by- While we're in suspension- Yes.

760
00:58:38,868 --> 00:58:40,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to acknowledge that today,

761
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:48,581
[SPEAKER_09]: June 6th is the 74th, 73rd anniversary of D-Day.

762
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:51,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Del Rosso.

763
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:52,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

764
00:58:53,244 --> 00:58:53,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

765
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,647
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, do we move, you have something?

766
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:03,370
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Nate to take another paper out of order.

767
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Which paper would that be, Councilor Nate?

768
00:59:05,371 --> 00:59:05,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh? 17504.

769
00:59:11,928 --> 00:59:14,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Mox, if you could read this, please.

770
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:18,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Vice President?

771
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:35,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper 17-504 offered by President Caviello.

772
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:42,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council discuss the problems caused by construction on Boston Ave to Harvard Street.

773
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:44,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Council President Caviello.

774
00:59:45,366 --> 00:59:46,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

775
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:53,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Vice Presidents, from Harvard Street all the way up to Boston Ave, you went to Ball Square.

776
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:57,954
[SPEAKER_10]: For the past three to four years, there's been constant construction going over there.

777
00:59:58,434 --> 01:00:01,016
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's, from digging the streets up

778
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:26,909
[SPEAKER_10]: to blocking the streets, and there are many businesses that are on that street that have suffered greatly with their business because of the street closures for extended periods of time, and a lot of the times they were done with no notification to the businesses, and I know that some of the businesses have reached out to the developers, and they seem to not have been any help.

779
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:30,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as soon as one project stopped there, another one started right up,

780
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:43,292
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's about time that these half a dozen businesses and the homes that are there receive some kind of break for all the disruption they've been going through for the last three years.

781
01:00:44,212 --> 01:00:46,933
[SPEAKER_10]: And the city doesn't seem to be doing anything about it.

782
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:59,415
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that the engineer, the city engineer again, step in and give us some kind of time frame to let us know what's happening with the project and how much longer they're gonna be there.

783
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:02,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

784
01:01:02,378 --> 01:01:02,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

785
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:05,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

786
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to thank Councilor Caviello for putting this resolution forward.

787
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:14,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, over the weekend had the opportunity to meet with a couple of business owners that operate on Harvard Avenue.

788
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:19,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a situation where it's not just one development that's going on.

789
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:24,789
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the development at 640 Boston Ave being performed by 640 Boston Avenue LLC.

790
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:27,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a 43-unit development housing.

791
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:30,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spoke with the general manager of the

792
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:35,484
[SPEAKER_07]: construction company yesterday, and that project is going to be wrapping up around July 1st.

793
01:01:35,684 --> 01:01:38,505
[SPEAKER_07]: So the construction is going to be complete and people will be moving in July 1st.

794
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:41,907
[SPEAKER_07]: With that being said, Mr. President, that's not the only issue in the neighborhood.

795
01:01:41,927 --> 01:01:50,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen the MBTA perform an extended amount of work on the train tracks in preparation for the Greenland extension that's impacted this business.

796
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:56,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we've seen Tufts University go in and do some work up on the top of Boston Ave that's also impacted this business.

797
01:01:57,093 --> 01:01:59,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we're seeing RX Devereux doing some

798
01:02:00,097 --> 01:02:04,039
[SPEAKER_07]: public utility work on the Somerville side that's disrupting this business.

799
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:20,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you wanted to get to the stretch of Boston Avenue between Ball Square and Harvard Street, and you were coming from Somerville, the only way that you'd be able to go would be to go up past Tufts University, all the way up to the library, then turn around down Boston Avenue and come back down Boston Avenue.

800
01:02:20,888 --> 01:02:27,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in essence, the traffic constraints that are in place right now are detouring people directly out of the entire region, Mr. President.

801
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:29,312
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just having an impact on the businesses down there.

802
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:44,544
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's also pertinent that we receive copies of the traffic management plans from 640 Boston Avenue, as well as Rx Davaro, who's performing the utility work on Harvard Street, on the Somerville side, Mr. President, in front of St.

803
01:02:44,584 --> 01:02:45,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Clement's Church.

804
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:49,468
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my understanding that Tufts University, at this point in time, has ceased their construction.

805
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: That project is complete.

806
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:54,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And the finishing touches that are being put on are striping and signage.

807
01:02:54,985 --> 01:03:02,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also am under the impression, Mr. President, that in the near future, the MBTA will be back out in the area performing some work.

808
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:04,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be doing some land takings, et cetera.

809
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:07,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'd also like to ask that the MBTA provide us with their traffic management plan.

810
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:21,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we receive those documents, we can forward them to our Division of Engineering and ask our Division of Engineering to review the traffic management plans and come up with recommendations to create a better flow of traffic that will have a less adverse impact on the businesses that are in operation on that stretch of land.

811
01:03:24,354 --> 01:03:25,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Counselor.

812
01:03:25,054 --> 01:03:25,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Scott Pelley.

813
01:03:26,815 --> 01:03:28,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

814
01:03:28,796 --> 01:03:31,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, went out on the site, talked to a few of the neighbors.

815
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:44,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we can have, you know, from beginning to end at Boston Ave, that constituents get an update on when the jobs or work being performed is being done.

816
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:49,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a call and I talked to one of our friends that told us that

817
01:03:51,638 --> 01:04:04,863
[SPEAKER_04]: they have to get up and leave an hour and a half early before the construction starts because if the construction starts before they leave, depending what time they come in, they're stuck in the driveway.

818
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:15,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and they're not getting much help or assistance or information from those developers or the contractors.

819
01:04:15,206 --> 01:04:17,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if we can reach out to

820
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:28,098
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, engineering and see who's doing the work to inform our, uh, constituents on Devereux and Boston Ave all the way up and down.

821
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:36,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a, uh, defined start time and end time to make their lives a little bit easier.

822
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be greatly appreciated.

823
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:38,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

824
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

825
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:39,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor.

826
01:04:40,071 --> 01:04:40,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor DelaRusso.

827
01:04:41,692 --> 01:04:42,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

828
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:54,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I attended last Wednesday night, instead of our Committee of the Whole meeting, I attended a meeting sponsored by the Department of Transportation on the Green Line extension.

829
01:04:54,614 --> 01:05:06,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was there along with the mayor and members of our state delegation to express concern by a number of the neighbors and butters to the project.

830
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:09,963
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the clear things that's emerged in this latest

831
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:32,788
[SPEAKER_09]: development of activity along the rail line of the rail corridor is the fact that much of the work proceeded without a point person, a point of contact for the neighbors, someone who would represent the construction company, the MBTA, the Department of Transportation to the general public.

832
01:05:34,068 --> 01:05:36,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We expressed that clearly to

833
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:44,954
[SPEAKER_09]: the members of the construction team that were present there, the management team from the MBTA, DOT, and the construction people.

834
01:05:45,634 --> 01:05:59,919
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they got the message clear, not only from the elected officials present, but also from the neighbors, that they want someone that they can reach out and have open channels of communication where there are problems occurring.

835
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:01,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are occurring.

836
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,361
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's going to be significant change, ambient change.

837
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:09,486
[SPEAKER_09]: to the area as this project continues.

838
01:06:09,806 --> 01:06:21,734
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be elimination of virtually all the vegetation all the way up beyond the gymnasium at the corner of College Avenue to accommodate this project in the coming months.

839
01:06:22,815 --> 01:06:33,763
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll begin the process of widening the rail bed or moving the tracks further to the north to make way for the southern

840
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:36,640
[SPEAKER_09]: tracks that will be inserted.

841
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:46,366
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to see the insertion of retaining walls and the beginnings and foundations of sound barriers in the corridor.

842
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:47,927
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're ready to go.

843
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:48,788
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going.

844
01:06:49,008 --> 01:06:49,529
[SPEAKER_09]: They're moving.

845
01:06:49,549 --> 01:06:51,610
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing the prep work, this project.

846
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:58,355
[SPEAKER_09]: We can, unless something happens with the funding at this point, we can consider it underway.

847
01:06:59,035 --> 01:07:01,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And so people are going to be affected.

848
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:07,767
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, and people will need someone to reach out to who was managing the project.

849
01:07:08,407 --> 01:07:11,910
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, we made that our priority in that meeting.

850
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:24,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, there will be another meeting, I think in a week or so, I forget the exact date, um, here in the council chambers, uh, for the general public of Medford, uh, to speak on the issue of this, uh, Green Line extension.

851
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:29,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they're holding one, uh, I think this week or next week, um, in Somerville.

852
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:32,578
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it will be important.

853
01:07:32,858 --> 01:07:40,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And everything's up on the city's web page and the Green Line Extension web page as far as information and contacts on this.

854
01:07:40,704 --> 01:07:49,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know that a number of people have felt the pressure about by being constantly under construction up there for the past several years.

855
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:51,772
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of utility work.

856
01:07:52,132 --> 01:07:54,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And there has been disruption up there.

857
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:59,378
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to support the businesses up there.

858
01:08:00,078 --> 01:08:10,102
[SPEAKER_09]: He wants to support you and see that you're served properly up there and don't have to go under any more duress than is necessary.

859
01:08:12,103 --> 01:08:13,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Council President Caviello.

860
01:08:13,324 --> 01:08:13,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

861
01:08:13,984 --> 01:08:24,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Councilor Layton mentioned that the project that's up there will be finished in July, but when I spoke to Mr. Anello, he's telling me that another project is ready to go right behind it.

862
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:27,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And the developer of that property has made no

863
01:08:28,715 --> 01:08:30,235
[SPEAKER_10]: attempt to work with the businesses.

864
01:08:31,276 --> 01:08:35,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, total disregard for their needs before he starts.

865
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:45,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So before this, say as soon as one stops and no one's gonna start, and these guys, and same person, and these people, it'll be another two years before they get a break.

866
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,420
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think something has to be done now, not when this guy just decides to do whatever he wants.

867
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

868
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address of the record, sir.

869
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Joseph Analetto, 590 Boston Ave, Medford, Mass.

870
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:08,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you primarily first for giving me this opportunity to speak about my grievances tonight in front of the council.

871
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:20,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I've been grinning, bearing the impacts from the construction since the first phase of the Green Line, and I think it started in about October 2012.

872
01:09:25,043 --> 01:09:37,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprisingly, the impacts from that construction, in particular to the Harvard Street Bridge, was not as significant as I thought in the beginning.

873
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:49,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Because whoever was the engineer on that project, particularly routing the traffic, they were cognizant of our ongoing day-to-day business.

874
01:09:52,456 --> 01:09:55,798
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're pretty close to the sales before the work commenced.

875
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,681
[SPEAKER_03]: This situation, it's completely different.

876
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:08,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've never been encumbered by road construction this badly in my entire life there.

877
01:10:08,365 --> 01:10:09,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been working on that corner since 1990.

878
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:17,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've probably been working on that corner every day, you know.

879
01:10:18,895 --> 01:10:19,916
[SPEAKER_03]: seven days a week since 1998.

880
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:29,704
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I spend a significant amount of time in the neighborhood, and I know, you know, I have a feel for the flow of traffic and everything else.

881
01:10:29,744 --> 01:10:32,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just seems like no one knows what's going on over there.

882
01:10:33,607 --> 01:10:36,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, customers are complaining about it to me every day.

883
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:43,815
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had a hard time getting over here, and I came here after work instead of coming here in the morning.

884
01:10:45,016 --> 01:10:47,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them, you know,

885
01:10:48,848 --> 01:10:49,328
[SPEAKER_03]: fed up with it.

886
01:10:50,309 --> 01:11:03,158
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to what extent do myself have to be responsible for loss of business for all this other work being done around me?

887
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:16,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was no, nobody really reached out to me before the utility work began, development project on 6th and it just seems like the work started and I'm supposed to grin and bear the sentiment that I'm picking up off the street.

888
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I realize that the entire area is going to change.

889
01:11:22,483 --> 01:11:26,086
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, gentrification is taking place and, you know, we all know that.

890
01:11:26,707 --> 01:11:30,289
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really starting to affect my bottom line.

891
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:43,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the losses, in particular, the last couple of months since Easter have been significant to the point where I feel demoralized.

892
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:45,782
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you sit there when

893
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:51,058
[SPEAKER_03]: The top of Boston Ave is closed, and then Harvard Street, and then Warner Street's closed.

894
01:11:51,118 --> 01:11:53,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're just sitting there twiddling your thumbs.

895
01:11:55,762 --> 01:12:04,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the thing that really set me off is reading the scope of the work that Devereux Construction had outlined.

896
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:08,292
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be doing utility work Monday through Saturday in May.

897
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:10,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the car wash business

898
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:18,412
[SPEAKER_03]: May is probably our busiest month of the year, and we really do rely on that revenue to get through the rest of the year, obviously because of the pollen season.

899
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:26,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can understand Monday through Friday from 7 to 4, but Monday through Saturday?

900
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:29,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it that necessary to do work on Saturday?

901
01:12:31,557 --> 01:12:35,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the way they've been running the traffic over there, it seems like they do it a different way every day.

902
01:12:36,878 --> 01:12:40,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, it's a, for lack of a better word,

903
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:43,205
[SPEAKER_03]: A mess.

904
01:12:46,888 --> 01:12:55,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel that the planning of this work was not well thought out from an inexperienced person.

905
01:12:56,015 --> 01:12:59,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been a traffic engineer in my life, and I probably never will.

906
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:01,920
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just feel like something's wrong here.

907
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not the only one that said it.

908
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:07,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, countless people have said, you know,

909
01:13:10,997 --> 01:13:15,179
[SPEAKER_03]: getting an attorney and all this other—you know, I'm trying to run a business on a day-to-day basis.

910
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:25,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't want to go, you know, to those means because it's just going to suck up my time and compromise.

911
01:13:26,463 --> 01:13:38,147
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, business, I have to be there making sure I'm making improvements, making sure my customers are—and a plethora of other issues that go with running a business.

912
01:13:39,637 --> 01:13:41,478
[SPEAKER_03]: a business of that nature, a service business.

913
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:50,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, basically the premise of my grievance was outlined by Rick and Adam before I spoke.

914
01:13:50,700 --> 01:14:03,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd really appreciate any type of consideration that you as the council can give to us, not just myself, but the entire neighborhood over there as the rest of this work goes on.

915
01:14:04,824 --> 01:14:05,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to say, though, that

916
01:14:07,953 --> 01:14:21,879
[SPEAKER_03]: When they did do the first phase of work on the bridge, whoever was in charge of engineering the traffic flow did a significantly better job than it is now.

917
01:14:21,919 --> 01:14:31,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever is working, whoever is in charge of that dynamic is not doing a good job, in my opinion.

918
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:36,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comments.

919
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:37,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor?

920
01:14:38,547 --> 01:14:50,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Analetto, have you had any conversations with Tufts University or the city of Medford relative to the work that they're going to be proposing relative to the complete streets program in the reconfiguration of the intersection at Boston Avenue?

921
01:14:51,474 --> 01:14:53,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, at the top of the hill by the library.

922
01:14:53,696 --> 01:14:56,278
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've had no correspondence with tough, no correspondence with tough.

923
01:14:56,298 --> 01:14:57,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and nobody from the administration as well.

924
01:14:58,099 --> 01:14:58,259
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

925
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

926
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:10,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if I could amend the paper to request that, um, the city engineer reach out to, uh, Titan gas station to explain to him the scope and circumstances of the complete streets project going on, uh, at the top of Boston.

927
01:15:10,348 --> 01:15:11,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that would be appreciated as well.

928
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:12,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

929
01:15:13,171 --> 01:15:14,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have someone else behind you that would like to speak.

930
01:15:18,846 --> 01:15:32,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like every meeting that I attend and I watch, we hear more and more about the onslaught that our residents and small business are facing in this city.

931
01:15:33,713 --> 01:15:47,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's becoming crucial that we demand that these folks that are working within our city limits reach out and communicate effectively

932
01:15:48,505 --> 01:15:51,046
[SPEAKER_01]: with the people whose lives they're impacting.

933
01:15:51,706 --> 01:15:58,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And in an area like Boston Ave, that isn't necessarily just the Butters or people in the general neighborhood.

934
01:15:59,328 --> 01:16:01,989
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a main area that people traverse through.

935
01:16:02,469 --> 01:16:03,909
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be communications.

936
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:07,050
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be transparencies for these things.

937
01:16:07,671 --> 01:16:10,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And there should be representation of our residents.

938
01:16:11,412 --> 01:16:16,153
[SPEAKER_01]: We really are, for lack of a better phrase, under attack.

939
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone is feeling it across the board.

940
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:20,821
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feeling it on Boston Ave.

941
01:16:21,341 --> 01:16:26,922
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feeling it up on Winthrop Street by the high school where there's demolition going on up there.

942
01:16:27,703 --> 01:16:33,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Salem Street is getting set to feel its pains with the Break Pro project.

943
01:16:33,824 --> 01:16:38,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that statement has come out yet, but we expect that to be happening.

944
01:16:39,265 --> 01:16:46,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, we continue to see the South Street area they're under attack to by

945
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,173
[SPEAKER_01]: their onslaught of development that's happening there.

946
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:58,279
[SPEAKER_01]: But we continue to see these groups, teams, and individuals come into our city and run roughshod over everybody.

947
01:16:58,879 --> 01:17:03,943
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, gentrification is underway, but we certainly don't have to sit back and just accept it.

948
01:17:04,423 --> 01:17:09,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And gentrification isn't only going to occur to just our seniors.

949
01:17:10,567 --> 01:17:12,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to occur to our businesses as well.

950
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:28,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we talk about things like how to revitalize Medford Square and bring back small businesses, where you hear about organizations and companies that are suffering because their foot traffic and vehicle traffic is being removed.

951
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:38,595
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at someone like Carol's, who's been under onslaught now for months upon months with bridge work that's going to extend and extend and extend.

952
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:42,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And it troubles me greatly because we

953
01:17:43,393 --> 01:17:49,575
[SPEAKER_01]: keep discussing these things, and the situation seemingly is getting worse and worse.

954
01:17:49,775 --> 01:17:59,178
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about things like development committees made up of residents, and I think we talked about that weeks ago now, haven't heard a word back about it.

955
01:17:59,778 --> 01:18:13,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've said it before, I'll say it again, zoning, development, yes, there are departments that are involved, but the purview of it resides with this

956
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:30,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would urge you, if we don't do something as a group to set limits and insist upon the rules of engagement for these folks, it's going to come to a head somehow.

957
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:38,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, that in conjunction with the airplanes and everything, it's just, it's crazy right now in the city of Medford.

958
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:41,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look to you guys because we know how

959
01:18:43,032 --> 01:18:46,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Much you all love the city like we do but it's Next week.

960
01:18:46,655 --> 01:19:06,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be someone else coming up, you know there's always something going on and until unless and until we insist that they have those communication plans and Use the proper methods to communicate them effectively Throughout the city when appropriate.

961
01:19:06,828 --> 01:19:09,270
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to continue to go on Thank you

962
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:10,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comments.

963
01:19:11,071 --> 01:19:13,772
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by Council President Caviello.

964
01:19:16,053 --> 01:19:16,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

965
01:19:16,974 --> 01:19:17,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

966
01:19:17,774 --> 01:19:21,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Just if we could read back what the resolve is, just so we know what we're voting on.

967
01:19:23,936 --> 01:19:24,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Ed, turn on your mic.

968
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:33,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Ed, you have the?

969
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,721
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking for the, because it's a petition, so I'm trying to

970
01:19:41,727 --> 01:19:51,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so the resolve is Memphis City Council discuss the problems caused by construction of Boston Avenue to Harvard Street.

971
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:52,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have an amendment.

972
01:19:58,092 --> 01:20:09,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the city engineer reach out to the business owners of Titan to further explain the scope of the service and construction and the ongoing process to them.

973
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

974
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:17,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a Council of Knights amendment?

975
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:20,423
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't a Council of Knights amendment.

976
01:20:20,503 --> 01:20:21,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

977
01:20:21,944 --> 01:20:23,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Now let me see.

978
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:37,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott Pelley is looking for the City Engineer to provide a start time and end time of the projects to reach out and provide some notifications to the residents or businesses in there.

979
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see here.

980
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:48,058
[SPEAKER_14]: And President Calvillo, City Engineer, give some time.

981
01:20:48,498 --> 01:20:53,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

982
01:20:53,179 --> 01:20:56,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Scope of time, you know, when the projects, these projects are going to continue.

983
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,900
[SPEAKER_14]: So they were also looking for a start and end time.

984
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:05,421
[SPEAKER_18]: If then nothing's been mentioned with regards to traffic flow and who's in charge of traffic flow.

985
01:21:05,522 --> 01:21:06,842
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could.

986
01:21:06,882 --> 01:21:12,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight asked for traffic plans from the MBTA.

987
01:21:14,587 --> 01:21:25,692
[SPEAKER_14]: and the traffic plans for the construction at Harvard and Boston Avenue and surrounding areas.

988
01:21:26,212 --> 01:21:26,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

989
01:21:26,672 --> 01:21:37,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think that's the main point of the, one of the main points of the complainant that we look into the traffic flow and make sure it's flowing

990
01:21:38,307 --> 01:21:41,188
[SPEAKER_18]: the same every day and in a way that works.

991
01:21:41,308 --> 01:21:48,069
[SPEAKER_18]: So I second approval of the paper and hope hopefully the administration can get on the MBTA as well.

992
01:21:48,129 --> 01:21:54,571
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could amend it, ask the administration to also reach out to the MBTA and ask them to make sure traffic is flowing.

993
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:56,711
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to keep on top of it as a city.

994
01:21:56,751 --> 01:22:03,173
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to make sure the traffic is flowing for the residents and the business owners and that it's consistent day after day.

995
01:22:03,193 --> 01:22:06,114
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, cause I, as a business owner, you feel the frustration.

996
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:07,414
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't want anybody to be hurting.

997
01:22:07,872 --> 01:22:28,967
[SPEAKER_18]: And if it comes down to, construction's gonna go on everywhere, but if it comes down to actually just managing your traffic flow on a consistent basis so the residents and the people that frequent these businesses know how to get point A to point B the same way every day, that's a simple fix that should be done and should be implemented.

998
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:38,559
[SPEAKER_18]: I ask that the mayor's office get on this, and I second the resolve, especially asking the MBTA to figure it out for our residents and our business owners.

999
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:51,271
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion offered by President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Wendell Kern, amended by Councilor Knight, further amended by Councilor Scapelli, and President Caviello, all in favor?

[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, upon reviewing the papers, I do have a petition to

1038
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:42,483
[SPEAKER_07]: hours of operation from 7 a.m.

1039
01:25:42,503 --> 01:25:44,625
[SPEAKER_07]: in the morning till 2 a.m.

1040
01:25:44,645 --> 01:26:09,903
[SPEAKER_11]: that would be the certified hours of operation at this paper we can explain to me what the hours of operation are at Annie's Pizzeria in terms of when they are actually going to be open and operating well we don't have launched we basically we open from 11 to 10 actually and then what we need is then the hours is after after 10 from you know until 2 in the morning

1041
01:26:10,585 --> 01:26:12,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't have a launch.

1042
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:13,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, we open at 11.

1043
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:13,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, 11.

1044
01:26:14,948 --> 01:26:15,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1045
01:26:15,369 --> 01:26:15,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1046
01:26:15,869 --> 01:26:17,350
[SPEAKER_07]: And how many employees do you have working for you?

1047
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:19,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I have four.

1048
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:21,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Four employees working for you?

1049
01:26:21,213 --> 01:26:26,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, as I review the paperwork here, I see the statement of workers' compensation insurance affidavit for a gentleman.

1050
01:26:27,578 --> 01:26:34,984
[SPEAKER_07]: In box number two on the state form, which I have a little bit of familiarity of, it says, I am a sole proprietor of a partnership and have no employees working for me in any capacity.

1051
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:40,188
[SPEAKER_07]: If, in fact, the gentleman does have four employees working for him, he will be required to purchase workers' compensation insurance.

1052
01:26:41,331 --> 01:26:49,536
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the materials that have been submitted to the council this evening, they are complete in terms of the accuracy as to whether or not he's not going to be required to carry workers' compensation.

1053
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:51,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different story, Mr. President.

1054
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:59,522
[SPEAKER_07]: If, in fact, he does have four employees that are working for him that are not part of the sole proprietorship or the business partnership, then he will be required to purchase workers' compensation insurance.

1055
01:27:00,003 --> 01:27:08,648
[SPEAKER_07]: If you purchase the workers' compensation insurance, it does have a hundred percent guarantee if you are found in violation of the Workers' Compensation Act

1056
01:27:09,012 --> 01:27:14,436
[SPEAKER_07]: and fail to appeal it $250 a day if you're found in violation of the Workers' Compensation Act and do appeal it.

1057
01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:30,526
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess my question to the gentleman at the podium right now is if, in fact, you do have people that are working for you and you are currently in operation, you will be found in violation of the law if these people aren't at least 25% of your corporation.

1058
01:27:31,027 --> 01:27:31,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1059
01:27:31,867 --> 01:27:35,190
[SPEAKER_11]: I explained Sylvia in the clerk department.

1060
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:38,772
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my wife and me, kids working.

1061
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:46,874
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to know if I can extend hours so I don't have those employees, because I don't know if I can hire them.

1062
01:27:47,835 --> 01:27:50,697
[SPEAKER_11]: But if I extend my hours, I'm going to hire them.

1063
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:51,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet.

1064
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:52,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have it yet.

1065
01:27:53,078 --> 01:27:55,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, you're open from 11?

1066
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,661
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just my wife and me.

1067
01:27:57,701 --> 01:28:01,323
[SPEAKER_11]: We are in the checkbooks, and my son just give us help.

1068
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:07,827
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so the articles of incorporation that were filed at the Secretary of State's office would list the offices and principles of the corporation and yourself and your wife?

1069
01:28:08,467 --> 01:28:08,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1070
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:09,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And no others?

1071
01:28:09,664 --> 01:28:09,865
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1072
01:28:10,105 --> 01:28:16,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if the Department of Industrial Accidents Investigation Division happen to go to 213 Middlesex Avenue.

1073
01:28:17,467 --> 01:28:23,570
[SPEAKER_07]: and went behind the counter, the only people that would be working, including delivering, cooking food, working cash register, any of that?

1074
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:25,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's a small business.

1075
01:28:25,151 --> 01:28:26,992
[SPEAKER_11]: We just started, but we want to grow.

1076
01:28:27,032 --> 01:28:29,193
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why we want to spend hours.

1077
01:28:29,454 --> 01:28:38,959
[SPEAKER_11]: If we spend hours, I don't choose going to hire probably two more employees, but I'm going to hire maybe a driver, an extra driver.

1078
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:44,122
[SPEAKER_07]: So as long as you're aware that if, in fact, you do hire employees that are in excess of your ground.

1079
01:28:44,222 --> 01:28:45,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, definitely.

1080
01:28:45,342 --> 01:28:46,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the individuals in your corporation.

1081
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:53,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, based upon the conversation I've had with the gentleman, I do feel as though the paper is in order and complete.

1082
01:28:53,710 --> 01:29:02,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I would suggest that because of the nature of the permit and the willingness for the employee to keep his business open until 2 o'clock in the morning, we place a 90-day review on this.

1083
01:29:02,955 --> 01:29:09,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also recommend, Mr. President, that if approved, that the approval for extended hours would stay with the business and not the address.

1084
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:15,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So that if the business moves, then the permit for extended hours would die with the relocation of the business.

1085
01:29:16,122 --> 01:29:16,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1086
01:29:20,018 --> 01:29:25,481
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could, through the chair, Mr. President, ask the audience, why do you wish to stay open so late?

1087
01:29:27,021 --> 01:29:28,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, we want to grow.

1088
01:29:28,382 --> 01:29:35,665
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to, you know, especially people who are awake late, not us.

1089
01:29:35,725 --> 01:29:37,085
[SPEAKER_11]: We are sleeping early.

1090
01:29:37,145 --> 01:29:39,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know the market.

1091
01:29:39,306 --> 01:29:42,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a friend of mine who has a pizzeria in Somerville.

1092
01:29:43,432 --> 01:29:48,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And they catch most of the business right now after those hours, because everybody else closed.

1093
01:29:49,496 --> 01:29:57,661
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I request to some of my neighbors and my customers, if they say it could be also, because it's anything open at that time.

1094
01:29:58,181 --> 01:30:02,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes we are late of the jobs, and it's nothing open.

1095
01:30:02,784 --> 01:30:04,025
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be really good for you.

1096
01:30:04,045 --> 01:30:04,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Why you don't try?

1097
01:30:04,725 --> 01:30:05,806
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm trying.

1098
01:30:05,866 --> 01:30:09,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm just trying to see if I can grow.

1099
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:14,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could, do you offer a delivery service?

1100
01:30:15,353 --> 01:30:15,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1101
01:30:15,473 --> 01:30:16,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have deliveries of pizza?

1102
01:30:17,274 --> 01:30:17,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1103
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1104
01:30:18,736 --> 01:30:21,818
[SPEAKER_11]: It must be most of the business that probably deliver.

1105
01:30:21,858 --> 01:30:22,619
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I say.

1106
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:32,266
[SPEAKER_11]: If I extend the hours, if you give me that opportunity, I can, you know, hire more people and more drivers because I can do it myself.

1107
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:33,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.

1108
01:30:33,527 --> 01:30:33,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1109
01:30:34,508 --> 01:30:39,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I might say, in the past when faced with these requests,

1110
01:30:40,461 --> 01:30:54,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, when there's been opposition, uh, those people have made themselves known either by, uh, informing, uh, myself and other counselors or by making themselves present here at a council meeting.

1111
01:30:54,152 --> 01:31:00,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I can think of one instance where the, the proprietor of the franchise was quite persistent.

1112
01:31:01,438 --> 01:31:07,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, in fact, the first time he petitioned us for extended hours, he arrived here with a dozen pizzas for us.

1113
01:31:08,244 --> 01:31:09,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not partake.

1114
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:16,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly, I don't partake of that brand at all, ever.

1115
01:31:17,654 --> 01:31:33,965
[SPEAKER_09]: However, so many of my neighbors were quick to point out, and many of them made themselves present here, and many of them made an effort to contact me at my office to say that they did not want this going on because they did not want these cars speeding through the neighborhood.

1116
01:31:36,126 --> 01:31:39,108
[SPEAKER_09]: As president, I've not been contacted by anybody here.

1117
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:44,321
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, nor have I seen anybody present to speak in opposition.

1118
01:31:44,781 --> 01:32:07,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And I might say that the chairman has made an excellent measure by pointing out that we should have a 90 day review on this and that the, uh, uh, that if the, uh, extended hours of operation are granted, that they'd be granted only to the petitioner and not to a subsequent owner nor towards the property permanently.

1119
01:32:08,379 --> 01:32:08,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1120
01:32:09,533 --> 01:32:10,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Marks.

1121
01:32:11,494 --> 01:32:12,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1122
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:16,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And the petitioner mentioned that he's only open till 10 p.m.

1123
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:17,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1124
01:32:18,058 --> 01:32:21,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Your license right now is until 11.

1125
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:23,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Until 11, but I close at 10.

1126
01:32:24,021 --> 01:32:26,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so you're closing at 10, you're able to open till 11.

1127
01:32:27,663 --> 01:32:29,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you want to stay open till 2 a.m.

1128
01:32:29,084 --> 01:32:30,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, usually between 9 p.m.

1129
01:32:30,465 --> 01:32:31,625
[SPEAKER_11]: to 11 is totally dead.

1130
01:32:38,625 --> 01:32:40,686
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a time to clean and go home.

1131
01:32:42,507 --> 01:32:51,070
[SPEAKER_11]: But when everybody else flows after 11 is when you can catch some businesses because we have something online.

1132
01:32:52,871 --> 01:33:01,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, you know, we've taken these petitions for extended licenses based on a number of circumstances.

1133
01:33:01,734 --> 01:33:06,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And each petition is an individual petition based on its own merits.

1134
01:33:06,985 --> 01:33:13,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would venture to say, Mr. President, that this particular business is nestled between homes.

1135
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,092
[SPEAKER_08]: You have homes across the street.

1136
01:33:15,432 --> 01:33:17,594
[SPEAKER_08]: You have homes on either side, Mr. President.

1137
01:33:18,154 --> 01:33:20,576
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my opinion, a 2 a.m.

1138
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:27,922
[SPEAKER_08]: closing would pose a severe quality of life issue for area residents in that particular area.

1139
01:33:28,413 --> 01:33:38,638
[SPEAKER_08]: So even with a 90-day, which I think is a very amendable way of trying to put things through, I don't support that, Mr. President.

1140
01:33:39,098 --> 01:33:53,324
[SPEAKER_08]: If the gentleman wanted to open maybe until midnight and start off at midnight, and that would give him 11 and 12, which he's not opening 11, he has by right, it would give him 11 and 12, and then see how it goes.

1141
01:33:54,065 --> 01:33:56,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in six months from now or a year from now,

1142
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:58,146
[SPEAKER_08]: say maybe I'd like to open until 1.

1143
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:12,091
[SPEAKER_08]: But to start off at 2 a.m., Mr. President, in an area that's already congested, all those stores, as the gentleman mentioned, are closed after probably 11 o'clock is the latest, maybe midnight.

1144
01:34:12,972 --> 01:34:23,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And this would be two hours after that of hearing doors open and close and having this be, as the gentleman alluded to, the spot where you can go get a pizza at 2 in the morning.

1145
01:34:24,336 --> 01:34:26,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if the neighbors

1146
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:29,671
[SPEAKER_08]: in my opinion, willing to put up with that.

1147
01:34:30,051 --> 01:34:31,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a special permit.

1148
01:34:31,311 --> 01:34:32,191
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not by right.

1149
01:34:32,571 --> 01:34:33,631
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a special permit.

1150
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:37,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this time, Mr. President, I cannot sign off on this.

1151
01:34:38,252 --> 01:34:42,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be willing to go up to midnight on a provisional basis.

1152
01:34:43,754 --> 01:34:48,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if we hear back from residents that everything's fine with midnight, maybe we could explore one.

1153
01:34:49,275 --> 01:34:51,235
[SPEAKER_08]: But to go right to 2 a.m., Mr. President.

1154
01:34:51,535 --> 01:34:54,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clark, how many operations do we have in the city at 2 a.m.? ?

1155
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:56,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Several, citywide.

1156
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have hundreds of businesses.

1157
01:34:58,821 --> 01:35:01,022
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have several that are open citywide.

1158
01:35:01,082 --> 01:35:04,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, Mr. President, I'm not saying anything.

1159
01:35:05,524 --> 01:35:08,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that business has turned over a number of times.

1160
01:35:08,866 --> 01:35:13,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I live right around the corner, and that's changed hands a number of times, that business, over the years.

1161
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:17,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know it's been a tough location, and I wish you well there.

1162
01:35:17,849 --> 01:35:19,970
[SPEAKER_08]: But to me, 2 a.m.

1163
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:24,112
[SPEAKER_08]: is — I just can't support that based on the neighbors, Mr. President.

1164
01:35:25,013 --> 01:35:25,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1165
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:28,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Knight.

1166
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:40,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I do believe we ran into a similar situation back when we were discussing the extended hours at the old Panda Palace location, which is now Shanghai Moon.

1167
01:35:41,504 --> 01:35:42,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did a phase-in.

1168
01:35:43,365 --> 01:35:45,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And we phased it in, I believe we said.

1169
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:53,031
[SPEAKER_07]: For the first six months, it would be X. For the next three months, it would be Y. For the final three months, it would be Z. And we had a review step at each step of the way.

1170
01:35:54,506 --> 01:35:57,007
[SPEAKER_07]: If the council is amenable, I mean, maybe that's a solution right now.

1171
01:35:57,087 --> 01:36:05,671
[SPEAKER_07]: We can help the gentleman out and I'll be in agreement that we give him a 90 day permit till midnight and then maybe a 90 day review after midnight.

1172
01:36:05,772 --> 01:36:09,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if there are no issues, it would revert for another 90 day period until 1am.

1173
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:14,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there's no issues there, then it would revert to a 2am license with another 90 day review.

1174
01:36:14,256 --> 01:36:19,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So in essence, we'd have, you know, a year and a half, a year and a half review.

1175
01:36:19,613 --> 01:36:30,820
[SPEAKER_07]: of the extended hours and they'd be gradually implemented so that if any instances or issues in the neighborhood arise, we'll be able to nip them in the bud within 90 days of the event occurring.

1176
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:36,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can always, you know, have an opportunity to correct the wrongs if any are made.

1177
01:36:36,784 --> 01:36:39,406
[SPEAKER_07]: But if any aren't, then we can help the business owners succeed.

1178
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:48,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the council has discussed the difficulty it is for businesses to be competitive in the city of Medford based upon a number of circumstances.

1179
01:36:49,018 --> 01:36:55,201
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that the extended hours was a permitting process that was put in place to address some of those concerns.

1180
01:36:55,241 --> 01:37:01,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm hoping that maybe we can all sit down here and put our heads together and come up with a methodology that might work for everybody involved.

1181
01:37:01,224 --> 01:37:11,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask the councilor if he feels as though that would be a suitable recommendation to do an increase of one hour, reach 90 days with a 90 day review thereof.

1182
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:14,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe that'll be a solution of compromise for all involved.

1183
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:16,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Member Kern.

1184
01:37:18,112 --> 01:37:19,532
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the resolve through the chair.

1185
01:37:21,193 --> 01:37:26,254
[SPEAKER_18]: But did you, have you talked to your, you said the neighbors are asking you to stay open because they want.

1186
01:37:26,274 --> 01:37:31,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I forget a book, but I have a lot of signatures from, I collect like 120.

1187
01:37:31,956 --> 01:37:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I know there's a couple of homes across the street.

1188
01:37:35,637 --> 01:37:43,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, especially across the street, all of them, and they said, I don't know, I'm okay with that, but I forgot.

1189
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:45,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially is,

1190
01:37:47,402 --> 01:37:53,249
[SPEAKER_11]: A guy across the street, he said, I received your letter, and I signed it.

1191
01:37:53,329 --> 01:37:55,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, OK, it's not a problem for that.

1192
01:37:55,592 --> 01:37:56,553
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and he signed your petition?

1193
01:37:56,613 --> 01:37:56,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1194
01:37:57,714 --> 01:37:59,456
[SPEAKER_10]: What time does Cafe Mari stay open, Tom?

1195
01:38:00,197 --> 01:38:00,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Who?

1196
01:38:00,598 --> 01:38:01,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Cafe Mari, the coffee shop there?

1197
01:38:01,999 --> 01:38:02,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I think always.

1198
01:38:03,401 --> 01:38:04,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he one o'clock?

1199
01:38:05,243 --> 01:38:06,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that, yeah.

1200
01:38:06,224 --> 01:38:06,264
[SPEAKER_11]: No?

1201
01:38:08,541 --> 01:38:09,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes like that.

1202
01:38:09,522 --> 01:38:09,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1203
01:38:09,742 --> 01:38:17,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes I stay late, not open because I have to clean something or make prep things and I get out of there at 1130 and they still open.

1204
01:38:17,489 --> 01:38:17,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1205
01:38:20,151 --> 01:38:20,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

1206
01:38:21,072 --> 01:38:22,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1207
01:38:22,293 --> 01:38:28,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I do have a couple of concerns regarding the late time, uh, stay until 2am.

1208
01:38:28,779 --> 01:38:33,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I do like the staged approach as to, you know, just kind of maybe increasing it over time.

1209
01:38:33,863 --> 01:38:35,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not completely against this, but, uh,

1210
01:38:36,446 --> 01:38:38,486
[SPEAKER_02]: How many drivers do you have delivering?

1211
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, one.

1212
01:38:40,307 --> 01:38:40,467
[SPEAKER_02]: One.

1213
01:38:40,867 --> 01:38:45,008
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know if I get late, because I know the business from that time.

1214
01:38:45,068 --> 01:38:49,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my friend experience in Somerville and Magoon Square.

1215
01:38:50,369 --> 01:38:54,910
[SPEAKER_11]: He told me, you probably need two more, because it's busy time.

1216
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:55,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody is closed.

1217
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:57,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand.

1218
01:38:57,651 --> 01:39:04,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a little bit of my concern, because if you're going to go till 2 AM, and then if you go up two drivers, you're going to have three drivers.

1219
01:39:04,933 --> 01:39:05,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Three drivers.

1220
01:39:05,313 --> 01:39:06,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three drivers.

1221
01:39:07,611 --> 01:39:09,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Three drivers coming and going at 2 a.m.

1222
01:39:10,532 --> 01:39:13,654
[SPEAKER_02]: is really, you got doors opening, closing.

1223
01:39:14,474 --> 01:39:17,336
[SPEAKER_02]: You have cars driving around at 2 a.m.

1224
01:39:17,356 --> 01:39:18,416
[SPEAKER_02]: in a residential neighborhood.

1225
01:39:18,877 --> 01:39:21,118
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bit of a concern, to me at least.

1226
01:39:21,718 --> 01:39:24,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's something that needs to be looked at.

1227
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna see you succeed, believe me.

1228
01:39:27,221 --> 01:39:33,224
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also wanna make sure that we're safeguarding the neighborhood and making sure that people can get a good night's sleep.

1229
01:39:33,284 --> 01:39:35,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, if you haven't,

1230
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:39,106
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, three drivers going back and forth at 2 a.m.

1231
01:39:39,806 --> 01:39:44,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you're delivering up till 2, that means they might be coming back to the shop after 2.

1232
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:50,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so we're talking maybe 2.30, you know, when you really look at it.

1233
01:39:50,875 --> 01:40:01,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would definitely be, you know, in favor of the compromised proposal by Councilor Knight, you know, just kind of going in stages and maybe increasing, you know, over time.

1234
01:40:02,545 --> 01:40:02,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know,

1235
01:40:04,899 --> 01:40:16,065
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to be going from one driver to three drivers and having all those cars coming and going that late at night or early in the morning, that is definitely a concern, but I am definitely in favor of the staged approach.

1236
01:40:16,085 --> 01:40:17,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1237
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1238
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:19,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor.

1239
01:40:20,027 --> 01:40:20,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1240
01:40:21,027 --> 01:40:21,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1241
01:40:21,708 --> 01:40:21,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1242
01:40:21,928 --> 01:40:27,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to ask the gentleman, is it your intention to stay open this late every day of the week or just Thursday, Friday, Saturday?

1243
01:40:27,851 --> 01:40:32,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I told Sylvia, but for some reason she put the whole thing, but I just want to do it.

1244
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:35,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday is dead.

1245
01:40:36,432 --> 01:40:39,374
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Sundays, everybody has to go to work or school.

1246
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:39,934
[SPEAKER_11]: It's dead.

1247
01:40:39,974 --> 01:40:42,435
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no reason to stay on Monday or Tuesday.

1248
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:44,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to do it Wednesday to Saturday.

1249
01:40:45,557 --> 01:40:50,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know people start to get money and pay checks weekends, you know, definitely.

1250
01:40:51,381 --> 01:41:01,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I think it may make sense to, based upon the feedback that I think I'm receiving from my colleagues, that we put a 90-day review, grant a special permit from 11 to 12 with a 90-day review.

1251
01:41:03,313 --> 01:41:11,098
[SPEAKER_07]: If there are no instances or issues, that we will grant the automatic permit from 12 to 1 with a 90-day review.

1252
01:41:11,318 --> 01:41:17,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there are no issues thereafter, we grant a permit from 1 to 2 automatic with a 90-day review.

1253
01:41:18,563 --> 01:41:26,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I think that the last 90-day review, when the permit is in place from 1 to 2 a.m., should be restricted maybe to the Wednesday through Saturday.

1254
01:41:27,648 --> 01:41:32,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe it should be restricted Wednesday through Saturday for the 12 to 1 and the 1 to 2.

1255
01:41:33,262 --> 01:41:42,085
[SPEAKER_07]: so that we can get through the 90-day review periods with them operating Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, the extended hours, and then we can get a better feel from the neighborhood what's going on.

1256
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:43,326
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be approving it.

1257
01:41:43,346 --> 01:41:46,007
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't be approving it for seven days of the week, and we wouldn't be approving it 100%.

1258
01:41:46,607 --> 01:41:47,847
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be gradually phasing it in.

1259
01:41:47,887 --> 01:41:52,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So if any questions or concerns do arise, we'll be able to address them within short order.

1260
01:41:52,669 --> 01:41:52,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1261
01:41:53,269 --> 01:41:54,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Bozo, are you happy with that?

1262
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:55,910
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's fine.

1263
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:56,510
[SPEAKER_11]: You're fine with that?

1264
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:57,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

1265
01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:58,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for any help.

1266
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:08,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Honorable vice president of box, just so I can understand.

1267
01:42:08,316 --> 01:42:16,726
[SPEAKER_08]: So will the petitioner then appear before us in 90 days or cause I heard automatic mentioned one, one time when you were mentioning it.

1268
01:42:17,567 --> 01:42:22,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, where I was looking at it was if there's no issue that arises, if there's no concern, no complaint, then

1269
01:42:23,348 --> 01:42:25,970
[SPEAKER_07]: it automatically be granted the next level of.

1270
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:30,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so if there's one complaint that he's not going to get approved, we'll bring them in and we'll discuss it and figure out what's going on.

1271
01:42:30,512 --> 01:42:32,333
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I think he should come in automatically.

1272
01:42:32,733 --> 01:42:33,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's fine.

1273
01:42:33,974 --> 01:42:39,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be quite honest with him is I don't mind the phase, but I won't go past a 1am at any point.

1274
01:42:40,457 --> 01:42:43,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I think 2am is too much to ask for the neighborhood.

1275
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,040
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't mind the first phase to go up to midnight.

1276
01:42:46,561 --> 01:42:49,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I might even support the one depending on feedback.

1277
01:42:49,753 --> 01:42:51,694
[SPEAKER_08]: But I am definitely not going to go up to 2 a.m.

1278
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:53,334
[SPEAKER_08]: in that particular area, Mr. President.

1279
01:42:53,994 --> 01:42:56,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a fair compromise, and I'd support that wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

1280
01:42:56,895 --> 01:42:58,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing a 90-day review, bringing them back in.

1281
01:42:58,636 --> 01:43:00,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's a good way to proceed.

1282
01:43:00,357 --> 01:43:03,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It protects the neighborhood, and it also helps the business owner compete.

1283
01:43:03,058 --> 01:43:04,138
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1284
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:18,483
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, with the stipulations that we have, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso, this is a special permit, so it does need

1285
01:43:20,606 --> 01:43:22,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1286
01:43:26,871 --> 01:43:29,012
[SPEAKER_14]: He goes with the petitioner.

1287
01:43:29,072 --> 01:43:31,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be 90 days from 12 o'clock.

1288
01:43:31,934 --> 01:43:33,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Wednesday through Saturday.

1289
01:43:35,217 --> 01:43:36,378
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

1290
01:43:47,198 --> 01:43:50,160
[SPEAKER_14]: 90-day review, first 90-day review, 90-day review, 12 to 1.

1291
01:43:50,881 --> 01:43:51,301
[SPEAKER_14]: With no issues.

1292
01:44:08,847 --> 01:44:14,588
[SPEAKER_10]: 90 days to make sure that there are no problems.

1293
01:44:15,929 --> 01:44:17,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Coy, please call the roll.

1294
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:24,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe there is a section, there's a section in our agenda that, um, might indicate papers requiring action.

1295
01:44:25,151 --> 01:44:32,173
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, I'd request that, um, this matter be placed on, uh, unfinished business rather that this matter be placed on unfinished business so that it comes up in the 90 days.

1296
01:44:32,846 --> 01:44:36,108
[SPEAKER_14]: so that it's on the agenda.

1297
01:44:37,628 --> 01:44:38,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Reports do.

1298
01:44:39,069 --> 01:44:39,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1299
01:44:39,289 --> 01:44:39,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1300
01:44:39,469 --> 01:44:40,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be in there.

1301
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:42,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be on the agenda for the next 90 days.

1302
01:44:42,091 --> 01:44:43,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a date cert coming up.

1303
01:44:44,492 --> 01:44:44,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1304
01:44:45,472 --> 01:44:46,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1305
01:44:47,393 --> 01:44:47,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1306
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:47,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1307
01:44:47,894 --> 01:44:48,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1308
01:44:48,374 --> 01:44:48,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1309
01:44:49,174 --> 01:44:49,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1310
01:44:49,515 --> 01:44:49,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1311
01:44:49,735 --> 01:44:49,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1312
01:44:50,035 --> 01:44:50,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1313
01:45:00,865 --> 01:45:02,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1314
01:45:03,246 --> 01:45:04,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes, good luck.

1315
01:45:05,167 --> 01:45:05,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1316
01:45:05,487 --> 01:45:06,368
[SPEAKER_10]: See you in 90 days.

1317
01:45:06,748 --> 01:45:08,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I promise you, I'm gonna do my best.

1318
01:45:08,388 --> 01:45:10,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And bring pizzas next time for us, we're hungry, it's late.

1319
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:16,264
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, motions, orders, and resolutions.

1320
01:45:16,284 --> 01:45:39,819
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-505, offered by Vice President Mox, being resolved that the city administration perform a complete audit on the condition of our roads and provide the council with a complete assessment, including curbing, sidewalk, catch basin, sewer covers, and handicapped rents, being further resolved that the city prioritize the list according to the road and infrastructure condition.

1321
01:45:40,259 --> 01:45:41,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Mox.

1322
01:45:42,463 --> 01:45:43,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1323
01:45:44,025 --> 01:45:52,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, this has been an issue that's been on the council agenda probably for the last several years.

1324
01:45:53,869 --> 01:46:01,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's an issue that I believe is one of the top three issues that I field as a member of the city council.

1325
01:46:01,833 --> 01:46:06,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been very consistent over the years, the poor condition of our roads.

1326
01:46:07,437 --> 01:46:18,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that, in my opinion, the city really doesn't have a game plan on repairing the roads or replacing our roads.

1327
01:46:19,727 --> 01:46:25,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did a little homework and went into the engineering department last week.

1328
01:46:26,228 --> 01:46:32,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I went into the finance department to get a little information on really what we're doing as a community on our streets.

1329
01:46:33,709 --> 01:46:36,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And I found it pretty interesting, Mr. President.

1330
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:43,951
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, a lion's share of the money we receive every year to do road work comes from the state.

1331
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:46,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes from Chapter 90 money.

1332
01:46:47,332 --> 01:46:49,092
[SPEAKER_08]: And many people at home may not know,

1333
01:46:49,652 --> 01:47:02,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Chapter 90 money is a program that entitles municipalities to 100% reimbursement of documented expenditures on approved projects for maintaining

1334
01:47:02,618 --> 01:47:08,440
[SPEAKER_08]: repairing, improving, and constructing town and county ways and bridges.

1335
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:18,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So we get roughly $900,000 a year through this Chapter 90 money earmarked to improvement of our roads.

1336
01:47:18,982 --> 01:47:29,065
[SPEAKER_08]: We also get, and it fluctuates year to year, we get money from the Office of Community Development for road repair, and that could vary from

1337
01:47:30,097 --> 01:47:32,418
[SPEAKER_08]: 150,000 to 300,000 a year.

1338
01:47:32,938 --> 01:47:47,484
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're looking at roughly $1.1 million a year allocation to improve our roads from the state and actually OCD, which comes from, I believe, the federal government.

1339
01:47:48,364 --> 01:47:51,465
[SPEAKER_08]: The allocation amount is based on three different factors.

1340
01:47:52,446 --> 01:47:55,187
[SPEAKER_08]: How many road miles do you have in your community?

1341
01:47:55,727 --> 01:47:57,248
[SPEAKER_08]: That weighs in at a 58%

1342
01:47:59,946 --> 01:48:05,853
[SPEAKER_08]: .33%, so it's very important how many road miles you have in your community when they allocate this money through Chapter 90.

1343
01:48:06,433 --> 01:48:15,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Population is 20.83% of the formula, so your population size weighs in on how much money you get back.

1344
01:48:16,797 --> 01:48:18,779
[SPEAKER_08]: The employment within the community.

1345
01:48:18,799 --> 01:48:21,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have high or low employment in the community?

1346
01:48:21,902 --> 01:48:23,063
[SPEAKER_08]: That weighs in also at 20.83%.

1347
01:48:25,225 --> 01:48:33,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So all those three factors will be what determines how the state allocates this Chapter 90 money.

1348
01:48:34,398 --> 01:48:41,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And in 2018, the governor is allocating $200 million for the entire state.

1349
01:48:42,704 --> 01:48:50,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Our allocation for the city of Method, based on the three factors, we have 91 miles of road in our community.

1350
01:48:50,629 --> 01:48:52,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Our population is roughly 56,173.

1351
01:48:56,130 --> 01:49:00,954
[SPEAKER_08]: and our employment is about 18,474 in the community.

1352
01:49:01,455 --> 01:49:06,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So based on those numbers, where we average with all the other communities, we're receiving 944,095.

1353
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:12,038
[SPEAKER_08]: in dollars.

1354
01:49:12,699 --> 01:49:13,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, we received $951,000.

1355
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:19,321
[SPEAKER_08]: The prior year, FY16, $950,000.

1356
01:49:19,641 --> 01:49:22,122
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's been very consistent over the years.

1357
01:49:22,843 --> 01:49:31,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And we move forward, and we spend the money, and then we get reimbursed by the state through this Chapter 90 money.

1358
01:49:32,066 --> 01:49:34,147
[SPEAKER_08]: The unfortunate thing about it, Mr. President,

1359
01:49:34,975 --> 01:49:37,297
[SPEAKER_08]: is that's all we're putting towards the roads.

1360
01:49:37,777 --> 01:49:43,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever we get through Chapter 90, which is great, 100% reimbursement, sign me up every year.

1361
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:45,982
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a problem with that.

1362
01:49:46,543 --> 01:49:49,004
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great that we get it, but it's not enough.

1363
01:49:49,725 --> 01:49:51,166
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've been doing this for years.

1364
01:49:51,946 --> 01:49:55,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know that our roads have not improved over the years.

1365
01:49:55,749 --> 01:50:01,112
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's clear to me, when you look at these figures, that we're never gonna get ahead of the game.

1366
01:50:01,132 --> 01:50:03,914
[SPEAKER_08]: We're always gonna be chasing our tail on the roads.

1367
01:50:05,547 --> 01:50:10,230
[SPEAKER_08]: We have 730 streets in the city of Method.

1368
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,132
[SPEAKER_08]: 40% of them are private ways.

1369
01:50:12,592 --> 01:50:15,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have 292 private ways.

1370
01:50:15,714 --> 01:50:18,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Now most people will say, ha ha, I live on a private way.

1371
01:50:19,277 --> 01:50:19,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?

1372
01:50:20,277 --> 01:50:24,921
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way you're living on a private way.

1373
01:50:25,321 --> 01:50:29,864
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be because in certain circumstances, you may have to pay for it.

1374
01:50:30,829 --> 01:50:33,670
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have to pay to have a tree limb taken down.

1375
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:39,273
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have to pay to have a sidewalk done because you're on a private way.

1376
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:46,676
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of the roads, 400 city streets, and that's 60% of city streets.

1377
01:50:47,436 --> 01:50:51,778
[SPEAKER_08]: So I took a look at the numbers over the last four and a half, close to five years.

1378
01:50:52,466 --> 01:51:03,175
[SPEAKER_08]: to try to get a picture on how many streets are we doing per year, and how much money are we getting from the state, and at what point are we gonna be able to complete our streets?

1379
01:51:03,195 --> 01:51:05,477
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we hear about complete streets all the time.

1380
01:51:05,938 --> 01:51:08,900
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the biggest misnomer ever, complete streets.

1381
01:51:09,381 --> 01:51:13,444
[SPEAKER_08]: We get 500,000, we do a few small projects, and we call it complete streets.

1382
01:51:14,325 --> 01:51:17,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what they're completed, but that's what we call it.

1383
01:51:18,332 --> 01:51:26,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the past four and a half years, we've paved altogether 30 streets in the city, over four and a half years.

1384
01:51:26,818 --> 01:51:28,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to round it off to five years.

1385
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:36,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of the 30 streets, nine were full streets, where we ground the street down and repaved it.

1386
01:51:37,145 --> 01:51:40,027
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did nine full streets in almost five years.

1387
01:51:40,668 --> 01:51:43,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other 21 streets were partial.

1388
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:46,792
[SPEAKER_08]: They went up 500 yards on a road, or they went

1389
01:51:47,161 --> 01:51:50,384
[SPEAKER_08]: from one intersection to the first intersection of the street.

1390
01:51:50,684 --> 01:51:51,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So they weren't full streets.

1391
01:51:52,426 --> 01:51:58,712
[SPEAKER_08]: But for my point, Mr. President, rather than trying to figure this out, I'm gonna go based on the 30 streets.

1392
01:51:59,152 --> 01:52:02,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So this city does 30 streets every five years.

1393
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:06,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what, six streets a year, if you average it out.

1394
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,582
[SPEAKER_08]: A street, grind and repave,

1395
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:12,796
[SPEAKER_08]: which we heard tonight in Committee of the Whole meeting.

1396
01:52:14,056 --> 01:52:30,880
[SPEAKER_08]: The repaving is not lost to 2025, and that could be for increased traffic on a parking lot street and of the tire, which we heard from DPW tonight.

1397
01:52:31,581 --> 01:52:33,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But a typical grind and pave 15,

1398
01:52:38,289 --> 01:52:54,874
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you take this and logically go through it, if we continue to pave the streets every five years, after 20 years, we will have paved the streets of the 438 states.

1399
01:52:55,774 --> 01:53:05,197
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point, when we, at that point of after five years and then after 20 years,

1400
01:53:15,712 --> 01:53:17,353
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be working on 15 to 20.

1401
01:53:21,496 --> 01:53:26,659
[SPEAKER_08]: This address any of the private roads I'm talking about.

1402
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:36,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you add in the other 300 roads, the figures that I'm coming up with are strictly only going based off the streets that I considered private, which is 438.

1403
01:53:39,043 --> 01:53:52,585
[SPEAKER_08]: According to Mr. President, we will never ever, in the way we're spending, allocating money on our streets, we will never ever get ahead on repaving our roads.

1404
01:53:53,086 --> 01:53:54,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We are always going to be catching up.

1405
01:53:54,926 --> 01:53:57,826
[SPEAKER_08]: We are always going to be doing our streets piecemeal.

1406
01:53:58,647 --> 01:54:06,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked the city engineer's office, can you provide me with a list, a working list, of the next priority of streets?

1407
01:54:07,949 --> 01:54:08,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I could not get one.

1408
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:20,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I could get a list of the 30 streets that were done over the past four and a half years, but I couldn't get a street listing of what the next priorities are.

1409
01:54:20,598 --> 01:54:29,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's some of the frustration with feeling behind this reel when residents come up and say, you know, my street hasn't been looked at in six decades.

1410
01:54:31,085 --> 01:54:32,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Six decades.

1411
01:54:33,226 --> 01:54:35,368
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Mr. President, it's clear to me

1412
01:54:36,511 --> 01:54:56,207
[SPEAKER_08]: In order to get ahead of the curve, we as a city can take advantage of the Chapter 90 money and the reimbursement, but we also have to put money, allocate money in our budget every year in DPW or engineering, specifically for road repavement, Mr. President.

1413
01:54:57,428 --> 01:55:01,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we allocate an additional million dollars in that year,

1414
01:55:02,803 --> 01:55:11,808
[SPEAKER_08]: We go up from 28% of the streets that are being done in five years to 52% or 54, whatever the math comes out to.

1415
01:55:13,309 --> 01:55:18,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It has that much of an impact, adding another million dollars a year to our roads.

1416
01:55:20,174 --> 01:55:34,681
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, knowing it's the top, in my opinion, one of the top three priorities in this community, knowing that we're never going to get ahead from previous experience on the money we're receiving, that we need to do this, Mr. President.

1417
01:55:35,081 --> 01:55:43,065
[SPEAKER_08]: We as a council, during this year's budget, I'm sure other councils have other priorities, traffic engineer and a lot of other issues out there.

1418
01:55:43,455 --> 01:55:58,464
[SPEAKER_08]: But we as a council have to stand up as a body and say, you know what, based on the complaints we get, based on the poor condition of our streets, based on a number of issues, Madam Mayor, we need you to add an additional $1 million.

1419
01:55:58,484 --> 01:56:00,825
[SPEAKER_08]: $2 million would be even better.

1420
01:56:01,045 --> 01:56:02,646
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be 75% of our roads.

1421
01:56:03,167 --> 01:56:05,128
[SPEAKER_08]: $3 million would be a panacea.

1422
01:56:06,114 --> 01:56:13,036
[SPEAKER_08]: and bring us to a target level of completing all our streets after a certain number of years.

1423
01:56:14,016 --> 01:56:19,737
[SPEAKER_08]: That may not be realistic, Mr. President, but I think at least putting an additional million dollars.

1424
01:56:20,618 --> 01:56:28,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we can all talk a big game when the residents come up, and we can sympathize, and we can cry crocodile tears when they come up and say, oh my God, that's awful.

1425
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:32,520
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have to do something as a council, Mr. President.

1426
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:35,261
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to stand up and take action.

1427
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:37,752
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is the only way it's gonna happen.

1428
01:56:37,972 --> 01:56:42,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever heard anyone from the city administration step up and say, we need more money for the roads?

1429
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:44,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely not, Mr. President.

1430
01:56:45,956 --> 01:56:59,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been on this council 16 years, Mr. President, and I've never heard one person from DPW, engineering, or the city administration ever step up and say, you know what, based on the poor condition of our roads, we need some additional funding.

1431
01:57:02,543 --> 01:57:05,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Received a number of pitches via email,

1432
01:57:07,152 --> 01:57:08,452
[SPEAKER_08]: because this was on the agenda.

1433
01:57:09,233 --> 01:57:15,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And the street, that are sinking.

1434
01:57:16,235 --> 01:57:23,077
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, the chapter is used not just to repave, it's used for infrastructure improvements.

1435
01:57:23,657 --> 01:57:29,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have a catch basin that's sinking, that money can be used to rebuild the catch basin.

1436
01:57:30,259 --> 01:57:36,801
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a manhole cover that's sinking or has potholes all around it, that could be used to fix the manhole cover.

1437
01:57:37,429 --> 01:57:43,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You have curbing that's level with the street now, like Riverside Ave that I've been complaining about, Mr. President.

1438
01:57:44,596 --> 01:57:47,839
[SPEAKER_08]: When you drive down Riverside Ave, the curbing is level with the road.

1439
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:49,841
[SPEAKER_08]: How unsafe is that?

1440
01:57:51,963 --> 01:57:57,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the infrastructure improvements, Mr. President, along with sidewalks as well, that can be done with this money.

1441
01:57:58,629 --> 01:57:59,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my opinion,

1442
01:58:00,135 --> 01:58:07,860
[SPEAKER_08]: It's long overdue, it's a top issue in this community, public safety and roads, and we need to address it, Mr. President.

1443
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:17,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to give people an idea what it cost, Stearns Ave in South Method had their road repaved not too long ago.

1444
01:58:18,046 --> 01:58:22,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was back in 2013, it was a few years back.

1445
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:28,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And that street, which probably has maybe 12 homes the length of the street,

1446
01:58:29,303 --> 01:58:36,866
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe 13, cost the city $85,000 for a full grind and a repave.

1447
01:58:38,126 --> 01:58:48,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it puts it in perspective, knowing the size of that street and comparing it to other streets, that we can get through a lot of streets if we put the money towards it.

1448
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:55,552
[SPEAKER_08]: We can accomplish our goals if we're able, Mr. President, to make this a priority, which it should be.

1449
01:58:56,910 --> 01:59:00,211
[SPEAKER_08]: You shouldn't have to use radar when you're running down the streets.

1450
01:59:01,552 --> 01:59:03,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I come down the streets, I know exactly where the potholes are.

1451
01:59:04,013 --> 01:59:06,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I go like that driving, I know exactly where they are.

1452
01:59:06,714 --> 01:59:11,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where the manhole covers are too low, I know where all the bumps are, and it's a shame, Mr. President.

1453
01:59:12,296 --> 01:59:18,478
[SPEAKER_08]: That shows you how long that our roads have been inflicted with these ripples and potholes.

1454
01:59:19,258 --> 01:59:23,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would respectfully ask my colleagues, Mr. President, on a vote tonight,

1455
01:59:24,271 --> 01:59:40,412
[SPEAKER_08]: To ask the mayor, I know we just received some of our budget and we got our budget book and we're gonna start meeting with department heads, that, and this is in the early stages of the budget, we haven't sat down at all yet, that a million dollars be appropriated, Mr. President.

1456
01:59:40,852 --> 01:59:50,778
[SPEAKER_08]: towards the repaving of our roads and that we also have a systematic approach on priorities of roads that need to be repaired.

1457
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:56,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't have to go to the engineering office and say, well, we really don't have a list.

1458
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:59,563
[SPEAKER_08]: It's done by calls that we receive.

1459
01:59:59,883 --> 02:00:01,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we go out and look at them.

1460
02:00:02,604 --> 02:00:05,206
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if the mayor wants to do them, we get them done.

1461
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:08,751
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's really no list, Mr. President.

1462
02:00:09,011 --> 02:00:20,134
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be a list on the city website that any resident can go there and see if they're on the priority list, see where their street falls, and expect a date that their street may be done, Mr. President.

1463
02:00:20,835 --> 02:00:22,035
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not rocket science.

1464
02:00:23,667 --> 02:00:31,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, as I preference my remarks all the time, this is no reflection on a depleted DPW department.

1465
02:00:32,473 --> 02:00:36,016
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no reflection on the good work that they do, Mr. President.

1466
02:00:36,456 --> 02:00:48,165
[SPEAKER_08]: But clearly, you know, from past experience and from past knowledge, that we're going nowhere how we're currently operating with repraving our streets.

1467
02:00:48,485 --> 02:00:51,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And I offer this, Mr. President, as a way to

1468
02:00:52,670 --> 02:01:05,538
[SPEAKER_08]: have an approach that can address one of the top concerns from residents that contact me, phone me, email me, stop me at stop and shop, or wherever else I am, about the condition of our roads.

1469
02:01:05,898 --> 02:01:17,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that in a formal vote tonight, Mr. President, that we request the mayor put an additional million dollars in the paving budget for either DPW or engineering.

1470
02:01:18,786 --> 02:01:19,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1471
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:30,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, several months ago this council voted on a resolution that I sponsored requesting that the DPW perform a complete assessment of our streets.

1472
02:01:30,785 --> 02:01:35,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And the resolution requested that they consider adopting new technology.

1473
02:01:35,948 --> 02:01:39,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now there is an opportunity for the city of Medford to utilize infrared technology.

1474
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:46,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And it pretty much is a truck that drives down the street and takes an x-ray of the road and uses infrared technology to determine

1475
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,621
[SPEAKER_07]: the quality of the infrastructure below the ground, as well as the defects of the infrastructure above the ground, Mr. President.

1476
02:01:52,801 --> 02:01:55,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had the opportunity to take a look at one of these machines.

1477
02:01:55,502 --> 02:02:00,323
[SPEAKER_07]: A local business on Mystic Avenue, Millennium Power Sweeping, is in possession of one.

1478
02:02:00,563 --> 02:02:03,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And this tool can work miracles.

1479
02:02:03,903 --> 02:02:11,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It can repair potholes and do a whole entire assessment of the roadway all in one felt swoop, Mr. President.

1480
02:02:13,037 --> 02:02:15,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly think that this is a noble resolution.

1481
02:02:17,178 --> 02:02:19,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if a million bucks is going to be enough, Mr. President.

1482
02:02:20,059 --> 02:02:33,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're going to be putting out a budget where we're looking to add $1 million to it, and this budget is funded by taxpayers, I don't think that it would be right to opt out of the budget.

1483
02:02:34,061 --> 02:02:39,002
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're going to add a million, we should be responsible and also make this a zero-sum game.

1484
02:02:39,583 --> 02:02:41,883
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I can certainly understand the councilor's frustration.

1485
02:02:42,962 --> 02:02:50,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And I expressed that in our subcommittee meeting this morning.

1486
02:02:51,571 --> 02:03:00,240
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I would like to include in this resolution an amendment asking that, number one, the infrared technology be utilized, and number two, I think that it's important.

1487
02:03:06,295 --> 02:03:08,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe do a trial run with the truck.

1488
02:03:09,618 --> 02:03:11,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe that they've done that already, Mr. President.

1489
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:24,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that Millennium might have been utilized to do a test run, performing repairs to some cracks on some basketball courts to show how far along technology has come.

1490
02:03:25,153 --> 02:03:27,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So I certainly don't have a problem.

1491
02:03:28,292 --> 02:03:33,753
[SPEAKER_07]: asking for a complete assessment, and I think it's premature to request funding until we get the assessment done, because we really don't know what it's going to cost.

1492
02:03:33,813 --> 02:03:38,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Councilman Marks has done a great job putting this resolve together, and he's done a lot of homework on it.

1493
02:03:39,455 --> 02:03:41,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like an opportunity to review the numbers a little further.

1494
02:03:42,075 --> 02:03:49,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get a response from the administration that it would cost about $7 million to pave our emergency arteries in their entirety.

1495
02:03:49,517 --> 02:03:55,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And the question comes is whether or not we can use taxation money to do that, or if there are other funding sources that are available to us as well.

1496
02:03:55,904 --> 02:04:03,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly can appreciate the resolution, however, for us right now to add a million dollars to the proposed budget I think is premature.

1497
02:04:03,266 --> 02:04:07,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should start our budget discussions and deliberations and find out where money's going.

1498
02:04:08,327 --> 02:04:20,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Based on last year's fiscal year budget, I think we have close to $605,000 of money that's used for contracted services, for services that could be performed in-house that's being performed out-house, for services that could go towards paying for salaries to

1499
02:04:21,327 --> 02:04:23,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, replete the DPW staff.

1500
02:04:23,088 --> 02:04:25,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a number of items that we need to look at, Mr. President.

1501
02:04:25,388 --> 02:04:28,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a priority, but there are other priorities as well as the council and noted.

1502
02:04:28,949 --> 02:04:32,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I can certainly stand behind the resolution to ask for the assessment.

1503
02:04:32,711 --> 02:04:38,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, however, at this point in time, I'd feel very uncomfortable requesting that a million dollars be added to the budget without further discussion to liberation and investigation.

1504
02:04:38,913 --> 02:04:46,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, the vice president box, the council will have mentioned that he asked for the assessment back several months.

1505
02:04:46,395 --> 02:04:48,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we get a copy of the assessment?

1506
02:04:48,696 --> 02:04:49,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we got it.

1507
02:04:49,336 --> 02:04:49,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh,

1508
02:04:50,843 --> 02:04:54,085
[SPEAKER_06]: We were supposed to get it on the 31st, but we haven't got it yet, according to the meeting that we just had.

1509
02:04:54,145 --> 02:04:56,526
[SPEAKER_08]: So we haven't got anything based on the resolution you offered?

1510
02:04:56,926 --> 02:05:00,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we got a response saying that they'll look into it.

1511
02:05:00,148 --> 02:05:00,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1512
02:05:00,648 --> 02:05:00,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1513
02:05:00,928 --> 02:05:02,389
[SPEAKER_08]: So we haven't got anything back.

1514
02:05:02,529 --> 02:05:05,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in my opinion... Well, we got a response back.

1515
02:05:05,951 --> 02:05:08,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We can ask again, which is great.

1516
02:05:08,032 --> 02:05:09,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no problem asking again.

1517
02:05:09,833 --> 02:05:14,035
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think, you know, people are tired of hearing about the ask and want to see action.

1518
02:05:14,695 --> 02:05:19,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think asking for a million dollars in the budget is action, Mr. President, that will result

1519
02:05:19,972 --> 02:05:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: in the repaving of streets and not just a proposal.

1520
02:05:24,536 --> 02:05:34,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree and I voted for the x-raying of streets and so forth, but I haven't seen a response back, so I'm not going to put too much credibility into that.

1521
02:05:35,526 --> 02:05:36,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather see some action.

1522
02:05:36,947 --> 02:05:40,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, we do have money that's already appropriated for the paving of Evans Street and Parris Street.

1523
02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:42,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we've seen that happen either, and the money's there.

1524
02:05:48,272 --> 02:05:48,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1525
02:05:49,112 --> 02:05:50,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

1526
02:05:50,713 --> 02:05:51,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

1527
02:05:52,014 --> 02:05:54,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford.

1528
02:05:54,935 --> 02:05:58,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank the Council Vice President for bringing this very important issue up.

1529
02:05:59,177 --> 02:06:07,981
[SPEAKER_17]: If you drive on Route 60, right at the Park Street, there is a trolley track or a train track exposed in the road.

1530
02:06:08,361 --> 02:06:15,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, a couple of years back, in front of the littlest laundromat, which is diagonal to that, the street literally caved in a big chunk

1531
02:06:16,862 --> 02:06:18,223
[SPEAKER_17]: the street caved in.

1532
02:06:18,703 --> 02:06:31,731
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what's under Salem Street but we do know that people from out of town use exit 32 as a speedway to get to Malden and Revere because they don't want to go route 16 which has about double the lights.

1533
02:06:32,112 --> 02:06:34,033
[SPEAKER_17]: I've counted them as I've encountered both roads.

1534
02:06:34,833 --> 02:06:39,016
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about double the lights on route 16 and imagine what happens when the casino comes in.

1535
02:06:39,356 --> 02:06:40,177
[SPEAKER_17]: So they use route 60

1536
02:06:41,202 --> 02:06:43,524
[SPEAKER_17]: which I don't think is a federal road, I think it's a Medford road.

1537
02:06:44,124 --> 02:06:47,806
[SPEAKER_17]: The crosswalks are abysmal right now, again, and they were painted last year.

1538
02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:50,868
[SPEAKER_17]: So last summer they were painted, this summer they're fading.

1539
02:06:51,529 --> 02:06:58,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Tonight, both sides, they weren't going 20 miles an hour, which is the road, that's the speed limit.

1540
02:06:59,654 --> 02:07:03,116
[SPEAKER_17]: One car had to be going 55 miles an hour, they just fly by.

1541
02:07:03,676 --> 02:07:06,318
[SPEAKER_17]: And Councilor De La Russo had noted that he agreed

1542
02:07:07,922 --> 02:07:09,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Route 60 is a mess.

1543
02:07:09,823 --> 02:07:19,428
[SPEAKER_17]: So you have our infrastructure, you have the streets like this, you have people coming from out of town, and we have this mess that's on this main dragway, which is Route 60.

1544
02:07:19,509 --> 02:07:36,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Public access TV, of course, could expose a lot more of this, but I just want this council to be aware that there's, you know, speed bumps aren't gonna help, and we can't put too many lights in, but there is a problem, and I'm wondering if any councilor knows how many times the city's been sued over broken roads.

1545
02:07:36,765 --> 02:07:38,166
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something to consider as well.

1546
02:07:38,566 --> 02:07:49,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we're getting sued over broken roads, if people are coming from out of town and zipping down 60, is that expense, could that be offset by paving that road in particular?

1547
02:07:50,431 --> 02:07:50,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1548
02:07:51,591 --> 02:07:51,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1549
02:07:52,652 --> 02:07:53,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

1550
02:07:54,272 --> 02:07:56,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean, 35 Paris Street.

1551
02:07:57,394 --> 02:08:00,135
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time we spoke about potholes, I told you all that.

1552
02:08:00,755 --> 02:08:03,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know the last time Paris Street was paved.

1553
02:08:03,476 --> 02:08:05,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone reached out and advised me.

1554
02:08:05,938 --> 02:08:13,543
[SPEAKER_01]: But the last time Parris Street was paved, they watched it from the window of the Curtis School as Beatlemania hit the United States in 1964.

1555
02:08:14,024 --> 02:08:16,886
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the last time Parris Street was paved.

1556
02:08:17,266 --> 02:08:24,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not surprised to hear that within the next century, we may only see another 50 of Medford's roads attended to.

1557
02:08:26,413 --> 02:08:28,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it interesting that 30 roads have been done.

1558
02:08:28,934 --> 02:08:34,859
[SPEAKER_01]: And through the chair, I'd be curious to know if a single one on the north side of Medford has been done, because I

1559
02:08:35,878 --> 02:08:41,639
[SPEAKER_01]: have said repeatedly that our side of the city has really seen no attention whatsoever.

1560
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:44,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Not roads, not sidewalks.

1561
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:59,743
[SPEAKER_01]: But it sounds like maybe that's not a bad thing based upon the committee of the whole meeting tonight that we heard about the poor quality of the hot top and asphalt that is coming out probably for any number of reasons.

1562
02:08:59,843 --> 02:09:02,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But 1964 was the last time Parry Street was paved.

1563
02:09:05,038 --> 02:09:07,699
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not really had our potholes attended to.

1564
02:09:07,819 --> 02:09:12,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love to see some additional funding put towards this.

1565
02:09:12,961 --> 02:09:16,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to be greedy.

1566
02:09:16,462 --> 02:09:28,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I would even be happy with key cut, properly filled potholes, rather than potholes that have some attention given to them as a band-aid for the short term.

1567
02:09:28,465 --> 02:09:33,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think many people might say,

1568
02:09:33,759 --> 02:09:42,266
[SPEAKER_01]: to spread that across a little bit more and have equitable repair of those potholes that are causing the most damage.

1569
02:09:42,906 --> 02:09:46,629
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not have to be in one place, certainly.

1570
02:09:46,789 --> 02:09:52,233
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, 1964 was the last time our streets saw any attention.

1571
02:09:52,754 --> 02:09:53,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1572
02:09:53,054 --> 02:09:53,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1573
02:09:55,615 --> 02:09:56,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

1574
02:09:57,278 --> 02:09:58,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1575
02:09:58,480 --> 02:09:59,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 281 Park Street.

1576
02:10:00,303 --> 02:10:03,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Our street was the fortunate benefactor of about 13 years ago.

1577
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:06,494
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did get our street paid, so yay us.

1578
02:10:06,915 --> 02:10:08,017
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the school on our street.

1579
02:10:08,833 --> 02:10:09,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy about that.

1580
02:10:09,873 --> 02:10:21,617
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really hope that a million dollars is put into the budget for street paving because it's nice to have ribbon cuttings, it's nice to add nice-to-haves to the city and beautiful parks and things, but we need the roads.

1581
02:10:21,937 --> 02:10:23,878
[SPEAKER_00]: The roads are what we use every single day.

1582
02:10:24,378 --> 02:10:27,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Every citizen in Medford wants the roads being repaired.

1583
02:10:27,999 --> 02:10:37,302
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents did have the cutouts done on their street, but they ran out of the asphalt halfway down and the rest of the street wasn't repaired properly.

1584
02:10:38,717 --> 02:10:39,798
[SPEAKER_00]: and serious disrepair.

1585
02:10:40,158 --> 02:10:46,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone who knows any street know they're off in the heights yesterday and I couldn't believe some of them.

1586
02:10:47,981 --> 02:10:51,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually speaking to people earlier that it's like the surface.

1587
02:10:52,343 --> 02:10:54,945
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really hope that some attention is given to our roads.

1588
02:10:54,965 --> 02:10:56,405
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quality of life issue.

1589
02:10:57,086 --> 02:10:57,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1590
02:10:57,466 --> 02:10:58,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1591
02:10:59,427 --> 02:11:00,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address of the record, please.

1592
02:11:01,088 --> 02:11:02,128
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1593
02:11:05,444 --> 02:11:08,245
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank Vice President Marks for bringing this up tonight.

1594
02:11:08,646 --> 02:11:12,187
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't know how many times I've been up here speaking about Evans Street.

1595
02:11:12,948 --> 02:11:19,711
[SPEAKER_20]: With all due respect, I respect the intentions of bringing in technology to look at the roads.

1596
02:11:19,771 --> 02:11:24,553
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, as Councillor Marks said, he's gotten, what, how many pictures came in?

1597
02:11:25,114 --> 02:11:29,536
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we know what the conditions of the roads and streets are.

1598
02:11:29,616 --> 02:11:33,438
[SPEAKER_20]: And to try to make it a little bit bigger of a picture,

1599
02:11:35,239 --> 02:11:40,002
[SPEAKER_20]: These kind of improvements go towards growing our community.

1600
02:11:41,422 --> 02:11:44,024
[SPEAKER_20]: I want more people to move and live in Medford.

1601
02:11:44,364 --> 02:11:54,350
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, with the problems we're having with airplanes and everything else, more improvement on parks, which has actually been excellent in the last year and a half, I have to say.

1602
02:11:54,870 --> 02:11:56,371
[SPEAKER_20]: The park improvements have been good.

1603
02:11:56,791 --> 02:11:58,452
[SPEAKER_20]: But if we add this million dollars,

1604
02:11:59,436 --> 02:12:09,542
[SPEAKER_20]: To further improve our city and make it aesthetically pleasing and get more people to move here To make our community stronger.

1605
02:12:09,922 --> 02:12:19,047
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it would be great and to make it a zero-sum game I know the council is in the administration and a lot of people don't want to hear this but perhaps a 20% reduction

1606
02:12:20,338 --> 02:12:33,924
[SPEAKER_20]: and certain pay grades might help to offset certain costs so that we can make these improvements to make our city a much better place to live in, move to, raise a family, and improve our schools.

1607
02:12:34,324 --> 02:12:40,887
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the facade at Medford High School, I think, is still in need of a million dollar repair.

1608
02:12:40,907 --> 02:12:42,027
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a figure that I heard.

1609
02:12:42,047 --> 02:12:43,488
[SPEAKER_20]: I could be speaking out of turn.

1610
02:12:43,508 --> 02:12:43,868
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

1611
02:12:44,396 --> 02:12:47,078
[SPEAKER_20]: that exactly, but I do know it does need repairs.

1612
02:12:47,798 --> 02:12:59,526
[SPEAKER_20]: And moving forward, I would hope that when you look at this budget that you're going to debate, we look into certain areas, because I took a look at it before coming up here.

1613
02:13:00,073 --> 02:13:24,012
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, to see millions of dollars in the pay grades and having to beg for a necessity like streets and roads kind of makes no sense to the people that are at home watching, seeing their water tax go up, their property taxes go up every year, a surcharge on the property tax, the excise taxes that I think are specifically supposed to be used for street and road improvements.

1614
02:13:24,072 --> 02:13:25,673
[SPEAKER_20]: And what are we getting for it?

1615
02:13:26,153 --> 02:13:28,375
[SPEAKER_20]: A city councilor who has to bring up again

1616
02:13:28,898 --> 02:13:36,300
[SPEAKER_20]: for how many years now, a simple thing like fixing the streets and roads to make Medford strong.

1617
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:38,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Take that slogan off of a T-shirt.

1618
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:40,120
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's put it into reality.

1619
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:41,181
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1620
02:13:41,501 --> 02:13:41,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1621
02:13:42,121 --> 02:13:42,901
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion.

1622
02:13:42,941 --> 02:13:46,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to settle, Mr. President.

1623
02:13:48,662 --> 02:13:49,842
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

1624
02:13:50,002 --> 02:13:52,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Nathan Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave, Medford, Mass.

1625
02:13:53,047 --> 02:13:56,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Martz, Vice President Martz, for bringing up this issue.

1626
02:13:57,108 --> 02:14:02,869
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a resident on Riverside Ave, I can personally attest that the curbs are very low.

1627
02:14:02,949 --> 02:14:13,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Back in 2014, in October, a car drove through my front yard, took out my fence, and hit the steps at what was the REMAX building on the corner of Riverside and Locust.

1628
02:14:14,131 --> 02:14:15,571
[SPEAKER_19]: So there is a need.

1629
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:22,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, for the record, I'm sure you're all aware that Wegmans is going to be open soon.

1630
02:14:22,949 --> 02:14:33,932
[SPEAKER_19]: So in terms of prioritization, maybe when these big projects are happening and you know that, hey, a place like that's going to open, if you're going to choose to repair roads, it may be a good time to do that and a bad time.

1631
02:14:34,732 --> 02:14:40,074
[SPEAKER_19]: You just talked a lot about the inconvenience on Boston Ave, you know, to the residents there.

1632
02:14:40,194 --> 02:14:42,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, what do you think is going to happen when Wegmans opens up?

1633
02:14:42,995 --> 02:14:46,596
[SPEAKER_19]: There won't be a good time to fix Riverside Ave for a very long time.

1634
02:14:48,076 --> 02:14:50,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Finally, as far as how to come up with a million dollars,

1635
02:14:51,554 --> 02:15:01,983
[SPEAKER_19]: So I see that, Lynn, I know this is kind of further in business, but the city is looking to raise $1 million ahead of time from our water bills.

1636
02:15:02,003 --> 02:15:04,505
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a notice I got in the mail the other day.

1637
02:15:05,946 --> 02:15:07,127
[SPEAKER_19]: We can come up with a million bucks.

1638
02:15:08,728 --> 02:15:13,712
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor Burke is also asking for, what, 900K for a leak detection system?

1639
02:15:15,754 --> 02:15:16,575
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a million dollars.

1640
02:15:16,955 --> 02:15:19,097
[SPEAKER_19]: So you could say no to that, and there's a million bucks.

1641
02:15:20,197 --> 02:15:20,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1642
02:15:21,327 --> 02:15:21,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1643
02:15:25,268 --> 02:15:31,330
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor, Vice President Marks, seconded by?

1644
02:15:33,371 --> 02:15:35,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Councilor Naita Seva.

1645
02:15:35,812 --> 02:15:37,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

1646
02:15:37,592 --> 02:15:38,593
[SPEAKER_21]: Castaneda, Cushman Street.

1647
02:15:39,093 --> 02:15:48,436
[SPEAKER_21]: This past gentleman brought up a corner location where a car went through his fence and onto the corner

1648
02:15:48,924 --> 02:15:51,145
[SPEAKER_21]: location, I believe it was called RE max.

1649
02:15:52,125 --> 02:15:54,146
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it's also my memory.

1650
02:15:54,186 --> 02:16:13,095
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe counselor Penta had said one that we should have used money by that corner piece of real estate when it was for sale, especially now with more tractor trailers trying to navigate that turn.

1651
02:16:14,367 --> 02:16:15,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Very dangerous.

1652
02:16:15,687 --> 02:16:18,828
[SPEAKER_21]: And in hindsight, I believe the gentleman was right in the past.

1653
02:16:21,129 --> 02:16:21,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1654
02:16:22,990 --> 02:16:27,051
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion that has to be severed by Councilor Knight.

1655
02:16:27,071 --> 02:16:27,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1656
02:16:28,331 --> 02:16:29,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1657
02:16:30,392 --> 02:16:31,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1658
02:16:32,013 --> 02:16:32,533
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be brief.

1659
02:16:32,593 --> 02:16:36,834
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we are very frustrated with the state of our roads.

1660
02:16:37,114 --> 02:16:39,295
[SPEAKER_18]: I've voiced my opinion in the last several weeks.

1661
02:16:40,837 --> 02:16:49,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Luckily, we did have a meeting with the DPW director and head of DPW this evening, and it is discouraging.

1662
02:16:49,942 --> 02:16:59,007
[SPEAKER_18]: The crews are out there, they said, on a daily basis working to repair our roads and fix potholes and try to fix manhole covers.

1663
02:16:59,187 --> 02:17:05,791
[SPEAKER_18]: I see the patches all over the place, and the complaints, from what I understand, are 60

1664
02:17:09,212 --> 02:17:12,355
[SPEAKER_18]: complaints on C-Click Fix, just for potholes.

1665
02:17:13,095 --> 02:17:19,101
[SPEAKER_18]: And I specifically asked, are we working just with regards to the potholes on a complaint basis?

1666
02:17:19,221 --> 02:17:21,563
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the state that we're in.

1667
02:17:22,263 --> 02:17:25,206
[SPEAKER_18]: We're understaffed and we're working just on complaints.

1668
02:17:25,666 --> 02:17:29,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, there are potholes and problems all over our streets.

1669
02:17:30,130 --> 02:17:35,335
[SPEAKER_18]: And to go into Evans Street and Parris Street, there's many other roads that need resurfacing.

1670
02:17:35,415 --> 02:17:36,616
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think what we're hearing

1671
02:17:37,648 --> 02:17:41,229
[SPEAKER_18]: is we have a budget to review and a request for a million dollars.

1672
02:17:41,269 --> 02:17:43,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that comes from frustration.

1673
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:45,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, too, am very frustrated.

1674
02:17:45,551 --> 02:18:00,636
[SPEAKER_18]: So whether it's a million dollars or half a million or even just a plan to be put in place that we're doing more than five streets a year, from what I understand through Council Marks' research, we need more.

1675
02:18:00,857 --> 02:18:02,377
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to have more in this budget.

1676
02:18:02,417 --> 02:18:04,658
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are places that you can trim.

1677
02:18:05,367 --> 02:18:07,327
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a number of different things that can be done.

1678
02:18:07,347 --> 02:18:09,268
[SPEAKER_18]: We have $9 million in free cash.

1679
02:18:10,148 --> 02:18:18,210
[SPEAKER_18]: We should be committing every year to put more than $950,000 into repaving and fixing our streets.

1680
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:19,470
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the bottom line.

1681
02:18:20,210 --> 02:18:31,132
[SPEAKER_18]: So whether we vote for a million tonight or we discuss it at budget time, I'm in support of putting more than what Chapter 90 funds allows us to put into our streets.

1682
02:18:31,352 --> 02:18:33,913
[SPEAKER_18]: We as a city are taxing our residents.

1683
02:18:34,672 --> 02:18:39,614
[SPEAKER_18]: on every level, we need to be able to give them a safe, proper place to drive.

1684
02:18:41,395 --> 02:18:57,582
[SPEAKER_18]: That is the bottom line, and I appreciate the resolution and see where it goes, but the bottom line is we need to dedicate more time, whether that's hiring more manpower, buying more fill, things need to be done that are not being done now.

1685
02:18:58,222 --> 02:18:58,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1686
02:18:59,243 --> 02:19:00,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1687
02:19:00,876 --> 02:19:02,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you, Mr. President.

1688
02:19:02,737 --> 02:19:07,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate council marks to bring this up because it is the number one concern we have in our community.

1689
02:19:08,058 --> 02:19:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if, if in a daily basis, I think that, um, most communities don't go to the city council meetings and put potholes on, uh, on their agenda.

1690
02:19:21,301 --> 02:19:23,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel, I feel for that.

1691
02:19:23,402 --> 02:19:27,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I, but, uh, I think that, uh, going through the budget,

1692
02:19:27,954 --> 02:19:41,961
[SPEAKER_04]: and being fiscally responsible to what we see, because I don't want to be in a position where we're being held accountable for losing other city necessities.

1693
02:19:42,241 --> 02:19:45,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important that the budget season comes up.

1694
02:19:45,882 --> 02:19:55,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm supporting Councilor Marks' process that during the budget time I will stand by him with the million or more

1695
02:19:56,058 --> 02:19:59,660
[SPEAKER_04]: and looking into other avenues as free cash.

1696
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:07,244
[SPEAKER_04]: But until we have that budget meeting, I think it's important that we hear what is upon us in the next week.

1697
02:20:07,524 --> 02:20:22,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Saturday, I believe, is going to be a very interesting day and long day, but it's going to be something that I think all of us have heard and all of us sitting at a table would really

1698
02:20:22,558 --> 02:20:28,465
[SPEAKER_04]: stress the fact that streets and our roads are gonna be one of our number one priorities, so.

1699
02:20:28,825 --> 02:20:29,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1700
02:20:30,226 --> 02:20:30,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

1701
02:20:31,288 --> 02:20:32,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1702
02:20:32,269 --> 02:20:35,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate my colleagues' comments.

1703
02:20:35,452 --> 02:20:39,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's remember, this council cannot add to the city budget.

1704
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:53,897
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a request by the council based on years of previous experience that we can't continue to operate the way we're doing business and expect our roads to get completed, Mr. President.

1705
02:20:54,337 --> 02:20:57,418
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all this is, to open up dialogue and discussion.

1706
02:20:57,839 --> 02:21:01,120
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't be, you know, hell-bent on, oh, a million dollars.

1707
02:21:01,140 --> 02:21:08,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to open up discussion and dialogue and to let the mayor know that there's a need in this community, Mr. President.

1708
02:21:08,935 --> 02:21:11,841
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Councilor Langel-Kern talked about we have $8,239,000 in free cash.

1709
02:21:11,881 --> 02:21:13,063
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be used for roads, Mr. President.

1710
02:21:21,092 --> 02:21:22,313
[SPEAKER_08]: We have linkage money.

1711
02:21:23,053 --> 02:21:39,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We're one of just a few communities in the entire state that when development comes in over a certain size, whether it's a rehab or new development, we charge a certain percentage to linkage for infrastructure improvements, like the gentleman that lives on Riverside Ave said.

1712
02:21:40,433 --> 02:21:41,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that be a novelty?

1713
02:21:42,174 --> 02:21:56,063
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when Wegmans comes in, because they're gonna pay linkage to this community, that a certain percent goes to the infrastructure around that particular area to improve access and to improve pedestrian safety, Mr. President.

1714
02:21:56,623 --> 02:21:59,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's plenty of money available.

1715
02:22:00,085 --> 02:22:04,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't get caught up on whether or not a million dollars and we're gonna have to cut something.

1716
02:22:04,468 --> 02:22:05,869
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're not talking about cuts at all.

1717
02:22:06,249 --> 02:22:16,977
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to present this to the mayor saying, Madam Mayor, whether it's through linkage, free certified free cash, or any other venue that you can think of, we need to do a better job.

1718
02:22:17,417 --> 02:22:26,023
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I mentioned earlier, the $950,000 we receive every year in Chapter 90 money is just not footing the bill in this community.

1719
02:22:26,463 --> 02:22:27,244
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's evident.

1720
02:22:28,044 --> 02:22:28,584
[SPEAKER_08]: It's evident.

1721
02:22:28,925 --> 02:22:37,390
[SPEAKER_08]: These streets are the worst I've seen in my, I don't want to date myself now, but I've been driving 30 years on these streets, Mr. President.

1722
02:22:38,411 --> 02:22:39,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're the worst I've ever seen.

1723
02:22:39,852 --> 02:22:44,035
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a problem and it exists and we have to address it.

1724
02:22:44,735 --> 02:22:48,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can ask for all the reports and all the different studies, but you know what?

1725
02:22:49,753 --> 02:22:50,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take some action.

1726
02:22:51,334 --> 02:22:52,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put money in the budget.

1727
02:22:52,874 --> 02:22:56,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get money out of certified free cash and move forward.

1728
02:22:56,316 --> 02:22:59,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get a list of priorities and start moving forward on these streets.

1729
02:23:00,098 --> 02:23:05,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And rather than see six a year, Mr. President, let's look at 15 to 20 streets a year.

1730
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:10,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we'll make some headway and get ahead of ourselves, Mr. President.

1731
02:23:11,002 --> 02:23:12,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I was offered tonight, Mr. President.

1732
02:23:13,223 --> 02:23:14,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not asking anyone behind this real

1733
02:23:15,147 --> 02:23:18,829
[SPEAKER_08]: to make decisions tonight on cutting out something within the budget.

1734
02:23:19,069 --> 02:23:22,391
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is to start discussion and dialogue.

1735
02:23:22,831 --> 02:23:29,234
[SPEAKER_08]: This, in my opinion, is warranted, and I have the proof.

1736
02:23:29,594 --> 02:23:42,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll send my council colleagues the emails I've received from pitches around the community, and I ask Mr. President for support of this tonight, to send the message a shot across the bow,

1737
02:23:43,621 --> 02:23:45,622
[SPEAKER_08]: and to let her know that we're serious about this.

1738
02:23:46,262 --> 02:23:49,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not going to just be another rubber stamp on the FY18 budget.

1739
02:23:50,844 --> 02:23:53,866
[SPEAKER_08]: This council wants some action and some results, Mr. President.

1740
02:23:54,126 --> 02:24:00,428
[SPEAKER_08]: You yourself said we've had more committee of the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings and push more new ordinances forward.

1741
02:24:01,129 --> 02:24:04,710
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also get some results when it comes to infrastructure in this community.

1742
02:24:05,271 --> 02:24:06,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1743
02:24:07,432 --> 02:24:08,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

1744
02:24:08,672 --> 02:24:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1745
02:24:09,252 --> 02:24:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1746
02:24:10,113 --> 02:24:12,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this resolution forward.

1747
02:24:13,490 --> 02:24:17,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important, you're right, it is important to open the dialogue and to talk about issues like this.

1748
02:24:18,353 --> 02:24:23,616
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an issue that impacts every neighbourhood throughout this city.

1749
02:24:24,337 --> 02:24:27,359
[SPEAKER_02]: The roads are in terrible condition.

1750
02:24:27,419 --> 02:24:32,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all the roads but a great percentage are in pretty bad shape.

1751
02:24:32,722 --> 02:24:37,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to ‑‑ I definitely would support an audit on the roads and prioritizing

1752
02:24:40,030 --> 02:24:43,671
[SPEAKER_02]: reconstructing some of the roads and resurfacing some of the roads.

1753
02:24:44,171 --> 02:25:01,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I also believe that the states, if we're getting money from, getting Chapter 90 funding for rehabilitating the roads, and if we're getting funding from, some funding from the federal government through OCD funds, we probably should be actually taking some money.

1754
02:25:01,913 --> 02:25:05,936
[SPEAKER_02]: from the city, we should probably take a look to see if there is any money in available accounts.

1755
02:25:06,317 --> 02:25:08,959
[SPEAKER_02]: To put it towards the roads, we should be investing in ourselves.

1756
02:25:10,380 --> 02:25:20,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there are surplus funds that we could take, and maybe it's not a million dollars, but maybe it's a start, maybe we can find some funding, then maybe we should do that.

1757
02:25:20,587 --> 02:25:23,710
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it is something that we should take a look at.

1758
02:25:24,030 --> 02:25:26,011
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be willing to reinvest in our city.

1759
02:25:26,832 --> 02:25:28,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We get state funding, we get federal funding.

1760

1761
02:25:31,446 --> 02:25:41,030
[SPEAKER_02]: to see what we can actually put into reinvesting in ourselves, reinvesting in our city and making it a better place and making better neighborhoods with smoother roads and improving the quality of life.

1762
02:25:41,551 --> 02:25:43,191

[SPEAKER_10]: It's time that we start reinvesting in our own community.

1765
02:25:51,755 --> 02:25:53,056
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1766
02:25:53,616 --> 02:25:58,218

1770
02:26:12,468 --> 02:26:14,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We're severing that from the others.

1771
02:26:14,269 --> 02:26:16,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you make it a beat paper or something?

1772
02:26:17,012 --> 02:26:19,374
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to make it a beat paper?

1773
02:26:19,414 --> 02:26:20,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are amendments to it.

1774
02:26:20,535 --> 02:26:21,376

1775
02:26:24,619 --> 02:26:28,623

[SPEAKER_10]: to the motion.

1784

02:27:01,436 --> 02:27:02,936
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a separate paper.

1786
02:27:02,996 --> 02:27:06,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not, it's not in the, it's not in the motion.

[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor, Vice-President Mines.

1836
02:29:56,195 --> 02:29:59,396
[SPEAKER_08]: So do we know what this is going to cost, the infrared technology?

1837
02:29:59,517 --> 02:29:59,897
[SPEAKER_10]: We do know.

1838
02:29:59,917 --> 02:30:00,637
[SPEAKER_10]: We're investigating.

1839
02:30:01,517 --> 02:30:02,198
[SPEAKER_10]: We're investigating.

1840
02:30:02,238 --> 02:30:02,878
[SPEAKER_10]: We're investigating.

1841
02:30:02,978 --> 02:30:04,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is the resolution?

1842
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:12,993
[SPEAKER_10]: that we investigate using technology.

1843
02:30:13,574 --> 02:30:13,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1844
02:30:14,514 --> 02:30:18,756
[SPEAKER_08]: If he could clarify, because we voted on the exact thing not too long ago.

1845
02:30:18,836 --> 02:30:32,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Layton, the amendment would be that the city utilize the newest technology that's out there, which is the infrared technology, just similar to the same way we request the city to use the new technology.

1846
02:30:32,443 --> 02:30:33,844
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is a request of expenditure.

1847
02:30:34,084 --> 02:30:35,845
[SPEAKER_08]: He's asking for the city to use this infrared

1848
02:30:36,158 --> 02:30:36,698
[SPEAKER_08]: technology.

1849
02:30:37,079 --> 02:30:38,240
[SPEAKER_06]: To evaluate the curve, to evaluate.

1850
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:41,502
[SPEAKER_08]: What if that costs $3 million a year to do the infrared technology?

1851
02:30:41,522 --> 02:30:44,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the response back would be, it'll cost $3 million a year to do it.

1852
02:30:44,144 --> 02:30:46,466
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you asked them to use that during the assessment.

1853
02:30:47,587 --> 02:30:47,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

1854
02:30:47,927 --> 02:30:50,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you just say, I asked them- To evaluate the utilization.

1855
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:53,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And use infrared, you said, during the assessment.

1856
02:30:53,271 --> 02:30:54,011
[SPEAKER_08]: To evaluate the utilization.

1857
02:30:54,031 --> 02:30:54,752
[SPEAKER_10]: To evaluate the use of it.

1858
02:30:55,052 --> 02:30:56,193
[SPEAKER_06]: To evaluate the utilization.

1859
02:30:56,213 --> 02:30:57,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You changed it.

1860
02:31:00,174 --> 02:31:01,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of like your resolution.

1861
02:31:01,576 --> 02:31:02,577
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're changing it now.

1862
02:31:02,957 --> 02:31:03,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1863
02:31:03,458 --> 02:31:04,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultimately it was to evaluate the use.

1864
02:31:04,679 --> 02:31:06,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same resolution we put forward before.

1865
02:31:06,641 --> 02:31:09,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Same resolution we all voted for before.

1866

02:31:17,012 --> 02:31:18,274
[SPEAKER_10]: The Chair seems to be in doubt.

1870
02:31:21,217 --> 02:31:22,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I only heard two ayes.

1871
02:31:26,513 --> 02:31:29,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight has asked that we withdraw the B paper.

1872
02:31:30,155 --> 02:31:31,155

1874
02:31:36,298 --> 02:31:39,060

1875
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:42,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a correspondence with our city council liaison, Ms.

1876
02:31:42,301 --> 02:31:46,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Felch, and she and I have scheduled a meeting to sit down and further discuss the C-Click fixed documents.

1879
02:31:50,506 --> 02:31:53,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Upon receipt, I'll be happy to share the information with my council colleagues.

1880
02:31:53,427 --> 02:31:54,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1881
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:54,588

1886
02:32:09,194 --> 02:32:19,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I am just about ready to get on to that, but before we do that, I want to let everyone know that there's been a slight change to our summer schedule for the meeting.

1887
02:32:21,539 --> 02:32:23,640
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be meeting on July 18th,

[SPEAKER_10]: in August 15th in the new media center at the high school, where we'll have the ability to take the meeting and show it at a later date, and maybe when she's ready by then, we may be able to be live, but I wouldn't count on that at this moment.

1889
02:32:42,924 --> 02:32:45,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the opportunity to go up there yesterday for a press conference.

1890
02:32:45,345 --> 02:32:52,527
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very nice room, and I think it'll serve our council well that we do those two meetings there, and I think everybody will be happy.

1891
02:32:53,307 --> 02:32:54,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So please take note.

1892
02:32:55,205 --> 02:32:58,208

1893
02:33:00,049 --> 02:33:07,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, will it be true that if this 9-1-1 goes up, there'll be a new venue for those two particular dates?

1894
02:33:07,836 --> 02:33:12,340
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll speak to the mayor about having Mr. Clemente do a reverse 9-1-1 to that.

1895
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:14,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, if you could make that notation there.

1896

1909
02:34:35,669 --> 02:34:35,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1910
02:34:53,387 --> 02:34:58,650
[SPEAKER_10]: 17 and city councilors.

1911
02:34:59,611 --> 02:35:12,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I respectfully request and recommend that your own body appropriate $188,400 from the sale of loss and graves accounts to the cemetery department.

1912
02:35:13,761 --> 02:35:21,647
[SPEAKER_10]: The account this recommended appropriation is requested in accordance with the fiscal 18 budget, the cemetery,

1913
02:35:22,172 --> 02:35:28,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Department salary count is reduced each year in anticipation of an appropriation from sales of lots.

1914
02:35:28,293 --> 02:35:41,476
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate $161,861 for care to the cemetery department expense budget.

1915
02:35:41,976 --> 02:35:46,337
[SPEAKER_10]: This recommended in accord with the fiscal 2018 budget.

1916
02:35:48,781 --> 02:36:02,884
[SPEAKER_10]: The cemetery expense budget is reduced each year in anticipation of appropriation from... In addition to the upcoming budget hearings, I respectfully request that this be forwarded to the committee of the whole hearing.

1917
02:36:03,365 --> 02:36:06,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Yours truly, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

1918
02:36:10,506 --> 02:36:16,368
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to refer this to the committee of the whole, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

1919
02:36:16,808 --> 02:36:17,528
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1920
02:36:18,473 --> 02:36:19,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1921
02:36:22,515 --> 02:36:29,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Please mark Councilor DelaRusso as opposed.

1922
02:36:30,459 --> 02:36:29,119
17, 514.

1923
02:36:30,820 --> 02:36:42,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the following transfer, $900,000 to be transferred from

1924
02:36:45,065 --> 02:36:59,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Water retained earnings to account three, four, zero, four, five, zero, five, seven, eight, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, eight, six, seven, two, zero, one, seven, water capital project.

1925
02:37:00,457 --> 02:37:11,946
[SPEAKER_10]: The amount of $900,000 is requested to purchase a water main leak detection system as was displayed in the meeting earlier this year with the water and soil commissioners.

1926
02:37:12,506 --> 02:37:13,447
[SPEAKER_10]: We strongly believe

1927
02:37:13,865 --> 02:37:29,675
[SPEAKER_10]: that this purchase will not only save dollars, but this commodity, I respectfully request that the paper be forward to the council of a whole for a deliberation during the budget process.

1928
02:37:30,016 --> 02:37:35,119
[SPEAKER_10]: The remaining balance in the retained water and earnings after this transfer will be $2,769,199.

1929
02:37:42,511 --> 02:37:51,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco to move this to a committee of the whole meeting.

1930
02:37:51,603 --> 02:37:52,364
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1931
02:37:54,627 --> 02:37:55,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Mox.

1932
02:37:56,376 --> 02:37:57,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1933
02:37:58,657 --> 02:38:10,282
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very important issue that leak detection, this council has been discussing for a number of years due to the high water and sewer rates in this community.

1934
02:38:10,802 --> 02:38:12,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only leak detection, but INI, inflow.

1935
02:38:13,203 --> 02:38:15,344
[SPEAKER_08]: My mic's not on, Mr. President.

1936
02:38:15,464 --> 02:38:17,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, mine is, Mr. President.

1937
02:38:17,104 --> 02:38:17,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1938
02:38:18,505 --> 02:38:19,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

1939
02:38:19,766 --> 02:38:20,626
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right, Mr. President.

1940
02:38:21,486 --> 02:38:25,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this is an important issue, Mr. President, that this council has been discussing

1941
02:38:26,012 --> 02:38:28,292
[SPEAKER_08]: for a number of years, leak detection in the community.

1942
02:38:29,053 --> 02:38:32,453
[SPEAKER_08]: We've also discussed INI inflow and infiltration.

1943
02:38:32,933 --> 02:38:42,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's costing the ratepayers of this community millions of dollars a year based on water that's leaking in our old outdated water pipes that are underground.

1944
02:38:43,656 --> 02:38:49,717
[SPEAKER_08]: A little known fact, Mr. President, about 90% of the water leaks never surface.

1945
02:38:50,597 --> 02:38:55,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So you may think, well, if we have water leaks, we're gonna see water leaking down streets and so forth.

1946
02:38:55,781 --> 02:38:57,442
[SPEAKER_08]: 90% of the water never surfaces.

1947
02:38:58,002 --> 02:39:07,348
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the MWRA, 17 to 20% of the water used in Meffitt each year is unaccounted for water that's lost to leakage.

1948
02:39:08,069 --> 02:39:09,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can imagine that figure.

1949
02:39:09,330 --> 02:39:13,212
[SPEAKER_08]: 17 to 20% is water that's unaccounted for.

1950
02:39:14,133 --> 02:39:17,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not made or anyone else's water.

1951
02:39:19,467 --> 02:39:39,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the new system, which I went some six months at the time the company claimed in five years method could save about $5 million with this leak detection system and save up to 15 million gallons of water annually by installing this system.

1952
02:39:40,132 --> 02:39:44,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's, uh, in my opinion, Mr. President, a no brainer.

1953
02:39:45,469 --> 02:39:47,250
[SPEAKER_08]: It's long overdue in this community.

1954
02:39:47,970 --> 02:40:05,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's money well spent that over the years will find its way to the rate payer and we can actually start seeing potentially a savings when it comes to our water and sewer bill, or at least not see the steady increases that we've grown accustomed to.

1955
02:40:06,360 --> 02:40:13,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, Mr. President, that with this particular leak detection, we were told by

1956
02:40:13,909 --> 02:40:18,794
[SPEAKER_08]: that you need appropriate staff to monitor this system.

1957
02:40:20,135 --> 02:40:26,222
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now, as we all know, we don't have the appropriate staff to do so.

1958
02:40:26,762 --> 02:40:34,790
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping, which will accompany this paper, also an additional request for staff, Mr. President.

1959
02:40:35,591 --> 02:40:37,173
[SPEAKER_08]: The way the system works, and I think it's

1960
02:40:37,553 --> 02:40:50,962
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriate people in this community know is that the company, whoever gets selected, would install an acoustic whistling device on the water mains in the gap valves between streets.

1961
02:40:51,623 --> 02:40:54,004
[SPEAKER_08]: They would be spaced out in a big grid across the city.

1962
02:40:54,585 --> 02:40:58,567
[SPEAKER_08]: The company would listen to the device overnight and there's

1963
02:40:59,708 --> 02:41:13,671
[SPEAKER_08]: and they could tell where the leaks are coming from by taking samples of the acoustic sounds and pinpointing within a couple of feet where we have leaks in the community, and then be able to prioritize those leaks and address them.

1964
02:41:14,331 --> 02:41:22,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully over time, we'll be addressing and lowering the percentage of unaccounted for water within our community.

1965
02:41:22,493 --> 02:41:25,394
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been pushing for leak detection for a number of years.

1966
02:41:26,374 --> 02:41:29,415
[SPEAKER_08]: INI inflow and infiltration is a whole other thing.

1967
02:41:30,115 --> 02:41:34,276
[SPEAKER_08]: in the community, which is another issue I've been pushing for, Mr. President.

1968
02:41:34,696 --> 02:41:44,558
[SPEAKER_08]: That's groundwater that's seeping into our sewer system and being treated as raw sewage, which is costing the ratepayers of this community tens of millions of dollars a year.

1969
02:41:45,878 --> 02:41:57,720
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing I would ask, Mr. President, that my colleagues consider is that currently right now, the school system and the city do not pay for their water.

1970
02:41:59,230 --> 02:42:04,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not included in the operating budget for the schools and for the city.

1971
02:42:04,772 --> 02:42:15,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone knows, any homeowner knows, when you have your budget, you look at your car insurance, you look at your groceries, and water and sewer is part of your budget.

1972
02:42:15,715 --> 02:42:20,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of operating, so you can flush your toilet, take showers, water your lawn, it's part of the budget.

1973
02:42:21,277 --> 02:42:24,498
[SPEAKER_08]: In our city, for some reason, not part of the budget.

1974
02:42:25,485 --> 02:42:28,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what, when it's not part of the budget, Mr. President, what happens?

1975
02:42:29,568 --> 02:42:30,809
[SPEAKER_08]: You tend not to conserve.

1976
02:42:32,150 --> 02:42:35,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't matter how much water I'm using, the ratepayers will pay for that.

1977
02:42:36,213 --> 02:42:36,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't matter.

1978
02:42:37,354 --> 02:42:39,556
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just add it on to the ratepayers.

1979
02:42:40,637 --> 02:42:42,758
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll grin and bear it and take it, Mr. President.

1980
02:42:43,499 --> 02:42:48,583
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if these buildings are meted, it should be part of the overall working budget.

1981
02:42:49,764 --> 02:42:51,705
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be part of the budget, Mr. President.

1982
02:42:52,006 --> 02:42:53,447
[SPEAKER_08]: It shouldn't be outside of a budget.

1983
02:42:54,442 --> 02:43:04,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And in order to make this system work, we have to account for every entity in this community, and that includes the school system and also the municipal buildings.

1984
02:43:04,548 --> 02:43:10,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no reason why, Mr. President, where those buildings are meted that we're not accounting for them in the budget.

1985
02:43:11,152 --> 02:43:15,135
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was on the school committee back some years ago, it was part of the operating budget.

1986
02:43:16,123 --> 02:43:30,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Mayor McGlynn, because he found out a good way of shifting it off of the Prop 2.5 within the budget, and said, I could put that within the ratepayers and also increase my budget on other things that I want to do.

1987
02:43:31,574 --> 02:43:33,375
[SPEAKER_08]: And, Mr. President, it should work that way.

1988
02:43:33,715 --> 02:43:38,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Just recently, the administration asked us to combine the water and sewer enterprise account.

1989
02:43:39,619 --> 02:43:39,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1990
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:42,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was easy for accounting for them.

1991
02:43:43,622 --> 02:43:50,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So why would they approach us and say, you know what, we also want to make sure that our buildings that are already needed, that we include them in the budget.

1992
02:43:53,164 --> 02:44:02,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you right now, Mr. President, there are several issues that if they're not addressed in this budget, like I did last year, and I know Councilor Lungo, I will not support this budget.

1993
02:44:03,127 --> 02:44:04,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I will not support it, Mr. President.

1994
02:44:05,447 --> 02:44:08,208
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor will have to account on the other members.

1995
02:44:09,648 --> 02:44:12,189
[SPEAKER_08]: But unless we hold our feet, Mr. President, to the fire,

1996
02:44:13,212 --> 02:44:18,735
[SPEAKER_08]: and make sure we address these issues and not just give lip service, that's the time to do it.

1997
02:44:20,276 --> 02:44:22,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Mr. President, I support this wholeheartedly.

1998
02:44:22,897 --> 02:44:34,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I would hope that we also have a discussion on staffing to be able to look at these leaks and instantaneously get a report to show where these leaks are.

1999
02:44:35,444 --> 02:44:42,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Mr. President, that once again, the school side and the municipal side include the water

2000
02:44:42,783 --> 02:44:44,964
[SPEAKER_08]: and SOAR within their budgeting process.

2001
02:44:46,405 --> 02:44:47,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

2002
02:44:48,486 --> 02:44:49,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nice.

2003
02:44:51,527 --> 02:44:52,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Your light was on.

2004
02:44:53,348 --> 02:44:54,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address for the record, please.

2005
02:44:56,230 --> 02:44:58,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street, Method Mass.

2006
02:44:59,892 --> 02:45:06,035
[SPEAKER_21]: On a positive note, I'd like to thank all you councilors, the mayor, all the salaried employees,

2007
02:45:07,368 --> 02:45:11,692
[SPEAKER_21]: and especially the volunteers for doing all the hard work and trying to improve our city.

2008
02:45:11,952 --> 02:45:12,812
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

2009
02:45:15,074 --> 02:45:20,939
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as saving taxpayers' money on the water, it sounds really good to me.

2010
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:25,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Trust is good, but verify would be better.

2011
02:45:26,843 --> 02:45:36,351
[SPEAKER_21]: The city is strongly believing this device or system will not only save taxpayers' money, and it may be a good idea,

2012
02:45:36,932 --> 02:45:48,880
[SPEAKER_21]: But verifying if it's historically a fact and true is a better, I believe, and a must idea before spending almost a million dollars of the people's money.

2013
02:45:50,501 --> 02:45:51,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it a wise purchase?

2014
02:45:52,042 --> 02:45:52,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Does it work?

2015
02:45:53,723 --> 02:45:59,887
[SPEAKER_21]: So, like, who, what cities have bought this system in the last three years?

2016
02:46:00,307 --> 02:46:04,050
[SPEAKER_21]: And can we call them and ask if they saved any money?

2017
02:46:05,050 --> 02:46:06,191
[SPEAKER_21]: And how much per year?

2018
02:46:06,642 --> 02:46:06,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Please.

2019
02:46:07,422 --> 02:46:21,350
[SPEAKER_21]: I also recollect the new water meters, they're probably 10 to 15 years old, and those are supposed to be all kinds of bells and whistles, and I believe in those meters, I believe one of the counselors had brought up, and I'm not sure if that saved the center any money.

2020
02:46:22,171 --> 02:46:34,398
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'd like to see from past experiences who has bought this around our locale, under the MWRA system, if they in fact really did save, or did it

2021
02:46:35,285 --> 02:46:41,589
[SPEAKER_21]: did they not save and they spent a million dollars or whatever, and was a cost-effective period.

2022
02:46:41,689 --> 02:46:42,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2023
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:42,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2024
02:46:44,731 --> 02:46:45,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address of the record, please.

2025
02:46:46,312 --> 02:46:47,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2026
02:46:47,313 --> 02:46:49,194
[SPEAKER_20]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

2027
02:46:49,734 --> 02:46:51,836
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank you all for this discussion.

2028
02:46:52,356 --> 02:46:55,498
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is one of the biggest pebbles in the pond.

2029
02:46:55,738 --> 02:47:01,762
[SPEAKER_20]: When we're paying for water that falls out of the sky, I mean, look at it from the perspective of the businesses.

2030
02:47:02,201 --> 02:47:07,044
[SPEAKER_20]: who might have to raise their prices a little bit for goods and services.

2031
02:47:08,044 --> 02:47:21,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Other residents who, like the city treasurer said before this council a couple months ago in talking about going after delinquent taxpayers, she said it's not fair to the residents who are, quote, sacrificing

2032
02:47:21,431 --> 02:47:23,292
[SPEAKER_20]: new cars and vacations.

2033
02:47:24,012 --> 02:47:25,553
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, why do you think that is?

2034
02:47:25,933 --> 02:47:29,415
[SPEAKER_20]: It's because they're paying for water that literally falls out of the sky.

2035
02:47:29,955 --> 02:47:34,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Is God going to be charged this new connectivity tax?

2036
02:47:34,238 --> 02:47:34,878
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think so.

2037
02:47:35,218 --> 02:47:37,079
[SPEAKER_20]: The Metro residents and businesses are.

2038
02:47:37,559 --> 02:47:44,563
[SPEAKER_20]: And it would help the overall local community to really get a grasp on this before

2039
02:47:45,667 --> 02:47:47,388
[SPEAKER_20]: and not just keep letting it go.
