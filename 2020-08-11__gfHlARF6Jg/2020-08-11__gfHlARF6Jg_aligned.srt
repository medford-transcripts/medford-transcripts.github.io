1
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:03,447
All right, we are live.

2
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:26,183
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:30,006
Wanted to just let you know that we're going to wait a few minutes as more people join us.

4
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,660
Thank you very much once again for joining us on this StreamYard presentation.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,505
The way you ask questions is by entering them in the comment box on either YouTube or our Facebook channel.

6
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:46,167
So thank you very much for being here tonight.

7
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:54,173
Thank you very much for your concern and investment in your child's education and our process for reopening schools.

8
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:57,315
So we're just gonna give it another minute or so.

9
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:04,457
for more people to join as the numbers in the last minute have gone from zero to over 100.

10
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,279
So thank you and we'll be right with you.

11
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:44,113
Alright.

12
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:13,998
Good evening, everyone.

13
00:02:14,518 --> 00:02:17,519
This is Marie Sedvard-Vincent, superintendent of school speaking.

14
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,821
And I'm pleased to have this additional listening session to get feedback.

15
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:39,524
Last week we presented at our school committee meeting, and we know that there are a lot of questions that you may have as parents regarding what our plan was that was presented last week.

16
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:42,325
So again, this is an opportunity for us to listen,

17
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:51,166
to be able to look at the comments and questions that you're going to have and respond to them as many as possible.

18
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:56,652
So I look forward to seeing your comments and communicating further.

19
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,153
Thank you.

20
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:07,973
Um, so, um, we wanted to also, uh, update everybody on where the frequently asked questions are.

21
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:10,756
I'm going to share my screen real quick with you.

22
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:22,089
Um, so, so hopefully.

23
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:27,735
There we go.

24
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:35,058
So this right now, what you're seeing is the frequently asked questions document that we have compiled.

25
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:40,481
There are over 38 categories of questions that you can see off to the side here.

26
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,964
And these are some of the questions that we're going to be going through and answering.

27
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:49,445
So it comes out to be just about 100 pages of questions.

28
00:03:49,505 --> 00:04:04,689
I have a few more emails to add to that, but I wanted to make you aware of just the level of questions that we've received and the level of care and duty we have to answering them.

29
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:15,525
We're going to be answering them in an executive summary format to make sure that we address as much as possible throughout this process.

30
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:19,607
So while that is a weird look when you share your screen that way.

31
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:22,909
So that's the questions there.

32
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:29,052
The other thing that I want to share with you real quick, and I hope it comes up, I'm going to take the banners down just for a second here.

33
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,551
All right.

34
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:38,579
So when you look at that, so that's our reopening right there, the questions that you had.

35
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:47,593
And then we are also going to show you kind of where the metrics are for reopening.

36
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:52,109
And so right now you can see on this graphic which U.S.

37
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,490
states meet the recommended positivity levels.

38
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,972
And so this was done by Johns Hopkins University.

39
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:03,896
And you can see where Massachusetts is toward the lower end of the tail right there.

40
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:11,206
Also, I just wanted to move forward with information that was released by the governor of Massachusetts today.

41
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:23,075
So he's releasing metrics for the average daily race case rate per 100,000 for COVID-19 in Massachusetts by city or town over the last two weeks.

42
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:28,460
And so when you look at this information, this is from 7-22 to 8-5, 2020.

43
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:37,144
And so you see up in here where Medford is as a green city.

44
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:50,630
And just to give you further clarity, I went through the data that was released today and is posted on the state website and have pulled out Medford's information.

45
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,792
So you can go and you can look at all of this information that's online.

46
00:05:55,312 --> 00:06:00,754
And so the last 14 days, which really isn't the last 14 days, it's back to 722 to 85.

47
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:06,350
And you look at that, our average percent positivity is 1.3%.

48
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,492
And the average daily cases per 100,000 over that 14 day period was 3.4 cases.

49
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:12,193
The population of Medford based on a US census check is 57,633.

50
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,394
So that's where the calculation comes from.

51
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:38,883
from what I understand, the numbers from 85 to now are significantly lower than that, but I don't have that officially.

52
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:43,527
And we will try to have that for tomorrow's call as well.

53
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:56,136
And do you wanna just clarify the percentage piece that it's the information that the state and even nationally is working on is that the average percent, which reflects that Johns Hopkins chart should be below 5%.

54
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,285
I think that's just important to note.

55
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:02,248
So we're at 1.3, significantly below 5%.

56
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:02,829
Right.

57
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,956
And so depending on where we are, we will share this information continually as it comes out.

58
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,380
The state is going to be sharing this on the website.

59
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,006
If you go to mass.gov, there's a COVID tab in the upper right hand

60
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:28,314
corner of mass.gov and you'll be able to see the information in the governor's daily press release.

61
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,896
So that's where it was found.

62
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:37,140
I will find the direct link to that and link it to our district's Facebook page this afternoon.

63
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,883
And we'll also post it to our website this evening slash tomorrow.

64
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,466
So, all right.

65
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:49,169
Anything else from the team right now as we see it?

66
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:58,023
here before we start answering questions.

67
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:00,404
All right.

68
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:02,245
All right.

69
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:03,845
Well, good evening, everyone.

70
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:08,887
So I'm going tonight to start taking the questions from the feed and starting to feed them to the group here.

71
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,728
We'll try our best to take as many questions as we possibly can.

72
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:17,029
We're shooting to have our session about an hour long just so we can plan here.

73
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:20,191
And again, I'm not ignoring any questions if we can't get to them.

74
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:24,734
There's already probably about 75 questions on the feed, and we'll do our best to get to them.

75
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:33,220
And we will try to prioritize questions that relate to things connected to the phased-in reopening, as we acknowledge there's been some questions about that over the past few days.

76
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,482
So let's start with a question from Advocate Mamio asking, please tell us an overview of what you're planning to do.

77
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:44,784
So I think maybe if someone from the team can just share, what are we trying to accomplish tonight with this listening session?

78
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:51,886
And then also, what's our overview of our plan moving forward, just to get everyone on the same page before we dive into some of the specifics?

79
00:08:53,826 --> 00:09:00,709
Well, I would want to say that our overview tonight is to really continue to listen and get additional feedback.

80
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:12,793
We know that we put out the plan last week and there were definitely questions I received since last week.

81
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:19,940
And we wanted to give the community an opportunity to kind of say what are some of the questions they have.

82
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:24,796
and look at what are the additional questions that need to be addressed.

83
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:43,825
So again, that's when I think about what our plan is for this evening, it's really to be able to listen, to see the types of questions that are coming forward, and to see how we can continue to answer all of those questions and see what we can do on our end to continue to meet the needs of the community.

84
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:52,073
So let's ask Ketaj's question about when are questions that were sent to info going to get replies?

85
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:55,095
Dr. Cushing quickly talked about the FAQ document.

86
00:09:55,135 --> 00:10:03,542
I don't know if Dr. Cushing could dive in a little bit of detail of maybe the timeline for when we may be able to get some response to those questions and what those responses might look like.

87
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:07,325
So we're going to be looking to get that information out to you Thursday afternoon.

88
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:09,887
My over under on that is five o'clock.

89
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:16,070
So, we're really hoping to get that information out to you for 5 p.m.

90
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:17,931
on Thursday.

91
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:24,275
I know that a lot of people don't want to answer the survey until they have some of those answers, and we completely respect that.

92
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:31,919
We are also, the survey will be open until Sunday.

93
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:41,129
And we really thank you for the over, we've got about 1700 students already locked into the survey.

94
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,774
As another point, please do not

95
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:49,897
feel that you have to, we're going to be sending out numerous reminders for people.

96
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:53,978
If you've already done the survey, you don't have to do it again.

97
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:54,798
All right.

98
00:10:55,599 --> 00:11:00,260
So I'll be sending out an email probably later tonight to everybody who has already registered.

99
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:03,642
Please make sure you double check your email that you enter.

100
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:08,123
As I have found about 20 errors that are preventing a

101
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:13,385
that are preventing an email from going out.

102
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:17,426
So I'm trying to work through that, but please make sure that you have that.

103
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:28,008
The other thing too that I wanted to address was the HVAC situation in our schools.

104
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:37,650
So we are working with a company called WB Engineering, and they are HVAC engineers who will be coming into Medford High School

105
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:45,866
to look at all of our information and to give us an updated report.

106
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:50,589
They should have three engineers in our building next week.

107
00:11:51,329 --> 00:12:02,056
So we are working through that right now and want to make sure that we are going to be having a safe and healthy building for everybody here.

108
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:10,977
So that's a quick update on a few things that I was supposed to mention at the start.

109
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:17,845
Anyway, back to the phased-in opening, Mr. Mieleczewski.

110
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,827
So our next question, I think we'll turn this one to Ms.

111
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:21,347
Galluzzi.

112
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,028
So the question comes from Jerry.

113
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:30,372
For the full remote option, how many hours a day will the students have a live teacher teaching them versus some self-paced asynchronous learning?

114
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:35,235
I assume Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday has one answer, and Wednesday may have a different answer.

115
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:36,576
So I don't know if Ms.

116
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:41,899
Galluzzi can just chime in on the level of detail that we've come up with already, and maybe what are some of the unknowns as well.

117
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:43,206
Sure, sure.

118
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:50,736
So I think the draft schedule that was in the plan was just like a broad overview of how things could possibly look.

119
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:57,665
And you're right that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday has more of a typical school day schedule.

120
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,348
Wednesday right now has the half day.

121
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,610
schedule.

122
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:12,197
So the next phase of the work that we have to do will be to fine tune and come up with those specific details.

123
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:25,527
Now that the school committee has voted for the hybrid and the fully remote plan, now we get some of the task force back together and we have to work on those fine details.

124
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:36,197
I don't have a specific answer at this time because we still need people to come back and do that fine detail work.

125
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:47,069
The only thing I will say that I've said before is that we want to take a developmental approach to how many hours students are going to be expected to be

126
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,202
doing live synchronous learning.

127
00:13:50,842 --> 00:14:02,847
We certainly do not expect kindergartners and first graders to be on the screen for three hours, but high schoolers may be able to handle three hours of online synchronous time.

128
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:11,271
So once those specifics are ironed out in the next two weeks, we absolutely will give an update to the community.

129
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:18,795
Next question, I know we may not have the specific answer on this.

130
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:24,978
So right now with the, so I'm looking at the next question, it's talking about the class sizes in the remote auction.

131
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:30,200
And so right now, as Dr. Cushing had mentioned, the survey is

132
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:31,967
still going.

133
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,949
So we have about 1,700 responses.

134
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:43,474
We have to wait and see what those numbers look like in terms of how many families want the remote option fully.

135
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:49,758
We also then have to look based on those families where the breakdown is per grade.

136
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:54,622
So of course we do not want a remote class to be

137
00:14:55,686 --> 00:15:02,792
to have high numbers, but it may not have the numbers that a hybrid class would when they're in person.

138
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:09,598
But what we would probably frame it on is what is a typical class size of about 20 students.

139
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,241
But it's going to vary depending on enrollment numbers.

140
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,095
Thank you, Ms.

141
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:16,576
Galluzzi.

142
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:28,382
The next question from Karen, will there be any way of preserving classes- Preserving classes with assigned schools and teams with middle school, or is that all dependent on what families choose and what teachers?

143
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:29,283
Yes.

144
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,244
Yeah, we would have to say yes.

145
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:41,670
While this preliminary survey has gone out right now, as we're gathering the information to see what families are choosing,

146
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:56,808
at first glance, the majority of families do seem to be selecting hybrid, but we can't say that because we still, you know, we can't say that that's the majority of families choose that.

147
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:10,039
But as families are going to be completing the survey and we have that data, we will be able to say, okay, now based on parent responses for their children,

148
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:14,871
what is it that they would like or they feel meets the needs of their families.

149
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:28,281
So, in that regards, where we are able to preserve a class or try to keep classes intact, we will definitely try to do that within assigned schools and teams.

150
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:35,867
Again, we need to get the rest of those surveys in so we have clear information.

151
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,782
Great.

152
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,784
Next question is going to Tom.

153
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:45,786
Tom, you're muted.

154
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:46,707
We can't hear you.

155
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:51,532
Can you hear me now?

156
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:54,729
I'm not sure.

157
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,210
Now we can.

158
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:57,531
Perfect.

159
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:58,592
Sorry about that.

160
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:03,555
So next question, let's see, is going to come from Jennifer here.

161
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:11,340
If a family is unable to respond to the survey, do they, due to their own work situation being unknown, will students be assigned to a specific model?

162
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,440
If so, which model?

163
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:17,804
I know our teams had conversations about sort of what's the default model under the current plan.

164
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,985
So I don't know if someone on the team could just speak to that quickly.

165
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:27,461
We are determined to try to get as close to 100% participation in the surveys.

166
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:34,566
So the first pass has gone out and families that are responding remotely or online.

167
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:41,571
And then at the end of this week, we're gonna take an assessment on Sunday to see where we land.

168
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:48,616
Again, within the first 24 hours, we already have 1,700 families or students accounted for.

169
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:52,558
And so those are really promising numbers.

170
00:17:53,218 --> 00:18:05,385
So by Sunday, once we get down to more manageable numbers, we will be calling out to families and setting up other ways to get the survey completed with them.

171
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:18,333
So if a family were to need support, either to have a translator work with them or to have a person speak to them to complete the survey, we would be willing to do that.

172
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:32,704
But I do, I think it's important to note though, since you brought that up, Dr. Edward-Vincent, that the surveys were sent out translated and we have had several families responding on the translated versions as well.

173
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:38,289
And the last count for that was an additional one to 200.

174
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:55,140
And so, Jennifer, where you're mentioning also that your work situation is unknown, what we want to do is really want to be as flexible as possible and work with families, realizing that, you know, at some point there is going to be, you know, the start of school will be here.

175
00:18:55,601 --> 00:19:04,868
So we want to be as flexible as we can while also realizing that we have to build the class lists and those types of things.

176
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,474
So our next question, I'd like to bring Joan in.

177
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,454
And I see here from Jen.

178
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:15,015
And Jen, I apologize we didn't get your question in a previous session.

179
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,296
We're trying our best to get as many as we can here.

180
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,676
So we'll definitely get yours tonight.

181
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:28,099
My question is, for students on an IEP who choose to go full remote, will they still have access to the specialist they are used to at their home school for consistency slash comfort?

182
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:38,166
So our goal would be to try to do that, but it depends on the numbers of students who are going remote and students who are participating in the hybrid plan.

183
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:46,248
We will look at those numbers closely to see who are the service providers and if that can continue with the full remote plan.

184
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:49,849
Thank you, Joan.

185
00:19:50,983 --> 00:20:01,934
So our next question, and I think we've heard this from, I've seen this a few times on the chat tonight, just from Marlo, why wasn't this plan released to parents and teachers prior to the school committee meeting the other night?

186
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:12,364
And I think maybe if someone on the team can speak about just sort of what may be, you know, different in the staggered hybrid model than maybe just the hybrid model and how that all happens.

187
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:36,536
So one of the challenges that we are facing right now with the hybrid model is at the Medford High School complex in particular, we were aware of some concerns around ventilation.

188
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:44,122
And so we needed to have the engineers come in because there are some new

189
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:50,927
COVID recommendations regarding older buildings.

190
00:20:52,268 --> 00:21:11,065
And with the high school complex in particular, being the oldest building, over 50 years old, there are a lot of areas that we knew we were gonna need to be able to address and look at parts of the high school complex

191
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,111
where maybe they were being utilized one way and needed to be utilized a different way.

192
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:26,053
So the hybrid model that was recommended, the hybrid model that the work group proposed, it's still that hybrid schedule.

193
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:35,816
But what we took into consideration, again, knowing that we were going to continue to receive updated information, updated medical information, and

194
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,602
thinking about the total number of students.

195
00:21:42,443 --> 00:22:01,991
So that if an entire building that normally holds 500 or so students, if that building was fully hybrid, fully functioning, all grade levels, at any given time, you could have 250 students, but it depended on the age.

196
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,632
And so we tried to look at

197
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,221
still going forward with the hybrid approach to instruction.

198
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:19,243
However, staggering those numbers so that we were not overwhelming the system.

199
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:31,186
And so a lot of the medical research talked about our youngest learners, our early childhood, our kindergarten age children, first from a readiness perspective.

200
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:35,127
They don't have actual school experience.

201
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:40,157
And we thought it was critically important to set that foundation.

202
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:44,538
We know that this situation is not ideal for anyone.

203
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:46,498
It's not an ideal learning situation.

204
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:57,520
And I personally feel that our kids are regressing, regressing, regressing, not only academically, but also social emotionally.

205
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,381
And so when we were trying to think about this,

206
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:09,364
hybrid staggered approach to say, let's start with some of our youngest learners so we can at least set the foundation.

207
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:19,111
When you think about our early childhood and kindergarten students, some of them don't even have experience yet with using computers or technology.

208
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:26,836
They may use their mom or dad's phone or someone's phone from time to time, but really being able to use the technology

209
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:52,391
And so we were saying we need to get them physically on campus to set that foundation and really set those early readiness skills that are developmentally appropriate for our youngest learners and slowly stagger in the additional grades to the school so that it was a gradual process.

210
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:56,133
So that was the reasoning or the thinking

211
00:23:56,826 --> 00:24:01,698
behind recommending the staggered approach.

212
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:04,084
So I just wanted to share that.

213
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:09,031
Thank you, Dr. Robertson.

214
00:24:09,091 --> 00:24:13,555
Next question gets at is a operations question from Kathleen.

215
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:16,758
The plan mentions you purchased eight electrostatic sanitizing sprayers.

216
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,542
How often do you intend to use those and how will they be spread among all the schools?

217
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:23,365
Seems like not enough for each school to have one.

218
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:27,189
And whoever answers that, if you could also just share about the school-based teams.

219
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:30,292
I think some of this will start to connect with work that they'll do at the school level.

220
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:33,366
So Kathleen, thank you very much for your question.

221
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:41,350
So we've not only purchased the eight handheld electrostatic sprayers, I actually tried to go and get one because I saw your question pop up.

222
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:50,815
But we also have two backpack sprayers, as well as the original one that Medford Public Schools had even before COVID started.

223
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,097
So what we're going to be doing is we're going to be using them

224
00:24:55,117 --> 00:25:08,221
in the evenings and then also we're gonna come up with a schedule during teachers preps where we can have custodians and maybe others go around and use them on spaces.

225
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:13,383
So we are definitely committed to using them.

226
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:17,784
And so just so you know, if you were to go on Amazon and look at them, they're $1,750 a piece.

227
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:28,497
Um, and so we need to be fiscally conscious and our director of facilities and grounds feels that that will be adequate.

228
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,537
Um, he's been able to get them for a reduced price.

229
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,458
And if we need to purchase more, we will.

230
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:47,701
Um, but just based on how the numbers are running, it seems like a, um, it seems like a, an appropriate number to have at this point, especially with the backpacks and other, um, the other equipment that we have.

231
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:56,228
Um, the formula that goes into the electrostatic sprayer can be used in a regular, uh, spray bottle.

232
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:58,367
and allowed to dry.

233
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:18,733
What the electrostatic sprayer does is it actually forces out the solution in a positive charge that then attracts two negatively charged particles in the room, therefore wrapping around surfaces and giving a complete disinfecting approach.

234
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:22,193
So just wanted to give you that.

235
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:34,444
Our school-based teams are launching now to work on the operational pieces for signage, for cleaning, for the building-based protocols based off our overall plan.

236
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:38,528
A question that I did see come through was about masks.

237
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,010
Masks are required for all students.

238
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,593
That is a change from when we initially issued the plan.

239
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:46,174
based on the feedback that we received.

240
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:49,375
So just wanted to give you that.

241
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:53,896
Great, thank you Dr. Cushing.

242
00:26:54,937 --> 00:27:04,320
Next question, I know we've talked a little bit about the decision to stagger certain ages at certain times and also the particular decision at the high school level.

243
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,782
So the question from Heather, could the staggered phase in begin at the high school September 16th versus October 13th

244
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:13,606
Could seniors also have some priority after freshmen?

245
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:23,024
So I don't know if someone could share just some of the rationale between the way that the current staggering in is at the high school level, and maybe get into some of the details about our plans of ventilation at the high school.

246
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:37,227
Yes, so I would definitely say, and I've received several, some communications regarding seniors and what's required for senior year with students preparing for college and to graduate.

247
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:41,169
So that is something that we can definitely continue to look at.

248
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,112
Again, the high school complex at one point in time

249
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:50,055
used to house 5,000 students.

250
00:27:50,555 --> 00:27:54,859
The same exact complex, which is now housing 1,200 students.

251
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:56,981
So, we are aware of that.

252
00:27:57,461 --> 00:28:02,846
However, at the same time, we are aware we have the engineers coming out to look at

253
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:09,548
some of the work that we will need to do here at the high school complex.

254
00:28:10,128 --> 00:28:14,371
So that was part of where we were saying we know that we're going to need to do some work.

255
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:17,394
There are many parts of the high school that are renovated.

256
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:21,157
The science wing is fully renovated, air conditioned.

257
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:42,166
that's in D building and many, many programs on the vocational side of the house are renovated or those spaces have large windows or bays where the windows will fully open and you're able to have a lot of circulation going through.

258
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:46,750
So we were looking at that and taking that also into consideration.

259
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:55,066
So we will definitely continue to look at the staggered dates.

260
00:28:55,727 --> 00:29:02,012
And again, there has been a lot of questions about what we can do for seniors in programming.

261
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:12,240
So that was what led to the staggered approach here at the high school, because we are aware that we have to do some ventilation work.

262
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,362
So that's something that is

263
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:27,016
you know, high priority, and we're going to continue to, you know, look at that as the school year gets closer, but we wanted to also give ourselves some time for that work to happen.

264
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:38,739
We have a follow-up question, I think, as someone can build off of that, to talk a little bit about the timeline of some of that work, and if, you know, how that information will be communicated.

265
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:44,100
So, from Kate, have engineers gone into the buildings yet, and will information be shared about what they find?

266
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:49,865
So our engineers will be in the building next week.

267
00:29:51,426 --> 00:30:03,135
As I mentioned earlier, we're working with a company called WB Engineering and they will be starting with Medford High School next week to go into the buildings and

268
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:07,017
Yeah, I mean, we'll be sharing information.

269
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:10,598
There's nothing that we're not going to be sharing.

270
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:19,102
You know, we've put up all the minutes from our work groups are headed to the website.

271
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:25,765
You know, the frequently asked questions I just showed to everybody, we'll be putting that out there.

272
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:26,865
So Ms.

273
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:29,426
Willard, we will definitely be sharing out everything that's found.

274
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,988
And in the newer buildings,

275
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:47,812
The engineers will be looking at the original drawings for those HVAC systems so that we can get the MERV 13 filters with the appropriate drops in them so that we don't burn out our motors and don't burn out our equipment.

276
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:52,418
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

277
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,038
I'd like to get Ms.

278
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,299
Bowen involved in here.

279
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,460
This next question relates to a 504 plan from Maria.

280
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:03,603
Will a child with a 504 plan who chooses to be fully remote, will they still have access to the plan?

281
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:06,684
Yes, they will.

282
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:18,390
So any student that's on a 504 or an IEP that chooses the fully remote plan will have access to their modifications, their accommodations, and their special education services.

283
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:24,616
They may be delivered a little bit differently, but they will still receive those accesses to the plan.

284
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:28,658
Great, thank you.

285
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:35,521
And just wanted to quickly, too, there was a question about where surveys are provided directly to people's emails.

286
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:38,082
Everyone should have received an email with a survey.

287
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:43,785
And if you did not, it might be helpful just to contact your building principal to make sure you can get your email address updated.

288
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:47,687
You also could find the surveys directly on the website

289
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:49,469
translated into five languages.

290
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:54,555
So again, if you didn't receive that, you should have through the email that we have on file.

291
00:31:54,615 --> 00:32:01,703
So if you did not receive that, just contact your building principal so we can find a way to get that email address updated for moving forward.

292
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:11,049
So next question relates to cohorts and I know there's a lot of conversations about sort of how will cohorts be generated.

293
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:20,434
I don't know if someone from the team can share how will we decide which cohort, which child will belong to cohort B or C and sort of where we're at with that decision making.

294
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:35,035
So unfortunately at this time, that's one of those decisions that we are going to be discussing with the school-based team, as well as some of the working teams.

295
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:48,365
So we have had some parents reach out to their building principals with maybe some of their personal needs that they have due to work schedules or family life situation.

296
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,007
And we would encourage you to still do so.

297
00:32:52,768 --> 00:33:07,488
But our intent is that we are keeping families together because we know that there is no perfect solution to the world we're living in right now, but we really do want to try to do what's best for families.

298
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:10,252
So our intent is to keep families together.

299
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:13,094
which includes blended families as well.

300
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:22,739
If you have specific needs beyond that, I would suggest that you reach out to your building principal, and we are going to do our best to accommodate.

301
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:32,485
But it's definitely going to be a cumbersome logistic puzzle that we are going to be starting to work on at the end of this week, beginning of next week.

302
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:34,487
Thanks, Ms.

303
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:34,847
Galussi.

304
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:40,309
Another question is about, this is a quick one, just about the survey being geared towards one child.

305
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:41,950
How do I address the needs of all of my kids?

306
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:48,872
Just to quickly point out, if you have multiple children, the survey should allow you to fill out the survey once per child.

307
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:52,333
So don't try to consolidate all that information once for the survey.

308
00:33:52,393 --> 00:33:55,214
Instead, just fill that survey out once for each of your children.

309
00:33:55,234 --> 00:34:00,216
Because again, your preferences for your child may look different for each one, for each situation.

310
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,223
So our next question comes from Robert, is about vocational school.

311
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:08,145
No mention was made of vocational school during meetings.

312
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:14,269
Why did Adam spring the vocational hybrid upon the community with no input from the stakeholders impacted by this?

313
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:18,691
I know that the team has had conversations with Mr. Fallon.

314
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:25,576
So I don't know if someone can just update how the decision was made to stagger in the particular grade levels of vocational school.

315
00:34:26,385 --> 00:34:49,915
Yes, so definitely for the vocational school, Principal Fallon was consulted and he shared that for the 11th and 12th graders, at those grade levels during vocational programming, students do the most practical hours where they have their actual hands-on experience learning.

316
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:54,677
Our 10th grade students, which are in the vocational program,

317
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:02,825
They actually, in 10th grade, the way the program is designed, it's more content-based.

318
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:14,833
So the students in 10th grade spend fewer hours or a fewer amount of time in their actual hands-on experience and more time taking the academic coursework.

319
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:21,637
And as the students get older, 11th and 12th grade, and getting ready to move into their careers,

320
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,445
it's critically important that those students

321
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:42,256
get the practical amount of hours using whether it's health assisting or electrical work or working on the vehicles and cars that they need that hands-on experience for them to really be prepared.

322
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:46,600
So with that, we spoke with principal Fallon.

323
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:52,005
And when he had looked at the numbers and said that at this point in time, it would be with 110

324
00:35:55,251 --> 00:36:10,275
seniors currently enrolled at the vocational school, that if they had 55 students to do the hybrid, then 55 students could be spread throughout all of the different programs

325
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,081
that those seniors would be involved in.

326
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:18,922
And it would be a manageable number to slowly transition in.

327
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:29,206
So that was what was taken into consideration when we made the final recommendation last week.

328
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:39,009
But the hybrid schedule, the instructional schedule of the hybrid team that was created by the work groups

329
00:36:40,595 --> 00:36:43,936
That is the schedule that is still on the table.

330
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,077
That is still the plan.

331
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:58,641
So whether it's the vocational side of the house or the comprehensive side of the house, the hybrid plan that was designed in the dynamic return to school plan, it's still that schedule.

332
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:04,423
The change is that it was a staggered approach.

333
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:05,744
And at the high school again,

334
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:17,734
with this being the largest complex and with all of the renovated spaces on the vocational side, that was where that recommendation was put forward.

335
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,255
I think it's important to note though too that

336
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:27,012
A vocational teacher was assigned to the hybrid group.

337
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:32,294
I'm not quite sure what happened, but did not participate in the planning for the group.

338
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:42,877
But that's why we, during those task force groups, reached out to Chad Fallon so that we made sure that the vocational voice was heard.

339
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:48,199
And that's why the link was embedded in that dynamic plan for both the hybrid and the remote model.

340
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:54,937
Before I go to the next question, I've seen a few questions and comments on there about masks.

341
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:57,538
Just want to emphasize that masks will be required for all students.

342
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:01,419
So just wanted to be crystal clear on that piece for the group.

343
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,801
Joan, next question relates to IEP from Lisa.

344
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:08,622
So when will students on an IEP receive services?

345
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,403
And these are the students who are not necessarily considered high needs.

346
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:12,643
Sure.

347
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:18,725
So any student will be receiving a specific schedule that outlines their classes.

348
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:28,651
So if they were to have a co-taught math class, the co-teacher would meet with the general education teacher during that time and co-teach the class.

349
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:34,542
If they had small group math class with a special education teacher, that would be built into their schedule.

350
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:49,845
We would also build in, say, academic support classes, speech, OT, PT, during wind blocks or during exploratory blocks, similar to what we do when we're in school and we have a typical day schedule.

351
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:52,886
Thank you, Josh.

352
00:38:53,944 --> 00:39:09,031
So the next question gets at a scenario we all hope it doesn't come to, but certainly something we will have to plan for from Kelly Robin, which is if students are attending hybrid and for whatever reason schools close, will they continue learning as if it were a hybrid from home or will they pivot to remote option?

353
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,932
How would that work for the high school specifically?

354
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:14,253
Didn't know if someone would be able to share their thoughts on that.

355
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:15,696
Yes, yes.

356
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:28,007
So if your child is enrolled in the hybrid model and they have their schedule with their set teachers, that will continue if the schools have to then close and go into remote.

357
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:33,772
They will continue with the hybrid schedule and educators that they started with.

358
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:34,472
Now,

359
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:44,680
What they may do is pick up some of the expectations and schedules that are working in the remote model, but their educators will remain the same.

360
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:48,703
I hope that answers their question.

361
00:39:48,743 --> 00:40:05,036
So in other words, depending on how long we may be closed, you may follow the remote schedule so that you will have that balance of synchronous and asynchronous time, but you would keep the educators that you had within the hybrid model.

362
00:40:07,827 --> 00:40:08,308
Thank you, Ms.

363
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:08,688
Colucci.

364
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:12,534
I just want to emphasize, too, we're trying our best to get to as many questions as we possibly can.

365
00:40:12,574 --> 00:40:20,146
There's hundreds of questions out there in the chat, and we're trying to get through as many as we can here, and also trying to get to maybe some topics that we haven't yet discussed.

366
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,151
So I appreciate your patience and understanding as we try to answer as many as we can.

367
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,930
I do see a lot of questions around kindergarten.

368
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:30,152
So I don't know if someone could share, what would a remote day of kindergarten be like?

369
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:40,538
I also heard a few people see that or say their child has a hard time focusing in remote instruction and don't think that they'll have the attention span to be able to last for a lot of online learning.

370
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:44,140
So don't know if someone on the team can share what kindergarten could look like through the remote model.

371
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:46,339
So we agree.

372
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,083
Everyone right here answering these questions and on this StreamYard session, we're all parents.

373
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:57,325
We all have more than one child.

374
00:40:57,845 --> 00:41:03,508
We all know how different they can be as learners and as little people and big people.

375
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:07,010
I know I have two completely different students as children.

376
00:41:08,863 --> 00:41:22,030
You're right, and I think Dr. Edouard-Vincent really spoke about the early childhood piece and how really critical it is because they're still developing those readiness skills.

377
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,772
And for entering kindergarten, depending on what their

378
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:35,754
a preschool experience, if they even had one, was like, they may be coming in with no readiness skills and it's our job to prepare them to be students.

379
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:46,079
So we know if we're in a remote situation, we do realize, as previously said, that we don't expect them to be on a computer for three hours a day.

380
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,963
But the work that's going to start with the teams next week to fine tune these plans,

381
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:56,525
is going to have representation from each level.

382
00:41:57,565 --> 00:42:16,416
That's what we're hoping for in working with the teachers union for that, so that we can specifically target those remote plans to the specific levels, because the expectation for a kindergartener in a remote level is not gonna be what the expectation is for a fourth grader or a fifth grader, and certainly not for middle school and high school.

383
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:22,860
So I do apologize that I don't have a more exact specific answer for you, it's coming.

384
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,321
but it's definitely going to be a developmental approach.

385
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,663
We have a few questions about testing.

386
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:33,485
And I know that this is something that's come up over the past, especially the past week.

387
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:42,269
So I don't know if we can have an update about that or maybe have an update, a timeline to share some information about will teachers and students be tested as it is with tough students.

388
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,931
So for students,

389
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:51,852
we don't have an official testing schedule for students.

390
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:58,635
So students would not be tested at this point in time coming to school.

391
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:09,738
Unless something were to take place, Medford will have additional testing sites, and we're going to be working closely with the Medford Board of Health.

392
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,779
However, for teachers,

393
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:18,559
We are working, the Medford Port of Health, the city of Medford, the mayor's office.

394
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,267
We are working right now closely with Tufts University to provide testing for teachers.

395
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:30,450
And so- All staff, all staff.

396
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,073
Not only teachers, but for all staff in Medford public schools.

397
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:39,157
And that testing would be available on a bi-weekly basis.

398
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:47,784
We are still ironing out those details, but that is something that is definitely in the works.

399
00:43:48,624 --> 00:44:07,814
And so, all the details have not been ironed out for staff, but it is something that is going to be available for staff in Medford Public Schools to be able to receive ongoing COVID testing in collaboration with Tufts University.

400
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:12,729
And I'd like to thank the mayor for negotiating that on our behalf.

401
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:25,794
And again, this is, you know, preliminary, early conversation, but by the time school does start up, Medford Public Schools and Tufts University, we will be collaborating to provide testing.

402
00:44:26,494 --> 00:44:28,115
So that's very good news.

403
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:30,637
And I'm very happy about that.

404
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:45,386
And I know as time goes by, we will get clearer information for students about where will regular or additional Medford sites be for testing if it was needed.

405
00:44:48,482 --> 00:44:51,906
I see a lot of questions around the hybrid model in general.

406
00:44:51,926 --> 00:44:56,951
So I, Annetta's question, can we see a test drive of a day in the life of a hybrid student?

407
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:01,396
So I don't know if someone can maybe provide an overview of what it may look like to be in the hybrid model.

408
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:09,806
And then also maybe speak about the student orientation that we're thinking about to maybe help onboard students to get them set up for success in that hybrid model.

409
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:11,856
Sure, I think that's very important.

410
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:13,657
I think I'll start there, Tom.

411
00:45:13,717 --> 00:45:30,826
So we've set aside about three days for like an orientation so that families and students can come and have time in a safely distant way or manner, maybe outdoors to meet their teachers.

412
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:33,515
no matter what plan.

413
00:45:33,636 --> 00:45:42,059
So I know you're specifically asking about hybrid, but that orientation is also going to be for students that are enrolled in the all-remote academy as well.

414
00:45:42,800 --> 00:46:01,068
And so during the orientation, parents will be given schedules or have an idea of how things may roll out and have the opportunity to, even though it's brief, but have that face-to-face and start the rapport with your child or children's educators.

415
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:10,201
during those 10 days that the Department of Education has given each district, we're going to spend time.

416
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:20,665
So teachers not only are going to have a lot of time to plan and collaborate for this big undertaking, but they're also going to have some training.

417
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:28,887
And it's going to be around the hybrid model, as well as the remote model, as well as the safety precautions and protocols.

418
00:46:29,527 --> 00:46:31,708
So the hybrid, when the students are in the building,

419
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:39,358
We're going to, as close as we can, have it mirror what it's like for them when they're in school.

420
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,543
Now, granted, there are certain things that aren't going to be the same.

421
00:46:44,623 --> 00:46:47,545
So desks may not be in clusters.

422
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:53,110
They may be separated so that we're keeping the social distancing that we need to keep at six feet.

423
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:59,655
If they're science tables, they're going to have to be at each end if that is six feet.

424
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:10,828
the school-based teams are going to handle what the schedules look like for transitions in hallways to keep it at a minimum.

425
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:15,593
So there'll be a little bit less moving than the secondary students are used to.

426
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:21,679
And that also includes like lunch routines and bathroom routines.

427
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:24,561
So we know that each building

428
00:47:25,612 --> 00:47:34,298
is slightly different, and even due to enrollment numbers, a lunch schedule at the Columbus Elementary may look different than at the Roberts Elementary.

429
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:46,267
So the school-based teams that have started their work will come out with a more detailed day in the life of or schedule for a hybrid model.

430
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:53,913
I can answer, like I know in elementary, lunch will probably take place in the classroom with

431
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:56,731
than the students going outside for recess.

432
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:59,214
It might look a little different though at the secondary level.

433
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:07,465
So we will let you know what the schedule will look like in further detail once the school-based teams have mapped it out.

434
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:16,294
Our next question gets at the high school level, and this is something we've heard a few questions about over the past week or so.

435
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:20,978
For high school students planning to take honors and AP classes, do you have the staffing to offer them hybrid and remote?

436
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:26,442
What should parents select if they want to be most likely to be assigned the honors and AP classes they've been planning to take?

437
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:32,507
So parents should select the plan that works the best for them.

438
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:36,450
We will be offering AP and honors courses to all students.

439
00:48:40,314 --> 00:48:40,719
Thank you.

440
00:48:41,224 --> 00:48:42,133
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

441
00:48:44,096 --> 00:48:50,259
Another operations question that I think was discussed in the operational work group was from David.

442
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:55,741
For hybrid, will be hand washing stations in every class and will there be mandatory hand washing breaks?

443
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:59,782
So upon entering every room, there will be hand sanitizer.

444
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:02,784
Students should hand sanitize upon entering every room.

445
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:05,745
The elementary schools, and Ms.

446
00:49:05,785 --> 00:49:13,308
Galussi can definitely speak to this, they have the instructional classrooms for the grade levels.

447
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:15,808
have sinks in every room.

448
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:23,270
And so we have gallons upon gallons upon gallons of soap for students to use that as well.

449
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:30,552
In rooms that don't have the soap, we have literally thousands of hand sanitizers.

450
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:40,714
I believe the number is 3,000 hand sanitizers for the rooms for us to be able to have that available for our students.

451
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:48,271
So, the next question, I think we, Dr. Duarte-Vincent talked about this.

452
00:49:49,051 --> 00:49:52,173
Why wasn't the plan released to parents and teachers prior to the school committee meeting?

453
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:53,313
I'm still seeking an answer.

454
00:49:53,693 --> 00:50:04,518
I just wanted to quickly share, too, and then I'll give it to someone else in the team, too, is that when we put forth the possibility of the staggered in, it did not change the work of the hybrid team.

455
00:50:04,578 --> 00:50:07,039
So, that hybrid model still remains the same.

456
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:18,803
the work that was done in the hybrid team, that sort of that plan and that schedule is still in place, and does not sort of, the staggered piece does not overrule the work that's been done in that team.

457
00:50:18,903 --> 00:50:31,548
So I think as a group here, we all wanted to emphasize that the collective work of those work groups was not, you know, overruled by the, by proposing or entering in a possibility of a staggering approach.

458
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:36,870
Since we've heard a few comments on that, I didn't know if someone else on the team just wants to weigh in on that piece.

459
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:53,363
I think I would just restate that we definitely built the plan upon what was available to us, building upon what was done from the workgroups that participated in designing both the hybrid and the remote.

460
00:50:53,863 --> 00:51:02,746
The staggered approach again was with some of the information that we received, some of the information, some of the guidelines that are available to us.

461
00:51:04,781 --> 00:51:24,415
regarding numbers, and also looking at knowing that this is a fluid situation, and at the start of this session, and I'm not sure if you were on for the start, but we showed Massachusetts numbers, but Medford as well, that Medford has

462
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:30,574
compared to many other communities that are not very far away from us.

463
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:34,075
Medford is actually in a very good position right now.

464
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:46,600
And so I, you know, I say that and I knock on some wood, but to say that knowing that it's a fluid situation, knowing the ages of the children, knowing that there is

465
00:51:47,315 --> 00:52:09,919
you know, limited work that needs to be done in the outside buildings, working with filters and those kinds of things, that that's what had prompted us to say, let's do the staggered approach so we have our youngest learners coming in and then building the numbers gradually so that, you know, every few weeks

466
00:52:10,683 --> 00:52:15,685
we have another cohort come in, and so the numbers will increase steadily.

467
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:17,565
So that was the intention.

468
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:38,732
But from the time that the dynamic plan was released and the work that we were doing between the meeting happening on Thursday, a week ago, last Thursday, that when we went into the meeting, that was a decision that was made at this level to say,

469
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:56,922
looking at all of our, given all of the givens that we have to work with, the parameters that we have to work with, and again, looking at medical guidance, CDC guidelines, et cetera, we felt that the staggered hybrid approach would be what was best for Medford.

470
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:06,087
And again, we're continuing to get feedback and people are asking for, you know, additional grades to be considered for staggering.

471
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:07,308
So we will continue to

472
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:12,004
take feedback, listen to it, but in the end, we do have to make a decision.

473
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:14,826
So that was where we're at.

474
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:20,351
Next one comes from Leticia.

475
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:26,195
How will you ensure the quality of both remote and hybrid education, and especially how are teachers being directed to both?

476
00:53:26,355 --> 00:53:26,776
I know Ms.

477
00:53:26,796 --> 00:53:36,163
Galussi and your work group started to look at accountability a little bit, and also maybe if you can share just some of the lessons learned from the spring and how those are being addressed as we move into the fall.

478
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:37,854
Right.

479
00:53:37,994 --> 00:53:38,815
So thank you.

480
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:57,247
So in all of the ways that we have gathered community input regarding their remote experience last year, and through all of the work on the task forces, we heard loud and clear that parents want consistency.

481
00:53:57,307 --> 00:53:58,728
That was one of the biggest pieces.

482
00:53:58,808 --> 00:54:06,253
So consistency in the expectations for learning for their students at every level and at every department.

483
00:54:08,232 --> 00:54:13,336
and consistency with the scheduling.

484
00:54:13,977 --> 00:54:16,279
So that was what we wanted.

485
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:19,801
We really wanted to make sure we covered both of those areas.

486
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:29,930
And I think that the sample schedules, though they may change a bit, but those sample schedules really took into account to make sure that we're consistent throughout Metro Public Schools.

487
00:54:30,774 --> 00:54:54,350
I think that part of the work in the remote group, because of that experience that educators and parents had, we did spend some time talking about what the accountability would look like at the administrative level, at the educator level, and at the parent, caregiver, student level.

488
00:54:56,472 --> 00:54:59,976
We gave you a little sampling in the dynamic plan.

489
00:55:00,437 --> 00:55:08,748
We will have more of the details of that once we work through them collectively with the teachers.

490
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:15,031
Next one, I just wanted to raise a good idea by Julia here.

491
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:19,253
Can you do some more of these Q&As broken into elementary, middle, and high school sessions?

492
00:55:19,593 --> 00:55:22,874
So many different developmental and operational concerns.

493
00:55:23,475 --> 00:55:32,419
It's a great idea and also something we can bring up to the school-based teams because I can imagine that there's a lot of also specific information that's relevant to specific school contexts too.

494
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:33,600
Yeah, I like that.

495
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,960
I like that idea, Julia.

496
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,261
Yeah, Julia, thank you very much.

497
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:37,062
We'd love to do that.

498
00:55:37,622 --> 00:55:45,027
We'll work with our school principals to have them set up for probably next week just to give people some time and to start planning them out.

499
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:48,990
But we'll start planning them out out there.

500
00:55:51,664 --> 00:55:51,864
Great.

501
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:54,726
Next one, and thanks, Julia, for raising that.

502
00:55:54,846 --> 00:56:03,251
Next one relates back to the masks for all students, which is, I've heard parents say they don't want kids to have to wear masks all day, and I've heard about mask breaks.

503
00:56:03,391 --> 00:56:05,112
Will mask breaks happen outside?

504
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,591
So the answer to that is yes.

505
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:17,256
Our high school principal has actually worked to have class change work so that students can walk in the exterior of the building.

506
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:22,119
And we're going to try to have the mask breaks outside as much as possible.

507
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,604
It's really fundamentally critical, though, that I've seen some other questions about what if students refuse to wear a mask.

508
00:56:30,484 --> 00:56:33,426
So there are those students who will have medical reasons.

509
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:44,114
But for those students who are outright refusing to wear a mask, we'll have to really coach their families for remote learning.

510
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:56,364
This is a public health crisis, and we are working as best as possible to prepare our buildings and prepare our staff, as well as to protect our staff and students.

511
00:56:56,904 --> 00:57:01,788
And wearing a mask is a baseline minimum that is expected of our students.

512
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:04,939
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

513
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:10,100
Next question regarding grading and sort of falling behind.

514
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:16,942
Although grading and making assignments required makes sense, I am concerned about my child failing without my help.

515
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:20,042
I will be working full time and can't give her the help that I did in the spring.

516
00:57:20,222 --> 00:57:21,883
I think a lot of working parents feel this way.

517
00:57:22,243 --> 00:57:27,904
I'd also just like to say that everyone on this call right now has children, if not multiple children.

518
00:57:28,184 --> 00:57:32,805
So something that is definitely, we've thought about how do we provide supports to students and make sure that they can

519
00:57:33,365 --> 00:57:37,826
sort of stay up to speed, especially for families that, you know, will be working full time.

520
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:42,847
I don't know if someone on the team could dive into a bit more detail on that about some of the supports that may be in place.

521
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:47,808
So we're definitely going to be providing social emotional supports.

522
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:51,969
And again, there were a lot of lessons learned from this spring.

523
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:59,811
And so when we talked about initially going forward with our dynamic planning framework, the three guiding principles

524
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:03,551
were safety, consistency, and equity.

525
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:13,157
And so, again, an area that we received a lot of feedback that there needed to be greater consistency between schools and between grade levels.

526
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:15,559
That was something that we wanted to have.

527
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:21,863
But also in the spring, because we knew there were connectivity issues, some students didn't go online

528
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,524
some students were not as engaged.

529
00:58:25,105 --> 00:58:38,933
So now that we've had the experience of the spring, and we've received much clearer guidance thus far from DESE, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, about taking attendance.

530
00:58:39,393 --> 00:58:43,176
So if students, when each time they're logging on, whether it's

531
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:52,916
in that remote or on their hybrid days when they're having remote learning, that attendance would be done to check in to see where students are.

532
00:58:52,996 --> 00:59:04,343
So if we see students either not showing up or not being able to attend, we're going to be able to catch them a lot earlier so that they don't fall through the cracks.

533
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:05,403
Also,

534
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:19,375
There are going to be some in the dynamic plan where we gave the sample schedules, we do have moments where teachers are able to meet with students.

535
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:22,577
So they're gonna have that set up a few times a day.

536
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:29,960
So that could also be targeted times if they see a particular student who's struggling.

537
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:36,424
There are going to be office hours where they could follow up with certain students to find out is there,

538
00:59:38,297 --> 00:59:44,220
a social emotional need that as a district we need to be able to provide additional supports to the family?

539
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,402
Or is there something else along those lines that we could be doing?

540
00:59:50,002 --> 00:59:54,224
So I just want to say that we're aware of that.

541
00:59:55,365 --> 00:59:56,885
Grading will be taking place.

542
00:59:57,446 --> 01:00:01,487
Assignments will be critically important.

543
01:00:01,607 --> 01:00:04,889
But we're also going to be making sure to be able to follow up

544
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:07,260
with families and students.

545
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,140
And Ms.

546
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,261
Galussi has some additional information.

547
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:23,269
I just want to add to that, just to echo what Dr. Edouard Vincent said, but that we're accounting for some of that time to work with students specifically on those Wednesdays.

548
01:00:23,629 --> 01:00:28,872
Because we do know that some students are going to need a more individualized approach to help them

549
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,773
navigate the remote pieces.

550
01:00:32,234 --> 01:00:38,017
And I mean, I just have to say, you know, I have two children and one just can't do remote and struggle so much.

551
01:00:38,197 --> 01:00:44,661
And I had to reach out to the school so that I could get some help to make sure that, you know, she got through.

552
01:00:44,681 --> 01:00:45,821
So I would still encourage

553
01:00:47,282 --> 01:01:00,736
parents to also keep in communication with the school and reach out to the principals and counselors so that we can create a plan for your child from the beginning so that nothing is slipping through the cracks.

554
01:01:03,922 --> 01:01:09,147
So our next question I know is one that Tony Ray would be able to answer in great detail.

555
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:14,193
So if the answer is that we can share sort of this and follow up in writing after that may be the best that we can do now.

556
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:19,818
But I would just like to raise that I saw a lot of questions around what happens when cases break out, what are the quarantine protocols.

557
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:22,481
So I don't know if anyone on the team wants to jump into that.

558
01:01:22,982 --> 01:01:26,005
And if not, maybe share like how we can get that information to families.

559
01:01:26,913 --> 01:01:32,458
So, Leticia, it is actually detailed in the document.

560
01:01:33,518 --> 01:01:35,060
Let me just pull up mine right here.

561
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:43,346
So, I'll get you the exact page numbers, but we do have it specifically detailed out.

562
01:01:43,486 --> 01:01:45,688
It starts on page 42.

563
01:01:45,728 --> 01:01:46,629
So, starting on page 42.

564
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:47,409
No, 41.

565
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:50,852
Sorry, 41.

566
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:54,535
Headed through our dynamic reopening framework.

567
01:01:55,584 --> 01:02:01,271
uh... and it is there it is is basically pulled directly from the massachusetts part of public health

568
01:02:04,557 --> 01:02:13,743
And our head nurse, Tony Ray, was in direct contact with the Medford Department of Public Health throughout our entire planning process.

569
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:27,132
She was the representative because, you know, the responding to the COVID situation has definitely put a tremendous tax on our local resources.

570
01:02:27,312 --> 01:02:29,654
And so I'm very grateful for Tony Ray

571
01:02:30,174 --> 01:02:35,097
to be there as our representative in direct contact with Marianne O'Connor.

572
01:02:38,879 --> 01:02:44,382
So unfortunately we only have time for just maybe one or two more questions here.

573
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,844
One we haven't got to yet is around Wi-Fi.

574
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,846
So from Lori, what about the families that cannot afford Wi-Fi?

575
01:02:52,446 --> 01:02:56,929
I know this is also in the survey about Wi-Fi access, so I don't know if someone on the team can take that.

576
01:02:57,469 --> 01:03:04,393
Yeah, so Lori, actually yesterday morning, 50 T-Mobile wireless hotspots were delivered to the district.

577
01:03:04,974 --> 01:03:13,859
So we have last year, our survey represented that we had 35 families that needed Wi-Fi.

578
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,721
I'm actually surprised it was that low, but that's really great.

579
01:03:18,122 --> 01:03:23,125
So we have 50 wireless hotspots for our high needs families.

580
01:03:23,485 --> 01:03:23,785
All right.

581
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:29,871
Um, to be able to work, to be able to use, um, those wifi spots.

582
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:30,651
All right.

583
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:34,953
Can connect up to 15 devices now.

584
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:40,734
So maybe in, uh, maybe in, um, close quarters, um, they can be used.

585
01:03:40,894 --> 01:03:43,035
We'll work with families as more needed.

586
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:48,477
We want to make sure that we have as much connectivity as possible for all of our families.

587
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,034
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

588
01:03:54,295 --> 01:03:58,056
So we had hoped to be able to hold a session for about an hour tonight.

589
01:03:58,076 --> 01:04:10,099
We're a little bit over now, but I did want to give anyone on the team just a chance to close out the session, answer anything maybe they didn't have a chance to share or anything else about what kind of the next steps in this work are.

590
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,921
So I want to answer a question from Florence here.

591
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:16,601
Why were the dates of the phases not based on metrics?

592
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:18,622
The metrics were actually released today.

593
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,869
So just so you're aware, the metrics were released today.

594
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:27,514
The governor gave a press conference today at noon.

595
01:04:27,954 --> 01:04:28,194
Right.

596
01:04:28,254 --> 01:04:30,196
And that's when we learned about the metrics.

597
01:04:30,517 --> 01:04:40,686
And so all of the information that I shared with you at the start that I will post to our Facebook page later this evening, was all just published today.

598
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:44,570
The Johns Hopkins table was given to us last week.

599
01:04:45,046 --> 01:04:55,530
But the other information from the governor's presser today was new information just as of noon today.

600
01:04:56,710 --> 01:05:08,694
We're expecting some more information from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to come out later this evening or tomorrow that we will share just as soon as we get it.

601
01:05:13,604 --> 01:05:13,864
others.

602
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:15,265
No, correct.

603
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:23,172
So, uh, so I, on behalf of the team and I'll give the microphone to the superintendent a second.

604
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,254
I want to thank everybody for being here this evening.

605
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:28,176
Uh, we'll have another session tomorrow at 10 AM.

606
01:05:28,877 --> 01:05:37,444
Um, we really appreciate the feedback as we move through completely uncharted territory, um, without a star to sail our ship by.

607
01:05:38,084 --> 01:05:39,505
So thank you very much.

608
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:41,968
And, um, yep.

609
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:42,448
Thank you.

610
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,331
and our superintendent.

611
01:05:45,372 --> 01:05:45,732
Thank you.

612
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:50,076
I just want to reiterate what Dr. Cushing just stated.

613
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:51,717
Thank you to everyone who jumped on.

614
01:05:52,197 --> 01:05:53,839
Thank you for your questions and comments.

615
01:05:53,879 --> 01:06:04,807
We're going to continue to go through the other questions that we weren't able to get through, but I'm happy we were able to spend just this hour with you to try to answer some of the questions that came forward.

616
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:11,953
And again, for people, if your schedules permit for you to join again tomorrow morning, that would be great.

617
01:06:12,452 --> 01:06:17,078
We'll be on from 10 to 11 tomorrow morning for an additional listening session.

618
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,541
Thank you and have a good evening.

619
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:22,845
And I look forward to seeing you guys again soon.

620
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:23,506
Thank you.

621
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:24,728
All right.

622
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:26,170
Thank you, everybody.

623
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,832
We're going to end our broadcast now.
