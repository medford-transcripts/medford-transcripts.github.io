01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Minutes are approved.

166
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:25,024
[SPEAKER_14]: We have our minutes from the April 28th, 2021 curriculum subcommittee.

167
01:09:25,044 --> 01:09:27,226
[SPEAKER_14]: That's me.

168
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:50,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we met from four to 530 on April 28 that evening we discussed the science curriculum and the fine arts curriculum of particular importance in terms of science was that clearly this year was not a particularly good year for hands on.

169
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,461
[SPEAKER_08]: learning, but we should be set up for next year.

170
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:58,122
[SPEAKER_08]: The sequence of courses has changed in high school.

171
01:09:58,502 --> 01:10:05,284
[SPEAKER_08]: In ninth grade, we're doing biology and 10th grade chemistry and grade 11 and 12 are electives.

172
01:10:09,025 --> 01:10:16,667
[SPEAKER_08]: In the FOSS grades K to five, we're on year two of adoption and the overall cost was 285,000.

173
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:31,441
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in biology in high school at the high school biology, we need to consider adopting a new program.

174
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:43,123
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pearson Biology 2021 program will cost approximately $47,700 for textbooks and a six-year digital license.

175
01:10:44,884 --> 01:10:49,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to be something that we're going to be seeing, hopefully, in our budget.

176
01:10:50,509 --> 01:10:56,674
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, we were given a free year because we were unable to complete the pilot in 2020 for reasons we understand.

177
01:10:58,176 --> 01:11:00,837
[SPEAKER_08]: The science department is satisfied with how it was going.

178
01:11:02,078 --> 01:11:19,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is also a, we are being offered a smaller, slimmer book at no cost, Biology the Core, and it's seen that this book could be used very beneficially for EL and special ed populations because there's less text.

179
01:11:22,704 --> 01:11:29,366
[SPEAKER_08]: A new electives committee will start next year and we're going to work on promoting a co-teaching model.

180
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:39,969
[SPEAKER_08]: It was overly, I think the most important thing was it was clear that there were significant textbook needs.

181
01:11:40,869 --> 01:11:43,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that we'll be discussing that.

182
01:11:45,981 --> 01:11:53,706
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of music, of course, there was no singing this year at the elementary level.

183
01:11:54,086 --> 01:12:05,873
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there were other music lessons that stressed percussive activities and other things as were allowed.

184
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:13,517
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things which we talked a little bit about was that we had, of course, no introduction of the violin program.

185
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:20,154
[SPEAKER_08]: or of the band program, violin at fourth grade band at fifth grade.

186
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:24,096
[SPEAKER_08]: We also talked about funding for those programs.

187
01:12:24,877 --> 01:12:32,941
[SPEAKER_08]: The violins are offered to students for 20, I think in the fourth grade, all students get the opportunity to do that.

188
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:35,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the cost for the whole year is 25 and there's $25.

189
01:12:35,463 --> 01:12:36,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is a way of applying to,

190
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,411
[SPEAKER_08]: not pay that.

191
01:12:42,431 --> 01:12:50,016
[SPEAKER_08]: At the fifth grade level, there is no formalized way of providing students instruments who can't afford the rental fees.

192
01:12:51,036 --> 01:12:59,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always been an informal, the head of the department working to make sure that every kid who really wanted to play had an instrument.

193
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:01,362
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might look at that at some point.

194
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:08,066
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a music program called Quaver that was utilized this year to help with the music program.

195
01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:14,731
[SPEAKER_08]: because of all the things we couldn't do, and that seems to have gotten very good results.

196
01:13:15,912 --> 01:13:22,598
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a much longer, of course, copy of the minutes, but I think I'll leave it at this for the time being.

197
01:13:23,338 --> 01:13:24,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve.

198
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:25,720

[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mayor.

253
01:15:28,141 --> 01:15:38,904
[SPEAKER_20]: So we had previously approved this policy, and upon approval, we had sent it back for additional cleanup, if you will.

254
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:43,264
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a policy that we had been urged to pass from our attorney.

255
01:15:43,845 --> 01:15:49,346
[SPEAKER_20]: So we passed it as quickly as possible, but then went back and made some modifications.

256
01:15:49,966 --> 01:15:55,287
[SPEAKER_20]: There were no substantial changes other than cleaning up the language, and I'm just realizing

257
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:57,366
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that actually in our packets?

258
01:16:01,327 --> 01:16:02,267
[SPEAKER_20]: Is the policy?

259
01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:06,588
[SPEAKER_20]: Since I had it, I didn't look to see if it was in our packets.

260
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:13,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we have to motion to, does anybody else have that actual policy?

261
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:15,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see it in what Susie sent us.

262
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:20,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, motion to table to our May 24th meeting.

01:18:58,085 --> 01:19:04,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, we have Maureen Ronane, 43 Winter Street, Medford, parent and speaking about dyslexia.

317
01:19:05,247 --> 01:19:05,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

318
01:19:05,427 --> 01:19:05,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Ronane.

319
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:08,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Just let me find.

320
01:19:08,628 --> 01:19:09,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

321
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,329
[SPEAKER_14]: You're good.

322
01:19:11,349 --> 01:19:11,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

323
01:19:11,529 --> 01:19:13,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

324
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:19,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.

325
01:19:19,895 --> 01:19:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, thank you for having me here tonight.

326
01:19:21,858 --> 01:19:28,507
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Maureen running, and I'm the mother of six children, my three elementary school struggle significantly with reading.

327
01:19:29,087 --> 01:19:33,653
[SPEAKER_07]: They work with dedicated and professional teachers that genuinely care about the children.

328
01:19:34,564 --> 01:19:47,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Recently, the Department of Education released the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines to help guide districts and families understand and remediate this common language-based learning stability.

329
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:51,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe everyone has a copy of it, and it's on the minutes.

330
01:19:52,196 --> 01:20:00,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And on page 49 of the Dyslexia Guidelines, it references this Every Student Succeeds Act, which is called SF for short.

331
01:20:01,303 --> 01:20:09,810
[SPEAKER_07]: This federal law was passed in 2015, and it mandates that all reading intervention be evidence based peer reviewed and published in a journal.

332
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:19,299
[SPEAKER_07]: This effectively eliminates the eclectic approach, also referred to as pulling from different programs reading programs that takes place in the district.

333
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:25,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Our teachers need support and training in order to deliver evidence-based reading instruction with fidelity.

334
01:20:26,662 --> 01:20:36,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Our ETLs need to be trained in evidence-based reading instruction so that they know what a student is receiving is appropriate in accordance with this federal law.

335
01:20:37,286 --> 01:20:43,148
[SPEAKER_07]: My second son, Aiki, states that he will use picture cues to decode

336
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:46,540
[SPEAKER_07]: This is guessing, it's completely inappropriate.

337
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,622
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not evidence-based or peer reviewed.

338
01:20:48,862 --> 01:20:54,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually interferes with learning to read because it takes the student's eyes away from the letters.

339
01:20:55,748 --> 01:20:58,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that the district has made some changes in early literacy.

340
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:10,379
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we're still using journeys as a core curriculum that was so flawed that it is effectively banned in several states because it lacks some of the essential components for reading instruction.

341
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:16,565
[SPEAKER_07]: The district did recently buy a patch, but that doesn't help the kids that already went through this program.

342
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:24,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Our teachers are mandated to use the DRA, and I've seen F&P, as reading assessments.

343
01:21:24,532 --> 01:21:32,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Independent testing has stated that a teacher would be more accurate percentage-wise at predicting reading failure if she just flipped a coin.

344
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:50,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally reached out to Dr. Matthew Burns, who did this study, and he wrote that it is terrible at identifying struggling readers, and that most kids who struggle with reading couldn't actually read the book at their level.

345
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:52,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Prevention is the key.

346
01:21:53,078 --> 01:22:05,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm asking that all pre K and eighth grade general ed education teachers and their and the administration, take professional development in the language essentials for teaching reading and spelling program.

347
01:22:05,889 --> 01:22:08,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also called letters le TRS by Dr.

348
01:22:10,132 --> 01:22:24,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I am asking that every single special education teacher that supports students academically be trained and certified in lips or in Gillingham and ravo, which are all evidence based and peer reviewed programs that they teach with fidelity.

349
01:22:26,471 --> 01:22:33,635
[SPEAKER_07]: We also need one person that oversees all tiers of reading instruction and is accountable for ESSA compliance.

350
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:36,397
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our children deserve to be taught to read in school.

351
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:49,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Literacy should not be reserved for the lucky few that learn to read with little instruction or those with parents that have a lot of money for neuropsych testing, tutors, advocates, lawyers, and specialty dyslexia schools.

352
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:53,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I am asking that you request for significant funding from our city council

353
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:59,173
[SPEAKER_07]: so that all children can be taught to read, and our teachers, who are wonderful, are supported in this endeavor.

354
01:23:00,194 --> 01:23:00,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

355
01:23:02,296 --> 01:23:02,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ms.

356
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:03,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Ronayne.

357
01:23:03,117 --> 01:23:07,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Number- Mayor.

358
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:09,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, member Van der Kloot.

359
01:23:12,277 --> 01:23:23,309
[SPEAKER_08]: We received two letters this week that expressed concerns about comments that were made at a subcommittee meeting.

360
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:26,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I need to read those.

361
01:23:28,035 --> 01:23:33,477
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one was received was from Jenny pagan says dear mayor.

362
01:23:34,237 --> 01:23:49,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ready to express my concerns about a motion that was passed by school committee member probably so during school subcommittee meeting the other night, school committee member Mr. so motion to prohibit citizens from saying they are lifelong resident, or how many years they have lived in Medford for during school committee.

363
01:23:50,555 --> 01:23:53,818
[SPEAKER_08]: during school committee meetings, which are public meetings, if I'm not mistaken.

364
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:57,963
[SPEAKER_08]: This motion was passed by two other members, Jenny Graham and Melanie McLaughlin.

365
01:23:58,623 --> 01:24:02,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It is set to go in front of the school committee on the whole on May 10th for a vote, which it is not.

366
01:24:03,128 --> 01:24:08,093
[SPEAKER_08]: But while I understand our city, state and country is changing, I truly worry about the direction we are going in.

367
01:24:08,726 --> 01:24:10,268
[SPEAKER_08]: We are censoring like never before.

368
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:20,378
[SPEAKER_08]: We are prohibiting what people can say what people can read and what people can watch to prohibit a resident from sitting how many years they have lived somewhere is not only illegal but immoral.

369
01:24:20,498 --> 01:24:30,008
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you as a mayor and resident allow this we are seriously teetering on dangerous ground when we allow a school committee in a city of 60,000 people to start dictating what residents are

370
01:24:31,254 --> 01:24:33,594
[SPEAKER_08]: and are not allowed to say in a public meeting.

371
01:24:34,015 --> 01:24:37,155
[SPEAKER_08]: The school committee has done very little this year to address the needs of students.

372
01:24:38,015 --> 01:24:40,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I have seen bickering, crying, and complaining in no actual doing.

373
01:24:41,096 --> 01:24:44,416
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a superintendent that brings us national news every time there's a meeting.

374
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:45,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I watch the news.

375
01:24:45,697 --> 01:24:48,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not need a recap of it by Medford superintendent.

376
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:51,378
[SPEAKER_08]: We need the school committee and superintendent to help our children.

377
01:24:51,478 --> 01:24:58,479
[SPEAKER_08]: You have families suing the district to pay for their children to go to other schools that will help them because Medford district does not.

378
01:24:59,493 --> 01:25:02,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I just pause to say, of course, these are the views of this writer.

379
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:06,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that suits will cost the city thousands of dollars.

380
01:25:06,078 --> 01:25:20,369
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would know since I've already looked into one for my dyslexic daughter, you have helped one meeting to, you have held one meeting to address the concerns brought forward by the families with dyslexic children in which the high reps of the system came on and praised themselves for early screening.

381
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:24,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Dessie already made early screening a mandate, but they were right.

382
01:25:24,688 --> 01:25:29,233
[SPEAKER_08]: quite proud to go on, and I think they had anything to do with this.

383
01:25:29,313 --> 01:25:31,655
[SPEAKER_08]: While it's a step, it intervenes without diagnosing.

384
01:25:32,183 --> 01:25:41,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So while I am truly happy for the struggling reader in kindergarten to get intervention, I guess the dyslexics in fourth, fifth, middle school and high school can just keep on struggling.

385
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:43,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm tired, I'm scared, and I'm beyond frustrated.

386
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:45,171
[SPEAKER_08]: When does it stop?

387
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,692
[SPEAKER_08]: When do we start getting back the issue of our children?

388
01:25:47,752 --> 01:25:56,037
[SPEAKER_08]: We set up committees upon committee to address the 15,000 plus name change of school, but I still cannot get a clear answer of what reading program they're going to give my daughter for dyslexia.

389
01:25:56,632 --> 01:25:58,093
[SPEAKER_08]: You have parks falling apart.

390
01:25:58,173 --> 01:26:02,015
[SPEAKER_08]: My daughter was at a basketball clinic today and was covered in dirt because the court is falling apart.

391
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:06,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Same baseball court the students at the Curtis use.

392
01:26:06,697 --> 01:26:14,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Our city is dividing, our school committee is out of control and our superintendent cares more about social justice in other states than she does with the actual children of the city.

393
01:26:15,242 --> 01:26:18,563
[SPEAKER_08]: You are the elected mayor, do something please before our city falls further apart.

394
01:26:19,144 --> 01:26:23,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jenny Lynn Pagan, third generation lifelong Medford resident.

395
01:26:24,392 --> 01:26:29,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The other letter which I received was from Jada Higgins, dear elected school committee members.

396
01:26:29,755 --> 01:26:34,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ready to express my concerns of a motion put forward by Mr. Rousseau during a school committee meeting.

397
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:40,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I am shocked that a school committee member who is elected by the community now believes he has the right to silence the same community.

398
01:26:41,102 --> 01:26:45,485
[SPEAKER_08]: It is our right to have freedom of speech even if the speech doesn't align with Mr. Rousseau's beliefs.

399
01:26:46,427 --> 01:26:53,093
[SPEAKER_08]: The same line he is trying to stop problem from saying when they call in is written in many elected official speeches in Medford and beyond.

400
01:26:53,573 --> 01:26:57,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe people say it because they believe they are more important than someone who has lived here a shorter time.

401
01:26:58,518 --> 01:27:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it said because they are proud to be from Medford.

402
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:04,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't move here because it was convenient for our commute to work.

403
01:27:04,503 --> 01:27:06,024
[SPEAKER_08]: We stayed here because we love it here.

404
01:27:06,565 --> 01:27:10,608
[SPEAKER_08]: We love the fact that our kids can go to school with their cousins and with our childhood friends' children.

405
01:27:11,429 --> 01:27:12,170
[SPEAKER_08]: We love that if

406
01:27:12,674 --> 01:27:17,956
[SPEAKER_08]: We are running late, we can make a call and either a family member or a friend will always be there to pick our kids up from school.

407
01:27:18,496 --> 01:27:23,178
[SPEAKER_08]: We love that our classmates are now the ones protecting this city as police and firefighters.

408
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:24,218
[SPEAKER_08]: We love it here.

409
01:27:24,478 --> 01:27:28,760
[SPEAKER_08]: My parents both grew up here and chose to stay and raise their children here.

410
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,480
[SPEAKER_08]: My brother and I have made the same choice.

411
01:27:30,941 --> 01:27:34,602
[SPEAKER_08]: We chose this for the love of our city and the great people who make up this community.

412
01:27:35,128 --> 01:27:40,911
[SPEAKER_08]: With all due respect, Mr. Rousseau, do the job you were elected to do and focus on the children in this community education.

413
01:27:41,411 --> 01:27:44,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus on the kids struggling daily with learning disabilities.

414
01:27:44,113 --> 01:27:46,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus on getting all students back to school safely.

415
01:27:46,974 --> 01:27:50,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus on closing the gap between children and stop dividing the cities.

416
01:27:50,236 --> 01:27:54,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus on creating an environment in the schools where kids can be kids and have fun while learning.

417
01:27:54,799 --> 01:27:57,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus on finding and writing grants to update MHS.

418
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:03,243
[SPEAKER_08]: There are so many other areas you could focus on, but silencing this community should never be your focus.

419
01:28:03,323 --> 01:28:04,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Jada Higgins,

420
01:28:05,064 --> 01:28:08,127
[SPEAKER_08]: a lifelong resident, mother of three, school-aged children.

421
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the two letters I received.

422
01:28:11,089 --> 01:28:18,194
[SPEAKER_14]: And into the Mayor, into the Medford SC's email, thank you for reading those.

423
01:28:18,314 --> 01:28:18,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin?

424
01:28:21,437 --> 01:28:22,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

425
01:28:22,438 --> 01:28:23,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually wanted to respond to

426
01:28:25,243 --> 01:28:25,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

427
01:28:25,444 --> 01:28:27,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Ronayne and thank her for her advocacy.

428
01:28:27,486 --> 01:28:42,225
[SPEAKER_13]: She has been a long standing advocate in this work and I know myself as an advocate, advocating for our children is not easy especially coming before officials and doing all the research that she has done so I would like to

429
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:45,486
[SPEAKER_13]: we will move forward with.

430
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:58,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we have been discussing if Miss Ronayne was not in the budget meeting for the last one, we were discussing professional development on Orton-Gillingham, so we will definitely be keeping that in mind as we're moving forward with the budget.

431
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:00,249
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to thank her for that.

432
01:29:00,349 --> 01:29:02,390
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I did want to address the letters.

433
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:11,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say I was not a part of that meeting, so I'm missing some of the context of this, although I was made aware after about some of the concern.

434
01:29:12,392 --> 01:29:27,457
[SPEAKER_13]: which of course is understandable and I want to ensure that people in the community do not, I'm concerned that people think that we're trying to, the rules policy and equity subcommittee is trying to quash public speech.

435
01:29:27,877 --> 01:29:29,437
[SPEAKER_13]: We couldn't even if we wanted to.

436
01:29:30,017 --> 01:29:34,959
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, you know, people can get up and frankly say for the most part what they want given the amount of time that

437
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:42,746
[SPEAKER_13]: is part of the policy so that was not the intent so I'm not sure you know where this is coming from or why people are

438
01:29:43,486 --> 01:29:46,528
[SPEAKER_13]: feeling that way, but again, I was not at the first portion of the meeting.

439
01:29:46,628 --> 01:29:50,791
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have no problem with people saying how long they've lived in Medford.

440
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:56,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I've lived in Medford for 20 something years, and I don't know how many minutes or seconds, but I am proud to live here.

441
01:29:56,335 --> 01:29:57,115
[SPEAKER_13]: I love this city.

442
01:29:57,536 --> 01:29:59,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I raised my children here, and this is my children's home.

443
01:30:00,097 --> 01:30:06,562
[SPEAKER_13]: They will always be from Medford, and we are proud of this community, and it is a community as a whole.

444
01:30:06,942 --> 01:30:12,406
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's new residents, old residents, multi-generation residents, brown, black, white,

445
01:30:13,306 --> 01:30:19,228
[SPEAKER_13]: yellow, every color, you know, you can imagine, we are Medford, and we need to figure out how to move forward on this.

446
01:30:19,328 --> 01:30:25,790
[SPEAKER_13]: And as far as our superintendent, I want to say, I am so grateful that we have a superintendent that is committed to social justice.

447
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:33,073
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to say it's about time that people are talking about social justice issues, because they are part of an education for our children.

448
01:30:33,652 --> 01:30:34,573
[SPEAKER_13]: for all of our children.

449
01:30:34,633 --> 01:30:43,277
[SPEAKER_13]: So thanks to the folks who are writing, we would never ever ask that people not be inclusive in our community.

450
01:30:43,617 --> 01:30:43,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

451
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:46,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

452
01:30:47,259 --> 01:30:52,382
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you clearing that up because my phone rang off the hook about that policy.

453
01:30:52,842 --> 01:30:53,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Van der Kloot.

454
01:30:54,766 --> 01:31:01,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, well, I just want to say that, you know, I wasn't part of that subcommittee.

455
01:31:02,028 --> 01:31:20,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly would not support anything that says that a community member can't express how long they lived in Medford or their lifelong residence, or if they just moved in yesterday, because I do believe it's a question of the person who's coming before us has

456
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:26,563
[SPEAKER_08]: The right to speak openly and for many people, they want to express that.

457
01:31:28,646 --> 01:31:32,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know how exactly that conversation all.

458
01:31:33,145 --> 01:31:36,266
[SPEAKER_08]: went forward, we did not have the transcript of the meetings tonight.

459
01:31:36,766 --> 01:31:41,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And I understand that Mr. Russo is going to relook at that if I'm correct.

460
01:31:42,929 --> 01:31:44,509
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't want to speak for the subcommittee.

461
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:47,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just expressing my own own personal feeling.

462
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:50,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to stand up and say thank you to the superintendent.

463
01:31:51,612 --> 01:31:53,973
[SPEAKER_08]: We've heard this now reframe a couple of times.

464
01:31:54,533 --> 01:32:00,357
[SPEAKER_08]: about concerns when she mentions other things, other events that are going on in the world.

465
01:32:00,377 --> 01:32:15,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's very important that we realize that we are part of the world and the things that the superintendent is talking about, certainly around social justice issues, racism, diversity issues, that those are important to us.

466
01:32:17,046 --> 01:32:21,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And that I actually take exception to people who don't feel

467
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:27,653
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we are sitting here and listening intently.

468
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:38,079
[SPEAKER_08]: We give opportunity to the community to speak, but I also certainly want to always be open and hearing our superintendent express her thoughts.

469
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,741
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really, frankly, what we pay her for.

470
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:44,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member Kreatz.

471
01:32:50,059 --> 01:32:50,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Cathy you're muted.

472
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

473
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:51,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

474
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:53,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I just realized I had it kind of blocked.

475
01:32:54,362 --> 01:32:55,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't see the microphone.

476
01:32:55,864 --> 01:32:59,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I just wanted to say that I wasn't at that meeting either.

477
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:04,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I was busy doing something else but I did, you know, get increased from different residents and

478
01:33:05,712 --> 01:33:20,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I to agree with the residents that I don't want to limit what residents are saying if they want to mention that they've lived here for many years or three months or six weeks, that's their right and responsibility to say that.

479
01:33:20,209 --> 01:33:20,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

480
01:33:22,792 --> 01:33:26,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that the policy committee is going to revisit some of the language.

481
01:33:27,098 --> 01:33:40,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I also recommend and maybe suggest that the language get reviewed by the city solicitor's office, or, you know, if they could seek advice from them to make sure that, you know, there isn't anything in the policy that's going to limit

482
01:33:43,236 --> 01:33:46,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to mention that.

483
01:33:46,837 --> 01:34:02,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to mention that I enjoy hearing from the superintendent when she shares her her, you know, biweekly updates with us, and it's interesting, and it's just informational and I appreciate it.

484
01:34:02,924 --> 01:34:04,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to mention that as well.

485
01:34:05,665 --> 01:34:06,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

486
01:34:11,857 --> 01:34:17,300
[SPEAKER_20]: This is about a blatant violation of open meeting law, as we sit here and talk about the laws and the Constitution.

487
01:34:17,801 --> 01:34:22,143
[SPEAKER_20]: This is as blatant a violation of the open meeting law as I can probably fathom.

488
01:34:22,683 --> 01:34:25,685
[SPEAKER_20]: So can I suggest we move on before we all end up fined?

489
01:34:31,108 --> 01:34:35,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Reporter of Superintendent, number one, superintendents updates and comments, Madam Superintendent.

490
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:44,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

491
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:48,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you for this opportunity to come before you and share my remarks.

492
01:34:50,619 --> 01:34:54,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, this is your proud superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent.

493
01:34:55,665 --> 01:35:04,374
[SPEAKER_05]: First off this evening in my remarks tonight, sadly, I must inform you all that we recently lost a member of our Mustang community.

494
01:35:06,072 --> 01:35:11,993
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our culinary arts teachers at the Medford Vocational Technical High School, Mr. Dennis Moriarty.

495
01:35:13,653 --> 01:35:16,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis began his teaching career with the Medford Public Schools in 1995.

496
01:35:17,374 --> 01:35:22,135
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a teacher and mentor to so many of his students.

497
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:32,497
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the vocational teachers, Mr. John Brown, said the following, and so this is an excerpt of what was submitted

498
01:35:34,472 --> 01:35:40,857
[SPEAKER_05]: On Tuesday, April 27th, 2021, the Medford Public Schools lost a valuable member of the community.

499
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:47,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis Moriarty dedicated 26 years of his life teaching culinary arts at the Vocational High School.

500
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:57,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis had been a part of the culinary program since its humble beginnings when the only kitchen equipment was a stove and an ice box.

501
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:04,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis was extremely proud of the culinary program and he cherished working with the youth of Medford and serving the community.

502
01:36:06,714 --> 01:36:14,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis was also an avid outdoorsman who loved to spend time with friends, hunting, fishing, or riding motorcycles.

503
01:36:15,962 --> 01:36:31,427
[SPEAKER_05]: He was especially proud of catching the biggest cod on one excursion on the Bunny Clark and never missed an opportunity to show someone the sticker he received for that occasion, which he had proudly and conveniently displayed behind his desk in Cafe Electra.

504
01:36:33,108 --> 01:36:36,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever Dennis caught would typically wind up on the menu at the bistro.

505
01:36:37,675 --> 01:36:45,000
[SPEAKER_05]: After a good day on a boat, Dennis would be in his glory at the bistro overseeing the students, cranking out a batch of fish cakes.

506
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It was quite a sight to behold.

507
01:36:48,081 --> 01:36:50,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis will be missed by his students, colleagues, and friends.

508
01:36:52,164 --> 01:36:58,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis had the natural ability to strike up a conversation with a complete stranger as if they were old friends.

509
01:36:58,888 --> 01:37:05,372
[SPEAKER_05]: This trait enabled him to connect with his students and made them feel like they were part of something special in the culinary arts program.

510
01:37:06,857 --> 01:37:14,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis was a part of the Medford Volk family and the greater Mustang community, and his loss leaves a void that can never be filled.

511
01:37:14,884 --> 01:37:20,109
[SPEAKER_05]: To his family and friends, we extend our deepest sympathy, and may he rest in peace.

512
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:29,838
[SPEAKER_05]: May is the month that we honor and celebrate our teachers, our principals, and our nurses.

513
01:37:32,412 --> 01:37:44,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in this past year, like no other, it's very, very well deserved that they are praised and commended for going above and beyond the call of duty during this worldwide pandemic.

514
01:37:46,097 --> 01:37:52,820
[SPEAKER_05]: We have simply the best Mustang staff, and that was proven once again during this very trying time.

515
01:37:55,605 --> 01:38:02,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Please note that this Wednesday marks the end of Ramadan for our Muslim friends, and this Thursday is Eid al-Fitr.

516
01:38:03,988 --> 01:38:05,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Eid means celebration.

517
01:38:05,228 --> 01:38:13,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Eid al-Fitr features two to three days of celebrations that include special morning prayers.

518
01:38:14,171 --> 01:38:18,192
[SPEAKER_05]: People greet each other with Eid Mubarak, meaning blessed Eid.

519
01:38:19,203 --> 01:38:20,504
[SPEAKER_05]: and with formal embraces.

520
01:38:21,124 --> 01:38:28,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet dishes are prepared at home and gifts or money are given to children and to those in need.

521
01:38:30,129 --> 01:38:37,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So I say early in advance, Eid Mubarak to all of those that will be celebrating the holiday this Thursday.

522
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:42,636
[SPEAKER_05]: May is also both Asian-American

523
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:49,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Month, as well as Jewish Heritage Month.

524
01:38:51,329 --> 01:38:57,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of these groups have experienced numerous acts of racial hate over the course of this year.

525
01:38:59,311 --> 01:39:08,213
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford Public Schools supports our Asian community, most especially during this very difficult year of pain and fear.

526
01:39:09,578 --> 01:39:19,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, we support our members of the Jewish community who have also been the targets of antisemitism and white nationalism.

527
01:39:20,326 --> 01:39:24,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of these groups have made important contributions to our society.

528
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:31,314
[SPEAKER_05]: In the words of the Torah, justice, justice shall you pursue.

529
01:39:32,555 --> 01:39:34,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be very clear.

530
01:39:35,667 --> 01:39:40,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I will always speak out against any and all racist acts.

531
01:39:41,631 --> 01:39:52,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It is imperative that we as a community do all we can to note that hate in any form has no place in the Mustang community.

532
01:39:56,482 --> 01:40:01,967
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I would like to send out a special congratulations to the Mustang football team

533
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,724
[SPEAKER_05]: for beating Malden 24 to 21 on Saturday.

534
01:40:07,925 --> 01:40:13,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Thanksgiving in May and it resulted in a great win for Medford.

535
01:40:14,411 --> 01:40:19,596
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first time in five years that Medford High School beat Malden.

536
01:40:20,617 --> 01:40:22,799
[SPEAKER_05]: What an exciting day for our Mustangs.

537
01:40:25,245 --> 01:40:46,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It is with great pleasure that I also commend one of our outstanding students, Adrita Samanta, a grade seven student at the Andrews Middle School, who received the 2021 American Mathematics Contest AMC 8 Young Women in Mathematics Award.

538

01:47:14,036 --> 01:47:18,297
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to say that Wednesday, May 12th is School Nurses Day.

579
01:47:18,857 --> 01:47:29,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to acknowledge my staff and my letter of appreciation for our nurses was included in Sunday's edition of the Boston Globe Salute to Nurses.

580
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:32,521
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you team for all of the work that you've done.

581
01:47:34,067 --> 01:47:45,689
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Medford statistics, we remain in the yellow zone with an average of four to five new cases per day and a positivity rate of 0.95.

582
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:48,950
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making progress and this is good news to report.

583
01:47:50,430 --> 01:48:02,493
[SPEAKER_00]: In our schools, since our last meeting, we administered 4,543 tests during the week that ended on April 30th and found four positive cases.

584
01:48:03,443 --> 01:48:11,910
[SPEAKER_00]: During the week ending May 7th, we administered 4,683 tests and had zero positive pools.

585
01:48:12,591 --> 01:48:18,496
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very pleased with the status in our schools and thank everyone for following the public health guidelines.

586
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:33,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our staff and students over the age of 16 have been vaccinated, and I ask that parents forward a copy of their child's COVID vaccination card to the school nurse at their school so we may include this information in their health record.

587
01:48:35,492 --> 01:48:47,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, I'm also pleased to announce that the FDA authorized the change in eligibility for the Pfizer vaccine, and now adolescents who are 12 years and older are eligible to receive the vaccine.

588
01:48:48,341 --> 01:48:54,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Planning is underway for a vaccine clinic at the Andrews Middle School next year, next week, excuse me.

589
01:48:55,306 --> 01:49:00,330
[SPEAKER_00]: And a message will be sent out shortly to parents for registration at the clinic.

590
01:49:01,499 --> 01:49:08,983
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a parent interested in obtaining a free COVID vaccine for your child, please register on the links that will be provided in the message.

591
01:49:09,423 --> 01:49:12,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thank the Medford Board of Health for organizing this clinic.

592
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:20,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to turn the next portion over to Mr. Murphy as he has some updates for you as well.

593
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:21,750
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Ms.

594
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:22,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Ray.

595
01:49:22,351 --> 01:49:23,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a very quick update.

596
01:49:23,491 --> 01:49:30,135
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had a few questions that have come in from committee members and also from community members with regard to the district's policies and procedures

597
01:49:30,923 --> 01:49:35,647
[SPEAKER_18]: related to the PPE protocols that we've all gotten used to over the course of the last year.

598
01:49:36,547 --> 01:49:45,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of you are probably familiar with how some of the guidelines have changed at the federal level in recent weeks, and at the state level, for that matter.

599
01:49:46,095 --> 01:49:53,961
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's, I think, probably a likelihood that we'll see a further loosening of certain restrictions between now and the end of the school year.

600
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:59,345
[SPEAKER_18]: As of this time, the practices that we put in place related to mask wearing,

601
01:49:59,979 --> 01:50:12,586
[SPEAKER_18]: when the school committee was briefed on the return to school plan over the summer, and to which we have, as an organization, strictly adhered to over the course of the school year, will remain in effect until the conclusion of this school year.

602
01:50:12,646 --> 01:50:23,072
[SPEAKER_18]: So at this time, we have no expectation that we'll be revisiting our face mask policy at any time prior to the conclusion of school in the 21-22 school year.

603
01:50:25,975 --> 01:50:35,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Needless to say, there's questions as to exactly what our protocols will look like at the beginning of the 21-22 school year and then throughout the school year.

604
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:40,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are issues that we will revisit over the course of the summer and issue additional guidance.

605
01:50:41,043 --> 01:50:54,090
[SPEAKER_18]: But just for purposes of clarity, we don't envision at this time any changes between now and the end of the school year, irrespective of what happens at the state or federal level related to mask wearing.

606
01:50:54,918 --> 01:50:59,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, when the distancing requirements were loosened, that has an operational implication to us.

607
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:06,723
[SPEAKER_18]: It allowed us to put us in a position where we're able to increase our in-person instruction in a way that was considered safe.

608
01:51:07,723 --> 01:51:13,206
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that is an adjustment that we made, and that's a flexibility that we'll continue to maintain.

609
01:51:13,906 --> 01:51:23,930
[SPEAKER_18]: But with regard to the mask wearing, the only exceptions under the guidance provided by the state at this point are medically-based exceptions

610
01:51:24,573 --> 01:51:28,715
[SPEAKER_18]: And that will continue to be the case from now until the conclusion of the school year.

611
01:51:28,775 --> 01:51:33,958
[SPEAKER_18]: So if there are changes, we'll certainly continue to consult with the Board of Health and Ms.

612
01:51:33,978 --> 01:51:35,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Ray and her staff will be involved in that as well.

613
01:51:36,839 --> 01:51:45,944
[SPEAKER_18]: But regardless of what's happening outside of the world of the Medford Public Schools, right now we do not anticipate any changes between now and the close of school.

614
01:51:52,392 --> 01:51:53,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there are any questions, Ms.

615
01:51:53,852 --> 01:51:55,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Rae and myself would be happy to take them at this time.

616
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:05,076
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there are not, we'll be happy to move on.

617
01:52:10,578 --> 01:52:12,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, it looks like- Yes.

618
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:13,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Kreatz has her hand up.

619
01:52:14,628 --> 01:52:14,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

620
01:52:14,888 --> 01:52:15,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

621
01:52:15,148 --> 01:52:15,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Injury in my house.

622
01:52:16,209 --> 01:52:20,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was having trouble finding the button anyways.

623
01:52:21,092 --> 01:52:21,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yes.

624
01:52:21,672 --> 01:52:22,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, thank you, Mr. Murphy.

625
01:52:23,053 --> 01:52:36,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, I just have a question in regards to outdoor sports, um, with the warm temperatures coming up and the mask wearing, you know, I have heard several different reports on, you know, on the news and so forth that, you know,

626
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:41,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard for the students to breathe with the masks on.

627
01:52:42,501 --> 01:52:48,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Is our mask policy that's going to remain in effect for both indoors and outdoors?

628
01:52:49,323 --> 01:52:50,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you clarify that?

629
01:52:51,143 --> 01:52:57,825
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything school related, distancing and mask and face coverings, our policies will stay in effect.

630
01:52:57,885 --> 01:53:04,566
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that, and I'd invite Dr. Cushing if he wants to comment on anything related to MIA or additional guidance.

631
01:53:04,996 --> 01:53:06,196
[SPEAKER_18]: that has come from that organization.

632
01:53:06,216 --> 01:53:10,818
[SPEAKER_18]: But for purposes of our organization, we're going to maintain consistency.

633
01:53:11,238 --> 01:53:16,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, I think as the weather gets warmer, there's probably a greater need for mask breaks from time to time.

634
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:19,681
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's certainly something that coaches in the athletic department will be advised of.

635
01:53:19,722 --> 01:53:22,262
[SPEAKER_18]: But beyond that, our policies will stay the same.

636
01:53:22,282 --> 01:53:24,403
[SPEAKER_18]: But Dr. Cushing, did you want to add anything to that?

637
01:53:24,983 --> 01:53:25,224
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

638
01:53:25,304 --> 01:53:27,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Murphy, you've done an excellent job.

639
01:53:27,464 --> 01:53:31,526
[SPEAKER_21]: And once again, this is another situation where we're not only beholden to

640
01:53:32,228 --> 01:53:42,676
[SPEAKER_21]: our own Board of Health's regulations, but as a member of the Greater Boston League and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, the MIAA, we're also beholden to their rules and regulations of play.

641
01:53:44,898 --> 01:53:45,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

642
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:48,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

643
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:55,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Number three, we have special education update, TAIRD-focused monitoring report.

644
01:53:56,206 --> 01:53:57,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Director of Pupil Services, Ms.

645
01:53:57,687 --> 01:53:58,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Joan Bowen.

646
01:53:59,553 --> 01:54:01,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, school committee members.

647
01:54:02,154 --> 01:54:06,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight I will be presenting the tiered focus monitoring final report from DESE.

648
01:54:07,597 --> 01:54:15,420
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what was formerly known as the Coordinated Program Review, and it is now called the tiered focus monitoring.

649
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

650
01:54:20,028 --> 01:54:24,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So Medford has been identified as Group B and we're a Tier Level 1.

651
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:29,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tier Level 1 are districts that have been determined to have no or low risk.

652
01:54:30,412 --> 01:54:33,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the Tier 1 is a self-directed improvement.

653
01:54:34,193 --> 01:54:41,336
[SPEAKER_02]: DESE provides us with data points and that we were indicated no concern on compliance and performance outcomes.

654
01:54:41,396 --> 01:54:43,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would meet the requirements.

655
01:54:44,379 --> 01:54:51,345
[SPEAKER_02]: DESE also monitors compliance regulatory requirements focusing on special education and civil rights.

656
01:54:51,666 --> 01:54:55,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the major focus of our TAF focus monitoring review this year.

657
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:58,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be reviewed every three years.

658
01:54:59,032 --> 01:55:02,074
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be back in 2023, school year 2023-24 to conduct the next evaluation.

659
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:19,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, the department has reserved a specific set of criteria known as targeted standards that looks at school level risk assessment data to indicate if there's a potential issue.

660
01:55:20,404 --> 01:55:26,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So they provided us with targeted standards that we had to provide documentation to.

661
01:55:27,652 --> 01:55:28,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

662
01:55:30,492 --> 01:55:43,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of these universal standards were in regards to licensure and professional development, parents, student, and community engagement, our school facilities and classroom observations.

663
01:55:44,162 --> 01:55:48,746
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, they did not do any in-person observations due to COVID.

664
01:55:50,047 --> 01:55:53,729
[SPEAKER_02]: They look at oversight, time and learning, and equal access.

665
01:55:54,710 --> 01:55:55,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

666
01:55:57,063 --> 01:56:16,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are in the self-assessment phase and we had to go through all of their criteria, which I will show you in a minute, and present to them and upload to the security portal all of our documentation that related to all of the criteria for both special education and civil rights.

667
01:56:17,096 --> 01:56:24,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And after we did the internal review, we got the documentation together and we presented it and uploaded it in October of 2020.

668
01:56:24,301 --> 01:56:26,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

669
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:33,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, they will come out and review student records for special education.

670
01:56:33,632 --> 01:56:34,712
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not do that.

671
01:56:35,172 --> 01:56:39,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I anticipate this will be completed in school year 2023.

672
01:56:40,054 --> 01:56:43,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they reviewed all of the documents for special education and civil rights.

673
01:56:44,555 --> 01:56:45,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

674
01:56:47,356 --> 01:56:52,958
[SPEAKER_02]: In February of 2021, they sent out surveys to parents of students with disabilities.

675
01:56:53,993 --> 01:57:03,395
[SPEAKER_02]: This was to solicit information regarding their experience with the district's implementation of special education programs, related services and procedural requirements.

676
01:57:04,376 --> 01:57:11,357
[SPEAKER_02]: After they received all the surveys, they came out and well, via Zoom conducted interviews with staff.

677
01:57:11,417 --> 01:57:13,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So this occurred in March.

678
01:57:14,098 --> 01:57:19,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Interviews of staff were consistent with the criteria selected for onsite verification.

679
01:57:19,559 --> 01:57:22,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wanted to know if there were processes

680
01:57:22,627 --> 01:57:26,048
[SPEAKER_02]: put into place, and that everyone was following these procedures.

681
01:57:26,929 --> 01:57:36,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Interviews of the CPAC, our Parent Advisory Council representatives, and other telephone interviews as requested by other parents or members of the general public.

682
01:57:36,713 --> 01:57:37,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

683
01:57:39,254 --> 01:57:49,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the on-site visit, we had an informal exit interview, and they just summarized their comments for us and to the superintendent and myself.

684
01:57:50,619 --> 01:57:52,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about an hour-long interview,

685
01:57:52,974 --> 01:57:58,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what they do is then take all of the information and go back to see if where the district fell.

686
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:09,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Were we implementing procedures and regulations and not implementing, or were we in the progress of doing this?

687
01:58:09,648 --> 01:58:16,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if they identify any of those areas, the district would go on a continuous improvement and monitoring plan.

688
01:58:16,854 --> 01:58:21,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would describe the measurement mechanism and provide a completion timeframe

689
01:58:22,117 --> 01:58:26,679
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring those areas into compliance with the controlling statute or regulation.

690
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:35,163
[SPEAKER_02]: LEAs are expected to incorporate these actions into their district and school improvement plans, including their professional development plans.

691
01:58:35,783 --> 01:58:36,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

692
01:58:38,213 --> 01:58:44,534
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the ratings that districts are given based on the special ed and civil rights criteria that DESE had selected.

693
01:58:45,155 --> 01:58:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going from not applicable to commendable.

694
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:58,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically districts might be found that they're partially implementing or that they're fully implementing all important aspects.

695
01:58:59,658 --> 01:59:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

696
01:59:02,678 --> 01:59:09,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were very, these were the special ed criteria that we were selected to provide the documentation regarding.

697
01:59:10,704 --> 01:59:13,046
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, there's a pretty good list of them.

698
01:59:13,066 --> 01:59:15,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we were also to do the civil rights.

699
01:59:15,909 --> 01:59:16,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

700
01:59:18,691 --> 01:59:19,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was,

701
01:59:20,792 --> 01:59:33,298
[SPEAKER_02]: buried anywhere from describing what our academic programs are, what special education students have access to, our school year schedules, student discipline, that sort of thing.

702
01:59:33,799 --> 01:59:34,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

703
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:44,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just the remainder of the civil rights criteria that they reviewed during their interviews and the documentation that we provided to them.

704
01:59:45,185 --> 01:59:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

705
01:59:48,325 --> 01:59:59,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So the findings from Medford Public Schools were that we were found to be in compliance with all of the criteria monitored during the TA focus monitoring review and no corrective action is required at this time.

706
02:00:00,194 --> 02:00:07,420
[SPEAKER_02]: What's also very exciting is that we received a rating of commendable with our relationship and collaboration with CPAC.

707
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:11,983
[SPEAKER_02]: and with the primary focus of improving special education services.

708
02:00:13,204 --> 02:00:28,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Our reviewer said that this was the first time that she has ever seen a district work so closely with their CPAC and she wants us to package it and to be able to provide this to other districts and how we are able to work together.

709
02:00:28,395 --> 02:00:34,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a great rating to be able to see that we were commendable in that area.

710
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:35,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.

711
02:00:37,016 --> 02:00:40,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is how they break down the findings.

712
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:48,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are in full compliance with all the universal standards regarding with special education and civil rights that they identified for us.

713
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:49,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

714
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:57,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to say a special thank you to all the special education coordinators and Medford Public School administrators.

715
02:00:58,406 --> 02:01:04,071
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the ones that had to provide me with the documentation to be able to complete this report.

716
02:01:04,612 --> 02:01:09,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to thank the staff members who were selected to do the interviews.

717
02:01:09,557 --> 02:01:14,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, Principal Paul DeLeva, Mr. Craig Drowski,

718
02:01:15,692 --> 02:01:19,675
[SPEAKER_02]: our CPAC co-chairpersons, Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lark.

719
02:01:20,016 --> 02:01:27,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just like to thank you, send a thank you to all the special education parents and caregivers who took the time to complete the survey.

720
02:01:27,502 --> 02:01:31,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the presentation and thank you very much.

721
02:01:35,068 --> 02:01:35,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ms.

722
02:01:35,528 --> 02:01:35,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Bowen.

723
02:01:38,771 --> 02:01:40,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Next, we have a member McLaughlin.

724
02:01:41,897 --> 02:01:43,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

725
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:47,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to say congratulations to Ms.

726
02:01:47,205 --> 02:01:49,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Bowen and staff, and Ms.

727
02:01:49,749 --> 02:01:56,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Bowen, I know that was your first CPR report, so congratulations, you made it over that.

728
02:01:56,860 --> 02:01:57,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that's a big deal.

729
02:01:58,842 --> 02:02:12,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Every three years it's a big report to go through so thank you and thanks to all your staff for all of the hard work and also a special thank you to CPAC of whom I'm very proud that that relationship has been built so strong.

730
02:02:13,193 --> 02:02:19,815
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that you'll share that information with Kathy Medaglio as well, because I'm sure she'll be very happy to hear that, our former Director of Pupil Services.

731
02:02:20,075 --> 02:02:27,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the civil rights and the other piece, this was super helpful in terms of the layout with the PowerPoint.

732
02:02:27,957 --> 02:02:30,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I felt like the report was less so.

733
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:34,239
[SPEAKER_13]: I think your description of the report was so much more helpful than the report itself.

734
02:02:34,299 --> 02:02:36,340
[SPEAKER_13]: It used to be a lot more involved, and this is sort of

735
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:38,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Less so, have you found that to be the case?

736
02:02:39,222 --> 02:02:44,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the years, they will pull out instead of going over everything, it's in the self-assessment phase.

737
02:02:44,725 --> 02:02:51,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wanna see if there's areas that you need to improve in and they assist you in getting to that point.

738
02:02:51,830 --> 02:03:02,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they come back three years later, they wanna make sure that anything that had to be changed or implemented differently, that that is happening during their next visit to us.

739
02:03:02,518 --> 02:03:02,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

740
02:03:03,370 --> 02:03:03,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

741
02:03:03,831 --> 02:03:08,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll be coming back in 2023, you said, to do the in-person visits and observations?

742
02:03:08,437 --> 02:03:08,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

743
02:03:09,719 --> 02:03:10,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

744
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:10,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

745
02:03:11,361 --> 02:03:11,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

746
02:03:12,262 --> 02:03:12,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Congrats.

747
02:03:13,624 --> 02:03:13,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

748
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:32,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to really just extend a humongous thank you to Miss Joan Bowen, our Director of Pupil Services, because to get through the entire TFM process was a tremendous amount of work for her and her entire team.

749
02:03:33,825 --> 02:03:41,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it seems easy just seeing that we're implementing and we're at a commendable level.

750
02:03:42,211 --> 02:03:47,535
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to get there, all of our documentation, everything had to be in order.

751
02:03:47,595 --> 02:03:54,120
[SPEAKER_05]: There are so many requirements that need to be met in order to meet the standard.

752
02:03:54,880 --> 02:04:13,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the fact that Medford really is meeting the standards set before us by the state and that we got such positive ratings, I just want to restate and really thank Joan and her entire team that helped to make it possible.

753
02:04:14,414 --> 02:04:15,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to say that again.

754
02:04:15,895 --> 02:04:16,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

755
02:04:17,196 --> 02:04:17,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

756
02:04:18,197 --> 02:04:18,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

757
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:19,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job.

758
02:04:21,848 --> 02:04:32,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Number four, we have recommendation to accept donation of $300 to the Fine Arts Department from John and Topper and Topper Modern Hardware and Paint Company.

759
02:04:32,596 --> 02:04:33,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Bernadette Briccadeli.

760
02:04:41,993 --> 02:04:55,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening Madam Mayor and members of the school committee, I'm here this evening to recommend the acceptance of a $300 donation from Medford high school alumnus john and tapa in conjunction with modern hardware and paint company.

761
02:04:56,319 --> 02:05:04,102
[SPEAKER_17]: One out of concern across the country that the arts would suffer amid the pandemic, Mr. and top of wanted to contribute to the Medford arts program.

762
02:05:05,142 --> 02:05:14,924
[SPEAKER_17]: He created a piece of wood slab art and raffled it off to the many local customers of Modern Hardware, raising $300 for our arts program.

763
02:05:15,284 --> 02:05:18,985
[SPEAKER_17]: We are truly grateful to both John and Tapa and Modern Hardware.

764
02:05:19,305 --> 02:05:19,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

765
02:05:20,546 --> 02:05:21,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

766
02:05:21,586 --> 02:05:22,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Great job.

767
02:05:22,066 --> 02:05:27,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve by member Rousseau, seconded by member Kreatz.

768
02:05:27,547 --> 02:05:28,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call.

769
02:05:29,828 --> 02:05:31,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

770
02:05:33,178 --> 02:05:33,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Kreatz?

771
02:05:34,218 --> 02:05:34,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

772
02:05:35,759 --> 02:05:36,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin?

773
02:05:36,559 --> 02:05:36,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

774
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:38,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Mustone?

775
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:38,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

776
02:05:39,801 --> 02:05:40,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

777
02:05:41,101 --> 02:05:41,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

778
02:05:42,201 --> 02:05:43,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Van der Kloot?

779
02:05:45,583 --> 02:05:45,983
[SPEAKER_14]: You're muted.

780
02:05:47,263 --> 02:05:47,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

781
02:05:48,704 --> 02:05:49,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

782
02:05:49,984 --> 02:05:50,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

783
02:05:50,525 --> 02:05:52,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

784
02:05:52,666 --> 02:05:54,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Donation is accepted.

785
02:05:54,686 --> 02:05:55,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

786
02:05:55,787 --> 02:05:57,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Number five, we have meat breaks for school year 2021-2022.

787
02:05:58,008 --> 02:05:58,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

788
02:05:58,088 --> 02:05:59,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Joan Bowen, Mr. David Murphy?

789
02:06:03,153 --> 02:06:03,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor.

790
02:06:04,374 --> 02:06:17,379
[SPEAKER_18]: The update related to the MEEP tuition fee schedule for the 21-22 school year is essentially that the administration is recommending that no change be put into effect with regard to those rates.

791
02:06:17,939 --> 02:06:29,685
[SPEAKER_18]: We frankly put it on the agenda in part because we know that there has been discussion in this forum, and I believe at a subcommittee level, of potentially amending the tuition schedule

792
02:06:31,212 --> 02:06:43,414
[SPEAKER_18]: and departing from what has been the established income-based, income and family composition-based tuition structure that has been in place.

793
02:06:43,575 --> 02:06:52,736
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe since it is a schedule that's based off an EEC model that was adopted, as I understand it, in 2014.

794
02:06:53,597 --> 02:06:57,977
[SPEAKER_18]: We were unable to find any record indicating that Medford has departed from that.

795
02:06:58,057 --> 02:07:00,658
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would be my expectation that this fee schedule has been in place

796
02:07:01,229 --> 02:07:13,273
[SPEAKER_18]: since at least 2014, with the exception of this school year that we're in now, where there was no tuition and no tuition-based admission to the MEAP program.

797
02:07:14,153 --> 02:07:30,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Next year, expecting a more traditional school year and wanting to ensure that the community has this service available to them and that the MEAP program is able to operate as it's envisioned to operate with community-based students in the program.

798
02:07:32,737 --> 02:07:34,438
[SPEAKER_18]: where we'd like to keep it the same.

799
02:07:34,458 --> 02:07:46,925
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't frankly believe it does require committee action since this is a schedule that's already been in place and was effectively just not utilized due to the operational limitations of MEEP in the 21-22 school year.

800
02:07:47,565 --> 02:07:56,150
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, we wanted to make sure that the committee was apprised of that, of our intent to return to that fee structure with the understanding that during the 21-22 school year,

801
02:07:57,838 --> 02:08:19,832
[SPEAKER_18]: we anticipate revisiting that to determine whether or not it's in fact meeting the community's needs and whether or not we need to consider a potential escalation of fees in order to make the program potentially more sustainable or expand participation or whatever else the committee would like to do if that were the case.

802
02:08:19,932 --> 02:08:25,436
[SPEAKER_18]: But as of right now, it's our hope to begin the process

803
02:08:26,642 --> 02:08:33,365
[SPEAKER_18]: assessing those tuition fees similar to as we did prior to this school year.

804
02:08:33,965 --> 02:08:34,326
[SPEAKER_18]: And Ms.

805
02:08:34,366 --> 02:08:37,887
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen, were there any other points that we felt the committee needed to know about?

806
02:08:38,607 --> 02:08:39,688
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that was it.

807
02:08:42,469 --> 02:08:49,252
[SPEAKER_18]: And just with regard to the rationale, it's based on the current economic conditions and some of the uncertainty that we know families are still facing.

808
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:51,060
[SPEAKER_18]: as we come out of the pandemic.

809
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:56,742
[SPEAKER_18]: And for that reason, we thought maintaining that consistency and stability would be well-advised at this time.

810
02:08:57,942 --> 02:08:58,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

811
02:09:00,843 --> 02:09:02,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want a motion, or are you just updating us?

812
02:09:03,364 --> 02:09:04,304
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll defer to the committee.

813
02:09:04,324 --> 02:09:06,125
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, the fees have been in place.

814
02:09:06,165 --> 02:09:07,265
[SPEAKER_18]: We also couldn't find it.

815
02:09:07,785 --> 02:09:11,386
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no evidence of an annual vote reaffirming these as the fees.

816
02:09:11,426 --> 02:09:15,287
[SPEAKER_18]: So until the committee votes otherwise, I would say this is the tuition schedule.

817
02:09:15,607 --> 02:09:17,128
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think you need to take a vote, but.

818
02:09:17,388 --> 02:09:17,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree.

819
02:09:19,375 --> 02:09:19,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

820
02:09:23,078 --> 02:09:24,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Number six recommendation.

821
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:26,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Graham.

822
02:09:27,522 --> 02:09:29,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is the fee schedule posted?

823
02:09:29,123 --> 02:09:34,448
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's on the website, but it's on my computer screen at the moment.

824
02:09:34,528 --> 02:09:35,529
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can certainly share it with you.

825
02:09:35,569 --> 02:09:37,991
[SPEAKER_18]: And we can make sure that it is posted and made available.

826
02:09:38,591 --> 02:09:43,956
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could just make sure it's posted on the website in an easy to find way, that would be great.

827
02:09:43,996 --> 02:09:44,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

828
02:09:44,596 --> 02:09:47,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

829
02:09:49,523 --> 02:09:53,445
[SPEAKER_14]: number six recommendation to approve Medford as a no school choice district.

830
02:09:53,565 --> 02:09:54,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

831
02:09:55,866 --> 02:09:56,786
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor, motion to approve.

832
02:09:57,527 --> 02:09:57,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

833
02:09:59,027 --> 02:10:00,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor.

834
02:10:00,848 --> 02:10:01,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin.

835
02:10:02,109 --> 02:10:03,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we explain this to the community, please?

836
02:10:05,150 --> 02:10:06,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Briefly, yeah, that'd be great.

837
02:10:06,771 --> 02:10:11,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, to briefly explain the no school choice.

838
02:10:14,333 --> 02:10:25,823
[SPEAKER_05]: If Medford were to participate, we would have to accept students from other communities in the Commonwealth for baseline tuition, which could be well below the actual cost of the services that we may incur.

839
02:10:26,924 --> 02:10:34,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Such acceptances would be on a seat available basis and could also affect enrollments selectively throughout the district.

840
02:10:34,290 --> 02:10:39,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a result, trigger costs, which would add up to our budgetary situation.

841
02:10:40,807 --> 02:10:52,796
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past, the Medford School Committee has continuously expressed a desire to emphasize servicing Medford students to the best of our ability and to concentrate our efforts in that direction.

842
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:57,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I am asking the school committee to reject this provision.

843
02:10:59,531 --> 02:11:14,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And my rationale is that we will not be compromising our ability to work with students in our special education programs or our chapter 74 vocational programs, which are beneficial to our overall program and financial position.

844
02:11:15,355 --> 02:11:20,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for those reasons that I'm asking the school committee to take a vote to reject school choice for school year 21-22.

845
02:11:23,163 --> 02:11:27,246
[SPEAKER_05]: so that I may formally notify the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

846
02:11:28,827 --> 02:11:29,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

847
02:11:30,308 --> 02:11:32,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, I have a follow-up question.

848
02:11:33,690 --> 02:11:37,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion is on the floor by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

849
02:11:37,933 --> 02:11:39,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin would like to speak before the roll.

850
02:11:40,558 --> 02:11:41,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

851
02:11:42,279 --> 02:11:45,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for that, Superintendent.

852
02:11:45,540 --> 02:12:02,265
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to be clear, this is an offer that is made across all of the districts across the state, and it does not reflect, well, it reflects incoming school choice for students who would wish to come from Medford, to Medford from other districts.

853
02:12:02,305 --> 02:12:08,147
[SPEAKER_13]: It does not reflect outgoing students per se that would want school choice in other districts.

854
02:12:08,547 --> 02:12:09,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

855
02:12:09,447 --> 02:12:09,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

856
02:12:10,087 --> 02:12:12,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I just want to make sure that we clarify that.

857
02:12:12,508 --> 02:12:24,310
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also for the community, there is a listing on the desi website of schools that do and do not accept school choice because we all have to make this decision as districts ourselves.

858
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:25,750
[SPEAKER_13]: So just want to clarify that.

859
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:26,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

860
02:12:26,651 --> 02:12:27,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

861
02:12:27,911 --> 02:12:28,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

862
02:12:28,131 --> 02:12:28,451

[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Member Ruseau.

868
02:12:39,131 --> 02:12:40,571
[SPEAKER_13]: I got out of order there for a second.

869
02:12:41,472 --> 02:12:42,433
[SPEAKER_13]: I was reading wrong.

870
02:12:43,073 --> 02:12:44,093

871
02:12:44,714 --> 02:12:44,914

[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

880
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

881
02:13:22,168 --> 02:13:23,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, let me, no, sorry.

882
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:25,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you see it now?

883
02:13:26,011 --> 02:13:26,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

884
02:13:26,332 --> 02:13:27,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, sorry about that.

885
02:13:27,452 --> 02:13:27,933
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

886
02:13:30,915 --> 02:13:35,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the Medford School Committee, and central administration.

887
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:41,464
[SPEAKER_01]: McGlynn Elementary School reopened in the fall, and the feeling of excitement was palpable.

888
02:13:42,325 --> 02:13:49,231
[SPEAKER_01]: We have provided an active learning environment that is safe and academically challenging for both our in-person and remote learners.

889
02:13:50,282 --> 02:13:57,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vision to reach every student at every performance level while focusing on the development of the whole child is our priority.

890
02:13:57,925 --> 02:14:04,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And through the partnership with families and community resources, students are making both social, emotional and academic progress.

891
02:14:04,948 --> 02:14:08,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I am honored to share an overview of all that we have accomplished this year.

892
02:14:09,190 --> 02:14:14,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am grateful for the school committee and central administration support and guidance during this challenging year.

893
02:14:16,373 --> 02:14:17,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Our achievements have been plentiful.

894
02:14:18,339 --> 02:14:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: and could not have occurred without our talented, hardworking teachers and staff, and my assistant principal and partner, Doreen Andrews.

895
02:14:28,145 --> 02:14:37,151
[SPEAKER_01]: They have formed a collaborative professional learning community and have met each challenge with a mindset that kindled personal and professional growth.

896
02:14:38,518 --> 02:14:49,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Teachers have adjusted practice and implemented strategies to provide options for student engagement and have used scaffolding and differentiation to deliver content through multiple means.

897
02:14:49,943 --> 02:14:57,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Our special education and English learner teachers have continued to provide support services to our students, both in person and online.

898
02:14:58,947 --> 02:15:07,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Data analysis and the use of online resources such as Lexia Core 5, Prodigy, and RASKids assist in creating action plans.

899
02:15:07,962 --> 02:15:10,164
[SPEAKER_01]: for targeting teaching in math and literacy.

900
02:15:11,205 --> 02:15:31,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Our teachers have participated in many hours of professional development, district common planning time, CPT, grade level and director meetings, along with staff meetings to improve knowledge and skills in order to facilitate individual school-wide and district-wide improvements for the purpose of increasing student achievement.

901
02:15:32,204 --> 02:15:40,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Topics of racial equity, cultural proficiency, and acceptance are added through our Mustang Pride program.

902
02:15:40,499 --> 02:15:44,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And students are proud to say, kindness begins with me.

903
02:15:45,706 --> 02:15:47,027
[SPEAKER_01]: M.E., McGlynn Elementary.

904
02:15:47,967 --> 02:16:05,057
[SPEAKER_01]: As we reflected on this year's experience, our faculty and staff have attained a whole new perspective on teaching and learning, and we believe we will return stronger as a community and will continue to tap into teachers' creativity so that students will learn and engage at the highest level.

905
02:16:06,410 --> 02:16:11,633
[SPEAKER_01]: At the McGlynn Elementary School, students and staff feel a deep sense of belonging and support.

906
02:16:12,333 --> 02:16:21,277
[SPEAKER_01]: We have created a positive school culture in the hybrid in-person and remote learning environments, and continue to maintain our mission of success for every child.

907
02:16:22,498 --> 02:16:30,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Students and families received a warm, culturally proficient welcome at the start of the school year, and a sense of belonging and support continued throughout the year.

908
02:16:31,823 --> 02:16:43,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Monthly newsletters communicated our core values, focusing on developing and supporting the whole child, teaching skills that will equip them with tools necessary to success outside the classroom.

909
02:16:44,591 --> 02:16:54,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Proactive communication was conducted through various platforms, such as Google Classroom, Gmail, and Talking Points, keeping in mind the diverse needs of our families.

910
02:16:54,990 --> 02:17:04,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the first month, two all school initiatives were planned, one to honor first responders and one to express gratitude to those instrumental in opening the Method Public Schools.

911
02:17:05,716 --> 02:17:13,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspiring videos from community first responders were shared and students expressed their appreciation through thank you letters and pictures.

912
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:28,688
[SPEAKER_01]: For our Mustang Pride Day, invited Medford leaders were asked to share through Flipgrid what is meant to be a Mustang, and activities with hybrid and remote classes reinforced the importance of showing Mustang pride in actions, thoughts, and words.

913
02:17:29,788 --> 02:17:36,092
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so proud of our 439 students as they have been resilient in adapting to our new normal.

914
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:53,519
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been conscientious in the following CDC guidelines and students have been amazingly flexible in adapting to changes in routines custodians have worked with teachers and administrators to clean and sanitize the building with heroic effects, our nursing professionals.

915
02:17:54,255 --> 02:17:58,479
[SPEAKER_01]: We continue to provide a safe environment for our students to learn.

916
02:17:59,239 --> 02:18:11,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Tremendous support, patience and understanding from our families helped us navigate these challenging circumstances, and we are grateful for their continuous belief in the McGlynn Mustang community.

917
02:18:12,405 --> 02:18:17,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Our remote academy teachers continue to seek ways to promote students' connections to friends in school.

918
02:18:18,648 --> 02:18:29,933
[SPEAKER_01]: With virtual grade-level field trips, shared snack times, co-teaching opportunities, outdoor recess gatherings, and many school celebrations, remote students know that they are valued members in our school.

919
02:18:31,116 --> 02:18:39,866
[SPEAKER_01]: As the year progressed, we celebrated the joy of reading throughout March with weekly incentives to promote the journey of reading different genres and learning new words.

920
02:18:40,567 --> 02:18:45,632
[SPEAKER_01]: In April, the focus was on math and activities that connected students learning to the real world.

921
02:18:46,438 --> 02:18:52,780
[SPEAKER_01]: In May, we continue to have fun and celebrate our differences and similarities through culturally rich activities.

922
02:18:53,500 --> 02:19:02,442
[SPEAKER_01]: With the support of the PTG, a virtual book fair is happening in May and staff were gifted with a special recognition during Teacher Appreciation Week.

923
02:19:03,463 --> 02:19:14,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Our end of the year activities will continue to connect our remote and in-person communities to celebrate the many accomplishments and friendships that connected all those in our community.

924
02:19:14,706 --> 02:19:15,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

925
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:18,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ms.

926
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:19,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Carino.

927
02:19:23,413 --> 02:19:30,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Next, we have highlights of Roberts Elementary School presentation by Mr. Principal, Mr. Kirk Johnson.

928
02:19:31,077 --> 02:19:31,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Johnson.

929
02:19:32,298 --> 02:19:32,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mayor.

930
02:19:33,378 --> 02:19:35,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mayor, school committee members, and Dr. Rod Vinson.

931
02:19:35,859 --> 02:19:38,161
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have a little slide deck to share with you.

932
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:38,441
[SPEAKER_15]: So Ms.

933
02:19:38,481 --> 02:19:42,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Glusi is going to work with me this afternoon, this evening.

934
02:19:48,041 --> 02:19:48,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Ms.

935
02:19:48,464 --> 02:19:48,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Glucy.

936
02:19:50,154 --> 02:19:50,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

937
02:19:50,436 --> 02:19:51,220
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

938
02:19:55,802 --> 02:19:56,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

939
02:19:56,943 --> 02:20:00,524
[SPEAKER_15]: So for the Robbins School, our mission statement continues to be our guiding force.

940
02:20:01,384 --> 02:20:11,529
[SPEAKER_15]: We really put to the test this year as we learned through remote instruction to hybrid and then to full inclusion, full in-person instruction all in one year.

941
02:20:12,229 --> 02:20:20,773
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think if anything, our mission statement really held true that we need to make sure that we provide a student environment where students can achieve success.

942
02:20:21,874 --> 02:20:22,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

943
02:20:22,054 --> 02:20:22,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucy, next slide.

944
02:20:24,743 --> 02:20:28,808
[SPEAKER_15]: So for the Robins, we continue to keep a steady student enrollment for the North sector of our city.

945
02:20:28,828 --> 02:20:35,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Due to the pandemic, we did have a few students transfer to home instruction and or the local parochial schools.

946
02:20:36,258 --> 02:20:39,762
[SPEAKER_15]: However, we've had a number of students enroll from the charter schools.

947
02:20:40,838 --> 02:20:46,580
[SPEAKER_15]: from outside our city schools, our other local cities next to us, and also outside the state.

948
02:20:47,460 --> 02:20:51,282
[SPEAKER_15]: We did this year, the Robbins School did lose the newcomers program.

949
02:20:51,662 --> 02:20:54,483
[SPEAKER_15]: That program was moved to the Columbus School this year.

950
02:20:54,583 --> 02:20:59,865
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do miss that program, but we continue to bring in numbers on the north side of our city.

951
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:01,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Ms.

952
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:02,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucy.

953
02:21:02,992 --> 02:21:13,180
[SPEAKER_15]: So as we all know, this year was our first ever debut of the Zoom classroom or remote instruction ever in the history of education.

954
02:21:13,981 --> 02:21:16,964
[SPEAKER_15]: However, we started the school year with a wonderful meet and greet in September.

955
02:21:17,084 --> 02:21:20,807
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a wonderful fall summer day here in the city.

956
02:21:20,827 --> 02:21:26,532
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the first time that our families, the staff, and students got a chance to meet one another on campus.

957
02:21:27,092 --> 02:21:29,473
[SPEAKER_15]: since our exit of March 12, 2020.

958
02:21:30,034 --> 02:21:36,177
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a great day and it was really, really well received by all of our families at the Robb School.

959
02:21:37,377 --> 02:21:37,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Ms.

960
02:21:37,878 --> 02:21:38,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Goosey.

961
02:21:39,310 --> 02:21:45,034
[SPEAKER_15]: With that, with the remote instruction, teachers did learn to really, as Ms.

962
02:21:45,074 --> 02:21:48,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Guarino mentioned, the challenges for instruction.

963
02:21:48,436 --> 02:22:04,106
[SPEAKER_15]: They learned to use desktop cameras for the first time, document cameras, tripods, all as new tools for instruction to assure that our students would continue that strong instructional level and also learning from our classroom teachers.

964
02:22:04,146 --> 02:22:07,068
[SPEAKER_15]: But they really rose to the occasion during that time.

965
02:22:07,828 --> 02:22:09,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we moved to our hybrid instruction.

966
02:22:09,669 --> 02:22:15,273
[SPEAKER_15]: We had from grade kindergarten to pre-K to grade five in that year.

967
02:22:15,993 --> 02:22:25,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, teachers had to adapt and also our students with two days of strong in-person instruction to back up that three-day asynchronous instruction.

968
02:22:25,159 --> 02:22:35,025
[SPEAKER_15]: However, once again, our teachers rose the occasion, working very hard, providing packets to go home with the students to follow up with that two-day instruction.

969
02:22:35,846 --> 02:22:36,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we moved from that

970
02:22:37,787 --> 02:22:46,009
[SPEAKER_15]: level to live instruction, where teachers were teaching both cohorts, both cohorts B and C, during the week through live instruction.

971
02:22:46,029 --> 02:22:51,210
[SPEAKER_15]: So our teachers once again, and students once again, adapted to a new level of instruction.

972
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:52,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Next Ms.

973
02:22:52,930 --> 02:22:53,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Galussi.

974
02:22:54,611 --> 02:23:05,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we came back to in-person instruction as of April 5th, all pre-K to 5, and we were all very happy to leave our Zoom classroom instruction and get to in-person

975
02:23:07,087 --> 02:23:10,590
[SPEAKER_15]: and really have teachers be with our students and students with their peers.

976
02:23:11,611 --> 02:23:13,052
[SPEAKER_15]: It brought some challenges as well.

977
02:23:13,553 --> 02:23:26,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of them were logistical, making sure that for lunchtime, students were not sitting near each other with six foot distancing, with the three foot classroom locations, but we were able to make the adaption and really do well.

978
02:23:26,964 --> 02:23:34,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Approximately 25 students returned in our school from remote academy to in-person instruction on April 5th.

979
02:23:37,341 --> 02:23:37,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Ms.

980
02:23:37,921 --> 02:23:38,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucey.

981
02:23:38,662 --> 02:23:43,465
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that said, with the logistics brings a snack time outdoors for students.

982
02:23:44,005 --> 02:23:52,269
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you are passing by the Robert school, you might see students having snack on the playground, by the kindergarten area, in front of our school.

983
02:23:52,670 --> 02:24:03,416
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've learned to use our limited campus space at the Robert school effectively so that we can all be together in person, keeping those safety measures for COVID-19.

984
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:07,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Next, Miss Lucy.

985
02:24:08,731 --> 02:24:16,314
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, in-person instruction brought us back to music, not being remote and students being able to have instruction with Mr. Connor.

986
02:24:16,774 --> 02:24:19,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is a grade five class drumming with Mr. Connor.

987
02:24:20,590 --> 02:24:26,353
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was very excited back in school, having his students use the hands-on instruments that he provides.

988
02:24:26,413 --> 02:24:29,894
[SPEAKER_15]: And he actually builds many of them on his own to provide that instruction.

989
02:24:29,914 --> 02:24:34,496
[SPEAKER_15]: So here's grade five, back in the saddle with their drumming instruction, Mr. Connor.

990
02:24:35,577 --> 02:24:36,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Ms.

991
02:24:36,077 --> 02:24:36,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Cussey.

992
02:24:37,798 --> 02:24:41,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, in-person instruction, once again, with Mr. Ferranti.

993
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:52,427
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a kindergarten class finally being back in the gymnasium, having our instruction with the teacher right in person versus looking through a Zoom camera.

994
02:24:52,467 --> 02:24:57,771
[SPEAKER_15]: So quite excited to see that happen back on April 5th and moving forward.

995
02:24:59,813 --> 02:25:00,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide.

996
02:25:01,614 --> 02:25:02,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's our class.

997
02:25:03,055 --> 02:25:04,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, with Ms.

998
02:25:04,096 --> 02:25:04,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Shanley.

999
02:25:05,096 --> 02:25:07,198
[SPEAKER_15]: And here, the students are making a paint and tape.

1000
02:25:07,238 --> 02:25:10,040
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost like a mosaic or a stained glass window project.

1001
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:16,263
[SPEAKER_15]: The PTO provided every student with this project, both in-person and remote.

1002
02:25:17,024 --> 02:25:25,109
[SPEAKER_15]: And here, the students are working on their mosaic that, again, provided by the PTO, all the materials by the PTO.

1003
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:27,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Ms.

1004
02:25:27,571 --> 02:25:27,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucy.

1005
02:25:28,853 --> 02:25:31,974
[SPEAKER_15]: In order to get remote instruction, so that continues with our remote academy.

1006
02:25:32,114 --> 02:25:39,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Here, the classroom teachers will come into the building every so often, a few weeks in between, providing all the materials to go home for the remote students.

1007
02:25:40,518 --> 02:25:47,841
[SPEAKER_15]: The packets will include science materials, there are cups in there, there's soil, there may be seeds, math mats go home.

1008
02:25:48,461 --> 02:25:56,425
[SPEAKER_15]: All the hands-on materials are still being provided to our students by the teachers at home for their science instruction in math and literacy.

1009
02:25:58,626 --> 02:25:59,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide.

1010
02:26:00,568 --> 02:26:09,674
[SPEAKER_15]: So here you see that at the Roberts School, eight students participated in Dr. Edouard-Vincent's Poetry Challenge back in the earlier part of our school year, a year.

1011
02:26:10,415 --> 02:26:15,999
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did have a visitor from WBC-TV, the journalist, Lisa Hughes, visited our school.

1012
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:20,923
[SPEAKER_15]: She spoke with Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and one of our students read his poem that day.

1013
02:26:20,943 --> 02:26:27,728
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we have time at school, I'd like to share the video just kind of quick to see that we were pretty busy that day here at the Roberts School.

1014
02:26:29,869 --> 02:26:44,772
[SPEAKER_09]: series unifying america we often hear words matter and in medford right now some of the words that matter most are coming from students kindergartners through high school seniors sharing their vision for the future in the district's first unity poetry contest

1015
02:26:45,982 --> 02:26:49,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want to inherit a world that does not stay united.

1016
02:26:50,004 --> 02:26:54,647
[SPEAKER_09]: But through poetry, nine-year-old Joe Hogan can express what he does want.

1017
02:26:55,027 --> 02:26:56,307
[SPEAKER_03]: The world is like blocks.

1018
02:26:56,588 --> 02:26:59,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time you unite them, they fall down again.

1019
02:26:59,589 --> 02:27:02,050
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can unite, the world will be like Legos.

1020
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:03,151
[SPEAKER_03]: They stay together.

1021
02:27:03,931 --> 02:27:06,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would want to inherit that world because it is united.

1022
02:27:07,533 --> 02:27:10,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we a Lego or building block?

1023
02:27:10,357 --> 02:27:11,298
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot be both.

1024
02:27:11,678 --> 02:27:12,960
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the recurring theme.

1025
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,222
[SPEAKER_09]: How can we come together?

1026
02:27:14,242 --> 02:27:15,904
[SPEAKER_09]: How can we be unified?

1027
02:27:16,304 --> 02:27:23,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford School Superintendent Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent announced the poetry contest the day after President Biden's inauguration.

1028
02:27:23,974 --> 02:27:24,975
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something that's

1029
02:27:25,776 --> 02:27:27,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, healing about writing a poem.

1030
02:27:27,937 --> 02:27:29,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And art is beautiful.

1031
02:27:30,138 --> 02:27:36,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And students who are choosing to be poet artists, they're expressing themselves through the written word.

1032
02:27:36,721 --> 02:27:41,343
[SPEAKER_03]: If we reconcile our differences with many voices and choices,

1033
02:27:42,095 --> 02:27:45,116
[SPEAKER_09]: We can accomplish preferences for peace.

1034
02:27:45,136 --> 02:27:50,299
[SPEAKER_09]: 10-year-old Ibrahim Ahmad submitted three poems fully embracing the theme.

1035
02:27:50,759 --> 02:27:53,180
[SPEAKER_09]: You can always accomplish unity.

1036
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,941
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need a group of willing people.

1037
02:27:55,961 --> 02:27:58,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Inaugural poet Amanda Gorman planted the seed.

1038
02:27:59,283 --> 02:28:03,485
[SPEAKER_09]: There is always light if only we're brave enough to see it.

1039
02:28:03,886 --> 02:28:06,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Inspiring Medford students in a special way.

1040
02:28:07,167 --> 02:28:10,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Gorman spoke at Medford Middle School in 2019.

1041
02:28:10,769 --> 02:28:15,652
[SPEAKER_09]: A powerful voice for inclusion, she's found a fan in 11-year-old Violet Bell.

1042
02:28:15,812 --> 02:28:16,873
[SPEAKER_09]: What does it mean for you?

1043
02:28:17,513 --> 02:28:24,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Not separating people into different categories and groups and just like we're all humans.

1044
02:28:25,808 --> 02:28:28,150
[SPEAKER_16]: So we should treat each other like that.

1045
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:30,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Violet's poem ends like this.

1046
02:28:30,992 --> 02:28:34,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Their hands join their voices, swearing, singing as a community.

1047
02:28:34,755 --> 02:28:37,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Black, white, gay, bi, singing in unity.

1048
02:28:37,577 --> 02:28:43,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that someday you will experience the world that you want to inherit?

1049
02:28:43,461 --> 02:28:44,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

1050
02:28:45,722 --> 02:28:49,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if I don't, I'll definitely try and do that for my kids.

1051
02:28:49,945 --> 02:28:55,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Based on the entries she's received so far, Dr. Edouard-Vincent doesn't think it's that far off.

1052
02:28:55,909 --> 02:29:03,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been filling my bucket, reading these poems and just giving me such encouragement and such hope.

1053
02:29:03,895 --> 02:29:06,957
[SPEAKER_05]: They realize what was happening before wasn't working.

1054
02:29:07,397 --> 02:29:09,698
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to make the world a better place.

1055
02:29:10,459 --> 02:29:14,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that this is the generation that is going to be able to do that.

1056
02:29:16,005 --> 02:29:19,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the deadline for entries in the Mustang Unity Poetry Contest is next Monday.

1057
02:29:20,073 --> 02:29:28,208
[SPEAKER_09]: The two winners, one hybrid learner, one remote learner from each age group, will present their poems, the winning poems, at a school committee meeting next.

1058
02:29:31,068 --> 02:29:31,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Ms.

1059
02:29:31,408 --> 02:29:31,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Galussi.

1060
02:29:32,289 --> 02:29:35,270
[SPEAKER_15]: So as you can see that the poetry continues in our schools.

1061
02:29:35,790 --> 02:29:44,113
[SPEAKER_15]: And our friend Joseph, I asked the students the other day in the lunchroom setting, anything special happening that you're going to do for moms on Mother's Day?

1062
02:29:44,193 --> 02:29:48,734
[SPEAKER_15]: And his answer was, he was going to write his mother a new haku poem for Mother's Day.

1063
02:29:48,794 --> 02:29:53,816
[SPEAKER_15]: So Joseph continues to bring his poetry love every day into the school year.

1064
02:29:54,737 --> 02:29:54,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1065
02:29:54,897 --> 02:29:55,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Galussi, next slide, please.

1066
02:29:57,636 --> 02:30:14,809
[SPEAKER_15]: As Dr. Edouard-Vincent mentioned, we had Super Robertson visit our school on April 28th, and his message was to congratulate all the students for their perseverance of the school year, from moving from our remote setting to our hybrid, back to smaller remote, then back to an in-person five days.

1067
02:30:15,229 --> 02:30:22,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if anything, perseverance is one of our words that is a key vocab word for the schools and our students this year.

1068
02:30:24,811 --> 02:30:34,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, interesting enough, we didn't know that, but we selected the day because we thought it'd be good to do it right after the vacation week somewhat, but it consequently was the National Superheroes Day that day, so I didn't know that.

1069
02:30:36,119 --> 02:30:45,587
[SPEAKER_15]: And another little sidebar, we worked very well with the vocational technical school, Mr. Chad Fallon, and one of our high school seniors in the graphic arts department.

1070
02:30:47,541 --> 02:30:49,122
[SPEAKER_15]: design our superheroes card.

1071
02:30:49,162 --> 02:30:55,227
[SPEAKER_15]: So quite pleased to invite the students to work with us at the voc school vocational CTE.

1072
02:30:56,268 --> 02:30:57,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide Miss Lucy.

1073
02:30:58,630 --> 02:31:06,477
[SPEAKER_15]: PTO has been very active the school year, even though the pandemic has kept them somewhat working from home or working in the evenings when kids aren't in the building.

1074
02:31:07,002 --> 02:31:12,344
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, once again, they have always proven to be such support as a Robbins School.

1075
02:31:12,404 --> 02:31:14,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Teacher Appreciation Lunch was held last week.

1076
02:31:14,725 --> 02:31:22,189
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a luncheon provided to the teachers, all staff, and all teachers received a wonderful gift card from the PTO.

1077
02:31:23,869 --> 02:31:28,271
[SPEAKER_15]: This year, they have provided every youngster from pre-k to grade five with Scholastic magazines.

1078
02:31:28,751 --> 02:31:36,795
[SPEAKER_15]: So every youngster this year has every child, every classroom has a subscription for the Scholastic News magazine, courtesy of the PTO.

1079
02:31:37,787 --> 02:31:51,137
[SPEAKER_15]: And they also provided each classroom and staff with a sanitation kit, which included a hand sanitizer, paper towels, tissues, and disinfectant wipes for every classroom and every teacher that has a classroom setting.

1080
02:31:51,838 --> 02:31:53,860
[SPEAKER_15]: So we thank you, the Robert's School PTO.

1081
02:31:54,020 --> 02:32:01,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, the superhero pencils was part of their contribution to our superhero school spirit day.

1082
02:32:02,606 --> 02:32:03,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Lucy.

1083
02:32:05,137 --> 02:32:22,242
[SPEAKER_15]: For the Robbins School, so last year, it was kind of interesting because of the COVID, but the Robbins School did receive the 2020 Central Region Exemplary Program Award, winner for the MassDOT Safe Routes to School Program, and we received the School Goal Level Partner Award and plaque in 2020.

1084
02:32:23,503 --> 02:32:24,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Special thanks to Ms.

1085
02:32:24,463 --> 02:32:26,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Reinhold, two of our parents, and Ms.

1086
02:32:26,864 --> 02:32:31,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Sarah McGivern in their committee and working with our Walking Wednesdays each month.

1087
02:32:32,163 --> 02:32:46,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, the city of Medford and the Roberts energy SRTS infrastructure project was approved with the project plan date of 2025 and I think the mayor can probably update somehow but that's a plan for the city to

1088
02:32:48,055 --> 02:32:50,457
[SPEAKER_15]: remodel and revise the Fellsway.

1089
02:32:51,098 --> 02:32:53,139
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a lot safer for walking.

1090
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:55,061
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's been some discussion.

1091
02:32:55,081 --> 02:33:00,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Our last meeting was held, I believe last December, virtually via Zoom.

1092
02:33:01,847 --> 02:33:12,456
[SPEAKER_15]: We've tried to get together some walking Wednesdays or walking days to go and do it in person, but because of COVID, it's kept us to our offices and done mostly for the virtual meetings.

1093
02:33:13,957 --> 02:33:14,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Next slide, Ms.

1094
02:33:14,458 --> 02:33:14,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Glusi.

1095
02:33:16,354 --> 02:33:25,938
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a picture of our goal level partner award that sits in our office that gives the award to our students and our parents for their walking Wednesday.

1096
02:33:27,338 --> 02:33:27,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Next.

1097
02:33:28,859 --> 02:33:36,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to thank you for all of our support this year, our parents and grandparents are out of school for numerous donations, the desktop cameras that we talked about earlier,

1098
02:33:37,002 --> 02:33:42,165
[SPEAKER_15]: the document cameras, the tripods, all to provide the remote instruction for teachers tools.

1099
02:33:43,306 --> 02:33:47,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Medical masks, we've had parents donate medical masks to the school, to the school nurse's office.

1100
02:33:48,189 --> 02:33:53,092
[SPEAKER_15]: And another family made a payment to student lunches, lunch accounts that were overdue.

1101
02:33:53,752 --> 02:34:03,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Although we have free lunch this school year, there was still a number of overdue bills into our lunch program that was given right to the lunch program for overdue bills.

1102
02:34:04,624 --> 02:34:12,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, for kids to have some of those outdoor settings for a snack and the like, a family donated a set of beach towels.

1103
02:34:12,646 --> 02:34:18,308
[SPEAKER_15]: So when the kids go outside, they can sit on a beach towel if they so select to take one or if they don't have their own for meal planning.

1104
02:34:18,708 --> 02:34:23,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It really helps in our meal planning settings this year because of the COVID-19 restructuring.

1105
02:34:24,409 --> 02:34:26,490
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, thank you to the CCSR students at MHS.

1106
02:34:27,935 --> 02:34:39,419
[SPEAKER_15]: They provided some student supplies back in the earlier part of our school year, child-sized masks, hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, all collected through their supplies donation drives that they've done for the city.

1107
02:34:41,159 --> 02:34:41,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ms.

1108
02:34:41,459 --> 02:34:42,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucy, last slide.

1109
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:50,402
[SPEAKER_15]: So just last week, I was in the lunch setting and I asked the fourth grade class if they could sort of describe, Ms.

1110
02:34:50,442 --> 02:34:52,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucy, I'm sorry, the next slide, I apologize.

1111
02:34:54,182 --> 02:34:55,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

1112
02:34:55,623 --> 02:35:01,224
[SPEAKER_15]: So the lunch setting last week, I asked the fourth grade classes, how could they describe the school year?

1113
02:35:01,264 --> 02:35:04,705
[SPEAKER_15]: So there were words selected, like it was different, it was confusing.

1114
02:35:05,446 --> 02:35:09,107
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the one that we can all agree upon this year is that flexibility was key.

1115
02:35:09,247 --> 02:35:12,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the fourth grade's description of the school year.

1116
02:35:12,708 --> 02:35:16,569
[SPEAKER_15]: And the young lady said, I think flexibility is the key, or is the key word.

1117
02:35:16,989 --> 02:35:21,931
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think if anything, this has been one year of flexibility from all

1118
02:35:22,468 --> 02:35:29,129
[SPEAKER_15]: accounts from our nursing staff, our teaching staff, our parents, grandparents have been teachers and aunts and uncles have been teachers this year.

1119
02:35:29,509 --> 02:35:38,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think everyone deserves a round of applause and thank you for the opportunity this evening to share some of the highlights of Robert's School for the 2021 school year.

1120
02:35:38,671 --> 02:35:39,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1121
02:35:43,452 --> 02:35:44,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

1122
02:35:48,373 --> 02:35:49,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any old business?

1123
02:35:56,492 --> 02:35:57,312
[SPEAKER_06]: No business.

1124
02:35:58,532 --> 02:35:59,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Communications.

1125
02:36:03,594 --> 02:36:07,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 11, new business, ad hoc report request.

1126
02:36:08,635 --> 02:36:14,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Fossil fuel utilization at the new school's target date, June 7th, 2021.

1127
02:36:14,416 --> 02:36:18,197
[SPEAKER_14]: The report is attempting, yes.

1128
02:36:19,317 --> 02:36:20,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Rizzo.

1129
02:36:21,337 --> 02:36:24,758
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be happy to skip the reading of that.

1130
02:36:26,077 --> 02:36:29,099
[SPEAKER_20]: if that's acceptable, unless you'd like to.

1131
02:36:34,623 --> 02:36:38,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Three paragraphs, so might as well read it so everybody can understand it.

1132
02:36:38,626 --> 02:36:38,966
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1133
02:36:44,510 --> 02:36:54,778
[SPEAKER_14]: The report is attempting to answer what, number one, what fossil fuel consumption at each of the new schools is in a typical year to the age of all systems that rely on fossil fuels.

1134
02:36:55,403 --> 02:36:57,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Three, what is the fuel used?

1135
02:36:57,264 --> 02:37:07,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Four, if a ballpark estimate can be provided to replace the fossil fuel systems with a pure electric option, what would the cost of replacement be?

1136
02:37:07,452 --> 02:37:11,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And similarly, if possible, what would the impact be on the energy cost compared?

1137
02:37:12,056 --> 02:37:15,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Current cost, new cost, a ballpark is all that is requested.

1138
02:37:16,199 --> 02:37:18,641
[SPEAKER_14]: And if that cannot be determined,

1139
02:37:19,493 --> 02:37:24,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Without an RFP or significant research, then this is not a required element of this report.

1140
02:37:24,654 --> 02:37:34,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Background as the federal and state governments have moved on fossil fuel reduction in Medford has landed on the top 10 communities in Massachusetts on our energy reduction.

1141
02:37:35,537 --> 02:37:39,718
[SPEAKER_14]: It is both reasonable and appropriate for us to consider the fossil fuel consumptions in our schools.

1142
02:37:40,058 --> 02:37:46,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Exclusive of the high school is on purpose here due to the extent of the work that would be required to include in this report.

1143
02:37:46,926 --> 02:37:48,126
[SPEAKER_14]: data elements expected.

1144
02:37:48,166 --> 02:37:49,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, building name.

1145
02:37:49,546 --> 02:37:50,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Two, building system.

1146
02:37:50,947 --> 02:37:52,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Three, age of each system.

1147
02:37:52,467 --> 02:37:54,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Four, average annual cost.

1148
02:37:55,028 --> 02:38:00,709
[SPEAKER_14]: By building, if possible, for all new schools, if per building is not possible.

1149
02:38:00,929 --> 02:38:07,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Five, amount of fuel used by each building and system for each building or for all schools, whichever level of detail is available.

1150
02:38:08,290 --> 02:38:12,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Six, ballpark costs to replace each system with an electric version.

1151
02:38:12,691 --> 02:38:13,651
[SPEAKER_14]: This should not include

1152
02:38:14,158 --> 02:38:20,161
[SPEAKER_14]: any MSBA or other grants, just a pure cost, including the system installation, again, if possible.

1153
02:38:22,483 --> 02:38:22,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there more?

1154
02:38:23,043 --> 02:38:24,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my goodness, I thought it was, that's all I thought it was.

1155
02:38:24,664 --> 02:38:32,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, number two, ad hoc report request impact on pandemic on identification of students requiring an IEP.

1156
02:38:33,188 --> 02:38:36,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, Member Ruseau, why don't you discuss number one?

1157
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:38,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mayor.

1158
02:38:38,651 --> 02:38:38,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1159
02:38:40,981 --> 02:38:45,084
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also realized the target date of June 7th is, I don't know why I put that date.

1160
02:38:45,164 --> 02:38:46,985
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's probably an unreasonable date.

1161
02:38:47,866 --> 02:38:55,652
[SPEAKER_20]: So if the superintendent, if this does pass, I think a date that is more appropriate should be replaced in there.

1162
02:38:56,512 --> 02:39:09,222
[SPEAKER_20]: But as the federal government has made commitments to dramatically reducing carbon output, looking at one of the biggest issues for the Northeast is

1163
02:39:10,005 --> 02:39:10,585
[SPEAKER_20]: home heating.

1164
02:39:11,546 --> 02:39:17,229
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we cannot just look at the high school as a whole is an entirely different problem.

1165
02:39:17,790 --> 02:39:27,575
[SPEAKER_20]: But our quote new schools should actually be technically simpler to get off of fossil fuels because of the newer age of them.

1166
02:39:28,516 --> 02:39:33,019
[SPEAKER_20]: So that that's what this report is for to try and find out where are we so we could

1167
02:39:34,294 --> 02:39:42,157
[SPEAKER_20]: move us along this path of no longer relying on fossil fuels, because I was thrilled to see the city listed in the top 10 in the state.

1168
02:39:42,277 --> 02:39:43,338
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

1169
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:48,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

1170
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:50,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Van der Kloot, then Member Kreatz.

1171
02:39:51,361 --> 02:39:53,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just had a question.

1172
02:39:53,202 --> 02:40:03,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So Paul, I thought if you're asking for a report like this, we're sending it to the superintendent, and she will tell us whether

1173
02:40:04,272 --> 02:40:07,215
[SPEAKER_08]: what the timeline and whether it's doable should be, right?

1174
02:40:07,415 --> 02:40:09,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that according to our policy?

1175
02:40:09,056 --> 02:40:14,000
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually used the policy and the form to submit this.

1176
02:40:15,461 --> 02:40:23,628
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, I mean, the policy is baked into the actual form and I just clicked on it and followed through.

1177
02:40:25,429 --> 02:40:26,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me just look at it real quick.

1178
02:40:27,651 --> 02:40:32,415
[SPEAKER_08]: But you put a date in and I thought that the idea was to ask the superintendent

1179
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:35,440
[SPEAKER_08]: for a reasonable timeline?

1180
02:40:36,741 --> 02:40:37,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

1181
02:40:38,121 --> 02:40:38,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1182
02:40:38,681 --> 02:40:41,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, the date was to when it was to be on the agenda.

1183
02:40:42,982 --> 02:40:47,143
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that must be why there's a date, the target date of June 7th, I don't know.

1184
02:40:48,684 --> 02:40:53,705
[SPEAKER_20]: But, oh no, the form does ask for when is the target date, when would I like it?

1185
02:40:54,205 --> 02:40:57,126
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know why I put June 7th, because that's obviously impossible.

1186
02:40:59,395 --> 02:41:00,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly support the motion.

1187
02:41:00,897 --> 02:41:10,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think in keeping what we're doing is we're asking the two superintendents to say when is a reasonable time for us to get this report back.

1188
02:41:14,933 --> 02:41:26,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll make a motion that we send it to the superintendent's office so that we can find out when a reasonable time to get the report back is.

1189
02:41:26,936 --> 02:41:32,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's worthwhile doing for every, you know, to find out the information.

1190
02:41:32,817 --> 02:41:36,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know.

1191
02:41:37,638 --> 02:41:37,898
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor?

1192
02:41:38,878 --> 02:41:40,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau and then Member Kreatz.

1193
02:41:41,379 --> 02:41:41,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1194
02:41:41,699 --> 02:41:43,579
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking at the actual policy and

1195
02:41:44,178 --> 02:41:52,722
[SPEAKER_20]: It says that we have to approve that we even would want the report before we ask the superintendent to determine that.

1196
02:41:52,863 --> 02:41:59,586
[SPEAKER_20]: As a majority, we don't even want the report, asking the superintendent to figure out how much work it is, is put in the cart before the horse kind of thing.

1197
02:42:02,688 --> 02:42:12,913
[SPEAKER_14]: So the motion is- So you'd like to amend the motion as it relates to the date, member Van der Kloot, you wanna eliminate the date and just put it in there if this is approved,

1198
02:42:13,976 --> 02:42:19,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Could the superintendent report back to us by June 7th on when this could be provided to the school committee?

1199
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:21,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, absolutely.

1200
02:42:22,461 --> 02:42:22,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Kreatz?

1201
02:42:24,182 --> 02:42:24,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1202
02:42:25,483 --> 02:42:26,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have questions.

1203
02:42:28,347 --> 02:42:30,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm not sure, like, I understand this resolution.

1204
02:42:31,348 --> 02:42:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an expert in fossil fuels.

1205
02:42:34,249 --> 02:42:44,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I did find out that we use natural gas to heat our buildings.

1206
02:42:44,732 --> 02:42:48,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think it would take the administration some time.

1207
02:42:48,133 --> 02:42:49,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to, sorry.

1208
02:42:49,513 --> 02:43:03,439
[SPEAKER_04]: some time to get a request like this, especially people what where we are with what we're doing with the the budget and the closeout of the end of the school year.

1209
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:05,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, let me just

1210
02:43:08,927 --> 02:43:26,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So also what I know just from being a homeowner and I have electric, not for my heating system, but I know that electric is one of the most expensive heating methods in that there is a service fee increase that extends from January to May 1st.

1211
02:43:27,283 --> 02:43:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So I reached out to some city councilors

1212
02:43:30,105 --> 02:43:38,849
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just about like, you know, fossil fuels versus electric and, you know, electric is one of the most expensive heating, you know, mechanism.

1213
02:43:38,909 --> 02:43:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way I was reading this resolution is that you want to go to an all electric heating component.

1214
02:43:45,952 --> 02:43:48,654
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like I really don't understand the resolution.

1215
02:43:48,674 --> 02:43:50,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor?

1216
02:43:52,755 --> 02:43:55,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

1217
02:43:55,817 --> 02:43:56,037
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean,

1218
02:43:57,314 --> 02:44:00,676
[SPEAKER_20]: none of us should be using any fossil fuels within 25 years.

1219
02:44:01,776 --> 02:44:06,719
[SPEAKER_20]: And it may be cheaper, but there is absolutely no way we're gonna meet our climate goals.

1220
02:44:07,879 --> 02:44:11,381
[SPEAKER_20]: It is not going to happen if we are only concerned about the price.

1221
02:44:12,001 --> 02:44:24,287
[SPEAKER_20]: So this report is to find out what is the different, what's it gonna cost to convert so that when the federal government presumably comes out with legislation that's actually in Congress now and says,

1222
02:44:24,865 --> 02:44:28,626
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, we have a trillion dollars to start converting public buildings.

1223
02:44:30,246 --> 02:44:33,427
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't then begin the process of finding out, well, what does it cost?

1224
02:44:34,547 --> 02:44:38,268
[SPEAKER_20]: So that we're not waiting two years after the money becomes available.

1225
02:44:38,708 --> 02:44:47,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead, we've figured it out that it's gonna cost a million dollars to convert all of our heating systems in the new schools to an electric option.

1226
02:44:48,932 --> 02:44:53,894
[SPEAKER_20]: and that it's the impact on the budget is gonna be a doubling of the cost of utilities.

1227
02:44:54,334 --> 02:44:56,595
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I don't know that I'm just making up numbers.

1228
02:44:57,415 --> 02:45:03,337
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it would be nice if we were prepared, because this is literally a major piece of legislation in Congress right now.

1229
02:45:04,017 --> 02:45:13,200
[SPEAKER_20]: And the outcome of that is going to be money for, I don't know if it's gonna be individual homeowners or it's gonna be public buildings,

1230
02:45:15,008 --> 02:45:21,837
[SPEAKER_20]: But getting us off of fossil fuels is the only way there's going to be a planet that we can live on.

1231
02:45:22,117 --> 02:45:22,899
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the goal.

1232
02:45:23,599 --> 02:45:27,024
[SPEAKER_20]: This is not a resolution to take us off of fossil fuels.

1233
02:45:27,725 --> 02:45:31,450
[SPEAKER_20]: It is to find out what's it going to cost to do it.

1234
02:45:32,486 --> 02:45:36,788
[SPEAKER_20]: what's the impact on our regular operating budget from an electricity perspective.

1235
02:45:37,328 --> 02:45:42,210
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can be prepared because we're in the top 10 right now in Massachusetts.

1236
02:45:42,551 --> 02:45:47,973
[SPEAKER_20]: We will not be in the top 10 forever if we are operating everything on fossil fuels like we do now.

1237
02:45:51,205 --> 02:45:54,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Kreatz, you finished or do you still have more questions?

1238
02:45:54,906 --> 02:46:02,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so I guess tonight we're supposed to vote on the resolution and then we're gonna find out when it's feasible.

1239
02:46:02,968 --> 02:46:05,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the other way around.

1240
02:46:05,348 --> 02:46:15,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the superintendent would determine what's feasible at this time and what the timeframe would be, or if it's not even feasible right now where we are.

1241
02:46:17,791 --> 02:46:19,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just- Point of clarification.

1242
02:46:20,770 --> 02:46:24,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of clarification member Van der Kloot.

1243
02:46:24,532 --> 02:46:31,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're talking about whether the timeline on the report is feasible.

1244
02:46:32,277 --> 02:46:37,160
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not making a bigger discussion about the question.

1245
02:46:37,180 --> 02:46:43,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, are we interested in having the report really is the question I think is.

1246
02:46:43,583 --> 02:46:46,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what we're talking about right now is are we interested in having a report?

1247
02:46:47,005 --> 02:46:49,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've said, yes, I'm interested in having a report.

1248
02:46:50,067 --> 02:47:01,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I want it to go to the superintendent, and I want her office to determine when is a reasonable time to get this information to us.

1249
02:47:04,711 --> 02:47:04,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1250
02:47:05,152 --> 02:47:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the clarification.

1251
02:47:09,253 --> 02:47:14,334
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, so there's a motion on the floor by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member Graham.

1252
02:47:15,155 --> 02:47:15,895
[SPEAKER_14]: So the motion.

1253
02:47:17,082 --> 02:47:23,386
[SPEAKER_14]: by member Rousseau as amended by member Van der Kloot to take out that we would get this report by June 7th, 2021.

1254
02:47:24,107 --> 02:47:34,334
[SPEAKER_14]: And instead that we will, if this passes, Madam Superintendent will give us a date on when she believes this is feasible, probably sometime in the fall to receive the report.

1255
02:47:35,355 --> 02:47:36,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, roll call, please.

1256
02:47:37,796 --> 02:47:38,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

1257
02:47:38,937 --> 02:47:39,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1258
02:47:40,818 --> 02:47:41,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Kreatz.

1259
02:47:42,119 --> 02:47:42,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1260
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:44,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1261
02:47:44,561 --> 02:47:44,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1262
02:47:44,841 --> 02:47:45,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Mustone.

1263
02:47:45,722 --> 02:47:45,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1264
02:47:47,173 --> 02:47:47,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

1265
02:47:49,014 --> 02:47:49,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1266
02:47:50,295 --> 02:47:51,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Van der Kloot?

1267
02:47:51,675 --> 02:47:52,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1268
02:47:52,796 --> 02:47:53,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Longo-Khan?

1269
02:47:54,917 --> 02:47:55,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, as amended.

1270
02:47:56,157 --> 02:47:57,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1271
02:47:57,838 --> 02:47:59,339
[SPEAKER_14]: The paper passes as amended.

1272
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:03,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two, ad hoc report request.

1273
02:48:03,421 --> 02:48:07,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Impact of pandemic on identification of students requiring an IEP.

1274
02:48:08,624 --> 02:48:10,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Target date, May 24th, 2021.

1275
02:48:11,545 --> 02:48:15,247
[SPEAKER_14]: The report is attempting to answer the number of students that were newly given an IEP

1276
02:48:16,123 --> 02:48:24,473
[SPEAKER_14]: in each of the previous four years, including 2020, 2021, through the date when the data is pulled to the report.

1277
02:48:25,595 --> 02:48:27,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there impacts on our budget?

1278
02:48:27,377 --> 02:48:32,063
[SPEAKER_14]: We anticipate as a result of the difference in students being identified during the pandemic.

1279
02:48:33,242 --> 02:48:38,486
[SPEAKER_14]: background, early detection of student needs is financially reasonable and what is best for students.

1280
02:48:38,987 --> 02:48:53,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Understanding the size of this problem and strategizing about how to compensate for differences resulting from the pandemic to ensure students with special and educational needs are identified as quickly as possible and whatever additional supporting resources are made available and prioritized.

1281
02:48:53,699 --> 02:48:54,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau.

1282
02:48:56,914 --> 02:48:58,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, sorry, I have two teenagers fighting.

1283
02:49:00,357 --> 02:49:08,202
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so the reason for this report is I'm concerned about delays in identifications of students that may need IEPs.

1284
02:49:09,623 --> 02:49:12,966
[SPEAKER_20]: There are so many reasons for which that's a problem.

1285
02:49:13,006 --> 02:49:14,867
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously for the students, that's a problem.

1286
02:49:15,387 --> 02:49:19,390
[SPEAKER_20]: For the teaching staff who will have more students who are not on IEPs that should be.

1287
02:49:20,511 --> 02:49:25,615
[SPEAKER_20]: And obviously the later we wait, the longer we wait to detect and

1288
02:49:26,195 --> 02:49:30,516
[SPEAKER_20]: begin services for a student, the more they cost.

1289
02:49:32,036 --> 02:49:37,418
[SPEAKER_20]: And for some services, the less likelihood that they will be as successful as they could be.

1290
02:49:38,418 --> 02:49:46,840
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, dyslexia is definitely better if we treat it when they're little rather than taking a teenager who has not had services.

1291
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:52,721
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm very concerned that my experience is that teachers are often the primary

1292
02:49:55,917 --> 02:50:00,798
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the sensors that detect that a student may in fact need to be evaluated.

1293
02:50:01,458 --> 02:50:15,801
[SPEAKER_20]: And when so many students have not been in front of teachers, some of them are not at all, but many were delayed this year because of the pandemic that, do we have a serious problem?

1294
02:50:16,101 --> 02:50:19,261
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd like to know what that looks like.

1295
02:50:19,281 --> 02:50:20,641
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why I asked for this report.

1296
02:50:22,342 --> 02:50:23,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, member Ruseau.

1297
02:50:23,242 --> 02:50:23,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin.

1298
02:50:25,133 --> 02:50:25,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1299
02:50:25,613 --> 02:50:30,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure I quite understand, through the chair, Member Ruseau's request.

1300
02:50:30,897 --> 02:50:37,222
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a number of levers, certainly, for a core evaluation for special education.

1301
02:50:37,282 --> 02:50:40,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Teachers are one of them, but also parents are.

1302
02:50:41,205 --> 02:50:45,709
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's a timeline, a very strict timeline that is adhered to after that.

1303
02:50:45,789 --> 02:50:48,631
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I'm not understanding what the report is.

1304
02:50:48,771 --> 02:50:52,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we asking how many data on how many

1305
02:50:53,013 --> 02:50:57,516
[SPEAKER_13]: students have been referred for special education services and what the timeline was for that?

1306
02:50:57,536 --> 02:51:02,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Or are we asking simply how many students have been referred to special education services?

1307
02:51:06,281 --> 02:51:07,522
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not interested.

1308
02:51:07,802 --> 02:51:08,423
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1309
02:51:08,723 --> 02:51:15,247
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about only the newly identified students that are newly identified as needing an IEP.

1310
02:51:15,427 --> 02:51:21,991
[SPEAKER_20]: There's probably a technical term for that, but students who one day did not have an IEP and the next day they have an IEP.

1311
02:51:22,582 --> 02:51:24,723
[SPEAKER_20]: that's a certain number of students every year.

1312
02:51:25,443 --> 02:51:26,663
[SPEAKER_20]: My son didn't have an IEP.

1313
02:51:27,163 --> 02:51:30,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Then after evaluations and things, he got an IEP.

1314
02:51:31,444 --> 02:51:36,765
[SPEAKER_20]: And in that year, he would have been a one for a student that was added to the IEP roles.

1315
02:51:37,505 --> 02:51:45,787
[SPEAKER_20]: And that happened because the teachers told us, you should have him evaluated.

1316
02:51:45,847 --> 02:51:52,109
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was the teachers and their hands-on experience with the students

1317
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:56,234
[SPEAKER_20]: really brought forth that there's perhaps a reason for this.

1318
02:51:56,694 --> 02:52:08,808
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm concerned that the lack of that experience with students has reduced the number of new students that are newly becoming added to the IEP roles, if you will.

1319
02:52:10,070 --> 02:52:11,151
[SPEAKER_13]: May I, Mayor?

1320
02:52:11,586 --> 02:52:12,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1321
02:52:12,727 --> 02:52:13,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1322
02:52:14,027 --> 02:52:27,995
[SPEAKER_13]: So I hear, I think what I hear you saying, what I hear Member Ruseau saying is a point of comparison data between, you know, pandemic and pre-pandemic data for IEP referrals.

1323
02:52:28,075 --> 02:52:31,037
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just really trying to understand because it's a very

1324
02:52:33,181 --> 02:52:39,166
[SPEAKER_13]: is a very complicated process and it's not a matter of obviously just one day you're referred and the next you're not.

1325
02:52:39,226 --> 02:52:44,770
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you know that member Ruseau having had children referred, but I wanna make clear for the community as well.

1326
02:52:44,830 --> 02:52:58,961
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're talking about a timeframe, so you're talking about March pandemic to end of June compared to March pre-pandemic to end of June the following year comparison data on IAPs to see, and I understand what you're saying about

1327
02:52:59,501 --> 02:53:09,767
[SPEAKER_13]: teachers maybe not necessarily having eyes on the students in the classroom, so less referrals from students, but you also have to think about the disaggregation of the data because it's not just teachers that are referring students for IEP.

1328
02:53:09,827 --> 02:53:21,073
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think if you're talking, A, teacher referrals for students, you know, and B, in a certain timeframe, like really being very clear about the data, because there's a lot of convoluted data that goes in there as well.

1329
02:53:22,914 --> 02:53:23,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1330
02:53:23,314 --> 02:53:24,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Bowen, and then, okay.

1331
02:53:25,533 --> 02:53:35,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So just for clarification, are you referring to students who received an initial evaluation and were found eligible for those the last four years?

1332
02:53:35,497 --> 02:53:38,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1333
02:53:41,210 --> 02:53:58,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I also wanted to explain that we also have a child find responsibility so it's also, it could be a Councilor, it could be a principal, teachers, parents, we get a referral from a doctor so there are many ways, and the timelines were not put on hold.

1334
02:53:59,922 --> 02:54:04,143
[SPEAKER_02]: the start of this school year, like they were last year from March to June.

1335
02:54:04,503 --> 02:54:12,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started back in September, we had to process and complete all of the evaluation that we received the consent forms from the parents.

1336
02:54:13,086 --> 02:54:16,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we received consent, we processed those and completed them.

1337
02:54:17,207 --> 02:54:22,608
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want us to compile who was found eligible through the initial evaluation process.

1338
02:54:25,187 --> 02:54:27,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, just point of information.

1339
02:54:27,888 --> 02:54:31,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, not who, but how many not who was found out?

1340
02:54:31,669 --> 02:54:35,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just I want to make sure that we're really clear that people are understanding.

1341
02:54:36,190 --> 02:54:36,450
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1342
02:54:37,910 --> 02:54:50,193
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I'm going to go out on a limb and bet that a little square on a zoom screen, the only contact anybody in our district has ever had with somebody who just moved into the district last over the last summer.

1343
02:54:51,699 --> 02:54:56,483
[SPEAKER_20]: that student's entire experience at Bedford Public Schools is sitting on a Chromebook in their bedroom.

1344
02:54:58,325 --> 02:55:00,686
[SPEAKER_20]: Were there a lot of those kids that ended up on IEPs?

1345
02:55:00,706 --> 02:55:12,076
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I'm not asking you to do that level of analysis, because I think that's really too much because some kids then ended up coming in and then some were two days, you know, like it's just too complicated.

1346
02:55:12,556 --> 02:55:20,903
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you have had a dramatic drop off in the number of newly eligible students or whatever you just said, I apologize for getting that.

1347
02:55:21,721 --> 02:55:45,054
[SPEAKER_20]: The effects on the budget, the effects on staffing, those are, I mean, and of course, then there's the effects on students, which is obviously critically important, but those other things, two or three years from now, are we gonna find out that we need to get rid of staff because we have this sudden like contraction of like 100 or 300 kids on IEPs that we never got on IEPs.

1348
02:55:45,275 --> 02:55:51,058
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't think it's a weird thing to ask for, because I think in my mind,

1349
02:55:51,516 --> 02:55:58,303
[SPEAKER_20]: this last year has not been normal for anybody, even if the dates and the timelines and the laws didn't change.

1350
02:55:59,164 --> 02:56:14,100
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm just having a hard time imagining that a little square on page two of some teacher's screen, who got lots of great attention from the teacher, I'm sure, that that same student

1351
02:56:14,682 --> 02:56:23,185
[SPEAKER_20]: had the same likelihood of being identified as needing services as the person sitting in front of the teacher in a classroom five days a week, right?

1352
02:56:23,205 --> 02:56:30,769
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, that doesn't seem crazy to think that that's not at all likely to have the same outcome.

1353
02:56:35,511 --> 02:56:36,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Van de Kloop?

1354
02:56:39,732 --> 02:56:41,473
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to unmute yourself, Member Van de Kloop.

1355
02:56:44,172 --> 02:56:45,672
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can ask it in a different way.

1356
02:56:46,973 --> 02:56:53,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally, how many kids are referred to special ed a year pre pandemic 2030.

1357
02:56:53,434 --> 02:56:57,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say a lot more than that.

1358
02:56:57,955 --> 02:57:03,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, yeah, I mean I don't have a definite number I would say anywhere, we could have at referrals a year.

1359
02:57:05,880 --> 02:57:17,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and this year, do you think the number, you know, if we had an idea of what it has been, has the number significantly reduced?

1360
02:57:18,467 --> 02:57:22,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you, you know, are you getting a lot of referrals into your office?

1361
02:57:23,090 --> 02:57:25,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think you're getting more referrals this year than ever before?

1362
02:57:26,992 --> 02:57:31,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think there has been an increased level of evaluations this year.

1363
02:57:31,416 --> 02:57:43,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to, what we would have to determine is what was left over from last year that we prioritized when we began school in September, and then what the new initial evaluations were this school year.

1364
02:57:44,246 --> 02:57:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do see an increase in the number of students that were found eligible this year, but I would need to compare it to the last four years to see if it was, you know, it continues to increase.

1365
02:57:58,377 --> 02:58:17,554
[SPEAKER_08]: So, again, I think my colleagues intent, I think, and you can correct me Paul if I'm wrong, is just to make sure that there are kids who aren't being overlooked because they've been on zoom rather than in person.

1366
02:58:18,354 --> 02:58:31,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and so I think that's, if that's what we're looking for, is the, uh, comparative data, which he suggests, is that the way to go about it or is there a better way, um, for us to, to figure it out?

1367
02:58:32,044 --> 02:58:37,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And how do we make sure under these circumstances that we're not overlooking kids?

1368
02:58:44,392 --> 02:58:45,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

1369
02:58:49,517 --> 02:58:51,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1370
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:52,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Memocrats, I'm sorry.

1371
02:58:52,482 --> 02:58:53,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a question.

1372
02:58:54,125 --> 02:58:58,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I... Oh, where'd you go?

1373
02:58:59,405 --> 02:59:01,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, Membercrat's just gonna unmute.

1374
02:59:02,007 --> 02:59:02,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, sorry.

1375
02:59:02,948 --> 02:59:03,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I did.

1376
02:59:03,529 --> 02:59:05,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I must've clicked it off again.

1377
02:59:06,091 --> 02:59:13,338
[SPEAKER_04]: It says on the resolution that there is a target date of May 24th, and that is a couple of weeks away.

1378
02:59:13,398 --> 02:59:18,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, I don't know if that's enough time.

1379
02:59:18,063 --> 02:59:21,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to reach out to Ms.

1380
02:59:21,366 --> 02:59:22,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowen to ask her,

1381
02:59:22,847 --> 02:59:24,628
[SPEAKER_04]: if that's something that is feasible.

1382
02:59:24,648 --> 02:59:34,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And once again, I thought that the timeframe wouldn't be in this part of the stage because it wasn't with the other resolution for the ad hoc request.

1383
02:59:35,534 --> 02:59:35,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor.

1384
02:59:37,435 --> 02:59:38,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau.

1385
02:59:39,496 --> 02:59:45,319
[SPEAKER_20]: The procedure that we all approved, I believe two years ago, explicitly requires that this is a beta element.

1386
02:59:47,560 --> 02:59:49,361
[SPEAKER_20]: So it is a suggestion

1387
02:59:51,381 --> 02:59:55,705
[SPEAKER_20]: If I didn't want the report until next summer of 2022, I should say that.

1388
02:59:57,326 --> 03:00:16,522
[SPEAKER_20]: And so considering that I imagined that this should, if the systems that we have in place are any good, if this takes more than 15 minutes to find out how many new referrals were there for a year and to do that for four different years, if that took more than 15 minutes, then Ms.

1389
03:00:16,562 --> 03:00:19,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Bowen or the superintendent can say there's just not enough

1390
03:00:19,430 --> 03:00:20,231
[SPEAKER_20]: time to get it done.

1391
03:00:21,071 --> 03:00:29,679
[SPEAKER_20]: But in my imagination, it is a query of the simplest order, and then we get it.

1392
03:00:30,740 --> 03:00:33,843
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is a required part of the procedure that we all approved.

1393
03:00:39,198 --> 03:00:41,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that reasonable or do you need a little more time?

1394
03:00:41,379 --> 03:00:43,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to request a little more time.

1395
03:00:43,921 --> 03:00:47,323
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the process of planning for extended school year programming.

1396
03:00:48,244 --> 03:00:50,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I could have a little more time to get it.

1397
03:00:51,346 --> 03:00:53,227
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pulling from eight different schools.

1398
03:00:54,188 --> 03:00:55,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1399
03:00:56,189 --> 03:00:56,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please.

1400
03:00:56,929 --> 03:00:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1401
03:00:58,711 --> 03:01:00,372
[SPEAKER_14]: So the end of June or?

1402
03:01:01,192 --> 03:01:02,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's fine.

1403
03:01:02,273 --> 03:01:03,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1404
03:01:03,294 --> 03:01:05,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that amenable to the committee?

1405
03:01:05,275 --> 03:01:06,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1406
03:01:07,616 --> 03:01:08,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Eric, I'm sorry.

1407
03:01:09,349 --> 03:01:10,289
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Ms.

1408
03:01:10,310 --> 03:01:37,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen's point about needing to take into account referrals that were put on hold in the spring of 2020, there's also the fact that if there is any type of discrepancy, to which I don't know that there would be, and our obligations are the same regardless of whether a student is attending school virtually or not, but if there is, if we're gonna take a look at that, I think we need more time to take a look at it because the referrals that could occur

1409
03:01:38,435 --> 03:01:39,996
[SPEAKER_18]: beyond June of 2021.

1410
03:01:40,757 --> 03:01:54,148
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think to really have a reliable data set, I think we're gonna need some more time removed from this current ongoing disruption in order to really have anything that we can compare.

1411
03:01:54,168 --> 03:01:55,029
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if Ms.

1412
03:01:55,049 --> 03:01:59,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen can do a report in the next two months, I think, you know, fine, we can do a report.

1413
03:01:59,813 --> 03:02:05,798
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think to really get to the substance of Mr. Rousseau's question, we're gonna need a longer runway

1414
03:02:06,330 --> 03:02:10,473
[SPEAKER_19]: to actually be able to take a look back to see if there is any noticeable discrepancy.

1415
03:02:12,674 --> 03:02:12,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor.

1416
03:02:17,357 --> 03:02:17,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau.

1417
03:02:19,038 --> 03:02:19,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1418
03:02:20,739 --> 03:02:21,980
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not looking for blame.

1419
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:27,083
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not looking for what we did or didn't do right, what the pandemic did or didn't do to kids.

1420
03:02:27,943 --> 03:02:35,108
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want the simplest of referral gets a date in the system that you all have to use.

1421
03:02:36,806 --> 03:02:56,742
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, if there was no drop off in referrals and you're telling me, even though I'm hearing from a special ed teacher that, you know what, the kids that were just little boxes for most of the school year who just showed up in April are shocking some of the teachers because they didn't know the student.

1422
03:02:57,442 --> 03:03:01,705
[SPEAKER_20]: They didn't go, oh my God, this student really needs to be on an IEP, I need to make a referral.

1423
03:03:03,066 --> 03:03:04,788
[SPEAKER_20]: Because when you're just a little box,

1424
03:03:05,625 --> 03:03:13,028
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not, I mean, as much as the teachers work their hardest, they're not a full person.

1425
03:03:13,508 --> 03:03:15,489
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't have, they're not 3D.

1426
03:03:16,870 --> 03:03:23,932
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanna know whether or not we had a different level of referrals going back the last four years.

1427
03:03:24,052 --> 03:03:26,874
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there in fact a trend unrelated to the pandemic?

1428
03:03:26,914 --> 03:03:27,714
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we going down?

1429
03:03:27,734 --> 03:03:28,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we going up?

1430
03:03:28,294 --> 03:03:35,277
[SPEAKER_20]: But I just can't believe that this pandemic, there has been no change in referrals, but also next year,

1431
03:03:36,139 --> 03:03:42,921
[SPEAKER_20]: I suspect that everybody knows there will be a dramatic increase in referrals and an increase from what?

1432
03:03:44,762 --> 03:03:48,103
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to not just see that there's a bigger budget for special ed.

1433
03:03:48,143 --> 03:03:50,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to know that there's been a dramatic increase in referrals.

1434
03:03:51,364 --> 03:03:52,744
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's what it was in the past.

1435
03:03:53,985 --> 03:03:59,827
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't understand why it would actually require any investigation that when referral is put in, there's a date on it.

1436
03:03:59,887 --> 03:04:00,407
[SPEAKER_20]: Am I correct?

1437
03:04:02,605 --> 03:04:05,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but these referrals don't all come in on the same day.

1438
03:04:05,928 --> 03:04:21,420
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I think we could give you data prior to the close of this school year, or at least before the beginning of the next school year, but it might be misleading because the impact of the pandemic will be felt for a timeline that extends well beyond that.

1439
03:04:22,540 --> 03:04:25,643
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm just like July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 is a year.

1440
03:04:25,703 --> 03:04:27,144
[SPEAKER_20]: How many referrals?

1441
03:04:31,464 --> 03:04:33,105
[SPEAKER_20]: and then do that going back four years.

1442
03:04:34,146 --> 03:04:35,246
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we have something to talk about.

1443
03:04:35,267 --> 03:04:38,409
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like we're talking about this with, I don't have any idea, I don't have any data.

1444
03:04:39,709 --> 03:04:42,871
[SPEAKER_18]: And that sort of was- Excuse me, Mr. Rizzo, I'm sorry.

1445
03:04:43,492 --> 03:04:44,753
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'll defer to Ms.

1446
03:04:44,793 --> 03:04:46,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen with regard to when that data can be provided.

1447
03:04:47,294 --> 03:04:54,979
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we wanna be clear though that that could be data that's on a faulty premise if the data is produced prematurely.

1448
03:04:56,020 --> 03:05:00,843
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I think that more reliable data to get to the point that you're asking about

1449
03:05:01,688 --> 03:05:03,568
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, is going to be at some point in the future.

1450
03:05:03,588 --> 03:05:29,673
[SPEAKER_18]: We could produce one data set now and one later, but what I would be, I have, what I do have some reservations about is if we produce data that says before the end of the school year, there's some type of discrepancy and that discrepancy is then publicly attributed to the fact that students were remote, were learning remotely, then there could be an assumption that the district was not meeting its obligations when in fact, just like there were,

1451
03:05:30,467 --> 03:05:46,076
[SPEAKER_18]: evaluations that needed to be completed in the fall that were put on hold in the spring, the totality of the impact of the pandemic might be the case that there is an increase in referrals over an extended period of time so that students are being properly evaluated.

1452
03:05:46,696 --> 03:05:51,459
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, again, I think if you just want data, again, defer to Ms.

1453
03:05:51,499 --> 03:05:58,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Bowen as to what a reasonable timeline is on that, but if it's in the next couple of months and it's data offered

1454
03:05:58,459 --> 03:06:18,666
[SPEAKER_18]: from which people can draw inferences or conclusions about whether or not the pandemic had an impact on the total number of referrals, I would say that data will be premature because we won't really know the answer to that until more time goes on and more of a traditional operation of school can take hold over the course of the 21-22 school year.

1455
03:06:19,806 --> 03:06:25,448
[SPEAKER_18]: So my only point is I just don't want the committee to be having a discussion about this on a false premise.

1456
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:31,242
[SPEAKER_19]: which seems to me like could be a possibility if the data is produced too early.

1457
03:06:31,262 --> 03:06:41,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so do we want this by the end of June or are we looking just push this out as Mr. Murphy I think is suggesting?

1458
03:06:41,626 --> 03:06:46,547
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we can produce data by June as long as everyone agrees we're not gonna draw major conclusions off of it.

1459
03:06:46,567 --> 03:06:53,730
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, again, and then I think it's something we have to revisit as we continue to assess the total impact of this disruption.

1460
03:06:54,965 --> 03:06:55,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor.

1461
03:06:55,345 --> 03:07:09,655
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, if this report comes back and says we have twice as many referrals coming in, and then you don't want to add any new special ed staff in the budget, I'm drawing some pretty big conclusions there.

1462
03:07:10,035 --> 03:07:15,659
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, I'm gonna not get numbers back that are shocking and not be shocked.

1463
03:07:15,979 --> 03:07:21,883
[SPEAKER_20]: If there's a 5% increase and you don't think we need no more staff, well, that's a conversation.

1464
03:07:22,342 --> 03:07:39,767
[SPEAKER_20]: but if the pandemic has caused a dramatic increase in referrals and there are no additional ETLs and there are no additional special ed staff to work with the students, that seems like a really important question the school committee would wanna understand, how do you plan to make this work?

1465
03:07:41,588 --> 03:07:45,469
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, and it's not that I don't believe you all are doing that, I trust Ms.

1466
03:07:45,489 --> 03:07:51,771
[SPEAKER_20]: Bowen is actually planning for all of that, but I just feel completely in the dark.

1467
03:07:52,500 --> 03:08:02,970
[SPEAKER_20]: about what's going on with kids that are being newly discovered as needing IEPs much, much later than they would have been if we didn't have a pandemic.

1468
03:08:03,750 --> 03:08:08,995
[SPEAKER_20]: And what about all the kids that still have not gone to school for a year and a half now?

1469
03:08:16,709 --> 03:08:18,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think, two things.

1470
03:08:18,330 --> 03:08:27,774
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I think that we need to ask the administration to advise us when what sort of report, and when.

1471
03:08:28,946 --> 03:08:38,350
[SPEAKER_08]: it would be available to get at some of these issues that Paul is raising or is concerned about.

1472
03:08:38,930 --> 03:08:53,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I do wanna remind my colleague that just tonight we did hear that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education thought we were doing really good job and that there is, I guess I do have a sense of,

1473
03:08:54,337 --> 03:09:13,984
[SPEAKER_08]: some level of trust in our special education staff that they are following up, that they are, that our teachers are very much, whether a child is on Zoom or in person, that they are on top of it, so to speak.

1474
03:09:14,564 --> 03:09:21,206
[SPEAKER_08]: So in order to move this discussion along, I think that we should just simply ask

1475
03:09:22,386 --> 03:09:47,762
[SPEAKER_08]: our superintendent's office and whatever, to consider what the issues that my colleague has raised, because he's got some concern and I understand it, to make sure that we are not inappropriately budgeting in the future, and making sure that if there is a wave of upcoming students or if we're really off, if the numbers really don't make sense,

1476
03:09:50,023 --> 03:09:54,817
[SPEAKER_08]: that they get back to us and give us an idea of what they think makes sense.

1477
03:09:55,539 --> 03:09:56,481
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I would advise.

1478
03:09:59,361 --> 03:10:03,143
[SPEAKER_08]: So Paul's got a motion on it on the floor.

1479
03:10:04,124 --> 03:10:25,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I would amend it and ask that the superintendent's office come back to us with their suggestion for a report which would look at data and answer some of the concerns that my colleague has.

1480
03:10:26,536 --> 03:10:27,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'd like to hear from them.

1481
03:10:28,898 --> 03:10:39,902
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay, so this motion will be amended to send to the administration, Dr. Edouard-Vincent and the administration to discuss what data they can give us by June.

1482
03:10:39,922 --> 03:10:48,725
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't said by June, but discuss what data they can give us and what suggestions they have for reports.

1483
03:10:49,185 --> 03:10:51,306
[SPEAKER_14]: For time, reports and timeframe.

1484
03:10:51,446 --> 03:10:56,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, motion on the floor as amended by member Van der Kloot, is there?

1485
03:10:58,282 --> 03:10:58,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

1486
03:11:00,984 --> 03:11:01,285
