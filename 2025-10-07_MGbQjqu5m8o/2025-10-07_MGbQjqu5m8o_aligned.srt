00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:07,277
This first song was by Carlos Vieira, one of the, you know,

2
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,976
lot of bossa nova so if it's too late forgive me that's the title i'll try to translate not

3
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:41,436
Very good on that, but I think you're gonna get a little bit of, you know, about what I'm singing.

4
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:44,799
So this next piece is like influence of the jazz.

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:54,747
So jazz influence, so it's about like the song that also by Tom's leader, about like the influence of jazz and samba.

6
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:03,515
So it's kind of like you're talking about samba has this, but jazz has that, and you know, you're gonna see how it goes.

00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:20,058
foreign

8
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:46,896
The one who died was dying, he's almost dying, he didn't realize.

9
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:50,217
And Zamba goes from one side to the other.

10
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:52,817
Jazz is different, forward and backward.

11
00:01:53,037 --> 00:02:00,580
And Zamba is kind of dumb, kind of stupid, he's a jazz fluency.

12
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,320
And the world goes on, complicating it, the world goes on.

13
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,322
It goes on twisting, it goes on without rest, it goes on, it goes on.

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,921
foreign

15
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:07,640
do

16
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:06,663
foreign

17
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:23,979
He died and ended up dying.

18
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,121
He came home and died without realizing it.

19
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:32,622
And this is a swing from one side to the other.

20
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,863
Jazz is different back and forth.

21
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:39,825
And this is also the world that ate so much influence from jazz.

22
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:48,409
And the world keeps on turning, it keeps on complicating, it keeps on spinning, it keeps on twisting, it keeps on resting.

23
00:05:50,008 --> 00:06:14,185
Balanço do top, samba meu Volta lá pro bolo e faz o soco aonde nasceu Pra não ser um samba com notas demais Não ser um samba torto pra frente e pra trás Vai ter que se virar pra poder se livrar Vai ter que se virar pra poder se livrar da influência do...

24
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,298
I think this next piece is, you might know, it's a wave.

25
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:58,408
I don't know what to do.

26
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:45,483
The first time was the city The second was eternity Now I already know The wave that followed the sea And the stars that we forgot to count Let's stop suffering While the night comes to envelop us I'll tell you

27
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:02,554
can't see anymore.

28
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:05,998
Things that only the heart can understand.

29
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,301
It's impossible to be happy alone.

30
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,663
The rest is all I don't know how to tell.

31
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:11,484
They're crazy things.

32
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,022
It comes from a sign that tells me it's impossible to be happy alone.

33
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,083
The first time was in the city.

34
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:37,186
The second time was in eternity.

35
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:39,348
It's a story I already know.

36
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,629
The moon that always is the moon.

37
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:44,972
And the stars that forgot where to go.

38
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:12,055
do

39
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,728
I can tell you that I can't live without you.

40
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:53,150
Things that only the heart can do.

41
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,383
The first time I was in the city.

42
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:47,286
I was born in a place of eternity.

43
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,607
It's the place where I was born.

44
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,568
It's the place where I was born.

45
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:54,089
It's the place where I was born.

46
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,010
It's the place where I was born.

47
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,651
It's the place where I was born.

48
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:01,912
It's the place where I was born.

49
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:03,473
It's the place where I was born.

50
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,052
Thank you.

51
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:37,893
I want to switch to the next one.

52
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:43,374
Sometimes we argue.

53
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:44,975
I want to sing this song.

54
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,716
I don't want to play this song.

55
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:49,476
But it's fine.

56
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,138
Samba, the land of Jesus.

57
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,539
Drinking at night.

58
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,620
Drinking the bambas.

59
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,682
Oh, the magic of the missiles.

60
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:19,943
My heart pours out in Bahia.

61
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:41,103
My heart is breaking

62
00:13:55,872 --> 00:14:18,670
I'm going to let it speak, I'm going to let it come down You can come to your senate, I'm going to be your blackboard I'm going to clap my hands again, with my feet in my heart I'm going to play the guitar, I'm going to find the realism of pain

63
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:24,007
I am, I am, I am, I am.

64
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:01,704
I'm going to Bahia Samba, I'm going there.

65
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,127
I'm going to Samba full of Jesus.

66
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:13,093
I'm going to see the moon and see the pampas, a magic of Jesus.

67
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:17,136
My heart is overflowing.

68
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:24,682
I'm going to Bahia, I'm going to the moon, I'm going to the cantina of the moon.

69
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:52,049
I'm from the south, I'm from the south I'm from the south, I'm from the south I'm from the south

70
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:01,339
I'm

71
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,799
I miss being white.

72
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:24,505
Day 2, 2nd of December.

73
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,669
I'm going to Bahia Selva.

74
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:29,091
I'm going there.

75
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,734
Day 2, 2nd of December.

76
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:35,299
I'm going to Bahia Selva.

77
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,100
I'm going.

78
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,338
João Bosto's song is always like crazy.

79
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:53,480
So this is a Perreiro de Jesus, where he's from.

80
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:10,790
It's a place in Bahia, where Bahia has a lot of, we have a lot of African contribution, and you know, and this is like, he's describing where he's from, and it's a very powerful song, beautiful.

81
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:13,559
Hard to sing on Saturday morning.

82
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,239
Singers like to sing at night.

83
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,521
So let's go back to the other one, which is Sampa.

84
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:24,742
Sampa is like that suburbiation of Sao Paulo.

85
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:32,964
So this is by Caetano Veloso, who also described it, how it was like being in Sampa for the first time.

86
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,565
And he said Sao Paulo is like New York.

87
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:41,867
So this has like beautiful and poetic things about São Paulo.

88
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:46,149
This is more than one.

89
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:17,910
Something happens in my heart, that only when I cross Ipiranga and Avenida São João, is that when I get here, I don't understand anything.

90
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:29,562
foreign foreign

91
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:58,301
When I looked at you face to face, I didn't see my face.

92
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:04,487
I called you by bad name, I saw you by bad name.

93
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:27,497
I don't know.

94
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:28,158
I don't.

95
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:11,052
do povo oprimido nas filas, nas filas favelas da força da grana que ergue e destrói coisas belas

96
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:47,193

98
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:39,900
I found such a crime, I found, I found, I found.

99
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:18,860
of the strength of the money that is, that destroys all the candles, of the cold smoke that rises, erasing the stars.

100
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,381
Today I see your poems of fields and spaces, your forest workshops, your rain gods.

101
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:43,542
The new Bahianas walk on your street.

102
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:47,930
And the new Bahianas go out.

103
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:14,786
I think you might know this one and feel free if you want to dance.

104
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:14,536

Samba de preto velho, samba de preto.

107
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:19,814
Mais que nada, um samba como esse tão legal, você não vai querer.

108
00:27:03,351 --> 00:27:03,773
Wow!

109
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:35,967
More than anything, get out of my way, I want to pass.

110
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:43,028
Because samba is animated, and what I want is samba.

111
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:49,369
But this samba, which is a mix of maracatu, samba de preto velho,

112
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:02,562
Oh

113
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:12,873
More songs to dance.

114
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:17,714
This is by Shigbo Aki, one of my favorites.

115
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,635
It's amazing.

116
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:24,517
Translation for this one is like, let the girl dance.

117
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,578
Do not stop her any time.

118
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:29,619
Not a good husband, not.

119
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,719
So just let her go and dance.

121
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:39,469
Joga confete Mas tem o que dizer Cê tá de lascar Cê tá de doer E se vai continuar enrustido Com essa cara de marido A moça é capaz De se aborrecer Por trás de um homem triste Há sempre uma mulher feliz E atrás dessa mulher

122
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:56,698
It's ten o'clock and the samba is hot

foreign

124
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:50,559
It only deserves the strength you have If the good is in your presence, my precious boy

125
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,934
I don't know what to say.

126
00:33:14,054 --> 00:33:16,876
You're hurting yourself.

127
00:33:16,936 --> 00:33:19,977
You're hurting yourself.

128
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:22,438
It's three o'clock.

129
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:23,759
The sun is hot.

130
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,461
Let the girl be happy.

131
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,081
Let the girl dance in peace.

132
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:34,245
Because of a sad woman, there's always a happy woman.

133
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:37,306
Behind this woman is a man.

134
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:46,389
That's why, for your own good, I'm going to take my head off over this girl that you love.

135
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:52,876
If you want to be resulting, my precious boy, there's no one else here.

136
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:36,795
I just want to thank you one more time, and thank everybody for the invitation to be here, with Bill Ward, with Greg, that's my first time, so happy you're here, and Renato.

137
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:46,482
My name is Anna Borges, feel free if you want to join the lecture, make a listen hour,

138
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:52,000
I promote events, I'm also a concert promoter.

139
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,961
And we're also from Hartford.

140
00:34:56,062 --> 00:34:57,643
And it's so nice to play at home.

141
00:34:58,203 --> 00:35:01,665
So nice, really nice.

142
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:04,906
All right, so let's do this one.

143
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:09,089
You might know this one too.

144
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:23,723
This is the part.

145
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:57,411
Você viu só que a mão nunca vi coisa assim Nem passou nem parou mas olha só pra mim Se voltar vou atrás e se voltar Vou contar que o amor foi feitinho pra dar Olha, é como o verão, quente o coração

146
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:09,763
I suddenly jump to see the girl who comes.

147
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:13,865
She always has this way of looking at me.

148
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:16,687
And she will come, she has to be.

149
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:18,068
She never has to love.

150
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:19,308
Today she says yes.

151
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:20,869
I'm tired of waiting.

152
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,291
I didn't stop, I didn't even sleep.

153
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:27,373
I was just thinking about leaving.

154
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:30,035
I pass by, but you don't come.

155
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:30,835
Come.

156
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:34,537
So let me speak, just tell me if you come.

157
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,362
You see, love, I've never seen anything like it.

158
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:44,464
It went by, it didn't stop, but look at me.

159
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:48,306
If you come back, I'll go back, I'll ask for love again.

160
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:52,609
I'll confess that love was a little fart to give.

161
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:59,594
Look, it's like a hot summer heart.

162
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:03,076
It suddenly jumps to see the next girl.

163
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,397
She must be pretending.

164
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:13,254
You'll see, I have to be, there's no one to love.

165
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:16,017
Today I know, I forgot, I'm tired of waiting.

166
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:20,141
I didn't stop, I didn't sleep, just thinking about life.

167
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:23,824
I ask, but you don't come.

168
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:24,404
Come.

169
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:27,748
I let go, I speak, I only think about you, but you don't come.

170
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:48,489
do do

171
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:22,165
And you saw that the girl of your victory didn't pass, didn't stop, but looked only at me.

172
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:27,348
If I go back, I'll go back, I'll come back, I'll tell you that love was a little temptation.

173
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:31,410
Look, it's like summer, who has a heart, just to suddenly stop.

174
00:39:49,388 --> 00:40:05,533
♪ Deixa então, falo só, digo ao céu, mas você vem ♪ ♪ Deixa então, falo só, digo ao céu, mas você vem ♪ ♪ Deixa então, falo só, digo ao céu, mas você vem ♪

175
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,090
Let's do the Bolero one.

176
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,371
Yeah, he likes the Bolero one.

177
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:38,091
Let's do that.

178
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:40,251
This is by Dorival Caymmi.

179
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,752
There's another song about love.

180
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:51,414
Let's do the Bolero one.

181
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:54,254
Oh my God.

182
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:55,255
Nice, nice.

183
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:56,135
I like that.

184
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:21,526
No fazes favorinho em gostar de alguém Nem eu, nem eu, nem eu Quem inventou o amor não fui eu, não fui eu

185
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:47,081
And with an important coincidence, my dear, from our lives to life, your toy came too.

186
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:17,400
In Costa del Rio, de Rio.

187
00:42:48,647 --> 00:43:04,263
Estavas desprevida E por acaso eu também E como acaso a importante e querida De nossas vidas a vida Fez seu brinquedo também

188
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:24,376
No fazes favor nenhum em gostar de alguém Nem eu, nem eu, nem eu Que inventou o amor

189
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:51,293
is

190
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:39,910
Inventor of love.

191
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,452
It wasn't me.

192
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,913
It wasn't me.

193
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:44,415
It wasn't me.

194
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:50,121
It wasn't me or anyone.

195
00:46:07,302 --> 00:46:10,363
Thank you.

196
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:14,025
This is the song that we can spend the whole day singing at the same time, right?

197
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:14,745
It's so good.

198
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:15,425
Love that.

199
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:15,845
One more?

200
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:17,446
All right.

201
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:21,467
Again, such a pleasure to be here in Medford.

202
00:46:22,568 --> 00:46:26,789
And with you guys, such a great audience, special.

203
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:30,911
And thank you a lot for everyone who invited us.

204
00:46:31,011 --> 00:46:33,191
Sorry, I can't remember everyone's name.

205
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:34,092
It's too early.

206
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:37,374
But thank you again for inviting us.

207
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,055
We're gonna do the last song.

208
00:46:39,115 --> 00:46:42,597
Let's, what's the best for the last song?

209
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:42,978
Bêbado.

210
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:46,180
Yeah, let's do it.

211
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,082
Or, do you know this one?

212
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:49,582
Bêbado.

213
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:55,406
All right, so this is another João Bosco song, so here we go.

214
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:56,166
A lot of energy, high notes.

215
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:56,707
You all right?

216
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:08,536
oh wow

217
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,933
O Brasil, meu Brasil.

218
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:46,720
Me sonha com a volta do irmão, do filho, com tanta gente que partiu.

219
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,942
Um rabo de boquete chora.

220
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,504
A nossa pátria mãe gentil.

221
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,845
Choro maria e zingare

222
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:01,533
foreign

223
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:49,492
a few words, Greg Torell, and enough about my music, my name is Linda Gordon.

224
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:52,253
We'll be playing West Peak in Harvard Square.

225
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:54,815
I can't tell you more if you ask.

226
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:59,138
Thank you.

227
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,060
All right, this is West Memphis, don't be stingy.

228
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,403
Resheta De Samba, Villabuda on piano.

229
00:51:06,423 --> 00:51:08,764
A lot of gorgeous on vocals.

230
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:09,785
Greg Torell on bass.

231
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:17,839
All right.

232
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,960
Very, very good.

233
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:26,286
Okay, so we're going to take a little pause for the pause while we get set up for our act two.

234
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:28,889
All right.

235
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:29,609
All right.

236
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,891
Hello, everybody.

237
00:51:33,793 --> 00:51:34,273
All right.

238
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:37,096
So we had a beautiful first step.

239
00:51:37,116 --> 00:51:39,098
They said that the ensemble was marvelous.

240
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:41,540
Really, really good.

241
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,642
And hopefully we will

242
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:50,925
at least meet if not exceed your expectations for the second part of our program today.

243
00:51:52,355 --> 00:52:02,084
For those of you who don't know me or who I haven't had a chance to meet yet, my name is Terry Carter, Terry E. My mother says use the initial, that's why I gave it to you.

244
00:52:02,144 --> 00:52:05,768
So it's Terry E. Carter, E stands for Eugene.

245
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:09,992
And I direct elder services here at the community center.

246
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:16,338
I'm not gonna talk a lot, but I do want you to know just a little bit about, we've been in business for 90 years.

247
00:52:17,649 --> 00:52:21,410
representing the historic African-American community of West Medford.

248
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:24,731
And this is the second building on the site.

249
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:38,816
The first building was little more than an old Army Quonset hut that was brought here from the Army base in East Boston going way back, World War II.

250
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:41,577
And it was set on the site.

251
00:52:42,275 --> 00:53:01,633
and it remained our home from like 1945 to the early 2000s and then it basically collapsed under its own weight and we were fortunate enough over the next several years thereafter to build this building and this is the current home of

252
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:06,096
an organization that really, really is very near and dear to my heart.

253
00:53:06,156 --> 00:53:07,637
I grew up in West Medford.

254
00:53:07,677 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm born and raised on Jerome and Monument Streets, not too far from here.

255
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:19,907
And so the community center, Duggar Park, where all the basketball players are, well, you know, another story for another day.

256
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:29,014
And, let's see, Duggar Park, the Hervey School, Shiloh Baptist Church, a couple other places.

257
00:53:29,962 --> 00:53:33,523
If our parents didn't know where we were, they knew where to find us, okay?

258
00:53:33,564 --> 00:53:35,944
Because we were at one of those three or four places.

259
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:44,728
But in any case, Jonathan and I, Jonathan Fagan here, who convened and founded the Jazz Fest.

260
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:50,530
Yeah, absolutely.

261
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:57,993
We got together, it's going on six years ago, and we decided that we wanted to

262
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:16,373
do something project-wise, him as a musician, me as a poet, that would bring those two worlds together under the banner of jazz, because he's a splendid jazz composer, arranger, and poetry, and I'm turning into more of a lyricist as time goes by.

263
00:54:16,393 --> 00:54:24,037
I just started out as a garden variety poet, but now I can add lyricist and poet laureate to my name.

264
00:54:27,485 --> 00:54:33,947
Okay, so we're gonna start off with where we think, as a community, we start off.

265
00:54:34,027 --> 00:54:37,988
So we're gonna do a tune called Hard by the Mystic, okay?

266
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:45,751
All right, now, everything that we do is this intersection of jazz and social justice, okay?

267
00:54:46,311 --> 00:54:53,653
Some of it might not fit your ears real easily, but I ask you to open your hearts because I speak the truth in love.

268
00:54:53,673 --> 00:54:55,513
Is that cool?

269
00:54:56,214 --> 00:54:57,154
All right, all right, very good.

270
00:54:58,207 --> 00:54:59,008
All right, let's do this.

271
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,792
They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it.

272
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:10,375
Just a few streets high by the river.

273
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:14,178
Gangs turned to fly and die behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

274
00:55:14,238 --> 00:55:18,220
Class was an irresistible force.

275
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,942
Race was an immovable object.

276
00:55:25,537 --> 00:55:39,110
us in our place in this mystic valley space where slaves and rams and shepherds had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

277
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,714
So it was hard by the mystic we went

278
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:50,629
muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be found in this ancient Middlesex County town.

279
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:57,850
But we named it, and claimed it, and made it our own.

280
00:56:00,171 --> 00:56:10,013
Even in the heat of summer, when the shores were parched and the soil was rank, with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

281
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,321
We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

282
00:56:14,361 --> 00:56:21,624
Like our own Georgia shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

283
00:56:21,664 --> 00:56:30,227
We popped the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread, and became the TV multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, inspired by the mystic.

284
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,342
We became community.

285
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:36,203
We commanded unity.

286
00:56:36,243 --> 00:56:47,552
We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

287
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:51,875
As the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows.

288
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,357
A few more streets become our home.

289
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:57,680
Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

290
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:03,707
From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landings won't make more room for blacks.

291
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:05,927
The color line recedes a bit.

292
00:57:06,448 --> 00:57:08,988
Church and school and center sits.

293
00:57:09,449 --> 00:57:12,229
The bill becomes the heart of it.

294
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,350
Hired by the Mr. Cho.

295
00:57:26,623 --> 00:57:36,455
Now the worm has surely turned And folks who left have surely learned Things couldn't stay the same That money mystic most days is clean

296
00:57:38,343 --> 00:57:40,524
The banks are freshly cut and green.

297
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:46,146
Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

298
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:53,188
These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines.

299
00:57:53,888 --> 00:58:03,612
Condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, excess, and largesse.

300
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:20,068
Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family.

301
00:58:28,535 --> 00:58:33,479
And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins

302
00:58:34,006 --> 00:58:35,007
to wear it in.

303
00:58:35,107 --> 00:58:50,157
The only place where one could be found in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

304
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,520
All right.

305
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:57,282
All right.

306
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:57,882
Okay.

307
00:58:57,922 --> 00:58:58,462
Now, okay.

308
00:58:58,502 --> 00:58:59,883
We're into it now.

309
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:00,544
Okay.

310
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:01,885
We're into it.

311
00:59:04,003 --> 00:59:17,771
So this is a cool segue because there were, in that ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own, there were a few institutions, especially for us kids.

312
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:24,568
Okay, there was of course Duggar Park, there was the Hervey School Yard where we grew up and played on that side of town.

313
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:37,796
There was the West Memphis Community Center where all of us kids came for Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts and playing pool and bumper pool and ping pong and so on and so forth.

314
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:46,622
And one of the other institutions that was particularly near and dear to our heart was right around the corner a few streets down on Jerome Street and it was called

315
00:59:47,348 --> 00:59:48,169
The Little Store.

316
00:59:57,657 --> 01:00:01,421
It was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome.

317
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:04,003
A bit rundown and rough around the edges.

318
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:13,866
And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient, and a little scary.

319
01:00:14,226 --> 01:00:21,352
One would suspect that he didn't even like kids, but he really must have loved us, or else.

320
01:00:22,173 --> 01:00:24,955
Where did all that penny candy come from?

321
01:00:24,995 --> 01:00:27,637
He had all of it, no serious stuff.

322
01:00:27,677 --> 01:00:32,301
We'd bust in there with a few nipples or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.

323
01:00:35,895 --> 01:00:37,735
up while he finished with grown folks business.

324
01:00:38,536 --> 01:00:42,036
Then he'd be back like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

325
01:00:42,656 --> 01:00:48,177
He'd peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.

326
01:00:48,837 --> 01:00:58,999
Then he'd blow over one of those small brown craft paper bags and get to stuffing while we were pooing and ahhing and huffing and puffing.

327
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:00,520
See, Mr. Henry had all the

328
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:11,796
Squirrel nut zippers and banana splits.

329
01:01:12,337 --> 01:01:14,700
Green mint juleps and button strips.

330
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:16,883
Red licorice ropes and bottle nips.

331
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,486
He had bazooka Joe bubblegum.

332
01:01:19,887 --> 01:01:21,909
And a tiny sucker called a dum-dum.

333
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,072
Jar breakers and tootsie rolls.

334
01:01:24,513 --> 01:01:26,756
Sugary love for little kids souls.

335
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:33,127
candy necklaces to wear and bite, and waxy red lips was such a sight.

336
01:01:33,447 --> 01:01:37,969
Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes, right beside the crunchy six legs.

337
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:40,430
Mary Jane chewies and B.J.

338
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,731
bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

339
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:48,913
Just the genuine Hershey's Kisses, all of the hits and none of the misses.

340
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:54,215
Like kid taffy squares and nickel wafers, liquor made in Boston they feel.

341
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,817
Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag, a kid's idea, sweet tooth swag.

342
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:05,939
Before the days of Laffy Taffys, we were gobbling up peppermint patties.

343
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:10,701
Before we knew about gummy bears, Twizzlers always came in pairs.

344
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:16,223
Chewy cow tails with creamy filling, but sugar babies had top filling.

345
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:21,205
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups had us squealing like newborn pups.

346
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,027
We grab those bags like potty, baby.

347
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:55,162
chuckles were a favorite choice and milk studs made us all rejoice jolly ranchers and bitter honey we always got a lot for our money talk about kids getting excited our greedy fingers could barely wait you can't imagine the flame he ignited to take that

348
01:02:59,294 --> 01:03:01,455
January to chilly December.

349
01:03:01,495 --> 01:03:08,759
More kinds of candy than I can remember at the Phil storefront on Upper Jerome.

350
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:14,922
I know I have to write this poem saying Mr. Henry had all the treats.

351
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:16,543
All of our favorites.

352
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:19,825
A hundred great sweets.

353
01:03:22,206 --> 01:03:22,666
Alright.

354
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,308
Alright, alright.

355
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:27,489
Yeah, yeah.

356
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:29,225
You love it.

357
01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:32,387
Okay, so there's the band.

358
01:03:33,828 --> 01:03:35,228
Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

359
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,732
Greg Toro on the little sexy.

360
01:03:41,752 --> 01:03:42,972
This is not the big sexy.

361
01:03:43,012 --> 01:03:45,353
The big sexy is the really big bass.

362
01:03:45,393 --> 01:03:46,754
This is the little sexy.

363
01:03:46,814 --> 01:03:48,935
It's still very sexy, but it's a smaller bass.

364
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,957
My man Gordon Engelkau on the traps here.

365
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,179
Okay, we are the Allied Project.

366
01:03:56,779 --> 01:03:58,260
We're gonna move this thing along.

367
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,715
Oh boy, where am I?

368
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:10,664
Yeah, okay, here we go.

369
01:04:10,684 --> 01:04:14,847
So I'm not gonna lie or front as we say in the hood.

370
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:20,713
The neighborhood has changed pretty dramatically, all right?

371
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,066
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about how I remember it and what it's become.

372
01:04:27,707 --> 01:04:30,451
Okay, so this piece is called Corner Lot.

373
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:31,693
All right.

374
01:04:53,959 --> 01:04:59,761
standing at the apex of Arlington and Jerome, trying to remember the black and the brown and the tan.

375
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:03,882
Ronnie and Otis used to live in the big house on the corner lot.

376
01:05:04,522 --> 01:05:07,163
It's probably changed a half a dozen times since then.

377
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:10,744
Current owner's been there for a minute.

378
01:05:10,784 --> 01:05:14,125
He's good with his hands and he knows his way around wood and tools.

379
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:16,886
Place has been gussied up quite a bit.

380
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:21,768
Picket fence is not quite white, but if you know, you know.

381
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:27,265
Asian kid in a Tufts hoodie just whipped by in a helmet and rollerblades.

382
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:30,167
Didn't see much of that back in the day.

383
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:36,430
The university sort of hit on the hell side trying its best to be a baby Ivy.

384
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:40,193
But the co-eds come here all the time now.

385
01:05:40,873 --> 01:05:48,638
Basketball, tennis rackets, pickleball paddles in tow, on bikes, in Benzos and rollerblades.

386
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:56,352
We used to bust ourselves up pretty good on those rickety metal skates with funky keys and leather straps.

387
01:05:57,573 --> 01:06:00,676
Nothing a little Vaseline and Mercurochrome couldn't handle.

388
01:06:00,716 --> 01:06:04,018
How did Henley put it in Invictus?

389
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:06,259
Oh yeah, bloody but unbowed.

390
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,943
Not too many white and off-white kids hanging out here back there then.

391
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:18,008
It was as if the invisible lines once drawn to keep us in sometimes kept other folks out too.

392
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:37,511
now they've pretty much taken over dug apart the rome tennis court the herby schoolyard and a hundred addresses on arlington lincoln and rome a host of our remembered places so few of our original faces

393
01:06:45,582 --> 01:06:55,907
Meanwhile, back at Ronnie and Otis' old place, I'm still standing like that centurion, knowing that Jesus doesn't have to go in to heal his servant.

394
01:06:55,947 --> 01:06:57,407
He just has to speak a word.

395
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:06,031
I guess I keep hoping that he'll speak a word to the Cornelot, too, and bring back the black and the brown and the tan.

396
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:12,314
Across the river, it's low tide.

397
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:16,431
The smell is gone and the grass is greener than I recall.

398
01:07:21,033 --> 01:07:25,015
That was our little park, away from Duggar and a lot less hectic.

399
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:30,037
We had makeshift bases or discarded cones for football and softball.

400
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:36,560
We lost a few in the river, but nobody was going in that muck to retrieve anything.

401
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,341
We'd probably wait in that water today.

402
01:07:44,037 --> 01:07:44,517
years ago.

403
01:07:44,557 --> 01:07:46,058
They're all pretty big now.

404
01:07:46,538 --> 01:07:48,179
Maple and ash, I think.

405
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,641
Nobody plays baseball or football there anymore.

406
01:07:52,421 --> 01:08:01,566
But there are lots of dogs frolicking off leash and gaggles of fat Canadian geese daring pennies, pugs, and poos to chase them off.

407
01:08:12,538 --> 01:08:16,281
I can't imagine my childhood without losing a few softballs there.

408
01:08:17,202 --> 01:08:27,792
I can't imagine not hearing Mrs. Allen call little James Michael to come and eat, or little Charlie to watch us play from his bowling chair, because his spindly legs were too weak to let him run.

409
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,595
I can't imagine that I'm still here.

410
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:38,141
But Bonnie and Otis, and Darryl King, and Frank the French, Aaron McDaniel, and Murphy Davis are all

411
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,702
Everyone had a nickname back then.

412
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:48,887
Daryl was super fast, so we called him Road Runner and Jack Rabbit.

413
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:53,592
Mark was as thick as a big tree trunk, so we came up with Oak for him.

414
01:08:54,173 --> 01:09:01,180
Aaron was Spud, Frankie was Fruit Man, and I was Top Cat, too cool, ran the school.

415
01:09:10,733 --> 01:09:11,974
across the corner lot now.

416
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:16,338
A little more land and perhaps a new perspective that angles create.

417
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:26,208
I wonder if that meant anything to Ronnie and Otis, or Jed and Miles and Gibbs, Barry, Coco, Keith Wing, and Kenny Byfield.

418
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:34,416
Certainly meant something to the white folks looking to displace, transplant, and uproot the local color.

419
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:39,897
Black folks built homes here.

420
01:09:40,657 --> 01:09:42,679
Only place where they were allowed to be.

421
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,501
Where they could color inside the lines.

422
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:50,323
Against the perceived discomforts of darker skin.

423
01:09:51,568 --> 01:09:53,450
We were here first.

424
01:09:54,210 --> 01:10:02,758
First firefighters, police officers, war heroes, shop owners, tradesmen, postal chiefs, teachers, artists, and preachers.

425
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:12,167
We were the human bedrock of the only neighborhood they'd let us build.

426
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:13,969
The old church is gone now.

427
01:10:14,963 --> 01:10:23,081
Nelson even changed the street number as if to erase the fact that the original Shiloh Baptist ever existed.

428
01:10:23,582 --> 01:10:25,446
But if you know, you know.

429
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:51,255
that corner still have the cornerstone 1900 and Nelson couldn't do nothing about it without a more draconian demolition two more condos in the house of the lord two more houses that us first folks can't afford two more dismissals of the blessings of his word one more holy stone rejected and

430
01:11:02,285 --> 01:11:05,887
So, all right, we're gonna switch it up a little bit.

431
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:21,515
If you're familiar with the Jazz Canon, you know a couple of the players, you know, Duke Ellington and Miles Davis and you know, maybe Herbie Hancock and a few others.

432
01:11:23,616 --> 01:11:25,557
And then maybe you know John Coltrane.

433
01:11:26,637 --> 01:11:27,998
All right, so Coltrane,

434
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:35,814
Some of the best of the jazz standards were his compositions with that beautiful horn of his.

435
01:11:36,395 --> 01:11:39,216
And one of them was about one of his loves.

436
01:11:39,636 --> 01:11:40,997
Her name was Naima.

437
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:47,660
And so if you know Coltrane and you know jazz a little bit, you probably have heard Naima before.

438
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,742
So this is a riff, a take on Naima.

439
01:11:50,802 --> 01:11:53,403
It's called Reprise for Naima.

440
01:11:58,103 --> 01:12:01,224
He would blow this note in the midnight air.

441
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:05,505
Aloft in the ether, it floats out there.

442
01:12:05,525 --> 01:12:10,506
Staccato cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude.

443
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:22,989
Improvisational mystery, like Monk's piano episcophy, or Miles' tone poem in a silent way, or Flanagan's piece at the end of the day.

444
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:34,911
Syncopated in sharp, bright tone, a countdown decides us, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace and out of sight.

445
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:48,995
With heartland crooning or bags-on vibes, trios, duets, quartets, and tribes, the blues, the ballads, the avant-garde, incredibly gorgeous, impossibly hard.

446
01:12:52,575 --> 01:12:54,616
Giant steps move us miles ahead.

447
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,917
Cooking up bar for Harlem street cred.

448
01:12:57,237 --> 01:12:59,058
Melodies hand to the harmony wed.

449
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:01,239
Pianos lullaby fresh in the bed.

450
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:03,280
Rhythm rocks with a drum of lead.

451
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,601
Rhythm rolls in the bass man's bed.

452
01:13:05,621 --> 01:13:07,943
Rhythm burns with the saxophone bread.

453
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:10,724
Rhythm heard what the master said.

454
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,063
How could he make the bitter taste sweeter?

455
01:13:17,244 --> 01:13:19,467
How could a tortured mind deleter?

456
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:21,791
How could the mellow scotch be neater?

457
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:26,819
How could the smoke from each cigarette create blue beads that cast an edge?

458
01:14:30,087 --> 01:14:37,471
A velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent riff of a lover's dream.

459
01:14:38,191 --> 01:14:44,815
Coltrane's notes are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance of laughter.

460
01:14:51,742 --> 01:15:04,592
Coltrane's notes are a sample divine, like gold in a can of gemstone mine, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffins with a hint of green.

461
01:15:04,612 --> 01:15:14,801
Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes from lover's pride, the gladness

462
01:15:35,057 --> 01:15:38,182
The harmonious spirit engulfs the room.

463
01:15:38,202 --> 01:15:40,065
The bride says yes to her lyrical groom.

464
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:42,869
The groove and the beat is in just the broom.

465
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,994
The tip drum resounds with a sonic boom.

466
01:15:57,792 --> 01:16:02,316
Musical mythology, a twisted path, a hero walk.

467
01:16:02,436 --> 01:16:04,678
With shield and sword, the hero starts.

468
01:16:04,998 --> 01:16:06,820
The different shapes are twisted locks.

469
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,682
Medusa's snake, his vision chopped.

470
01:16:09,702 --> 01:16:11,684
The poles of the mirror in stony blocks.

471
01:16:12,124 --> 01:16:14,406
The harp and the horn melt icy rocks.

472
01:16:27,652 --> 01:16:37,780
Coltrane's notes are a rollercoaster, a hallelujah and a kalinosa, a glorious note from the maestro's hand.

473
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:44,666
The saxophone titan is in command.

474
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:49,250
Coltrane's notes are a crazy rhythm, a swap of chords in place of schism, the frenetic pace of Mr.

475
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,333
P.C., the coolest round midnight will ever be.

476
01:16:54,681 --> 01:17:08,586
Coltrane's notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a lover's dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

477
01:17:09,586 --> 01:17:20,750
Coltrane's notes are naive as reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part,

478
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:26,048
in the balladeer's heart.

479
01:17:30,669 --> 01:17:31,149
Thank you.

480
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:33,010
Thank you very much.

481
01:17:34,871 --> 01:17:35,771
All right, all right.

482
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:39,172
So we're going to stay, we're going to stay on the jazz frontier for a minute.

483
01:17:39,772 --> 01:17:50,376
And Herbie Hancock and later Quincy Jones, they did a tune, Quincy covered it.

484
01:17:50,856 --> 01:17:52,937
Herbie Hancock did it first and it's called

485
01:17:53,656 --> 01:17:54,997
Tell Me A Bedtime Story.

486
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:59,680
So we do a little riff on Tell Me A Bedtime Story.

487
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,922
It's called Tell Me Another Bedtime Story.

488
01:18:03,502 --> 01:18:03,862
All right?

489
01:18:04,883 --> 01:18:07,304
It's just a sweet little jazz ditty, OK?

490
01:18:54,015 --> 01:18:55,756
and reducing the pain?

491
01:18:56,596 --> 01:19:02,058
Is this where we fly to never, never land, like the troop of lost boys with Peter Pan?

492
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,422
All of the mystery of hidden dreams, nothing now is ever seen.

493
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:17,525
For the sweet tale that sugars and creams, with flashes of stardust and shining moonbeams.

494
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:28,207
Let there be a hint of romance.

495
01:19:28,247 --> 01:19:31,352
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance.

496
01:19:56,365 --> 01:20:06,900
Tell me a bedtime story, please, of secret gardens and pecan trees, of babbling brooks and waterfalls, of gentle breezes that summer calls.

497
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:41,328
Tell me a fable of Arabian nights Spread on a table of earthly delights Free from the label of anger and spite Willing and able to scale higher heights

498
01:21:03,763 --> 01:21:23,664
The baby rocks in the maple bough As the blue ox puts his nose to the plough And the sweaty farmer wipes his brow As each green seedling happily bows To yield each fruit the ground allows And seven dwarfs whistle a happy tune And sleeping beauty awakens soon

499
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:33,986
Let there be a melody that sings in four part harmony.

500
01:21:34,026 --> 01:21:35,148
Let it resound.

501
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:27,456
This is the time when the sandman whispers and seven brooms meet seven sisters and the prairie sings an ode to love as the angels release the turtle dove.

502
01:22:29,037 --> 01:22:35,845
For now, I lay me down to sleep and pray to God, my soul to keep.

503
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:43,834
Jonathan Bacon on the keys.

504
01:22:45,475 --> 01:22:46,756
Ray Carroll on the bass.

505
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:50,439
Did you hear that?

506
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,100
You heard that, right?

507
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:55,143
All right, let's go with the angle down on the drums.

508
01:22:55,723 --> 01:22:56,183
All right.

509
01:22:57,044 --> 01:22:58,045
Woo!

510
01:22:59,466 --> 01:23:00,827
All right, so listen.

511
01:23:01,427 --> 01:23:05,590
We're going to the intersection of jazz and social justice, all right?

512
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:11,655
All right, and when I say we ain't playing, we ain't playing, but we're playing.

513
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:19,957
okay all right so we ain't playing okay this is called alienation

514
01:23:38,982 --> 01:24:02,517
here is a fence without a gate you can't get in you have to wait you can't be foreign or somehow strange this isn't your home home on the range you can't arrive in a rickety boat our castle has a treacherous moat we won't hold refugees at our door you're not the soul we're looking for take good note we stay on guard we don't want you in our

515
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:08,633
Despite the danger you seek to avoid, our best deterrents have been deployed.

516
01:24:09,553 --> 01:24:12,055
You say our country's full of peril.

517
01:24:12,475 --> 01:24:15,857
But like stray cats, we think you're feral.

518
01:24:15,897 --> 01:24:17,478
We think you're prone to filthy crime.

519
01:24:17,578 --> 01:24:21,040
We don't want fear at this time.

520
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,561
We don't care what the neighbors say.

521
01:24:23,581 --> 01:24:25,402
They won't do more than hope and pray.

522
01:24:25,422 --> 01:24:26,983
Our stance is clear.

523
01:24:34,893 --> 01:24:36,715
You saw that statue in the bank.

524
01:24:36,735 --> 01:24:39,218
It stood for liberty until today.

525
01:24:39,718 --> 01:24:44,264
It welcomed tired and huddled masses, not criminals from your underclass.

526
01:24:45,365 --> 01:24:47,007
We've got militias on the border.

527
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:49,429
They own big guns to keep the order.

528
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:54,295
Law enforcement lets them stay to help them keep your kind at bay.

529
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,023
Why do we feel that this is good?

530
01:25:03,383 --> 01:25:05,264
Why can't we share the neighborhood?

531
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:07,526
Is it because you're black and brown?

532
01:25:07,606 --> 01:25:10,327
No, we just choose to stand our ground.

533
01:25:10,828 --> 01:25:11,468
Stay in your place.

534
01:25:11,728 --> 01:25:12,549
Deal with your issues.

535
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:14,810
We'll send lots of coal and tissues.

536
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,411
Don't form caravans and run.

537
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:19,933
You'll find yourself in the sights

538
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:27,353
There are no streets here lined with old.

539
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:29,535
Our eyes are closed, our hearts are old.

540
01:25:29,575 --> 01:25:31,677
There is no flowing milk and honey.

541
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:35,261
American skies are not that sunny.

542
01:25:36,322 --> 01:25:40,566
The fences we build keep aliens out.

543
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:43,228
They serve to keep our faith devout.

544
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:48,013
This land we scheme to make our own is ours, you see, and ours alone.

545
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:53,152
As long as you stay on the other side, we can maintain our national pride.

546
01:25:53,332 --> 01:25:55,812
Please don't show us your anguished faces.

547
01:25:56,553 --> 01:25:59,634
We're cutting back on other races.

548
01:26:03,255 --> 01:26:05,276
We've had enough of global inclusion.

549
01:26:05,616 --> 01:26:07,677
We're ridding this country of race confusion.

550
01:26:08,117 --> 01:26:11,178
We know how to win these fights and limit all

551
01:26:13,595 --> 01:26:18,879
Safety nets and the welfare state will have to stop for the lost and late.

552
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:22,321
A rising tide that favors the rich.

553
01:26:22,361 --> 01:26:27,045
That's our famous favorite campaign pitch.

554
01:26:27,065 --> 01:26:31,968
Me Too movements and Black Lives Matter and all due time your ranks will scatter.

555
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:34,790
You think that you shall overcome?

556
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,591
Just cross this line.

557
01:26:36,871 --> 01:26:37,832
We'll give you some.

558
01:26:40,234 --> 01:26:41,875
We'll give you a taste of burning church.

559
01:26:42,451 --> 01:26:44,494
and black boys hunts for folks and virgins.

560
01:26:45,114 --> 01:26:50,501
We'll give you a taste of incarceration in prison.com, the corporate plantation.

561
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:11,428
We're taking this country back to the day when white men write in every way, when men are privileged to rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat.

562
01:27:11,828 --> 01:27:23,535
We're taking this homeland back to the season when hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods of swamp and bog.

563
01:27:26,713 --> 01:27:38,139
where confederate flags were both raised and crosses in the darkest place and the land was full of racial hate served with grits on a breakfast plate

564
01:27:41,045 --> 01:27:45,988
You thought this worm had surely turned, and young black bodies no longer burned.

565
01:27:46,489 --> 01:27:51,533
Yet here you are again today, with the specter of prejudice winning the day.

566
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:56,756
The MAGA cap you wear with pride, they let us know who's on your side.

567
01:27:56,776 --> 01:28:01,240
The pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe.

568
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:12,447
Perhaps this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it.

569
01:28:12,807 --> 01:28:17,870
Until that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price.

570
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:23,714
You'll pay a price as many misguided people embrace the hate their voice provides.

571
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:30,158
His Twitter rants and soundbites full of ethnocentric, cock and bull.

572
01:28:37,606 --> 01:28:49,892
You'll pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls, where fences are the new condition, announcing the refugees' abolition.

573
01:28:52,052 --> 01:28:57,135
This isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist powers.

574
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:02,197
And yet, the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've

575
01:29:07,056 --> 01:29:11,441
So take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard.

576
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:16,807
Our agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this island.

577
01:29:17,848 --> 01:29:19,470
Tolerance is in short supply.

578
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:24,396
We won't let your kind occupy this sacred land our forebears built.

579
01:29:24,516 --> 01:29:27,179
We don't subscribe to Anglo guilt.

580
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:34,026
This fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late.

581
01:29:34,527 --> 01:29:38,132
To all you aliens, we don't like strange.

582
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:43,740
No room at the inn in our home on the range.

583
01:29:56,955 --> 01:30:00,698
Hard truth, admittedly, but truth nonetheless.

584
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:08,604
All right, so we're gonna stay there for a minute, and then we'll try and ease up off of your feelings.

585
01:30:10,225 --> 01:30:16,229
This piece is called The Ally, and it's actually kind of the eponym for our project.

586
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:19,212
So we're gonna do Ally for you.

587
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:34,542
Friends become distant and strange, as if you have some creeping mane.

588
01:30:35,242 --> 01:30:38,225
Family wonders why and brings their hands.

589
01:30:38,245 --> 01:30:40,447
How could you choose them over us?

590
01:30:41,048 --> 01:30:44,431
We're your blood, bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh.

591
01:30:44,831 --> 01:30:46,012
They're not like us.

592
01:30:46,993 --> 01:30:51,598
They're so different, less than, not equal to, beneath.

593
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:54,134
Declarations have been made.

594
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:55,676
Arrangements are in place.

595
01:30:55,696 --> 01:30:58,138
These are matters of our kin.

596
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,080
Signs have been painted.

597
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:01,621
You're going to be cast out.

598
01:31:01,842 --> 01:31:03,343
You're going to be shunned.

599
01:31:03,783 --> 01:31:06,506
You need to stick with your own kind.

600
01:31:19,034 --> 01:31:21,016
Well, it's a hard road to hoe.

601
01:31:21,457 --> 01:31:23,119
You're making strange bed pillows.

602
01:31:23,139 --> 01:31:25,982
You're casting your white pearls in full swine.

603
01:31:26,323 --> 01:31:28,846
You weren't raised to behave like this.

604
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:32,872
Our family is a proud and honored clan.

605
01:31:33,192 --> 01:31:35,913
We'll never be lower than any black man.

606
01:31:35,973 --> 01:31:38,593
There's no room for them at this table.

607
01:31:39,174 --> 01:31:41,314
There's always been two sides of the track.

608
01:31:41,534 --> 01:31:44,455
The right and wrong side of time.

609
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:47,236
Our kind and their kind.

610
01:31:47,296 --> 01:31:48,816
Your people and those folks.

611
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,837
It's gonna kill your mother and your daddy.

612
01:32:01,948 --> 01:32:06,229
You can't be out there with them.

613
01:32:07,269 --> 01:32:15,831
You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to

614
01:32:29,017 --> 01:32:29,597
Dominate.

615
01:32:30,257 --> 01:32:30,878
Relegate.

616
01:32:31,118 --> 01:32:32,238
Subjugate.

617
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:33,898
Eliminate.

618
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,780
They want reparations.

619
01:32:41,461 --> 01:32:45,662
Well, we're making preparations to give them 40 acres of hell and a mule kick to the gut.

620
01:32:45,742 --> 01:32:47,582
You don't seem to get it, son.

621
01:32:48,023 --> 01:32:49,803
This is the way the races run.

622
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:52,684
There's not enough room for everyone.

623
01:32:53,264 --> 01:32:56,245
The time for black and brown is done.

624
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,926
You can't be out there with them.

625
01:33:06,386 --> 01:33:17,013
You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

626
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:22,880
do

627
01:38:25,054 --> 01:38:27,016
All right, yeah.

628
01:38:27,616 --> 01:38:29,277
All right, all right.

629
01:38:30,378 --> 01:38:32,059
Once again, the Allied Carpet.

630
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:36,303
Jonathan Fagan, Greg Toro, Dwayne Englegar, and Terry Carter.

631
01:38:36,623 --> 01:38:39,225
Too cool, these bros got me sweating out here.

632
01:38:39,785 --> 01:38:40,566
Got me sweating.

633
01:38:41,487 --> 01:38:46,250
All right, okay, so we're at a couple of different spots, and then we're gonna finish up.

634
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:49,793
But let's do something nice and mellow.

635
01:38:49,813 --> 01:38:52,015
This is called Legacy, okay?

636
01:39:02,412 --> 01:39:03,494
Everybody enjoying themselves?

637
01:39:03,714 --> 01:39:04,576
Alright.

638
01:39:05,056 --> 01:39:06,238
I know it's warm out there.

639
01:39:08,482 --> 01:39:11,667
But you're braving the elements and enjoying the day, hopefully.

640
01:39:12,829 --> 01:39:13,650
Very, very good.

641
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,921
that is the burden of your children.

642
01:39:46,961 --> 01:39:50,162
They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.

643
01:39:51,462 --> 01:39:57,825
And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

644
01:39:58,765 --> 01:40:03,527
You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name.

645
01:40:05,407 --> 01:40:08,748
How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?

646
01:40:08,929 --> 01:40:12,930
How will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out

647
01:40:36,357 --> 01:40:45,000
Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

648
01:40:46,101 --> 01:40:53,284
If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's girthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.

649
01:40:54,464 --> 01:41:02,587
If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark and stoke the flame, you don't know.

650
01:41:05,509 --> 01:41:11,365
And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride story, the hunters will always tell them first.

651
01:41:21,025 --> 01:41:23,647
book says, train up the child in the way they should go.

652
01:41:24,468 --> 01:41:36,918
Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on the hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

653
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:45,005
Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journeys?

654
01:41:49,555 --> 01:41:51,276
the wonders of Wakanda.

655
01:41:51,716 --> 01:41:53,057
And San Pololo grew tacky.

656
01:41:53,117 --> 01:41:57,780
The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.

657
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:02,262
But how will they know the way home if no map charts the scene?

658
01:42:02,322 --> 01:42:12,147
Measures the roads, sites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees.

659
01:42:14,429 --> 01:42:18,131
Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?

660
01:42:18,977 --> 01:42:20,398
Will they care to carry?

661
01:42:20,898 --> 01:42:22,779
Will they dare to tarry?

662
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,381
Will they linger at the foot of the tree?

663
01:42:26,481 --> 01:42:30,043
Or will they hunger for the wisdom of the saints?

664
01:42:31,344 --> 01:42:42,750
We must put them on this page, where hard work turns a man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, with miracles scarfed at the wand of a maid.

665
01:42:52,484 --> 01:43:07,267
that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional boot, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.

666
01:43:10,027 --> 01:43:18,589
This is the gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captors free, and the candle's light beckons liberty.

667
01:43:22,773 --> 01:43:37,102
I think you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.

668
01:43:37,122 --> 01:43:49,630
They will show you a Nazi's clever ways, hopeful and contagious journeys, for Pharaoh's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly the wonders of Lusanda, and Sanga Lolo's new tactics,

669
01:43:53,607 --> 01:43:55,911
Soon you will be the herald.

670
01:43:55,991 --> 01:43:59,798
Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.

671
01:44:00,419 --> 01:44:03,725
Let them put a running in your feet.

672
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:12,311
With each quickening step, you repel the arrows of the hunter.

673
01:44:12,731 --> 01:44:19,172
With the shield of abiding faith, you capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.

674
01:44:19,972 --> 01:44:29,994
You remain the lions of the pride and your tales will always be your children's prayers.

675
01:44:30,835 --> 01:44:33,875
You will never abandon the community of faith.

676
01:44:34,575 --> 01:44:37,516
Though you build a thousand cities on a hill,

677
01:44:45,174 --> 01:44:52,698
fills your clay jars with his grace.

678
01:44:52,998 --> 01:44:55,960
Thank you.

679
01:44:57,521 --> 01:44:58,722
Alright, so

680
01:45:01,432 --> 01:45:04,816
Quite a while ago, it was either my first or my second book.

681
01:45:04,856 --> 01:45:07,920
Speaking of first and second books, I've got books up there.

682
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:13,066
There's actually a Allied Project CD, for those of you who still have a CD player.

683
01:45:14,247 --> 01:45:17,631
And it's got a lot of our music on it, so if you're interested, it's up there.

684
01:45:17,972 --> 01:45:20,314
We also have a CD player.

685
01:45:21,536 --> 01:45:31,264
Jazz Festival t-shirts, which are lovely, and our food venue, the Danish Pastry House, will still be here after we leave.

686
01:45:31,304 --> 01:45:41,994
So if you didn't get a snack, and you wanna get one, come back and sit out under the tent and talk, or however the move hits ya, it's all there, still there for you.

687
01:45:42,514 --> 01:45:42,854
All right?

688
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:46,838
Okay, so I think we're gonna do two more, and then we're gonna be done.

689
01:45:47,588 --> 01:45:48,208
All right, so.

690
01:45:49,609 --> 01:45:52,450
I love that, I love that, I love that.

691
01:45:53,071 --> 01:45:53,731
I love that.

692
01:45:53,871 --> 01:45:58,253
If it's not fake, if you're faking it, don't do it.

693
01:45:58,293 --> 01:46:03,075
But if it's, oh, okay, I love it, okay.

694
01:46:03,135 --> 01:46:05,136
What are you doing?

695
01:46:06,257 --> 01:46:07,497
Oh, we're doing Bobby, okay.

696
01:46:08,078 --> 01:46:09,598
All right, so a while back,

697
01:46:11,703 --> 01:46:14,344
like on one of my early books, I think it was the second one.

698
01:46:15,004 --> 01:46:19,705
I have a painting in my house, it's called, what's it called, T?

699
01:46:19,805 --> 01:46:22,565
Oh, it's called Barbie Doesn't Live Here.

700
01:46:22,965 --> 01:46:34,568
And basically what it is is my attempt, my humble painting attempt to kind of depict black women in all shapes and sizes because they come in all shapes and sizes.

701
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:36,648
And there may be one or two of them who are

702
01:46:37,028 --> 01:46:46,710
very, very narrow and somewhat Barbie-like, somewhat Angel Reese-like, but for the most part, it runs the gamut.

703
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:53,651
So I wrote this poem called Barbie Doesn't Live Here to go with that piece of artwork.

704
01:46:54,592 --> 01:47:01,453
And every once in a while, you revisit a piece of poetry and you say, well, what could I have done differently, or what could I have said differently?

705
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:07,985
So I had this notion, and it came out like this, and it's called If Barbie Had a Choice.

706
01:47:39,905 --> 01:47:40,926
Barbie had a choice.

707
01:47:41,606 --> 01:47:45,548
I believe that from day one, she would have made it a black thing.

708
01:47:46,368 --> 01:47:51,191
She would have ditched the cream-sickened skin and gone with a lustrous ebony hue.

709
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:59,775
She would have spoken in an evil dialect with a true queen's attitude and said, to hell with you pollinators.

710
01:47:59,875 --> 01:48:05,938
Package me up in a pink box with white lettering and a bunch of beachy palms and sand in the background.

711
01:48:11,748 --> 01:48:15,369
Curvaceous hip into that goldie lawn, psychedelic mini.

712
01:48:16,729 --> 01:48:19,710
I'ma need a little something more substantial.

713
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:27,631
I'ma need coach's yards of single-eased cotton with shiny petite totems and all the colors of the motherland.

714
01:48:27,971 --> 01:48:35,613
I'ma need a Wakanda seamstress straight out of the Ruth Potter school to hook the thing up right and show the world what I'm working for.

715
01:48:35,673 --> 01:48:40,114
I'ma need a mane in Dahomey, not by Mattel and Disney.

716
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:47,753
If Bobby had a choice, Ken would've looked more like Ali or Denzel.

717
01:48:48,073 --> 01:48:51,595
Or that fine-ass, dark-chocolate British cat, Delirious Alba.

718
01:48:51,895 --> 01:48:55,237
He would've been melanated, not barely suntanned.

719
01:48:55,577 --> 01:49:03,201
And by no means would he have seen more holiday tissue wrap and 150-grit sandpaper.

720
01:49:03,281 --> 01:49:06,283
He would've been swashbuckling like Marv or T'Challa.

721
01:49:06,303 --> 01:49:10,525
Woke like Tupac and standing on business like Brother Malcolm.

722
01:49:26,589 --> 01:49:36,133
She would have kissed that man with unretouched, un-botoxed black girl lips, lush and full as a tropic rainforest.

723
01:49:36,353 --> 01:49:44,397
She would have engulfed her man in every quaking itch of the last poet's black thighs.

724
01:49:44,437 --> 01:49:46,518
If you don't know it, YouTube it.

725
01:49:46,578 --> 01:49:54,482
She would have no need of a Brazilian butler, a Beverly Hills school job, or an Adobe Photoshop session.

726
01:49:55,835 --> 01:50:06,583
Mother Africa in a generous genome took care of all of that, you feel me?

727
01:50:06,743 --> 01:50:12,828
If Barbie had a choice, you would never have been able to buy her at Toys R Us, F.A.O.

728
01:50:12,848 --> 01:50:14,169
Schwartz or Mary Arnold.

729
01:50:14,589 --> 01:50:19,272
She wouldn't have been a fake trophy bride, a chick on the side, or a Bonnie for five.

730
01:50:19,473 --> 01:50:21,354
She wouldn't have been American Girl Addie,

731
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:30,072
It girl Margot Robbie, or Cherry Pie's Bobby, or a P. Diddy Harvey.

732
01:50:31,192 --> 01:50:37,774
I'ma close the flow with a few more rhymes, just a few bronze bars to end this on time.

733
01:50:39,734 --> 01:50:42,675
A new newbie in Barbie wouldn't stand for nonsense.

734
01:50:43,356 --> 01:50:45,516
A brother's pursuit couldn't sit on the fence.

735
01:50:45,836 --> 01:50:47,977
Her womanly wiles would truly be immense.

736
01:50:48,677 --> 01:50:54,139
A player would just bind her game to a tense, but never a true shot that loves record pace.

737
01:50:55,534 --> 01:51:02,758
Though he might pull up in a Bentley or Rolls, he'd lose by a landslide at a Rio Queen's pole.

738
01:51:03,619 --> 01:51:06,700
A new Nubian Barbie would demand that mistake.

739
01:51:06,721 --> 01:51:09,282
She wouldn't suffer the guilt or neglect.

740
01:51:09,302 --> 01:51:12,304
She'd fight for her own like a Goji elite.

741
01:51:12,324 --> 01:51:16,106
She wouldn't be tamed, demure, or petite.

742
01:51:24,635 --> 01:51:53,388
Things would be different on this I may bet A pimp or a hustler would not be a threat As fine as the print on the national deck Her beauty and wisdom would not break a sweat That glitzy white Barbie might have the toy jet But she hasn't landed a soul plane yet My African queen makes the real king spaghetti Though she might wanna keep that fly pink Corvette

743
01:51:58,675 --> 01:51:59,395
I want to keep that.

744
01:52:00,876 --> 01:52:01,256
All right.

745
01:52:02,036 --> 01:52:18,540
OK, so we're going to end where we begin, and that's with family, because everybody here, everybody who's here, you know, and I so appreciate, we so appreciate everyone who has braved the heat, because we know it's out there to be here with us.

746
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,141
So let's see if I can hopefully find it.

747
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:31,327
Okay, good All right, so

748
01:52:46,162 --> 01:52:55,808
I know that a lot of stuff that I've said today and that we've played today, you know, strikes different chords and resonates differently with everybody.

749
01:52:56,588 --> 01:53:06,054
But this particular poem, maybe like The Little Store, really, really is gonna bring back an image of the way that your home looked at some point in time.

750
01:53:06,394 --> 01:53:11,998
I can almost guarantee it doesn't matter where you came from, what ethnicity, what background,

751
01:53:13,143 --> 01:53:33,384
At some point in time my prayer my hope is that your Home look like this at some point and hopefully still does this piece is called kitchen table home Nobody ever wants to leave there like the blueberry stains on mama's apron

752
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:35,811
Settled, satisfied.

753
01:53:36,211 --> 01:53:38,112
Good food has been eaten.

754
01:53:38,192 --> 01:53:40,033
Fresh corn and collard greens.

755
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:42,094
Fried chicken and potato salad.

756
01:53:42,574 --> 01:53:46,556
Bellies are fat and full.

757
01:53:46,677 --> 01:53:47,617
This is that room.

758
01:53:48,297 --> 01:53:51,779
Oh my God, and girl, and are you serious right now?

759
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,520
It's real talk.

760
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:54,861
We're real people.

761
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:56,762
Family, you know what I'm saying?

762
01:53:57,442 --> 01:53:59,903
We're family.

763
01:53:59,963 --> 01:54:03,145
You can smell the love long before the door opens.

764
01:54:03,872 --> 01:54:05,854
You know there's gonna be pecan pie.

765
01:54:06,414 --> 01:54:09,136
And the sweet tea will be ice cold.

766
01:54:09,957 --> 01:54:12,759
Southern folk will slip out of their northerness.

767
01:54:12,959 --> 01:54:18,763
Accents will thicken and the country shade will feel closer to the city center.

768
01:54:18,963 --> 01:54:20,304
And they'll stay at that table.

769
01:54:20,885 --> 01:54:24,187
Long after the crumbs are cleared, the dishes will be all washed.

770
01:54:24,207 --> 01:54:28,490
The food will be put away or packed in tupperware in ziplock totes.

771
01:54:28,771 --> 01:54:31,913
Everyone will have a doggie bag and a story to tell.

772
01:54:36,562 --> 01:54:42,443
down dominoes, sipping on a little something something and talking big trash.

773
01:54:42,543 --> 01:54:46,604
The smiles will be broad and the laughter will be contagious.

774
01:54:47,585 --> 01:54:50,085
The women will be fanning and fussing.

775
01:54:50,665 --> 01:54:53,066
Good Lord, she know she too big for that dress.

776
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:55,747
That ain't no Sunday saved outfit.

777
01:54:56,027 --> 01:54:58,087
That's for Saturday night sinning.

778
01:54:58,127 --> 01:54:59,488
You know I'm right, girl.

779
01:54:59,568 --> 01:55:02,668
You know I'm right.

780
01:55:02,788 --> 01:55:04,989
Nobody ever wants to leave.

781
01:55:05,908 --> 01:55:11,792
They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old print, loving and consistent.

782
01:55:11,872 --> 01:55:13,633
Soul food has been shared.

783
01:55:13,893 --> 01:55:19,717
Our gene has prayed down heaven and the baby sang their song.

784
01:55:19,957 --> 01:55:23,160
Everyone's tickled and tranquil.

785
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:27,503
This is that room.

786
01:55:28,243 --> 01:55:29,344
I really miss pap.

787
01:55:31,205 --> 01:55:33,106
His baby boy's cancer and remission.

788
01:55:34,027 --> 01:55:35,588
And when you coming back to church,

789
01:55:36,985 --> 01:55:37,845
It's real talk.

790
01:55:38,526 --> 01:55:40,087
We're real people.

791
01:55:40,387 --> 01:55:40,887
Family.

792
01:55:41,467 --> 01:55:42,388
You know what I'm saying?

793
01:55:43,168 --> 01:55:46,130
We're family.

794
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:49,051
The Ally Project, ladies and gentlemen.

795
01:55:50,252 --> 01:55:51,913
Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

796
01:55:53,153 --> 01:55:54,414
Greg Currow on the bass.

797
01:55:56,196 --> 01:55:57,077
He's on the run, man.

798
01:55:57,097 --> 01:55:59,241
He's actually got a wedding to play in a little while.

799
01:55:59,281 --> 01:55:59,861
Here's my man.

800
01:56:00,462 --> 01:56:01,624
All right.

801
01:56:02,165 --> 01:56:02,706
Check this out.

802
01:56:02,726 --> 01:56:03,647
He's a road warrior.

803
01:56:03,687 --> 01:56:07,933
He's going to get in his little whip, and he's going to go down to Connecticut to play a wedding.

804
01:56:08,695 --> 01:56:09,135
All right.

805
01:56:09,716 --> 01:56:10,718
And then my man.

806
01:56:11,842 --> 01:56:14,462
The one, the only, Gordon Angle guy on the drums.

807
01:56:15,163 --> 01:56:16,783
All right.

808
01:56:16,823 --> 01:56:19,043
We are the Ally Project.

She won't be here, but her students will and they can go.

812
01:56:41,484 --> 01:56:52,935
One of her drummers, a young woman by the name of Ivana Cuesta, is going to be leading that effort, and she's what Terry Lynn Carrington was at 22, 23 years old.
