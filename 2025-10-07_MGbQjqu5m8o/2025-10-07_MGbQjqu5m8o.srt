1
00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:07,277
This first song was by Carlos Vieira, one of the, you know,

2
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,976
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of bossa nova so if it's too late forgive me that's the title i'll try to translate not

3
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:41,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good on that, but I think you're gonna get a little bit of, you know, about what I'm singing.

4
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:44,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So this next piece is like influence of the jazz.

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So jazz influence, so it's about like the song that also by Tom's leader, about like the influence of jazz and samba.

6
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:03,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like you're talking about samba has this, but jazz has that, and you know, you're gonna see how it goes.

7
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:20,058
[SPEAKER_02]: foreign

8
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:46,896
[SPEAKER_02]: The one who died was dying, he's almost dying, he didn't realize.

9
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:50,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And Zamba goes from one side to the other.

10
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:52,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz is different, forward and backward.

11
00:01:53,037 --> 00:02:00,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And Zamba is kind of dumb, kind of stupid, he's a jazz fluency.

12
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And the world goes on, complicating it, the world goes on.

13
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on twisting, it goes on without rest, it goes on, it goes on.

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,921
[SPEAKER_02]: foreign

15
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:07,640

[SPEAKER_02]: foreign

17
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:23,979
[SPEAKER_02]: He died and ended up dying.

18
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,121
[SPEAKER_02]: He came home and died without realizing it.

19
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:32,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a swing from one side to the other.

20
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz is different back and forth.

21
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:39,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also the world that ate so much influence from jazz.

22
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:48,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And the world keeps on turning, it keeps on complicating, it keeps on spinning, it keeps on twisting, it keeps on resting.

23
00:05:50,008 --> 00:06:14,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Balanço do top, samba meu Volta lá pro bolo e faz o soco aonde nasceu Pra não ser um samba com notas demais Não ser um samba torto pra frente e pra trás Vai ter que se virar pra poder se livrar Vai ter que se virar pra poder se livrar da influência do...

24
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this next piece is, you might know, it's a wave.

25
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:58,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do.

26
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:45,483
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time was the city The second was eternity Now I already know The wave that followed the sea And the stars that we forgot to count Let's stop suffering While the night comes to envelop us I'll tell you

[SPEAKER_02]: Things that only the heart can understand.

29
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible to be happy alone.

30
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest is all I don't know how to tell.

31
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:11,484
[SPEAKER_02]: They're crazy things.

32
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from a sign that tells me it's impossible to be happy alone.

33
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,083
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time was in the city.

34
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:37,186
[SPEAKER_02]: The second time was in eternity.

35
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:39,348
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a story I already know.

00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:19,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Today she says yes.

151
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:20,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired of waiting.

152
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't stop, I didn't even sleep.

153
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:27,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking about leaving.

154
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:30,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I pass by, but you don't come.

155
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:30,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Come.

156
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:34,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me speak, just tell me if you come.

157
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,362
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, love, I've never seen anything like it.

158
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:44,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It went by, it didn't stop, but look at me.

159
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:48,306
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come back, I'll go back, I'll ask for love again.

160
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:52,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll confess that love was a little fart to give.

161
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:59,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it's like a hot summer heart.

162
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:03,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It suddenly jumps to see the next girl.

163
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,397
[SPEAKER_02]: She must be pretending.

164
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:13,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see, I have to be, there's no one to love.

165
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:16,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I know, I forgot, I'm tired of waiting.

166
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:20,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't stop, I didn't sleep, just thinking about life.

167
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:23,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask, but you don't come.

168
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:24,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Come.

169
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:27,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I let go, I speak, I only think about you, but you don't come.

170
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:48,489
do do

171
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:22,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And you saw that the girl of your victory didn't pass, didn't stop, but looked only at me.

172
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:27,348
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go back, I'll go back, I'll come back, I'll tell you that love was a little temptation.

173
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:31,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it's like summer, who has a heart, just to suddenly stop.

174
00:39:49,388 --> 00:40:05,533
[SPEAKER_02]: ♪ Deixa então, falo só, digo ao céu, mas você vem ♪ ♪ Deixa então, falo só, digo ao céu, mas você vem ♪ ♪ Deixa então, falo só, digo ao céu, mas você vem ♪

175
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do the Bolero one.

176
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he likes the Bolero one.

177
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:38,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that.

178
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:40,251
[SPEAKER_02]: This is by Dorival Caymmi.

179
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,752
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another song about love.

180
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:51,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do the Bolero one.

181
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:54,254
Oh my God.

182
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:55,255
Nice, nice.

183
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:56,135
I like that.

184
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:21,526
[SPEAKER_02]: No fazes favorinho em gostar de alguém Nem eu, nem eu, nem eu Quem inventou o amor não fui eu, não fui eu

185
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:47,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And with an important coincidence, my dear, from our lives to life, your toy came too.

186
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:17,400
[SPEAKER_02]: In Costa del Rio, de Rio.

187
00:42:48,647 --> 00:43:04,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Estavas desprevida E por acaso eu também E como acaso a importante e querida De nossas vidas a vida Fez seu brinquedo também

188
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:24,376
[SPEAKER_02]: No fazes favor nenhum em gostar de alguém Nem eu, nem eu, nem eu Que inventou o amor

189
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: is

190
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:39,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Inventor of love.

191
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't me.

192
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,913
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't me.

193
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:44,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't me.

194
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:50,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't me or anyone.

195
00:46:07,302 --> 00:46:10,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

196
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:14,025
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the song that we can spend the whole day singing at the same time, right?

197
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:14,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.

198
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:15,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that.

199
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:15,845
[SPEAKER_02]: One more?

200
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:17,446
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

201
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:21,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, such a pleasure to be here in Medford.

202
00:46:22,568 --> 00:46:26,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And with you guys, such a great audience, special.

203
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:30,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you a lot for everyone who invited us.

204
00:46:31,011 --> 00:46:33,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I can't remember everyone's name.

205
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:34,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too early.

206
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:37,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you again for inviting us.

207
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,055
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna do the last song.

208
00:46:39,115 --> 00:46:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, what's the best for the last song?

209
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:42,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Bêbado.

210
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:46,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do it.

211
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, do you know this one?

212
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:49,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Bêbado.

213
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:55,406
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this is another João Bosco song, so here we go.

214
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:56,166
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of energy, high notes.

215
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:56,707
[SPEAKER_02]: You all right?

216
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:08,536
[SPEAKER_02]: oh wow

217
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,933
[SPEAKER_02]: O Brasil, meu Brasil.

218
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:46,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Me sonha com a volta do irmão, do filho, com tanta gente que partiu.

219
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Um rabo de boquete chora.

220
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,504
[SPEAKER_02]: A nossa pátria mãe gentil.

221
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Choro maria e zingare

222
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:01,533
[SPEAKER_02]: foreign

223
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:49,492
[SPEAKER_02]: a few words, Greg Torell, and enough about my music, my name is Linda Gordon.

224
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:52,253
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be playing West Peak in Harvard Square.

225
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:54,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you more if you ask.

226
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:59,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

227
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,060
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, this is West Medford, don't be stingy.

228
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Resheta De Samba, Villabuda on piano.

229
00:51:06,423 --> 00:51:08,764
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of gorgeous on vocals.

230
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:09,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg Torell on bass.

231
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:17,839
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

232
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very good.

233
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:26,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're going to take a little pause for the pause while we get set up for our act two.

234
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:28,889
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

235
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:29,609
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

236
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody.

237
00:51:33,793 --> 00:51:34,273
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

238
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:37,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a beautiful first step.

239
00:51:37,116 --> 00:51:39,098
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that the ensemble was marvelous.

240
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:41,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really good.

241
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully we will

242
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:50,925
[SPEAKER_03]: at least meet if not exceed your expectations for the second part of our program today.

243
00:51:52,355 --> 00:52:02,084
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who don't know me or who I haven't had a chance to meet yet, my name is Terry Carter, Terry E. My mother says use the initial, that's why I gave it to you.

244
00:52:02,144 --> 00:52:05,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's Terry E. Carter, E stands for Eugene.

245
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:09,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And I direct elder services here at the community center.

246
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:16,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna talk a lot, but I do want you to know just a little bit about, we've been in business for 90 years.

247
00:52:17,649 --> 00:52:21,410
[SPEAKER_03]: representing the historic African-American community of West Medford.

248
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:24,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the second building on the site.

249
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:38,816
[SPEAKER_03]: The first building was little more than an old Army Quonset hut that was brought here from the Army base in East Boston going way back, World War II.

250
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:41,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was set on the site.

251
00:52:42,275 --> 00:53:01,633
[SPEAKER_03]: and it remained our home from like 1945 to the early 2000s and then it basically collapsed under its own weight and we were fortunate enough over the next several years thereafter to build this building and this is the current home of

252
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:06,096
[SPEAKER_03]: an organization that really, really is very near and dear to my heart.

253
00:53:06,156 --> 00:53:07,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in West Medford.

254
00:53:07,677 --> 00:53:12,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm born and raised on Jerome and Monument Streets, not too far from here.

255
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:19,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the community center, Duggar Park, where all the basketball players are, well, you know, another story for another day.

256
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:29,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And, let's see, Duggar Park, the Hervey School, Shiloh Baptist Church, a couple other places.

257
00:53:29,962 --> 00:53:33,523
[SPEAKER_03]: If our parents didn't know where we were, they knew where to find us, okay?

258
00:53:33,564 --> 00:53:35,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were at one of those three or four places.

259
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:44,728
[SPEAKER_03]: But in any case, Jonathan and I, Jonathan Fagan here, who convened and founded the Jazz Fest.

260
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:50,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.

261
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:57,993
[SPEAKER_03]: We got together, it's going on six years ago, and we decided that we wanted to

262
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:16,373
[SPEAKER_03]: do something project-wise, him as a musician, me as a poet, that would bring those two worlds together under the banner of jazz, because he's a splendid jazz composer, arranger, and poetry, and I'm turning into more of a lyricist as time goes by.

263
00:54:16,393 --> 00:54:24,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I just started out as a garden variety poet, but now I can add lyricist and poet laureate to my name.

264
00:54:27,485 --> 00:54:33,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're gonna start off with where we think, as a community, we start off.

265
00:54:34,027 --> 00:54:37,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna do a tune called Hard by the Mystic, okay?

266
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:45,751
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, now, everything that we do is this intersection of jazz and social justice, okay?

267
00:54:46,311 --> 00:54:53,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it might not fit your ears real easily, but I ask you to open your hearts because I speak the truth in love.

268
00:54:53,673 --> 00:54:55,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that cool?

269
00:54:56,214 --> 00:54:57,154
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right, very good.

270
00:54:58,207 --> 00:54:59,008
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's do this.

271
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,792
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it.

272
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:10,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few streets high by the river.

273
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:14,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Gangs turned to fly and die behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

274
00:55:14,238 --> 00:55:18,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Class was an irresistible force.

275
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Race was an immovable object.

276
00:55:25,537 --> 00:55:39,110
[SPEAKER_03]: us in our place in this mystic valley space where slaves and rams and shepherds had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

277
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was hard by the mystic we went

278
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:50,629
[SPEAKER_03]: muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be found in this ancient Middlesex County town.

279
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:57,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But we named it, and claimed it, and made it our own.

280
00:56:00,171 --> 00:56:10,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in the heat of summer, when the shores were parched and the soil was rank, with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

281
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,321
[SPEAKER_03]: We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

282
00:56:14,361 --> 00:56:21,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Like our own Georgia shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

283
00:56:21,664 --> 00:56:30,227
[SPEAKER_03]: We popped the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread, and became the TV multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, inspired by the mystic.

284
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We became community.

285
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:36,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We commanded unity.

286
00:56:36,243 --> 00:56:47,552
[SPEAKER_03]: We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

287
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:51,875
[SPEAKER_03]: As the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows.

288
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,357
[SPEAKER_03]: A few more streets become our home.

289
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:57,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

290
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:03,707
[SPEAKER_03]: From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landings won't make more room for blacks.

291
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:05,927
[SPEAKER_03]: The color line recedes a bit.

292
00:57:06,448 --> 00:57:08,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Church and school and center sits.

293
00:57:09,449 --> 00:57:12,229
[SPEAKER_03]: The bill becomes the heart of it.

294
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Hired by the Mr. Cho.

295
00:57:26,623 --> 00:57:36,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the worm has surely turned And folks who left have surely learned Things couldn't stay the same That money mystic most days is clean

296
00:57:38,343 --> 00:57:40,524
[SPEAKER_03]: The banks are freshly cut and green.

297
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:46,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

298
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:53,188
[SPEAKER_03]: These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines.

299
00:57:53,888 --> 00:58:03,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, excess, and largesse.

300
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:20,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family.

301
00:58:28,535 --> 00:58:33,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins

302
00:58:34,006 --> 00:58:35,007
[SPEAKER_03]: to wear it in.

303
00:58:35,107 --> 00:58:50,157
[SPEAKER_03]: The only place where one could be found in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

304
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,520
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

305
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:57,282
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

306
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:57,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

307
00:58:57,922 --> 00:58:58,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, okay.

308
00:58:58,502 --> 00:58:59,883
[SPEAKER_03]: We're into it now.

309
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:00,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

310
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:01,885
[SPEAKER_03]: We're into it.

311
00:59:04,003 --> 00:59:17,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a cool segue because there were, in that ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own, there were a few institutions, especially for us kids.

312
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:24,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there was of course Duggar Park, there was the Hervey School Yard where we grew up and played on that side of town.

313
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:37,796
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the West Medford Community Center where all of us kids came for Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts and playing pool and bumper pool and ping pong and so on and so forth.

314
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:46,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the other institutions that was particularly near and dear to our heart was right around the corner a few streets down on Jerome Street and it was called

315
00:59:47,348 --> 00:59:48,169
[SPEAKER_03]: The Little Store.

316
00:59:57,657 --> 01:00:01,421
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome.

317
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:04,003
[SPEAKER_03]: A bit rundown and rough around the edges.

318
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:13,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient, and a little scary.

319
01:00:14,226 --> 01:00:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: One would suspect that he didn't even like kids, but he really must have loved us, or else.

320
01:00:22,173 --> 01:00:24,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did all that penny candy come from?

321
01:00:24,995 --> 01:00:27,637
[SPEAKER_03]: He had all of it, no serious stuff.

322
01:00:27,677 --> 01:00:32,301
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd bust in there with a few nipples or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.

323
01:00:35,895 --> 01:00:37,735
[SPEAKER_03]: up while he finished with grown folks business.

324
01:00:38,536 --> 01:00:42,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he'd be back like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

325
01:00:42,656 --> 01:00:48,177
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.

326
01:00:48,837 --> 01:00:58,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he'd blow over one of those small brown craft paper bags and get to stuffing while we were pooing and ahhing and huffing and puffing.

327
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:00,520
[SPEAKER_03]: See, Mr. Henry had all the

328
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:11,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Squirrel nut zippers and banana splits.

329
01:01:12,337 --> 01:01:14,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Green mint juleps and button strips.

330
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:16,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Red licorice ropes and bottle nips.

331
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,486
[SPEAKER_03]: He had bazooka Joe bubblegum.

332
01:01:19,887 --> 01:01:21,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And a tiny sucker called a dum-dum.

333
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Jar breakers and tootsie rolls.

334
01:01:24,513 --> 01:01:26,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Sugary love for little kids souls.

335
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:33,127
[SPEAKER_03]: candy necklaces to wear and bite, and waxy red lips was such a sight.

336
01:01:33,447 --> 01:01:37,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes, right beside the crunchy six legs.

337
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:40,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary Jane chewies and B.J.

338
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,731
[SPEAKER_03]: bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

339
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:48,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the genuine Hershey's Kisses, all of the hits and none of the misses.

340
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:54,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Like kid taffy squares and nickel wafers, liquor made in Boston they feel.

341
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag, a kid's idea, sweet tooth swag.

342
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:05,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the days of Laffy Taffys, we were gobbling up peppermint patties.

343
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:10,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we knew about gummy bears, Twizzlers always came in pairs.

344
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:16,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Chewy cow tails with creamy filling, but sugar babies had top filling.

345
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:21,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Reese's Peanut Butter Cups had us squealing like newborn pups.

346
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,027
[SPEAKER_03]: We grab those bags like potty, baby.

347
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:55,162
[SPEAKER_03]: chuckles were a favorite choice and milk studs made us all rejoice jolly ranchers and bitter honey we always got a lot for our money talk about kids getting excited our greedy fingers could barely wait you can't imagine the flame he ignited to take that

348
01:02:59,294 --> 01:03:01,455
[SPEAKER_03]: January to chilly December.

349
01:03:01,495 --> 01:03:08,759
[SPEAKER_03]: More kinds of candy than I can remember at the Phil storefront on Upper Jerome.

350
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:14,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I have to write this poem saying Mr. Henry had all the treats.

351
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:16,543
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our favorites.

352
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:19,825
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred great sweets.

353
01:03:22,206 --> 01:03:22,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

354
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright.

355
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:27,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

356
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:29,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You love it.

357
01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:32,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there's the band.

358
01:03:33,828 --> 01:03:35,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

359
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg Toro on the little sexy.

360
01:03:41,752 --> 01:03:42,972
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not the big sexy.

361
01:03:43,012 --> 01:03:45,353
[SPEAKER_03]: The big sexy is the really big bass.

362
01:03:45,393 --> 01:03:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the little sexy.

363
01:03:46,814 --> 01:03:48,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still very sexy, but it's a smaller bass.

364
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,957
[SPEAKER_03]: My man Gordon Engelkau on the traps here.

365
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we are the Allied Project.

366
01:03:56,779 --> 01:03:58,260
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna move this thing along.

367
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy, where am I?

368
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:10,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, here we go.

369
01:04:10,684 --> 01:04:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not gonna lie or front as we say in the hood.

370
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:20,713
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighborhood has changed pretty dramatically, all right?

371
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,066
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna talk a little bit about how I remember it and what it's become.

372
01:04:27,707 --> 01:04:30,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this piece is called Corner Lot.

373
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:31,693
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

374
01:04:53,959 --> 01:04:59,761
[SPEAKER_03]: standing at the apex of Arlington and Jerome, trying to remember the black and the brown and the tan.

375
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:03,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Ronnie and Otis used to live in the big house on the corner lot.

376
01:05:04,522 --> 01:05:07,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably changed a half a dozen times since then.

377
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:10,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Current owner's been there for a minute.

378
01:05:10,784 --> 01:05:14,125
[SPEAKER_03]: He's good with his hands and he knows his way around wood and tools.

379
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:16,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Place has been gussied up quite a bit.

380
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:21,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Picket fence is not quite white, but if you know, you know.

381
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:27,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Asian kid in a Tufts hoodie just whipped by in a helmet and rollerblades.

382
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:30,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't see much of that back in the day.

383
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:36,430
[SPEAKER_03]: The university sort of hit on the hell side trying its best to be a baby Ivy.

384
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:40,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But the co-eds come here all the time now.

385
01:05:40,873 --> 01:05:48,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Basketball, tennis rackets, pickleball paddles in tow, on bikes, in Benzos and rollerblades.

386
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:56,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to bust ourselves up pretty good on those rickety metal skates with funky keys and leather straps.

387
01:05:57,573 --> 01:06:00,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing a little Vaseline and Mercurochrome couldn't handle.

388
01:06:00,716 --> 01:06:04,018
[SPEAKER_03]: How did Henley put it in Invictus?

389
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:06,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, bloody but unbowed.

390
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too many white and off-white kids hanging out here back there then.

391
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It was as if the invisible lines once drawn to keep us in sometimes kept other folks out too.

392
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:37,511
[SPEAKER_03]: now they've pretty much taken over dug apart the rome tennis court the herby schoolyard and a hundred addresses on arlington lincoln and rome a host of our remembered places so few of our original faces

393
01:06:45,582 --> 01:06:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, back at Ronnie and Otis' old place, I'm still standing like that centurion, knowing that Jesus doesn't have to go in to heal his servant.

394
01:06:55,947 --> 01:06:57,407
[SPEAKER_03]: He just has to speak a word.

395
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:06,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I keep hoping that he'll speak a word to the Cornelot, too, and bring back the black and the brown and the tan.

396
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:12,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Across the river, it's low tide.

397
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:16,431
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell is gone and the grass is greener than I recall.

398
01:07:21,033 --> 01:07:25,015
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our little park, away from Duggar and a lot less hectic.

399
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:30,037
[SPEAKER_03]: We had makeshift bases or discarded cones for football and softball.

400
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:36,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost a few in the river, but nobody was going in that muck to retrieve anything.

401
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd probably wait in that water today.

402
01:07:44,037 --> 01:07:44,517
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.

403
01:07:44,557 --> 01:07:46,058
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all pretty big now.

404
01:07:46,538 --> 01:07:48,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple and ash, I think.

405
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody plays baseball or football there anymore.

406
01:07:52,421 --> 01:08:01,566
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are lots of dogs frolicking off leash and gaggles of fat Canadian geese daring pennies, pugs, and poos to chase them off.

407
01:08:12,538 --> 01:08:16,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine my childhood without losing a few softballs there.

408
01:08:17,202 --> 01:08:27,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine not hearing Mrs. Allen call little James Michael to come and eat, or little Charlie to watch us play from his bowling chair, because his spindly legs were too weak to let him run.

409
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine that I'm still here.

410
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:38,141
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bonnie and Otis, and Darryl King, and Frank the French, Aaron McDaniel, and Murphy Davis are all

411
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone had a nickname back then.

412
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:48,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Daryl was super fast, so we called him Road Runner and Jack Rabbit.

413
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark was as thick as a big tree trunk, so we came up with Oak for him.

414
01:08:54,173 --> 01:09:01,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron was Spud, Frankie was Fruit Man, and I was Top Cat, too cool, ran the school.

415
01:09:10,733 --> 01:09:11,974
[SPEAKER_03]: across the corner lot now.

416
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:16,338
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more land and perhaps a new perspective that angles create.

417
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:26,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that meant anything to Ronnie and Otis, or Jed and Miles and Gibbs, Barry, Coco, Keith Wing, and Kenny Byfield.

418
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:34,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly meant something to the white folks looking to displace, transplant, and uproot the local color.

419
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:39,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Black folks built homes here.

420
01:09:40,657 --> 01:09:42,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Only place where they were allowed to be.

421
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they could color inside the lines.

422
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:50,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Against the perceived discomforts of darker skin.

423
01:09:51,568 --> 01:09:53,450
[SPEAKER_03]: We were here first.

424
01:09:54,210 --> 01:10:02,758
[SPEAKER_03]: First firefighters, police officers, war heroes, shop owners, tradesmen, postal chiefs, teachers, artists, and preachers.

425
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:12,167
[SPEAKER_03]: We were the human bedrock of the only neighborhood they'd let us build.

426
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:13,969
[SPEAKER_03]: The old church is gone now.

427
01:10:14,963 --> 01:10:23,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelson even changed the street number as if to erase the fact that the original Shiloh Baptist ever existed.

428
01:10:23,582 --> 01:10:25,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you know, you know.

429
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: that corner still have the cornerstone 1900 and Nelson couldn't do nothing about it without a more draconian demolition two more condos in the house of the lord two more houses that us first folks can't afford two more dismissals of the blessings of his word one more holy stone rejected and

430
01:11:02,285 --> 01:11:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right, we're gonna switch it up a little bit.

431
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:21,515
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're familiar with the Jazz Canon, you know a couple of the players, you know, Duke Ellington and Miles Davis and you know, maybe Herbie Hancock and a few others.

432
01:11:23,616 --> 01:11:25,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe you know John Coltrane.

433
01:11:26,637 --> 01:11:27,998
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so Coltrane,

434
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:35,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best of the jazz standards were his compositions with that beautiful horn of his.

435
01:11:36,395 --> 01:11:39,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was about one of his loves.

436
01:11:39,636 --> 01:11:40,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name was Naima.

437
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:47,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you know Coltrane and you know jazz a little bit, you probably have heard Naima before.

438
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a riff, a take on Naima.

439
01:11:50,802 --> 01:11:53,403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Reprise for Naima.

440
01:11:58,103 --> 01:12:01,224
[SPEAKER_03]: He would blow this note in the midnight air.

441
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:05,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Aloft in the ether, it floats out there.

442
01:12:05,525 --> 01:12:10,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Staccato cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude.

443
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:22,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Improvisational mystery, like Monk's piano episcophy, or Miles' tone poem in a silent way, or Flanagan's piece at the end of the day.

444
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:34,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Syncopated in sharp, bright tone, a countdown decides us, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace and out of sight.

445
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:48,995
[SPEAKER_03]: With heartland crooning or bags-on vibes, trios, duets, quartets, and tribes, the blues, the ballads, the avant-garde, incredibly gorgeous, impossibly hard.

446
01:12:52,575 --> 01:12:54,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Giant steps move us miles ahead.

447
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooking up bar for Harlem street cred.

448
01:12:57,237 --> 01:12:59,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Melodies hand to the harmony wed.

449
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:01,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Pianos lullaby fresh in the bed.

450
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:03,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhythm rocks with a drum of lead.

451
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhythm rolls in the bass man's bed.

452
01:13:05,621 --> 01:13:07,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhythm burns with the saxophone bread.

453
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:10,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhythm heard what the master said.

454
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,063
[SPEAKER_03]: How could he make the bitter taste sweeter?

455
01:13:17,244 --> 01:13:19,467
[SPEAKER_03]: How could a tortured mind deleter?

456
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:21,791
[SPEAKER_03]: How could the mellow scotch be neater?

457
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:26,819
[SPEAKER_03]: How could the smoke from each cigarette create blue beads that cast an edge?

458
01:14:30,087 --> 01:14:37,471
[SPEAKER_03]: A velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent riff of a lover's dream.

459
01:14:38,191 --> 01:14:44,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Coltrane's notes are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance of laughter.

460
01:14:51,742 --> 01:15:04,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Coltrane's notes are a sample divine, like gold in a can of gemstone mine, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffins with a hint of green.

461
01:15:04,612 --> 01:15:14,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes from lover's pride, the gladness

462
01:15:35,057 --> 01:15:38,182
[SPEAKER_03]: The harmonious spirit engulfs the room.

463
01:15:38,202 --> 01:15:40,065
[SPEAKER_03]: The bride says yes to her lyrical groom.

464
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:42,869
[SPEAKER_03]: The groove and the beat is in just the broom.

465
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,994
[SPEAKER_03]: The tip drum resounds with a sonic boom.

466
01:15:57,792 --> 01:16:02,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Musical mythology, a twisted path, a hero walk.

467
01:16:02,436 --> 01:16:04,678
[SPEAKER_03]: With shield and sword, the hero starts.

468
01:16:04,998 --> 01:16:06,820
[SPEAKER_03]: The different shapes are twisted locks.

469
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Medusa's snake, his vision chopped.

470
01:16:09,702 --> 01:16:11,684
[SPEAKER_03]: The poles of the mirror in stony blocks.

471
01:16:12,124 --> 01:16:14,406
[SPEAKER_03]: The harp and the horn melt icy rocks.

472
01:16:27,652 --> 01:16:37,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Coltrane's notes are a rollercoaster, a hallelujah and a kalinosa, a glorious note from the maestro's hand.

473
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:44,666
[SPEAKER_03]: The saxophone titan is in command.

474
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:49,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Coltrane's notes are a crazy rhythm, a swap of chords in place of schism, the frenetic pace of Mr.

475
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,333
[SPEAKER_03]: P.C., the coolest round midnight will ever be.

476
01:16:54,681 --> 01:17:08,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Coltrane's notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a lover's dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

477
01:17:09,586 --> 01:17:20,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Coltrane's notes are naive as reprieve, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part,

478
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:26,048
[SPEAKER_03]: in the balladeer's heart.

479
01:17:30,669 --> 01:17:31,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

480
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:33,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

481
01:17:34,871 --> 01:17:35,771
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right.

482
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:39,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to stay, we're going to stay on the jazz frontier for a minute.

483
01:17:39,772 --> 01:17:50,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And Herbie Hancock and later Quincy Jones, they did a tune, Quincy covered it.

484
01:17:50,856 --> 01:17:52,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Herbie Hancock did it first and it's called

485
01:17:53,656 --> 01:17:54,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell Me A Bedtime Story.

486
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:59,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do a little riff on Tell Me A Bedtime Story.

487
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Tell Me Another Bedtime Story.

488
01:18:03,502 --> 01:18:03,862
[SPEAKER_03]: All right?

489
01:18:04,883 --> 01:18:07,304
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a sweet little jazz ditty, OK?

490
01:18:54,015 --> 01:18:55,756
[SPEAKER_03]: and reducing the pain?

491
01:18:56,596 --> 01:19:02,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this where we fly to never, never land, like the troop of lost boys with Peter Pan?

492
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,422
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the mystery of hidden dreams, nothing now is ever seen.

493
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:17,525
[SPEAKER_03]: For the sweet tale that sugars and creams, with flashes of stardust and shining moonbeams.

494
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:28,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Let there be a hint of romance.

495
01:19:28,247 --> 01:19:31,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance.

496
01:19:56,365 --> 01:20:06,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a bedtime story, please, of secret gardens and pecan trees, of babbling brooks and waterfalls, of gentle breezes that summer calls.

497
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:41,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a fable of Arabian nights Spread on a table of earthly delights Free from the label of anger and spite Willing and able to scale higher heights

498
01:21:03,763 --> 01:21:23,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The baby rocks in the maple bough As the blue ox puts his nose to the plough And the sweaty farmer wipes his brow As each green seedling happily bows To yield each fruit the ground allows And seven dwarfs whistle a happy tune And sleeping beauty awakens soon

499
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:33,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Let there be a melody that sings in four part harmony.

500
01:21:34,026 --> 01:21:35,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it resound.

501
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:27,456
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the time when the sandman whispers and seven brooms meet seven sisters and the prairie sings an ode to love as the angels release the turtle dove.

502
01:22:29,037 --> 01:22:35,845
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, I lay me down to sleep and pray to God, my soul to keep.

503
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:43,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonathan Bacon on the keys.

504
01:22:45,475 --> 01:22:46,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray Carroll on the bass.

505
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:50,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear that?

506
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,100
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard that, right?

507
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:55,143
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go with the angle down on the drums.

508
01:22:55,723 --> 01:22:56,183
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

509
01:22:57,044 --> 01:22:58,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

510
01:22:59,466 --> 01:23:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so listen.

511
01:23:01,427 --> 01:23:05,590
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to the intersection of jazz and social justice, all right?

512
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:11,655
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and when I say we ain't playing, we ain't playing, but we're playing.

513
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:19,957
[SPEAKER_03]: okay all right so we ain't playing okay this is called alienation

514
01:23:38,982 --> 01:24:02,517
[SPEAKER_03]: here is a fence without a gate you can't get in you have to wait you can't be foreign or somehow strange this isn't your home home on the range you can't arrive in a rickety boat our castle has a treacherous moat we won't hold refugees at our door you're not the soul we're looking for take good note we stay on guard we don't want you in our

515
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:08,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite the danger you seek to avoid, our best deterrents have been deployed.

516
01:24:09,553 --> 01:24:12,055
[SPEAKER_03]: You say our country's full of peril.

517
01:24:12,475 --> 01:24:15,857
[SPEAKER_03]: But like stray cats, we think you're feral.

518
01:24:15,897 --> 01:24:17,478
[SPEAKER_03]: We think you're prone to filthy crime.

519
01:24:17,578 --> 01:24:21,040
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want fear at this time.

520
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,561
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't care what the neighbors say.

521
01:24:23,581 --> 01:24:25,402
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't do more than hope and pray.

522
01:24:25,422 --> 01:24:26,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Our stance is clear.

523
01:24:34,893 --> 01:24:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw that statue in the bank.

524
01:24:36,735 --> 01:24:39,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It stood for liberty until today.

525
01:24:39,718 --> 01:24:44,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It welcomed tired and huddled masses, not criminals from your underclass.

526
01:24:45,365 --> 01:24:47,007
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got militias on the border.

527
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:49,429
[SPEAKER_03]: They own big guns to keep the order.

528
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:54,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Law enforcement lets them stay to help them keep your kind at bay.

529
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we feel that this is good?

530
01:25:03,383 --> 01:25:05,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't we share the neighborhood?

531
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:07,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because you're black and brown?

532
01:25:07,606 --> 01:25:10,327
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we just choose to stand our ground.

533
01:25:10,828 --> 01:25:11,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay in your place.

534
01:25:11,728 --> 01:25:12,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Deal with your issues.

535
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:14,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll send lots of coal and tissues.

536
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't form caravans and run.

537
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:19,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find yourself in the sights

538
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:27,353
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no streets here lined with old.

539
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:29,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Our eyes are closed, our hearts are old.

540
01:25:29,575 --> 01:25:31,677
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no flowing milk and honey.

541
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:35,261
[SPEAKER_03]: American skies are not that sunny.

542
01:25:36,322 --> 01:25:40,566
[SPEAKER_03]: The fences we build keep aliens out.

543
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:43,228
[SPEAKER_03]: They serve to keep our faith devout.

544
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:48,013
[SPEAKER_03]: This land we scheme to make our own is ours, you see, and ours alone.

545
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:53,152
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you stay on the other side, we can maintain our national pride.

546
01:25:53,332 --> 01:25:55,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't show us your anguished faces.

547
01:25:56,553 --> 01:25:59,634
[SPEAKER_03]: We're cutting back on other races.

548
01:26:03,255 --> 01:26:05,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had enough of global inclusion.

549
01:26:05,616 --> 01:26:07,677
[SPEAKER_03]: We're ridding this country of race confusion.

550
01:26:08,117 --> 01:26:11,178
[SPEAKER_03]: We know how to win these fights and limit all

551
01:26:13,595 --> 01:26:18,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Safety nets and the welfare state will have to stop for the lost and late.

552
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:22,321
[SPEAKER_03]: A rising tide that favors the rich.

553
01:26:22,361 --> 01:26:27,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our famous favorite campaign pitch.

554
01:26:27,065 --> 01:26:31,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Me Too movements and Black Lives Matter and all due time your ranks will scatter.

555
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:34,790
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that you shall overcome?

556
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cross this line.

557
01:26:36,871 --> 01:26:37,832
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you some.

558
01:26:40,234 --> 01:26:41,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you a taste of burning church.

559
01:26:42,451 --> 01:26:44,494
[SPEAKER_03]: and black boys hunts for folks and virgins.

560
01:26:45,114 --> 01:26:50,501
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you a taste of incarceration in prison.com, the corporate plantation.

561
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:11,428
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking this country back to the day when white men write in every way, when men are privileged to rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat.

562
01:27:11,828 --> 01:27:23,535
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking this homeland back to the season when hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods of swamp and bog.

563
01:27:26,713 --> 01:27:38,139
[SPEAKER_03]: where confederate flags were both raised and crosses in the darkest place and the land was full of racial hate served with grits on a breakfast plate

564
01:27:41,045 --> 01:27:45,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You thought this worm had surely turned, and young black bodies no longer burned.

565
01:27:46,489 --> 01:27:51,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet here you are again today, with the specter of prejudice winning the day.

566
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:56,756
[SPEAKER_03]: The MAGA cap you wear with pride, they let us know who's on your side.

567
01:27:56,776 --> 01:28:01,240
[SPEAKER_03]: The pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe.

568
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:12,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it.

569
01:28:12,807 --> 01:28:17,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Until that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price.

570
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:23,714
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll pay a price as many misguided people embrace the hate their voice provides.

571
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:30,158
[SPEAKER_03]: His Twitter rants and soundbites full of ethnocentric, cock and bull.

572
01:28:37,606 --> 01:28:49,892
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls, where fences are the new condition, announcing the refugees' abolition.

573
01:28:52,052 --> 01:28:57,135
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist powers.

574
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:02,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've

575
01:29:07,056 --> 01:29:11,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard.

576
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:16,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Our agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this island.

577
01:29:17,848 --> 01:29:19,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Tolerance is in short supply.

578
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:24,396
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't let your kind occupy this sacred land our forebears built.

579
01:29:24,516 --> 01:29:27,179
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't subscribe to Anglo guilt.

580
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:34,026
[SPEAKER_03]: This fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late.

581
01:29:34,527 --> 01:29:38,132
[SPEAKER_03]: To all you aliens, we don't like strange.

582
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:43,740
[SPEAKER_03]: No room at the inn in our home on the range.

583
01:29:56,955 --> 01:30:00,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard truth, admittedly, but truth nonetheless.

584
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:08,604
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're gonna stay there for a minute, and then we'll try and ease up off of your feelings.

585
01:30:10,225 --> 01:30:16,229
[SPEAKER_03]: This piece is called The Ally, and it's actually kind of the eponym for our project.

586
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:19,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna do Ally for you.

587
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:34,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Friends become distant and strange, as if you have some creeping mane.

588
01:30:35,242 --> 01:30:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Family wonders why and brings their hands.

589
01:30:38,245 --> 01:30:40,447
[SPEAKER_03]: How could you choose them over us?

590
01:30:41,048 --> 01:30:44,431
[SPEAKER_03]: We're your blood, bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh.

591
01:30:44,831 --> 01:30:46,012
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not like us.

592
01:30:46,993 --> 01:30:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so different, less than, not equal to, beneath.

593
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:54,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Declarations have been made.

594
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:55,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Arrangements are in place.

595
01:30:55,696 --> 01:30:58,138
[SPEAKER_03]: These are matters of our kin.

596
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Signs have been painted.

597
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:01,621
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be cast out.

598
01:31:01,842 --> 01:31:03,343
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be shunned.

599
01:31:03,783 --> 01:31:06,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to stick with your own kind.

600
01:31:19,034 --> 01:31:21,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a hard road to hoe.

601
01:31:21,457 --> 01:31:23,119
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making strange bed pillows.

602
01:31:23,139 --> 01:31:25,982
[SPEAKER_03]: You're casting your white pearls in full swine.

603
01:31:26,323 --> 01:31:28,846
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't raised to behave like this.

604
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:32,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Our family is a proud and honored clan.

605
01:31:33,192 --> 01:31:35,913
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll never be lower than any black man.

606
01:31:35,973 --> 01:31:38,593
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no room for them at this table.

607
01:31:39,174 --> 01:31:41,314
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always been two sides of the track.

608
01:31:41,534 --> 01:31:44,455
[SPEAKER_03]: The right and wrong side of time.

609
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:47,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Our kind and their kind.

610
01:31:47,296 --> 01:31:48,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Your people and those folks.

611
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna kill your mother and your daddy.

612
01:32:01,948 --> 01:32:06,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be out there with them.

613
01:32:07,269 --> 01:32:15,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to

614
01:32:29,017 --> 01:32:29,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Dominate.

615
01:32:30,257 --> 01:32:30,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Relegate.

616
01:32:31,118 --> 01:32:32,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Subjugate.

617
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:33,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Eliminate.

618
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,780
[SPEAKER_03]: They want reparations.

619
01:32:41,461 --> 01:32:45,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're making preparations to give them 40 acres of hell and a mule kick to the gut.

620
01:32:45,742 --> 01:32:47,582
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't seem to get it, son.

621
01:32:48,023 --> 01:32:49,803
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the way the races run.

622
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:52,684
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not enough room for everyone.

623
01:32:53,264 --> 01:32:56,245
[SPEAKER_03]: The time for black and brown is done.

624
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be out there with them.

625
01:33:06,386 --> 01:33:17,013
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

626
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:22,880
do

627
01:38:25,054 --> 01:38:27,016
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, yeah.

628
01:38:27,616 --> 01:38:29,277
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right.

629
01:38:30,378 --> 01:38:32,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, the Allied Carpet.

630
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:36,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonathan Fagan, Greg Toro, Dwayne Englegar, and Terry Carter.

631
01:38:36,623 --> 01:38:39,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Too cool, these bros got me sweating out here.

632
01:38:39,785 --> 01:38:40,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Got me sweating.

633
01:38:41,487 --> 01:38:46,250
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, okay, so we're at a couple of different spots, and then we're gonna finish up.

634
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:49,793
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's do something nice and mellow.

635
01:38:49,813 --> 01:38:52,015
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called Legacy, okay?

636
01:39:02,412 --> 01:39:03,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody enjoying themselves?

637
01:39:03,714 --> 01:39:04,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

638
01:39:05,056 --> 01:39:06,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's warm out there.

639
01:39:08,482 --> 01:39:11,667
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're braving the elements and enjoying the day, hopefully.

640
01:39:12,829 --> 01:39:13,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very good.

641
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,921
[SPEAKER_03]: that is the burden of your children.

642
01:39:46,961 --> 01:39:50,162
[SPEAKER_03]: They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.

643
01:39:51,462 --> 01:39:57,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

644
01:39:58,765 --> 01:40:03,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name.

645
01:40:05,407 --> 01:40:08,748
[SPEAKER_03]: How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?

646
01:40:08,929 --> 01:40:12,930
[SPEAKER_03]: How will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out

647
01:40:36,357 --> 01:40:45,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

648
01:40:46,101 --> 01:40:53,284
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's girthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.

649
01:40:54,464 --> 01:41:02,587
[SPEAKER_03]: If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark and stoke the flame, you don't know.

650
01:41:05,509 --> 01:41:11,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride story, the hunters will always tell them first.

651
01:41:21,025 --> 01:41:23,647
[SPEAKER_03]: book says, train up the child in the way they should go.

652
01:41:24,468 --> 01:41:36,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on the hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

653
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journeys?

654
01:41:49,555 --> 01:41:51,276
[SPEAKER_03]: the wonders of Wakanda.

655
01:41:51,716 --> 01:41:53,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And San Pololo grew tacky.

656
01:41:53,117 --> 01:41:57,780
[SPEAKER_03]: The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.

657
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:02,262
[SPEAKER_03]: But how will they know the way home if no map charts the scene?

658
01:42:02,322 --> 01:42:12,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Measures the roads, sites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees.

659
01:42:14,429 --> 01:42:18,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?

660
01:42:18,977 --> 01:42:20,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they care to carry?

661
01:42:20,898 --> 01:42:22,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they dare to tarry?

662
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they linger at the foot of the tree?

663
01:42:26,481 --> 01:42:30,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Or will they hunger for the wisdom of the saints?

664
01:42:31,344 --> 01:42:42,750
[SPEAKER_03]: We must put them on this page, where hard work turns a man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, with miracles scarfed at the wand of a maid.

665
01:42:52,484 --> 01:43:07,267
[SPEAKER_03]: that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional boot, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.

666
01:43:10,027 --> 01:43:18,589
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captors free, and the candle's light beckons liberty.

667
01:43:22,773 --> 01:43:37,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.

668
01:43:37,122 --> 01:43:49,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They will show you a Nazi's clever ways, hopeful and contagious journeys, for Pharaoh's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly the wonders of Lusanda, and Sanga Lolo's new tactics,

669
01:43:53,607 --> 01:43:55,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon you will be the herald.

670
01:43:55,991 --> 01:43:59,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.

671
01:44:00,419 --> 01:44:03,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them put a running in your feet.

672
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:12,311
[SPEAKER_03]: With each quickening step, you repel the arrows of the hunter.

673
01:44:12,731 --> 01:44:19,172
[SPEAKER_03]: With the shield of abiding faith, you capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.

674
01:44:19,972 --> 01:44:29,994
[SPEAKER_03]: You remain the lions of the pride and your tales will always be your children's prayers.

675
01:44:30,835 --> 01:44:33,875
[SPEAKER_03]: You will never abandon the community of faith.

676
01:44:34,575 --> 01:44:37,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Though you build a thousand cities on a hill,

677
01:44:45,174 --> 01:44:52,698
[SPEAKER_03]: fills your clay jars with his grace.

678
01:44:52,998 --> 01:44:55,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

679
01:44:57,521 --> 01:44:58,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so

680
01:45:01,432 --> 01:45:04,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a while ago, it was either my first or my second book.

681
01:45:04,856 --> 01:45:07,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of first and second books, I've got books up there.

682
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:13,066
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a Allied Project CD, for those of you who still have a CD player.

683
01:45:14,247 --> 01:45:17,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got a lot of our music on it, so if you're interested, it's up there.

684
01:45:17,972 --> 01:45:20,314
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a CD player.

685
01:45:21,536 --> 01:45:31,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Jazz Festival t-shirts, which are lovely, and our food venue, the Danish Pastry House, will still be here after we leave.

686
01:45:31,304 --> 01:45:41,994
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you didn't get a snack, and you wanna get one, come back and sit out under the tent and talk, or however the move hits ya, it's all there, still there for you.

687
01:45:42,514 --> 01:45:42,854
[SPEAKER_03]: All right?

688
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:46,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I think we're gonna do two more, and then we're gonna be done.

689
01:45:47,588 --> 01:45:48,208
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so.

690
01:45:49,609 --> 01:45:52,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that, I love that, I love that.

691
01:45:53,071 --> 01:45:53,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.

692
01:45:53,871 --> 01:45:58,253
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not fake, if you're faking it, don't do it.

693
01:45:58,293 --> 01:46:03,075
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's, oh, okay, I love it, okay.

694
01:46:03,135 --> 01:46:05,136
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?

695
01:46:06,257 --> 01:46:07,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're doing Bobby, okay.

696
01:46:08,078 --> 01:46:09,598
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so a while back,

697
01:46:11,703 --> 01:46:14,344
[SPEAKER_03]: like on one of my early books, I think it was the second one.

698
01:46:15,004 --> 01:46:19,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a painting in my house, it's called, what's it called, T?

699
01:46:19,805 --> 01:46:22,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's called Barbie Doesn't Live Here.

700
01:46:22,965 --> 01:46:34,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what it is is my attempt, my humble painting attempt to kind of depict black women in all shapes and sizes because they come in all shapes and sizes.

701
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:36,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And there may be one or two of them who are

702
01:46:37,028 --> 01:46:46,710
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very narrow and somewhat Barbie-like, somewhat Angel Reese-like, but for the most part, it runs the gamut.

703
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:53,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wrote this poem called Barbie Doesn't Live Here to go with that piece of artwork.

704
01:46:54,592 --> 01:47:01,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And every once in a while, you revisit a piece of poetry and you say, well, what could I have done differently, or what could I have said differently?

705
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:07,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had this notion, and it came out like this, and it's called If Barbie Had a Choice.

706
01:47:39,905 --> 01:47:40,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Barbie had a choice.

707
01:47:41,606 --> 01:47:45,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that from day one, she would have made it a black thing.

708
01:47:46,368 --> 01:47:51,191
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have ditched the cream-sickened skin and gone with a lustrous ebony hue.

709
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:59,775
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have spoken in an evil dialect with a true queen's attitude and said, to hell with you pollinators.

710
01:47:59,875 --> 01:48:05,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Package me up in a pink box with white lettering and a bunch of beachy palms and sand in the background.

711
01:48:11,748 --> 01:48:15,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Curvaceous hip into that goldie lawn, psychedelic mini.

712
01:48:16,729 --> 01:48:19,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I'ma need a little something more substantial.

713
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:27,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I'ma need coach's yards of single-eased cotton with shiny petite totems and all the colors of the motherland.

714
01:48:27,971 --> 01:48:35,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I'ma need a Wakanda seamstress straight out of the Ruth Potter school to hook the thing up right and show the world what I'm working for.

715
01:48:35,673 --> 01:48:40,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I'ma need a mane in Dahomey, not by Mattel and Disney.

716
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:47,753
[SPEAKER_03]: If Bobby had a choice, Ken would've looked more like Ali or Denzel.

717
01:48:48,073 --> 01:48:51,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that fine-ass, dark-chocolate British cat, Delirious Alba.

718
01:48:51,895 --> 01:48:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: He would've been melanated, not barely suntanned.

719
01:48:55,577 --> 01:49:03,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And by no means would he have seen more holiday tissue wrap and 150-grit sandpaper.

720
01:49:03,281 --> 01:49:06,283
[SPEAKER_03]: He would've been swashbuckling like Marv or T'Challa.

721
01:49:06,303 --> 01:49:10,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Woke like Tupac and standing on business like Brother Malcolm.

722
01:49:26,589 --> 01:49:36,133
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have kissed that man with unretouched, un-botoxed black girl lips, lush and full as a tropic rainforest.

723
01:49:36,353 --> 01:49:44,397
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have engulfed her man in every quaking itch of the last poet's black thighs.

724
01:49:44,437 --> 01:49:46,518
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know it, YouTube it.

725
01:49:46,578 --> 01:49:54,482
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have no need of a Brazilian butler, a Beverly Hills school job, or an Adobe Photoshop session.

726
01:49:55,835 --> 01:50:06,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother Africa in a generous genome took care of all of that, you feel me?

727
01:50:06,743 --> 01:50:12,828
[SPEAKER_03]: If Barbie had a choice, you would never have been able to buy her at Toys R Us, F.A.O.

728
01:50:12,848 --> 01:50:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Schwartz or Mary Arnold.

729
01:50:14,589 --> 01:50:19,272
[SPEAKER_03]: She wouldn't have been a fake trophy bride, a chick on the side, or a Bonnie for five.

730
01:50:19,473 --> 01:50:21,354
[SPEAKER_03]: She wouldn't have been American Girl Addie,

731
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:30,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It girl Margot Robbie, or Cherry Pie's Bobby, or a P. Diddy Harvey.

732
01:50:31,192 --> 01:50:37,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I'ma close the flow with a few more rhymes, just a few bronze bars to end this on time.

733
01:50:39,734 --> 01:50:42,675
[SPEAKER_03]: A new newbie in Barbie wouldn't stand for nonsense.

734
01:50:43,356 --> 01:50:45,516
[SPEAKER_03]: A brother's pursuit couldn't sit on the fence.

735
01:50:45,836 --> 01:50:47,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Her womanly wiles would truly be immense.

736
01:50:48,677 --> 01:50:54,139
[SPEAKER_03]: A player would just bind her game to a tense, but never a true shot that loves record pace.

737
01:50:55,534 --> 01:51:02,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Though he might pull up in a Bentley or Rolls, he'd lose by a landslide at a Rio Queen's pole.

738
01:51:03,619 --> 01:51:06,700
[SPEAKER_03]: A new Nubian Barbie would demand that mistake.

739
01:51:06,721 --> 01:51:09,282
[SPEAKER_03]: She wouldn't suffer the guilt or neglect.

740
01:51:09,302 --> 01:51:12,304
[SPEAKER_03]: She'd fight for her own like a Goji elite.

741
01:51:12,324 --> 01:51:16,106
[SPEAKER_03]: She wouldn't be tamed, demure, or petite.

742
01:51:24,635 --> 01:51:53,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Things would be different on this I may bet A pimp or a hustler would not be a threat As fine as the print on the national deck Her beauty and wisdom would not break a sweat That glitzy white Barbie might have the toy jet But she hasn't landed a soul plane yet My African queen makes the real king spaghetti Though she might wanna keep that fly pink Corvette

743
01:51:58,675 --> 01:51:59,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to keep that.

744
01:52:00,876 --> 01:52:01,256
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

745
01:52:02,036 --> 01:52:18,540
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we're going to end where we begin, and that's with family, because everybody here, everybody who's here, you know, and I so appreciate, we so appreciate everyone who has braved the heat, because we know it's out there to be here with us.

746
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see if I can hopefully find it.

747
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:31,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good All right, so

748
01:52:46,162 --> 01:52:55,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that a lot of stuff that I've said today and that we've played today, you know, strikes different chords and resonates differently with everybody.

749
01:52:56,588 --> 01:53:06,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But this particular poem, maybe like The Little Store, really, really is gonna bring back an image of the way that your home looked at some point in time.

750
01:53:06,394 --> 01:53:11,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I can almost guarantee it doesn't matter where you came from, what ethnicity, what background,

751
01:53:13,143 --> 01:53:33,384
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point in time my prayer my hope is that your Home look like this at some point and hopefully still does this piece is called kitchen table home Nobody ever wants to leave there like the blueberry stains on mama's apron

752
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:35,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Settled, satisfied.

753
01:53:36,211 --> 01:53:38,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Good food has been eaten.

754
01:53:38,192 --> 01:53:40,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh corn and collard greens.

755
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:42,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Fried chicken and potato salad.

756
01:53:42,574 --> 01:53:46,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Bellies are fat and full.

757
01:53:46,677 --> 01:53:47,617
[SPEAKER_03]: This is that room.

758
01:53:48,297 --> 01:53:51,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, and girl, and are you serious right now?

759
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real talk.

760
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:54,861
[SPEAKER_03]: We're real people.

761
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:56,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Family, you know what I'm saying?

762
01:53:57,442 --> 01:53:59,903
[SPEAKER_03]: We're family.

763
01:53:59,963 --> 01:54:03,145
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smell the love long before the door opens.

764
01:54:03,872 --> 01:54:05,854
[SPEAKER_03]: You know there's gonna be pecan pie.

765
01:54:06,414 --> 01:54:09,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And the sweet tea will be ice cold.

766
01:54:09,957 --> 01:54:12,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Southern folk will slip out of their northerness.

767
01:54:12,959 --> 01:54:18,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Accents will thicken and the country shade will feel closer to the city center.

768
01:54:18,963 --> 01:54:20,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll stay at that table.

769
01:54:20,885 --> 01:54:24,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Long after the crumbs are cleared, the dishes will be all washed.

770
01:54:24,207 --> 01:54:28,490
[SPEAKER_03]: The food will be put away or packed in tupperware in ziplock totes.

771
01:54:28,771 --> 01:54:31,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone will have a doggie bag and a story to tell.

772
01:54:36,562 --> 01:54:42,443
[SPEAKER_03]: down dominoes, sipping on a little something something and talking big trash.

773
01:54:42,543 --> 01:54:46,604
[SPEAKER_03]: The smiles will be broad and the laughter will be contagious.

774
01:54:47,585 --> 01:54:50,085
[SPEAKER_03]: The women will be fanning and fussing.

775
01:54:50,665 --> 01:54:53,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Good Lord, she know she too big for that dress.

776
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:55,747
[SPEAKER_03]: That ain't no Sunday saved outfit.

777
01:54:56,027 --> 01:54:58,087
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for Saturday night sinning.

778
01:54:58,127 --> 01:54:59,488
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm right, girl.

779
01:54:59,568 --> 01:55:02,668
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm right.

780
01:55:02,788 --> 01:55:04,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody ever wants to leave.

781
01:55:05,908 --> 01:55:11,792
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old print, loving and consistent.

782
01:55:11,872 --> 01:55:13,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul food has been shared.

783
01:55:13,893 --> 01:55:19,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Our gene has prayed down heaven and the baby sang their song.

784
01:55:19,957 --> 01:55:23,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's tickled and tranquil.

785
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:27,503
[SPEAKER_03]: This is that room.

786
01:55:28,243 --> 01:55:29,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I really miss pap.

787
01:55:31,205 --> 01:55:33,106
[SPEAKER_03]: His baby boy's cancer and remission.

788
01:55:34,027 --> 01:55:35,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you coming back to church,

789
01:55:36,985 --> 01:55:37,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real talk.

790
01:55:38,526 --> 01:55:40,087
[SPEAKER_03]: We're real people.

01:55:40,387 --> 01:55:40,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Family.

792
01:55:41,467 --> 01:55:42,388
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?

793
01:55:43,168 --> 01:55:46,130
[SPEAKER_03]: We're family.

01:55:53,153 --> 01:55:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg Currow on the bass.

797
01:55:56,196 --> 01:55:57,077
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on the run, man.

01:55:57,097 --> 01:55:59,241
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually got a wedding to play in a little while.

[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:56:02,165 --> 01:56:02,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.

802
01:56:02,726 --> 01:56:03,647
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a road warrior.

803
01:56:03,687 --> 01:56:07,933
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to get in his little whip, and he's going to go down to Connecticut to play a wedding.

804
01:56:08,695 --> 01:56:09,135
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

805
01:56:09,716 --> 01:56:10,718

[SPEAKER_03]: The one, the only, Gordon Angle guy on the drums.

811
01:56:37,626 --> 01:56:40,107
