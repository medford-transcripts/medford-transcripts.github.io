    <p>[8Kto7egzLDI_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=118.902s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=135.826s">Agenda</a>  item number three is the MSBA Accelerated Repair Statements of Interest, SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=143.48s">Dr.</a>  Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent, and this is concerning the district's intention to submit a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority MSBA accelerated program on behalf of the Roberts, the Misituck, and the Brooks Elementary Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=158.909s">Medford</a>  School Committee is hereby asked to approve three separate motions hereby authorizing the administration to formally submit the statement of interest <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=167.397s">For</a>  the schools listed below under priority five, replacement, renovation and modernization of school facility systems, such as roofs, windows, boilers, heating and ventilation systems to increase energy conservation and decrease energy related costs in school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=184.183s">Number</a>  one is the Roberts Elementary School roof and heat pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=187.948s">Two</a>  is Mississippi Tech Elementary School roof and heat pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=190.832s">And</a>  number three is Brooks Elementary School roof and heat pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=195.438s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, I don't know if you have anything to add before we take votes and discuss.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=200.353s">No,</a>  just appreciate the committee's consideration of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=204.938s">This</a>  window is open now until March 21st, and then we anticipate it will be closed for approximately two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=211.744s">So</a>  now is an opportunity to at least get into the pipeline and have the opportunity to make decisions as we move forward with these three schools.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=223.324s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=224.245s">And</a>  then, so the general public's aware, this is the same process we took, just a different category under MSBA as it relates to the work we're doing for the new high school, which we're now excited to share last week that we're in the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=242.243s">So</a>  this is just the first phase of trying to get that <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=246.667s">portion</a>  of these projects paid for through the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=249.649s">So</a>  I want to thank all that are working on these applications from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=255.093s">Needed</a>  projects, of course, is one that has to worry about city and school budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=259.857s">It's</a>  a lot of work that we are doing on our HVAC and our high school and now these roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=264.38s">nevermind</a>  city-side projects, but definitely getting at least 50% reimbursement is something that you just can't pass up trying to do when you have buildings that are 25 years old at this point and their roofs are at the life expectancy or gonna be there shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=282.615s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=284.196s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=286.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=288.179s">Is</a>  there an exact set of language that I should have the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=292.162s">Is</a>  that why Member Graham has her hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=295.354s">That's</a>  my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=296.166s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=299.997s">Yes,</a>  there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=300.997s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, this language that you've shared with me, I'm just going to pop in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=307.699s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=307.979s">And</a>  I'm happy to read it out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=309.379s">But</a>  I think the other piece of context for all of this, just so that if anybody else is listening besides the committee that's sort of been through all this with us, when we looked at the capital plan, which we approved back in December, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=326.231s">December,</a>  I believe it was December in that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=330.393s">We</a>  made recommendations to pursue these accelerated repair applications when the window opened, because at that time, what we did know is this window is open again for the 1st time in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=346.68s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=347.22s">I</a>  think it was open last year, potentially, but was closed to us when we would have needed to use it for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=356.404s">Um,</a>  the McGlynn Andrews project, and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=361.227s">The</a>  is doing a lot to try to combat. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=364.689s">Like,</a>  the sort of skyrocketing cost of construction across all of their projects, which is what led to them freezing this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=372.875s">So</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=374.216s">seems</a>  like it's the first program to freeze when something happens that is unexpected and I'm glad that we have this window open that we might be successful with one or multiple of these projects because at best if everything goes as planned this will not come around again for two years which means we would not know an answer for three years which means we're probably looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=403.507s">5</a>  years from now that, like, these things would be repaired and replaced and I am really worried based on what I hear about the. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=412.732s">Things</a>  like the roofs and the HVACs from the process that we've been going through with McGlynn and doing these many assessments to figure out how to submit these applications that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=424.057s">sometime</a>  between now and five years from now like we are going to be looking at all of these projects as non-optional projects so um i i know dr cushing has been like really hustling to get this done in collaboration with some of the team that is working on mclenny andrews um and just sort of trying to position us to take advantage of a potential grant so thank you dr cushing for <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=451.132s">Um,</a>  for doing that, and I will, I'll read this and I will also pop it in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=459.552s">This</a>  is just real quick, if I can, I apologize for interrupting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=464.533s">This</a>  language that is going to be read is extraordinarily specific and prescribed to the largest extent where specific things have been put in around the priority, the address of the school, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=477.817s">But</a>  otherwise, the language is prescribed by MSBA and specifically taken from their resources.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=486.152s">Thank</a>  you, which made it really easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=488.412s">So</a>  I didn't have to come up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=491.453s">So</a>  I will make a motion that reads having convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025, prior to the SOI submission closing date, the Medford school committee of the city of Medford in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances has voted to authorize a superintendent to submit to the Massachusetts school building authority, the statement of interest form dated March, 2025 for the Roberts elementary school <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=516.621s">located</a>  at, what is the exact address? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=522.703s">35</a>  Court Street, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=523.863s">I</a>  think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=526.784s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=528.684s">Court</a>  Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=535.646s">02155,</a>  which describes and explains the following deficiencies and the priority categories for which the application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=544.219s">Priority</a>  5 replacement, renovation or modern modernization of school facility systems, including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=556.166s">This</a>  work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the city of Medford as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=564.951s">In</a>  particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for staff and students to function at maximum learning capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=572.878s">The</a>  roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness, and hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=592.294s">or</a>  commits Medford Public Schools of the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=601.88s">And</a>  here it comes in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=609.745s">I</a>  am forever grateful you didn't expect me to type that up as it went, since you went.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=613.908s">Although</a>  it's not letting me send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=621.786s">Oh,</a>  it's too long.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=625.067s">Yes,</a>  there's a limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=626.968s">Member</a>  Graham, would you like me to share the document with members? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=634.011s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=636.612s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=638.913s">It</a>  is in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=640.254s">So</a>  what I just read, we can share with you if that works.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=646.496s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=648.29s">by</a>  Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=652.171s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=653.271s">Unless</a>  that's a problem because I have a child with the Roberts, but I assume that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=657.932s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's fine.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1028.343s">It's</a>  always hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1030.544s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1032.704s">Can</a>  you see it OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1033.425s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1037.086s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1038.446s">So</a>  for this meeting, I'm going to give an overview of what we found for enrollment projections for next year, how that translates in the class sizes projected, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1055.492s">a</a>  brief overview of chapter 70 budget and kind of how we divided up the override questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1066.538s">And</a>  then I'm gonna go through kind of the initial asks from all the principals and directors in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1079.784s">And</a>  there's gonna be a lot there and the bottom line is gonna be <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1085.241s">a</a>  little eye popping, but we're not suggesting that we're gonna attempt to fund everything that was asked for, but we do wanna encourage principals and directors to not be shy about stating what they think they need for their program.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1104.832s">Jerry,</a>  do you want us to save questions till the end?</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1108.013s">I</a>  guess I did allow for some time for questions at the end, but I suppose, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1116.0s">if</a>  there's any clarification that it might make sense to interrupt.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1124.522s">And</a>  sorry, while I'm here, will we get a copy of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1127.183s">I</a>  don't think it was in our- Yes.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1128.503s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1129.203s">Yes,</a>  we'll get it up on the website tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1136.145s">So</a>  we're predicting an increase in kindergarten enrollment, and of course, that's just a best guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1145.153s">I</a>  did note that there was 699 births in Medford for the year that the kindergarten class is entering. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1155.502s">I</a>  took an average of the percent of births in the prior three years that translated into kindergarten enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1169.673s">And</a>  then I made my projections based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1174.655s">You</a>  know, we'll of course keep an eye on that, you know, through the registration process, but we are proposing, you know, to have sufficient teachers to handle that increase in enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1193.928s">So</a>  the enrollment by grade, it's somewhat stable, although, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1200.813s">There's</a>  been this history in recent years where one kindergarten is high and then the next year the kindergarten is low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1207.777s">And</a>  then as these grades progress through the elementary, there's ups and downs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1214.721s">But</a>  we'll get to the total enrollment and it's somewhat stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1220.905s">This</a>  will necessitate principals to kind of move their teaching staff around because some <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1231.136s">You</a>  know, they might've had four grade twos this year, and they only have three grade threes next year, but one of those second grade teachers will probably have to move to grade three, unless they still needed four in grade two. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1248.006s">So</a>  we've accounted for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1250.187s">So</a>  there's your middle school grades and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1264.025s">And</a>  then I took a cut by school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1268.609s">So</a>  Roberts is really large. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1274.453s">So</a>  that's something that we should be keeping an eye on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1277.195s">And</a>  the rest of the schools are pretty close to what they had this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1285.461s">And</a>  some of that increased kindergarten enrollment is driving up that number for them slightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1294.95s">And</a>  then here's the middle schools are pretty stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1301.614s">And</a>  then the high school we expect will increase a little bit because of the ninth grade coming in and the Curtis Tufts will be somewhat stable this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1312.719s">And</a>  that really depends on, that's based on students we know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1318.122s">And</a>  there could be other students assigned to Curtis Tufts during the FY26 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1325.457s">And</a>  then these are the totals for the last three years, actual as of October 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1333.36s">And</a>  then based on the October 1, 24 enrollment, we use that as a baseline to form a projection for FY 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1348.026s">So</a>  about, you know, 34, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1352.612s">students,</a>  let's see, it's an increase of about 65 students, 34 is from the kindergarten enrollment, 23 is from the high school, and then the rest is kind of sprinkled around throughout the remaining schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1371.342s">So</a>  we did class size, you know, after I got some feedback from the principals this year, we changed a little bit how we're doing class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1382.204s">because</a>  I wasn't originally taking into account students that are mainstreamed in specialist classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1392.046s">So</a>  we tried this methodology this year where we took the number of regular ed grades in the school for a particular grade and then divided it by the total student enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1408.81s">And</a>  that will make sure that they, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1411.523s">specialists</a>  will have a reasonable caseload. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1418.048s">And</a>  these, I think, compared to other school districts I know about, these are pretty generous class sizes, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1429.036s">But</a>  Chapter 70, as we found out, kind of the basis for the override was the conclusion that the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1440.068s">Chapter</a>  70 budget and Chapter 70 state, the foundation budget and the Chapter 70 state aid really do not provide MEDFED with the funds they need to run their district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1456.821s">So</a>  there's a, right now this is based on the governor's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1463.465s">Chapter</a>  70 for MEDFED will increase by $338,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1470.002s">That's</a>  based on many school districts actually get the minimum state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1478.748s">They</a>  don't qualify for chapter 78, as is the case with MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1484.052s">So</a>  typically governors have begun this process by giving $30 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1494.179s">Governor</a>  Healey constructed her budget based on $75 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1500.712s">And</a>  if my memory serves last year at the conclusion of the state budget process, it was up to about $104 per pupil. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1510.678s">So</a>  hopefully that number will rise and give the city a little bit of extra funding to offset their appropriations school department.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1524.786s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1527.073s">I</a>  don't know if you can see the question from the mayor, but should that actually say FY25 and FY26?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1531.356s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't know if that was, sorry.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1538.761s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1539.941s">Okay,</a>  because you said it will be going up, so I thought FY25 were finalized.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1546.446s">Yeah,</a>  I think I used last year's template, and I did forget, but I'll fix that at the end of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1556.692s">presentation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1557.733s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1558.553s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1559.133s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1562.135s">And</a>  so then we had the ballot questions this year and thanks to the voters of Medford coming to the rescue, providing $7 million in additional budget authority for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1580.164s">Question</a>  seven provided $3 million for kind of general school expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1586.28s">And</a>  4 million was dedicated towards the creation of a high school schedule along with providing funds for teacher and paraprofessional compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1600.569s">So</a>  how this got divided up is we were grateful to the mayor and the city council who advanced one <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1613.844s">million,</a>  $750,000 to the school department to kind of finalize our school budget last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1624.829s">And</a>  it prevented further cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1626.85s">Everybody</a>  can remember there were a lot of cuts that had to be made in last year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1633.513s">So</a>  the city was willing to take a risk and provide those funds upfront and hoping that the override would pass, which it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1642.056s">So</a>  of the 7 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1645.529s">that</a>  1.7 was retained so it could go to fund the amount of money that the city already provided to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1655.313s">And</a>  that left $5,250,000 to add to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1656.853s">So</a>  basically this year we're working with a budget of $83 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1673.735s">And</a>  last year, I know the school committee was very interested in some of the special revenue funds that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1679.499s">So</a>  I'm gonna try to quickly go through the list of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1686.863s">So</a>  we have federal grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1690.405s">You'll</a>  see, I have a column for FTEs funded, and I haven't got to that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1697.629s">But</a>  particularly with the federal grants, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1701.773s">Those</a>  grants are at risk, as many of you are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1706.574s">So</a>  we really have to get a handle of who we're funding off of these grants and just be prepared in the event that funding is cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1717.738s">But</a>  that will be part of the budget narrative when you get the budget document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1725.82s">So</a>  we have our ESSER group, Title I, Title IIa, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1733.022s">Title</a>  one is for reading and math instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1736.343s">Title</a>  two A is professional development and maybe, is it class size? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1744.104s">You</a>  can use it for class size reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1747.285s">Title</a>  three is for our EL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1751.366s">And</a>  then we have this student support, academic enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1757.927s">That's</a>  the Saturday Academy, terrific, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1761.81s">And</a>  then the VOTE program has the Perkins Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1768.652s">Special</a>  Ed has the IDEA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1772.974s">We</a>  have a significant special needs population, which is why this amount is so high, and this funds teachers and medical contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1787.545s">other</a>  types of contracts that are needed for our special needs students and out-of-district tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1797.889s">There</a>  was a new IEP being mandated to be implemented, so we did receive some funds to implement that new IEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1808.994s">And</a>  then we get a separate IDEA funding that supports the preschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1820.238s">Then</a>  we got this year, we got vacation acceleration academies and Molly Lorden spearheaded an effort to take advantage of a cybersecurity grant that was available earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1840.767s">And</a>  we in fact were awarded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1845.769s">Our</a>  health services department <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1848.349s">receives</a>  comprehensive school health services grant from DPH. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1854.713s">And</a>  then we are a fiscal agent for Medford Family Network and they receive a federal grant, coordinated family and community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1866.721s">And</a>  then we had a small grant to support proficiency outcomes for our EL students and then the state <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1875.895s">uh,</a>  kicked in another $5,500 for that federal grant that we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1883.598s">Um,</a>  we also, um, had, uh, qualified for reimbursement for a portion of our out of district, uh, uh, tuitions and transportation, uh, over a certain amount, uh, any tuition that's over a certain amount of money that's based on your foundation per pupil amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1906.292s">75%</a>  of that difference is eligible for reimbursement from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1913.236s">So</a>  our special education department prepares an initial claim every year, and then we get reimbursement based on that claim. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1923.541s">And</a>  then in the last quarter, there's a reconciliation to get the actual student costs lined up with what we <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1935.423s">already</a>  received. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1937.784s">And</a>  we also get reimbursed for our homeless transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1944.606s">And</a>  we've never budgeted this, but this year I want to utilize some of these funds to offset our homeless transportation budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1955.17s">So</a>  I think we can free up maybe 300,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1960.078s">or</a>  all the way to 391 to kind of offset the homeless transportation in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1969.846s">And</a>  that provides us a little bit of relief to address other needs in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1979.974s">We</a>  have private grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1981.195s">We</a>  have the Crystal Campbell Betterment Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1984.818s">Cummings</a>  Foundation provides money for the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1990.356s">Center</a>  of Civic and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1996.661s">They</a>  also receive donations from the public, so that's in a third account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2002.586s">We</a>  have a scholarship in the memory of Leah Kalleri-Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2011.534s">We</a>  help the Medford Education Foundation manage the distribution of funds to our <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2018.186s">teachers</a>  that apply for grants through the Medford Education Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2026.833s">Another</a>  private grant is Children's Trust from Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2032.558s">That</a>  is in the deficit, but it's mainly, we're still kind of unraveling accounting problems with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2041.766s">They</a>  have several, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2045.8s">several</a>  pots of money, and then they have people could be funded over two or three different pots. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2052.002s">And</a>  if that's not executed perfectly, then you can get this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2058.284s">But</a>  this grant is well managed by the person that's assigned to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2063.986s">So</a>  that will, I'm not concerned about that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2069.047s">And</a>  by the way, these funds, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2072.108s">are</a>  only through the end of February and it's being compared to a full year's worth of funding from FY24. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2084.474s">And</a>  then Midford Family Network also does some fundraising and that goes into their gift account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2090.677s">And</a>  then the school department receives gifts and donations at various times and it goes into this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2102.818s">as</a>  well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2106.159s">And</a>  then for our revolving funds, oh, okay.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2111.22s">All</a>  right, just to clarify, that's the balance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2113.021s">That's</a>  not the spending on it?</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2115.141s">Yes,</a>  it's not the spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2116.902s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2117.742s">It's</a>  what's available after the spending.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2120.062s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2121.063s">I</a>  mean, I'm happy to, you know, maybe at a different time, we could kind of take a deeper dive into the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2130.658s">the</a>  revolving funds and we could get, I mean, I have a history of revenue and spending for each of these accounts.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2137.561s">No,</a>  I just wanted to make sure that was.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2140.703s">Yeah,</a>  it's not the spending, that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2143.985s">And</a>  the other thing about revolving funds is that the expenses hit right away, but the revenue typically lags because of reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2156.01s">It</a>  comes through a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2159.582s">fees</a>  come through the website, and then they have to be downloaded here at the school department, prepare a report that has to go up to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2169.308s">City</a>  Hall has to match it up with the deposit they received, and then it gets into the admin system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2176.012s">So</a>  the revenue does lag behind, and the balances at the end of the year will reflect all the revenue that was collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2190.288s">Let's</a>  see, so some of these, I mean, you're familiar with the early education program, Medford is fee-based, school lunch is fee-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2203.237s">Those</a>  balances are down mainly for the reason that I talked to you about it, but it's also the school lunch director is really doing a good job replacing equipment and updating equipment, utilizing those revolving funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2220.594s">school</a>  athletics, driver's ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2225.217s">We</a>  charge students if they break their Chromebook or they lose their Chromebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2233.983s">At</a>  one time we accepted students from out of district down at the Curtis Tufts and we charged tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2242.348s">So</a>  we do still have balance in that account which we use to charge one of the individuals <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2251.675s">teaching</a>  their kids corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2254.557s">Again,</a>  that's a situation where the revenue lags, the actual spending, but we've been, there's another thing that we're working on right now is that we've always had this practice of holding slots for employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2276.652s">And</a>  sometimes, you know, if you have a very efficient, soon to be mom, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2281.895s">She's</a>  on the phone four or five months ahead of when she needs it to make sure she gets a slot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2288.598s">And</a>  the budget is really based on almost full utilization of all the seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2295.24s">So</a>  that's creating a little bit of a problem with the revenue projections that we're trying to address now for next year.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2303.764s">Barry?</a> </p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2304.844s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2305.465s">Yes,</a>  Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2307.083s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2308.944s">The</a>  shore tuition going up is confusing, because I didn't think we had shore occupying any classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2314.327s">So</a>  was there money that shore owed us and we just got it?</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2318.369s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2318.769s">So</a>  it went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2320.43s">What</a>  typically happens when you have out of district students in your district, you can set up a revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2328.474s">And</a>  so this is a balance from back in the day when we collected tuition for those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2335.847s">And</a>  little by little, we've been kind of spending it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2338.568s">So</a>  you see, it goes from 176 at the end of 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2341.909s">It's</a>  down to 98 as of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2345.15s">Oh,</a>  there's an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2347.691s">The</a>  176 is 17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2349.251s">Oh,</a>  that should be a comma, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2352.432s">Okay,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2352.752s">I</a>  was confused by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2353.552s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2364.989s">catch</a>  there's no more there's no more revenue coming into that account and that that's also the same for uh vocational uh tuition as well um i think the last student that we have from out of district is a senior this year uh and then of course we have the before and after school program um the edgley field now these next two accounts one um you know the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2394.589s">In</a>  community schools, I don't know when the decision was made, but it was before my time, but I'm sure it was necessary to get through a tough budget year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2405.518s">But</a>  the director of athletics and his administrative assistant are charged to community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2418.068s">And</a>  it could have been that there were like sufficient <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2424.185s">funds</a>  in that year to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2427.047s">And</a>  of course, the director of athletics does have a responsibility for scheduling the people that rent our school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2437.414s">But</a>  it's really unsustainable because we don't have the rent coming in to cover those salaries anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2444.399s">So</a>  I think what we'll try to do before the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2449.352s">is</a>  finalized is figure out some kind of allocation method where it kind of makes sense for the director to be charged a portion to Edgeley Field, a portion to community schools, and a portion to the general fund, and the same for his administrative assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2467.347s">And</a>  that will provide some relief to this revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2473.345s">And</a>  then the pool, they're doing a little bit better, as you can see from the deficit is going down, but we did change the rates at the beginning of the year, so that's helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2489.756s">The</a>  other thing that I've done, one thing that also may be unsustainable in the pool is that the use of the pool by our own students <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2501.773s">uh,</a>  is important, but it's right now it's being absorbed into this fund, which doesn't have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2508.854s">Uh,</a>  so we can either, uh, so right now, um, I directed, um, the pool director to fund the chemicals that are used in the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2521.797s">We're</a>  funding those out of the facilities department right now to kind of compensate for the school use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2528.998s">But,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2530.005s">going</a>  forward, we might have to figure out some kind of allocation on the general fund to support the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2540.091s">And</a>  then finally, the Medford Family Network also has a revolving fund that they call the Parent-Child Account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2552.037s">You</a>  want me to, that was a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2554.919s">Do</a>  you wanna, let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2557.54s">Yeah,</a>  we're gonna get into, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2559.378s">kind</a>  of all the different asks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2562.199s">In</a>  the next few slides, I don't know if we wanna stop and entertain any questions so far.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2568.922s">I</a>  just have a question from the chair if I don't see any hands raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2574.064s">In</a>  the CFO world and maybe the superintendent too, where are we at with the federal uncertainty and how our schools <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2587.393s">you</a>  know, taking that into account and budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2589.434s">I</a>  know us mayors are talking about it on the city side mainly, but I have recently learned that there's a city or two that are nervous enough to be, is gonna be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2610.825s">affecting</a>  their budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2611.946s">So</a>  I just didn't know where we are, because you did have a slide with all the federal monies and grant monies that come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2617.728s">And</a>  I just, is there any of them that are of concern? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2622.19s">Are</a>  we hearing any word on any of them that they might be cut or reduced or anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2628.053s">Just</a>  so we can keep an eye on it.</p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2632.675s">I</a>  haven't heard any specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2634.595s">We</a>  definitely have to keep an eye on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2638.977s">I</a>  will try to budget <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2640.805s">some</a>  money in undesignated salaries to maybe address three or four positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2650.569s">What's</a>  unclear is whether the grants are going to be completely eliminated or are they simply eliminating the bureaucracy and giving the money or some portion of the money directly to the states. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2670.165s">you</a>  know, we'll just have to see what direction they go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2673.746s">But,</a>  you know, these are grants that affect every community, red states, blue states, urban, rural. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2688.412s">It's</a>  just, there'll be a lot of pushback, I think, if this attempts to cut them completely, so.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2697.647s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2698.047s">When</a>  you hear about, you know, cutting, you know, eliminating the Department of Education, it's possible that these programs will just move over to the United States Treasury and will be dispersed from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2709.776s">Did</a>  you want to say?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2713.239s">I</a>  was only going to just follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2714.86s">You</a>  know, the title grants are the ones that fall under ESSA, Every Student Succeeds Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2720.304s">They</a>  are the ones that are linked to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2725.319s">the</a>  competency determination and our compliance with making sure that we are compliant to the state standards and frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2735.742s">Right</a>  now for Title I in Medford, we are using it solely for early literacy and reading skills at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2744.744s">And</a>  to Jerry's point, Title II is a lot around professional development and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2751.346s">We</a>  do fund some consultancies in there, some of that <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2755.011s">funding</a>  is used to help us continue our partnership with Hill for Literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2760.554s">Title</a>  III, as he said, is through Paul Teixeira. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2763.075s">Title</a>  IV is a lot of stipends and used to, as it's stated here, support students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2771.76s">And</a>  a lot of our fiscal 25 funding went to help with the High School Saturday Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2781.536s">The</a>  only thing that I would say, there's definitely a lot of conversation going on, a lot of monitoring of the current situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2788.079s">There</a>  has been no change, but there is definitely some rhetoric around maybe, you know, just fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2798.744s">And</a>  if districts and states are not compliant with federal mandates and executive orders, you know, the threat is that this is the type of things that they will remove. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2811.68s">from</a>  funding districts federally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2815.602s">So</a>  of course it warrants monitoring, but at this time, there's no change.</p>
