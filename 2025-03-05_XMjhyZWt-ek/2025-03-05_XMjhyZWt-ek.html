    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=106.017s">Member</a>  so present, Mayor Lago-Kern.</p>

    <p>[8Kto7egzLDI_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=118.902s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=135.826s">Agenda</a>  item number three is the MSBA Accelerated Repair Statements of Interest, SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=143.48s">Dr.</a>  Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent, and this is concerning the district's intention to submit a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority MSBA accelerated program on behalf of the Roberts, the Misituck, and the Brooks Elementary Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=158.909s">Medford</a>  School Committee is hereby asked to approve three separate motions hereby authorizing the administration to formally submit the statement of interest <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=167.397s">For</a>  the schools listed below under priority five, replacement, renovation and modernization of school facility systems, such as roofs, windows, boilers, heating and ventilation systems to increase energy conservation and decrease energy related costs in school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=184.183s">Number</a>  one is the Roberts Elementary School roof and heat pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=187.948s">Two</a>  is Mississippi Tech Elementary School roof and heat pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=190.832s">And</a>  number three is Brooks Elementary School roof and heat pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=195.438s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, I don't know if you have anything to add before we take votes and discuss.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=200.353s">No,</a>  just appreciate the committee's consideration of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=204.938s">This</a>  window is open now until March 21st, and then we anticipate it will be closed for approximately two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=211.744s">So</a>  now is an opportunity to at least get into the pipeline and have the opportunity to make decisions as we move forward with these three schools.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=223.324s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=224.245s">And</a>  then, so the general public's aware, this is the same process we took, just a different category under MSBA as it relates to the work we're doing for the new high school, which we're now excited to share last week that we're in the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=242.243s">So</a>  this is just the first phase of trying to get that <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=246.667s">portion</a>  of these projects paid for through the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=249.649s">So</a>  I want to thank all that are working on these applications from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=255.093s">Needed</a>  projects, of course, is one that has to worry about city and school budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=259.857s">It's</a>  a lot of work that we are doing on our HVAC and our high school and now these roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=264.38s">nevermind</a>  city-side projects, but definitely getting at least 50% reimbursement is something that you just can't pass up trying to do when you have buildings that are 25 years old at this point and their roofs are at the life expectancy or gonna be there shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=282.615s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=284.196s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=286.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=288.179s">Is</a>  there an exact set of language that I should have the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=292.162s">Is</a>  that why Member Graham has her hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=295.354s">That's</a>  my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=296.166s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=299.997s">Yes,</a>  there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=300.997s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, this language that you've shared with me, I'm just going to pop in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=307.699s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=307.979s">And</a>  I'm happy to read it out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=309.379s">But</a>  I think the other piece of context for all of this, just so that if anybody else is listening besides the committee that's sort of been through all this with us, when we looked at the capital plan, which we approved back in December, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=326.231s">December,</a>  I believe it was December in that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=330.393s">We</a>  made recommendations to pursue these accelerated repair applications when the window opened, because at that time, what we did know is this window is open again for the 1st time in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=346.68s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=347.22s">I</a>  think it was open last year, potentially, but was closed to us when we would have needed to use it for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=356.404s">Um,</a>  the McGlynn Andrews project, and, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=361.227s">The</a>  is doing a lot to try to combat. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=364.689s">Like,</a>  the sort of skyrocketing cost of construction across all of their projects, which is what led to them freezing this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=372.875s">So</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=374.216s">seems</a>  like it's the first program to freeze when something happens that is unexpected and I'm glad that we have this window open that we might be successful with one or multiple of these projects because at best if everything goes as planned this will not come around again for two years which means we would not know an answer for three years which means we're probably looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=403.507s">5</a>  years from now that, like, these things would be repaired and replaced and I am really worried based on what I hear about the. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=412.732s">Things</a>  like the roofs and the HVACs from the process that we've been going through with McGlynn and doing these many assessments to figure out how to submit these applications that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=424.057s">sometime</a>  between now and five years from now like we are going to be looking at all of these projects as non-optional projects so um i i know dr cushing has been like really hustling to get this done in collaboration with some of the team that is working on mclenny andrews um and just sort of trying to position us to take advantage of a potential grant so thank you dr cushing for <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=451.132s">Um,</a>  for doing that, and I will, I'll read this and I will also pop it in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=459.552s">This</a>  is just real quick, if I can, I apologize for interrupting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=464.533s">This</a>  language that is going to be read is extraordinarily specific and prescribed to the largest extent where specific things have been put in around the priority, the address of the school, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=477.817s">But</a>  otherwise, the language is prescribed by MSBA and specifically taken from their resources.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=486.152s">Thank</a>  you, which made it really easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=488.412s">So</a>  I didn't have to come up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=491.453s">So</a>  I will make a motion that reads having convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025, prior to the SOI submission closing date, the Medford school committee of the city of Medford in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances has voted to authorize a superintendent to submit to the Massachusetts school building authority, the statement of interest form dated March, 2025 for the Roberts elementary school <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=516.621s">located</a>  at, what is the exact address? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=522.703s">35</a>  Court Street, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=523.863s">I</a>  think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=526.784s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=528.684s">Court</a>  Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=535.646s">02155,</a>  which describes and explains the following deficiencies and the priority categories for which the application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=544.219s">Priority</a>  5 replacement, renovation or modern modernization of school facility systems, including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=556.166s">This</a>  work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the city of Medford as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=564.951s">In</a>  particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for staff and students to function at maximum learning capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=572.878s">The</a>  roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness, and hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=592.294s">or</a>  commits Medford Public Schools of the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=601.88s">And</a>  here it comes in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=609.745s">I</a>  am forever grateful you didn't expect me to type that up as it went, since you went.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=613.908s">Although</a>  it's not letting me send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=621.786s">Oh,</a>  it's too long.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=625.067s">Yes,</a>  there's a limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=626.968s">Member</a>  Graham, would you like me to share the document with members? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=634.011s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=636.612s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=638.913s">It</a>  is in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=640.254s">So</a>  what I just read, we can share with you if that works.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=646.496s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=648.29s">by</a>  Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=652.171s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=653.271s">Unless</a>  that's a problem because I have a child with the Roberts, but I assume that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=657.932s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's fine.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1028.343s">It's</a>  always hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1030.544s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1032.704s">Can</a>  you see it OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1033.425s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1037.086s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1038.446s">So</a>  for this meeting, I'm going to give an overview of what we found for enrollment projections for next year, how that translates in the class sizes projected, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1055.492s">a</a>  brief overview of chapter 70 budget and kind of how we divided up the override questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1066.538s">And</a>  then I'm gonna go through kind of the initial asks from all the principals and directors in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1079.784s">And</a>  there's gonna be a lot there and the bottom line is gonna be <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1085.241s">a</a>  little eye popping, but we're not suggesting that we're gonna attempt to fund everything that was asked for, but we do wanna encourage principals and directors to not be shy about stating what they think they need for their program.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1104.832s">Jerry,</a>  do you want us to save questions till the end?</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1108.013s">I</a>  guess I did allow for some time for questions at the end, but I suppose, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1116.0s">if</a>  there's any clarification that it might make sense to interrupt.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1124.522s">And</a>  sorry, while I'm here, will we get a copy of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1127.183s">I</a>  don't think it was in our- Yes.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1128.503s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1129.203s">Yes,</a>  we'll get it up on the website tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1136.145s">So</a>  we're predicting an increase in kindergarten enrollment, and of course, that's just a best guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1145.153s">I</a>  did note that there was 699 births in Medford for the year that the kindergarten class is entering. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1155.502s">I</a>  took an average of the percent of births in the prior three years that translated into kindergarten enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1169.673s">And</a>  then I made my projections based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1174.655s">You</a>  know, we'll of course keep an eye on that, you know, through the registration process, but we are proposing, you know, to have sufficient teachers to handle that increase in enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1193.928s">So</a>  the enrollment by grade, it's somewhat stable, although, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1200.813s">There's</a>  been this history in recent years where one kindergarten is high and then the next year the kindergarten is low. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1207.777s">And</a>  then as these grades progress through the elementary, there's ups and downs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1214.721s">But</a>  we'll get to the total enrollment and it's somewhat stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1220.905s">This</a>  will necessitate principals to kind of move their teaching staff around because some <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1231.136s">You</a>  know, they might've had four grade twos this year, and they only have three grade threes next year, but one of those second grade teachers will probably have to move to grade three, unless they still needed four in grade two. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1248.006s">So</a>  we've accounted for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1250.187s">So</a>  there's your middle school grades and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1264.025s">And</a>  then I took a cut by school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1268.609s">So</a>  Roberts is really large. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1274.453s">So</a>  that's something that we should be keeping an eye on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1277.195s">And</a>  the rest of the schools are pretty close to what they had this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1285.461s">And</a>  some of that increased kindergarten enrollment is driving up that number for them slightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1294.95s">And</a>  then here's the middle schools are pretty stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1301.614s">And</a>  then the high school we expect will increase a little bit because of the ninth grade coming in and the Curtis Tufts will be somewhat stable this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1312.719s">And</a>  that really depends on, that's based on students we know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1318.122s">And</a>  there could be other students assigned to Curtis Tufts during the FY26 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1325.457s">And</a>  then these are the totals for the last three years, actual as of October 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1333.36s">And</a>  then based on the October 1, 24 enrollment, we use that as a baseline to form a projection for FY 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1348.026s">So</a>  about, you know, 34, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1352.612s">students,</a>  let's see, it's an increase of about 65 students, 34 is from the kindergarten enrollment, 23 is from the high school, and then the rest is kind of sprinkled around throughout the remaining schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1371.342s">So</a>  we did class size, you know, after I got some feedback from the principals this year, we changed a little bit how we're doing class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1382.204s">because</a>  I wasn't originally taking into account students that are mainstreamed in specialist classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1392.046s">So</a>  we tried this methodology this year where we took the number of regular ed grades in the school for a particular grade and then divided it by the total student enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1408.81s">And</a>  that will make sure that they, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1411.523s">specialists</a>  will have a reasonable caseload. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1418.048s">And</a>  these, I think, compared to other school districts I know about, these are pretty generous class sizes, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1429.036s">But</a>  Chapter 70, as we found out, kind of the basis for the override was the conclusion that the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1440.068s">Chapter</a>  70 budget and Chapter 70 state, the foundation budget and the Chapter 70 state aid really do not provide MEDFED with the funds they need to run their district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1456.821s">So</a>  there's a, right now this is based on the governor's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1463.465s">Chapter</a>  70 for MEDFED will increase by $338,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1470.002s">That's</a>  based on many school districts actually get the minimum state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1478.748s">They</a>  don't qualify for chapter 78, as is the case with MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1484.052s">So</a>  typically governors have begun this process by giving $30 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1494.179s">Governor</a>  Healey constructed her budget based on $75 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1500.712s">And</a>  if my memory serves last year at the conclusion of the state budget process, it was up to about $104 per pupil. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1510.678s">So</a>  hopefully that number will rise and give the city a little bit of extra funding to offset their appropriations school department.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1524.786s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1527.073s">I</a>  don't know if you can see the question from the mayor, but should that actually say FY25 and FY26?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1531.356s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't know if that was, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1538.761s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1539.941s">Okay,</a>  because you said it will be going up, so I thought FY25 were finalized.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1546.446s">Yeah,</a>  I think I used last year's template, and I did forget, but I'll fix that at the end of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1556.692s">presentation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1557.733s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1558.553s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1559.133s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1562.135s">And</a>  so then we had the ballot questions this year and thanks to the voters of Medford coming to the rescue, providing $7 million in additional budget authority for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1580.164s">Question</a>  seven provided $3 million for kind of general school expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1586.28s">And</a>  4 million was dedicated towards the creation of a high school schedule along with providing funds for teacher and paraprofessional compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1600.569s">So</a>  how this got divided up is we were grateful to the mayor and the city council who advanced one <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1613.844s">million,</a>  $750,000 to the school department to kind of finalize our school budget last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1624.829s">And</a>  it prevented further cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1626.85s">Everybody</a>  can remember there were a lot of cuts that had to be made in last year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1633.513s">So</a>  the city was willing to take a risk and provide those funds upfront and hoping that the override would pass, which it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1642.056s">So</a>  of the 7 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1645.529s">that</a>  1.7 was retained so it could go to fund the amount of money that the city already provided to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1655.313s">And</a>  that left $5,250,000 to add to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1656.853s">So</a>  basically this year we're working with a budget of $83 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1673.735s">And</a>  last year, I know the school committee was very interested in some of the special revenue funds that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1679.499s">So</a>  I'm gonna try to quickly go through the list of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1686.863s">So</a>  we have federal grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1690.405s">You'll</a>  see, I have a column for FTEs funded, and I haven't got to that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1697.629s">But</a>  particularly with the federal grants, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1701.773s">Those</a>  grants are at risk, as many of you are aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1706.574s">So</a>  we really have to get a handle of who we're funding off of these grants and just be prepared in the event that funding is cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1717.738s">But</a>  that will be part of the budget narrative when you get the budget document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1725.82s">So</a>  we have our ESSER group, Title I, Title IIa, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1733.022s">Title</a>  one is for reading and math instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1736.343s">Title</a>  two A is professional development and maybe, is it class size? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1744.104s">You</a>  can use it for class size reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1747.285s">Title</a>  three is for our EL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1751.366s">And</a>  then we have this student support, academic enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1757.927s">That's</a>  the Saturday Academy, terrific, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1761.81s">And</a>  then the VOTE program has the Perkins Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1768.652s">Special</a>  Ed has the IDEA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1772.974s">We</a>  have a significant special needs population, which is why this amount is so high, and this funds teachers and medical contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1787.545s">other</a>  types of contracts that are needed for our special needs students and out-of-district tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1797.889s">There</a>  was a new IEP being mandated to be implemented, so we did receive some funds to implement that new IEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1808.994s">And</a>  then we get a separate IDEA funding that supports the preschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1820.238s">Then</a>  we got this year, we got vacation acceleration academies and Molly Lorden spearheaded an effort to take advantage of a cybersecurity grant that was available earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1840.767s">And</a>  we in fact were awarded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1845.769s">Our</a>  health services department <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1848.349s">receives</a>  comprehensive school health services grant from DPH. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1854.713s">And</a>  then we are a fiscal agent for Medford Family Network and they receive a federal grant, coordinated family and community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1866.721s">And</a>  then we had a small grant to support proficiency outcomes for our EL students and then the state <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1875.895s">uh,</a>  kicked in another $5,500 for that federal grant that we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1883.598s">Um,</a>  we also, um, had, uh, qualified for reimbursement for a portion of our out of district, uh, uh, tuitions and transportation, uh, over a certain amount, uh, any tuition that's over a certain amount of money that's based on your foundation per pupil amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1906.292s">75%</a>  of that difference is eligible for reimbursement from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1913.236s">So</a>  our special education department prepares an initial claim every year, and then we get reimbursement based on that claim. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1923.541s">And</a>  then in the last quarter, there's a reconciliation to get the actual student costs lined up with what we <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1935.423s">already</a>  received. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1937.784s">And</a>  we also get reimbursed for our homeless transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1944.606s">And</a>  we've never budgeted this, but this year I want to utilize some of these funds to offset our homeless transportation budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1955.17s">So</a>  I think we can free up maybe 300,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1960.078s">or</a>  all the way to 391 to kind of offset the homeless transportation in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1969.846s">And</a>  that provides us a little bit of relief to address other needs in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1979.974s">We</a>  have private grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1981.195s">We</a>  have the Crystal Campbell Betterment Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1984.818s">Cummings</a>  Foundation provides money for the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1990.356s">Center</a>  of Civic and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1996.661s">They</a>  also receive donations from the public, so that's in a third account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2002.586s">We</a>  have a scholarship in the memory of Leah Kalleri-Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2011.534s">We</a>  help the Medford Education Foundation manage the distribution of funds to our <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2018.186s">teachers</a>  that apply for grants through the Medford Education Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2026.833s">Another</a>  private grant is Children's Trust from Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2032.558s">That</a>  is in the deficit, but it's mainly, we're still kind of unraveling accounting problems with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2041.766s">They</a>  have several, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2045.8s">several</a>  pots of money, and then they have people could be funded over two or three different pots. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2052.002s">And</a>  if that's not executed perfectly, then you can get this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2058.284s">But</a>  this grant is well managed by the person that's assigned to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2063.986s">So</a>  that will, I'm not concerned about that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2069.047s">And</a>  by the way, these funds, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2072.108s">are</a>  only through the end of February and it's being compared to a full year's worth of funding from FY24. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2084.474s">And</a>  then Midford Family Network also does some fundraising and that goes into their gift account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2090.677s">And</a>  then the school department receives gifts and donations at various times and it goes into this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2102.818s">as</a>  well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2106.159s">And</a>  then for our revolving funds, oh, okay.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2111.22s">All</a>  right, just to clarify, that's the balance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2113.021s">That's</a>  not the spending on it?</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2115.141s">Yes,</a>  it's not the spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2116.902s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2117.742s">It's</a>  what's available after the spending.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2120.062s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2121.063s">I</a>  mean, I'm happy to, you know, maybe at a different time, we could kind of take a deeper dive into the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2130.658s">the</a>  revolving funds and we could get, I mean, I have a history of revenue and spending for each of these accounts.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2137.561s">No,</a>  I just wanted to make sure that was.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2140.703s">Yeah,</a>  it's not the spending, that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2143.985s">And</a>  the other thing about revolving funds is that the expenses hit right away, but the revenue typically lags because of reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2156.01s">It</a>  comes through a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2159.582s">fees</a>  come through the website, and then they have to be downloaded here at the school department, prepare a report that has to go up to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2169.308s">City</a>  Hall has to match it up with the deposit they received, and then it gets into the admin system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2176.012s">So</a>  the revenue does lag behind, and the balances at the end of the year will reflect all the revenue that was collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2190.288s">Let's</a>  see, so some of these, I mean, you're familiar with the early education program, Medford is fee-based, school lunch is fee-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2203.237s">Those</a>  balances are down mainly for the reason that I talked to you about it, but it's also the school lunch director is really doing a good job replacing equipment and updating equipment, utilizing those revolving funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2220.594s">school</a>  athletics, driver's ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2225.217s">We</a>  charge students if they break their Chromebook or they lose their Chromebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2233.983s">At</a>  one time we accepted students from out of district down at the Curtis Tufts and we charged tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2242.348s">So</a>  we do still have balance in that account which we use to charge one of the individuals <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2251.675s">teaching</a>  their kids corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2254.557s">Again,</a>  that's a situation where the revenue lags, the actual spending, but we've been, there's another thing that we're working on right now is that we've always had this practice of holding slots for employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2276.652s">And</a>  sometimes, you know, if you have a very efficient, soon to be mom, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2281.895s">She's</a>  on the phone four or five months ahead of when she needs it to make sure she gets a slot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2288.598s">And</a>  the budget is really based on almost full utilization of all the seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2295.24s">So</a>  that's creating a little bit of a problem with the revenue projections that we're trying to address now for next year.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2303.764s">Barry?</a> </p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2304.844s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2305.465s">Yes,</a>  Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2307.083s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2308.944s">The</a>  shore tuition going up is confusing, because I didn't think we had shore occupying any classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2314.327s">So</a>  was there money that shore owed us and we just got it?</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2318.369s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2318.769s">So</a>  it went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2320.43s">What</a>  typically happens when you have out of district students in your district, you can set up a revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2328.474s">And</a>  so this is a balance from back in the day when we collected tuition for those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2335.847s">And</a>  little by little, we've been kind of spending it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2338.568s">So</a>  you see, it goes from 176 at the end of 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2341.909s">It's</a>  down to 98 as of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2345.15s">Oh,</a>  there's an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2347.691s">The</a>  176 is 17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2349.251s">Oh,</a>  that should be a comma, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2352.432s">Okay,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2352.752s">I</a>  was confused by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2353.552s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2364.989s">catch</a>  there's no more there's no more revenue coming into that account and that that's also the same for uh vocational uh tuition as well um i think the last student that we have from out of district is a senior this year uh and then of course we have the before and after school program um the edgley field now these next two accounts one um you know the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2394.589s">In</a>  community schools, I don't know when the decision was made, but it was before my time, but I'm sure it was necessary to get through a tough budget year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2405.518s">But</a>  the director of athletics and his administrative assistant are charged to community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2418.068s">And</a>  it could have been that there were like sufficient <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2424.185s">funds</a>  in that year to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2427.047s">And</a>  of course, the director of athletics does have a responsibility for scheduling the people that rent our school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2437.414s">But</a>  it's really unsustainable because we don't have the rent coming in to cover those salaries anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2444.399s">So</a>  I think what we'll try to do before the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2449.352s">is</a>  finalized is figure out some kind of allocation method where it kind of makes sense for the director to be charged a portion to Edgeley Field, a portion to community schools, and a portion to the general fund, and the same for his administrative assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2467.347s">And</a>  that will provide some relief to this revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2473.345s">And</a>  then the pool, they're doing a little bit better, as you can see from the deficit is going down, but we did change the rates at the beginning of the year, so that's helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2489.756s">The</a>  other thing that I've done, one thing that also may be unsustainable in the pool is that the use of the pool by our own students <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2501.773s">uh,</a>  is important, but it's right now it's being absorbed into this fund, which doesn't have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2508.854s">Uh,</a>  so we can either, uh, so right now, um, I directed, um, the pool director to fund the chemicals that are used in the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2521.797s">We're</a>  funding those out of the facilities department right now to kind of compensate for the school use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2528.998s">But,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2530.005s">going</a>  forward, we might have to figure out some kind of allocation on the general fund to support the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2540.091s">And</a>  then finally, the Medford Family Network also has a revolving fund that they call the Parent-Child Account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2552.037s">You</a>  want me to, that was a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2554.919s">Do</a>  you wanna, let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2557.54s">Yeah,</a>  we're gonna get into, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2559.378s">kind</a>  of all the different asks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2562.199s">In</a>  the next few slides, I don't know if we wanna stop and entertain any questions so far.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2568.922s">I</a>  just have a question from the chair if I don't see any hands raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2574.064s">In</a>  the CFO world and maybe the superintendent too, where are we at with the federal uncertainty and how our schools <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2587.393s">you</a>  know, taking that into account and budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2589.434s">I</a>  know us mayors are talking about it on the city side mainly, but I have recently learned that there's a city or two that are nervous enough to be, is gonna be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2610.825s">affecting</a>  their budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2611.946s">So</a>  I just didn't know where we are, because you did have a slide with all the federal monies and grant monies that come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2617.728s">And</a>  I just, is there any of them that are of concern? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2622.19s">Are</a>  we hearing any word on any of them that they might be cut or reduced or anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2628.053s">Just</a>  so we can keep an eye on it.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2632.675s">I</a>  haven't heard any specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2634.595s">We</a>  definitely have to keep an eye on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2638.977s">I</a>  will try to budget <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2640.805s">some</a>  money in undesignated salaries to maybe address three or four positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2650.569s">What's</a>  unclear is whether the grants are going to be completely eliminated or are they simply eliminating the bureaucracy and giving the money or some portion of the money directly to the states. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2670.165s">you</a>  know, we'll just have to see what direction they go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2673.746s">But,</a>  you know, these are grants that affect every community, red states, blue states, urban, rural. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2688.412s">It's</a>  just, there'll be a lot of pushback, I think, if this attempts to cut them completely, so.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2697.647s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2698.047s">When</a>  you hear about, you know, cutting, you know, eliminating the Department of Education, it's possible that these programs will just move over to the United States Treasury and will be dispersed from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2709.776s">Did</a>  you want to say?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2713.239s">I</a>  was only going to just follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2714.86s">You</a>  know, the title grants are the ones that fall under ESSA, Every Student Succeeds Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2720.304s">They</a>  are the ones that are linked to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2725.319s">the</a>  competency determination and our compliance with making sure that we are compliant to the state standards and frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2735.742s">Right</a>  now for Title I in Medford, we are using it solely for early literacy and reading skills at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2744.744s">And</a>  to Jerry's point, Title II is a lot around professional development and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2751.346s">We</a>  do fund some consultancies in there, some of that <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2755.011s">funding</a>  is used to help us continue our partnership with Hill for Literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2760.554s">Title</a>  III, as he said, is through Paul Teixeira. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2763.075s">Title</a>  IV is a lot of stipends and used to, as it's stated here, support students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2771.76s">And</a>  a lot of our fiscal 25 funding went to help with the High School Saturday Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2781.536s">The</a>  only thing that I would say, there's definitely a lot of conversation going on, a lot of monitoring of the current situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2788.079s">There</a>  has been no change, but there is definitely some rhetoric around maybe, you know, just fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2798.744s">And</a>  if districts and states are not compliant with federal mandates and executive orders, you know, the threat is that this is the type of things that they will remove. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2811.68s">from</a>  funding districts federally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2815.602s">So</a>  of course it warrants monitoring, but at this time, there's no change.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2823.065s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Guzzi. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2826.547s">And</a>  Member Graham?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2831.622s">Thank</a>  you, I just I saw I got a couple of questions related to this from a constituent and on the same day, I saw 1 of our representatives post about this very topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2846.874s">So</a>  I just dug up her post and I'm going to put it in the chat to sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2853.764s">frame</a>  like how does money come to us like there's very little money that comes directly to us directly from the feds um so um i just thought this was like a helpful context oh it's too big um i'm just going to give you the facebook link i guess because i can't give you the whole quote um but um <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2879.893s">I</a>  find her to be very helpful and factual in her understanding of how school funding works. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2888.861s">She's</a>  sort of a legend in Massachusetts, and she should be in a much more broad way than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2895.087s">I</a>  don't know if that will actually take you to her post. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2900.212s">Let</a>  me, I will send it to you all separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2906.474s">And</a>  her name is Tracy O'Connell Novick, and she is a wealth of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2912.456s">So</a>  I'm happy to read it to you all, but she basically, she says, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2921.775s">that</a>  something I see a lot, perhaps, of people perhaps simply not knowing how federal aid to school districts works. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2927.84s">In</a>  the vast majority of cases, federal aid to school districts goes through state ed agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2932.483s">There</a>  are some exceptions, and this doesn't, for example, speak to DOD schools or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2938.288s">Districts</a>  are not on their own, though, for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2940.369s">Your</a>  federal aid is conditioned on written agreements between the state and federal governments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2944.292s">There</a>  is no TAP that runs directly to your school district, and thus, this isn't every little school district's fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2954.571s">You</a>  know, the world changes, like, every minute right now, but that is helpful context. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2962.434s">So</a>  for all of our, like, wishes about what Dessie might do differently in the world right now, I think we're all on that same side. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2975.198s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2975.798s">But</a>  just point, I mean, I do think that's important to also note though, because there is a difference, right, between competitive grants and non-competitive grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2984.063s">And</a>  most, not all, but like most of these grants that Jerry is highlighting, we receive an allocation based on our demographics, our enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2994.408s">And</a>  so we're kind of assigned the amount that we have to work with and budget for in the various categories.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3010.26s">Okay,</a>  so I wanted just to give you an idea of what the principals and program directors have been asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3022.632s">We've</a>  made some tentative decisions on things we might include in the budget, but it's very limited right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3035.89s">where</a>  we know we're gonna have, we have to provide a reserve for our collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3044.252s">And</a>  we do have teachers, we do have staff that are under agreement with the collective bargaining that will have an increase next year, that has to be accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3059.216s">And</a>  most people have step increases <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3063.014s">or</a>  a lot of people have step increases that also have to be accounted for too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3066.917s">So</a>  once that's taken care of, then we can kind of address some of these other needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3074.842s">And</a>  this is kind of right now where I'm at. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3080.406s">There's</a>  still a handful of budgets that I really haven't gone through with a fine tooth comb, but we, and keep in mind that the numbers that I, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3093.073s">you're</a>  looking at is not a budget number, it's the increase over FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3101.399s">So,</a>  we're anticipating we'll have to increase our reserve for expiring collective buying agreements by 1.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3114.347s">We've</a>  already plugged in FY26 salaries for everybody if they <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3123.21s">If</a>  they are under a collective bargaining agreement in FY26, we used whatever was proposed for that employee for FY26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3133.997s">If</a>  they're not, we're using their current amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3141.482s">And</a>  those funds are provided on that first line under our reserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3148.595s">We</a>  have a handful of unforeseen expenses that we had to add to FY25 after the budget was approved, and I'll go through that list with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3162.625s">We</a>  have tentatively sought to include some new spending, and then I'll go through the list I want to see just to give you an idea of what's being asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3178.97s">is</a>  kind of to be determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3181.031s">That</a>  totals 2.7 million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3186.214s">And,</a>  you know, there's no expectation that we're gonna be able to fund everything that was asked for, but all the expenses will be evaluated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3198.683s">Some</a>  of the asks, it may, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3202.74s">behoove</a>  us to wait until the new school schedules are established. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3211.689s">So</a>  I'm going to switch to a different spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3217.655s">So</a>  I'm going to stop sharing this one and</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3239.892s">Oh,</a>  sorry, the wrong one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3250.82s">Here</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3258.906s">Okay,</a>  so this is a new spending that we've included so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3264.83s">And</a>  again, we kind of reserve the right to <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3267.797s">to</a>  take some of these off if we have to demalice the budget, but we do want to increase our capacity in our tech area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3282.424s">We</a>  identified this year every single software application that we're using, and it totals close to $800,000 worth of annual licenses <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3298.175s">So</a>  we know that our students and staff are using a lot of this technology for research, for instruction, for professional development, for keeping track of our students with demographic information, keeping track of their grades and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3326.738s">you</a>  know, we have to have a reliable network. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3330.179s">And</a>  what this will do is that the kind of the network support is within the group of people that are under Molly Layden that support the school, the teachers and the students with getting their computers running, their printers running. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3353.588s">So</a>  we intend to keep those <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3355.527s">that</a>  same number of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3357.569s">This</a>  gives us an extra position that can deal exclusively with network issues and we'll be able to serve the staff and students better in the school with the compliment of staff that we have there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3376.583s">And</a>  then we have, you know, aging service and <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3382.998s">uninterrupted</a>  power supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3386.86s">These</a>  power supplies would keep our computers running in the event of a power outage and a lot of them don't work or they're beyond their life expectancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3398.345s">We</a>  have a separate project going to replace air conditioning that's in the computer rooms at each school too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3408.269s">So</a>  a lot of those are out and of course that creates a very <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3413.13s">risky</a>  situation when those rooms heat up too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3422.753s">We</a>  do think we have sufficient teachers to implement those class sizes that I showed you earlier, except we would need another elementary teacher at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3441.193s">So</a>  we're kind of a little bit back and forth whether we should hold back on that and wait until we get closer to the start of the school year to see if those additional students materialize. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3452.88s">But</a>  right now we're suggesting that we wanna go forward with that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3463.026s">Yeah,</a>  I had a meeting with the principals and we went over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3471.787s">the</a>  number of teachers they have per class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3473.828s">So</a>  I know there was a concern with the Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3477.529s">In</a>  fact, that will be on the list that I showed you, but all the, I believe all the teachers that the principals need in the elementary schools are provided for in the budget right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3495.473s">And</a>  we can go, if you wanted to see kind of details about <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3500.395s">how</a>  many classrooms we have at each grade at each school, we can certainly go through that at another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3508.462s">The</a>  world language director asked for a stipend to provide a French II. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3518.423s">Of</a>  course, an existing teacher would pick up an extra section to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3523.847s">Of</a>  course, with the new schedule, there may be no need for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3527.55s">It</a>  might be able to be absorbed, but we'll keep an eye on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3534.235s">When</a>  we approved our compensation plan for hourly rates, we identified security monitors as a possible <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3547.762s">security</a>  monitor substitutes as a possible need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3551.963s">So</a>  this will provide a small budget, at least initially, if we utilize a daily sub for security monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3565.948s">And</a>  we are expanding the number of students that can take the PSAT, sophomores and juniors <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3576.764s">I</a>  think at all, all sophomores and juniors, I think are contemplated to take the PSAT next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3583.466s">And</a>  so that requires an increase to that subsidy of $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3589.307s">The</a>  current budget is $4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3596.509s">Now</a>  for budget adjustments, these are, let me see if I can make this a little bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3612.053s">So</a>  these are things, you know, for operations we had because of, we had students move into the district that required one-on-one paras that come to the district with IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3627.581s">And</a>  we had to put on three one-on-one paras at the Mississauga and an additional special ed para at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3642.081s">We</a>  also, we currently fund lunch monitors in the lunch fund, which is not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3653.33s">We</a>  will get written up by DESI if we haven't already done so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3658.375s">So</a>  we'll propose to bring those salaries onto the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3669.644s">We</a>  have two, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3671.075s">pieces</a>  of software that are no longer eligible for grant funding that are integral to our instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3679.141s">One</a>  is ST Math software, and the other is the MAP assessment program that we will have to provide for in the general fund next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3699.998s">This</a>  year, to deal with vacancies and illnesses at the vocational school, we added a building sub, although, no, we added an academic lead, I think, to support the vocational program, and that is working very well right now, and so we're <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3727.002s">proposing</a>  that we add that to the budget next year when we fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3734.444s">We</a>  also have frequently used daily subs in the health services program, but we don't really have a budget for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3743.967s">So</a>  we're gonna establish a budget in FY26 for those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3752.83s">For</a>  security monitors, one security monitor <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3757.009s">was</a>  added this year because we have one night shift building monitor at the high school and we weren't able to provide that building monitor with a work-free dinner at the appropriate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3780.298s">We</a>  also had some concerns with coverage over on the pool side. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3786.233s">on</a>  a door on that side. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3787.454s">So</a>  we added a building monitor for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3792.836s">And</a>  then in reviewing the staff, so we take a kind of look, we look at, you know, the FTEs that were authorized in FY25 versus what we actually have in the payroll and a additional security monitor popped up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3812.184s">So</a>  through, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3814.567s">miscommunication,</a>  I think, that a position got filled that didn't really exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3818.808s">So</a>  we're kind of evaluating, you know, how we want to deal with that second position right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3825.389s">But</a>  one is definitely needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3830.29s">And</a>  then, as I said, we went through all the instructional software that's used throughout the building and throughout the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3840.593s">And</a>  these, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3843.352s">You</a>  know, as these became available, my guess is that people would just kind of figure out accounts they already had that they might have some slack in a particular year to fold in software. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3860.758s">So</a>  sometimes it was charged to textbooks, sometimes it was charged to instructional supplies, sometimes to contract services, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3872.968s">But</a>  for interview reporting, it should be reported under a category that's called instructional software. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3879.752s">So</a>  we've identified all those and for what we need to get those accounts right size, we would have to add $58,000 to various accounts over the school system to make sure that those, that software is fully <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3902.733s">funded.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3904.294s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3910.739s">Jerry,</a>  I may ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3914.261s">I</a>  know every year the city adds like a position or two and then the schools is moving things around and maybe does the same, adds several positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3924.308s">This</a>  year we're adding quite a few more than that, obviously, because of the overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3930.632s">Are</a>  you budgeting at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3932.933s">on</a>  the school side for the 20,000 plus per person it costs for insurance, or is that something that would be doing on the city side? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3943.281s">Just</a>  pointing it out, because I know the school side alone is 11, maybe 11 and a half million for insurance.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3950.266s">Right,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3952.588s">Well,</a>  I think that the practice here, Mayor, is that that was always accounted for on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3962.503s">But,</a>  you know, we could have a conversation if you wanted these people are already on the payroll so they're already baked into FY 25.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3973.073s">Okay,</a>  on this page. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3974.554s">I</a>  just, this page and I know there's been a few others with new proposed positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3979.197s">So</a>  that's why I think it's going to be more than usual with the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3983.779s">So</a>  I just wanted to point that out because it's just a large expense for a city and school that we, yeah, I think we do take on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3991.704s">So</a>  I didn't know if you were budgeting that 20,000 or so or more per person per new hire.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=3997.087s">We</a>  are not yet, but you would have the increase in the chapter 70 <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4003.74s">um,</a>  to help support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4006.422s">Um,</a>  and I don't think at the end of the day, um, the, the, the, the, the question eight was really to address compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4022.073s">So</a>  not to add people, uh, and then question three, I mean, question seven, uh, the 3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4032.851s">is</a>  basically stabilizing some of these budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4036.372s">Like</a>  this is how we're fully funding our instructional software and looking at facilities maintenance and the needs of our technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4049.054s">So</a>  I think you'll find that we're not really in a position to add a lot of new staff in my mind right now.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4059.477s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4066.258s">And</a>  so, I wanted to just kind of give you an idea of what the principals and directors were asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4077.86s">At</a>  the high school, the principal would like to start, oh, she asked for funds for Acceleration Academy, and I think we have that covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4088.662s">Is</a>  that covered in the grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4091.642s">Oh,</a>  that's a Saturday.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4092.683s">The</a>  Saturday Academy, yes.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4094.703s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4096.108s">not</a>  the Acceleration Academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4098.349s">She's</a>  very interested in establishing an alternative program at the high school in that this program would be similar to the Curtis Tufts, but different from the Curtis Tufts, these would students that don't have identified special needs, but need smaller groups and kind of a little extra therapeutic support <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4126.385s">And</a>  she does have a grand vision for this program, but what we are looking at is kind of more or less a pilot and start out with a small group of students and see how that works out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4143.531s">And</a>  there'd be a lead siteman attached to kind of take care of some administrative duties within that approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4154.708s">more</a>  funds for the summer school, an advisory, I guess this would be a curriculum committee for SEL, whiteboards. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4170.881s">She'd</a>  like to add funds for bathroom duty, but that's something that I haven't taken a look at yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4178.547s">And</a>  you'll see, she asked for a number of positions which are <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4184.425s">are</a>  listed under the directors, but our teacher, band teacher, which we took care of in the supplemental theater teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4196.85s">Three</a>  were language teachers, and we'll give a few more details in a minute on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4204.574s">And</a>  then two engagement specialists that would support working with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4213.607s">address</a>  attendance and behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4218.308s">At</a>  the Vogue program, we more or less took care of a lot of the asks through the supplemental. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4225.27s">He</a>  is looking for an assistant due to increases in his program, enrollment in his program, and just somebody to help out with the administrative duties at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4244.153s">The</a>  Andrews principal asked for a full or part-time special ed meeting teacher and was looking for either a para or a behavior specialist to run a in-school suspension program with a restorative practices curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4268.297s">At</a>  the McGlynn, we did talk about the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4274.674s">administrative</a>  assistant position, and that got added in the supplemental. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4279.177s">He</a>  is also looking for funds to utilize a guidance Councilor to help with the schedule over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4288.261s">The</a>  MISADUC asked for grade two, which we've provided for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4292.402s">The</a>  Roberts was looking for a special ed reading teacher, a BCBA, and a math interventionist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4304.251s">The</a>  ELA director asked if we consider two literacy interventionists at each middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4315.64s">The</a>  world language director was interested in restoring one Spanish teacher that was cut in 25, and then adding a second Spanish teacher to expand offerings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4329.064s">And</a>  to, sorry, there's a typo there, but to create a sign language strand within her department as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4341.451s">And</a>  then the extra section for French too, which we've tentatively signed off on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4350.016s">And</a>  then we, for math, we had this ST Math that we're bringing into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4358.779s">Next</a>  year, she did offer to reduce her supply line because based on her needs, they're well, they have less of a need for textbooks and supplies because of the technology that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4380.991s">The</a>  athletics, I haven't been able to go through and I will within the next few days, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4389.205s">They've</a>  been typically running over their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4393.406s">So</a>  I want to look at, you know, how we can structure that account to figure out what are we going to charge to the athletic revolving fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4404.169s">And</a>  then what do we want to provide for in the, in the general fund budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4412.424s">The</a>  Food Service Director provided for new appliances at the various schools and she has sufficient funding in her evolving fund for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4423.776s">Visual</a>  and Performing Arts would like to add an art teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4428.581s">And</a>  again, this was kind of thinking similar to world language that there might be a need for more <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4437.487s">more</a>  of these types of sections when the new schedule gets created, but that I think is to be determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4446.409s">We</a>  restored the band teacher at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4450.629s">She</a>  also asked that the theater teacher be restored and have a part-time elementary band teacher and then increase her supply line by $4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4467.327s">uh,</a>  which I think is, you know, has merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4474.271s">At</a>  the buildings and grounds, we, we, um, we added when we finally settled the Teamstess contract, we were able to add two swing stiff custodians, and that's been helpful in, in keeping the overtime down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4490.319s">Um,</a>  but the budget had already been passed by the time that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4496.317s">Labor</a>  agreement got worked out, so we added those in the supplemental along with an assistant director for buildings and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4504.564s">And</a>  we still have to do some analysis on the cleaning contract, the maintenance lines, and the utility lines to make sure that those are sufficiently funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4520.276s">In</a>  curriculum instruction, we talked about the MAP and the STMATH <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4526.707s">That</a>  map is really should be 38,000, I think not 45, but all this will continue to be gone over before we finalize the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4543.513s">For</a>  special ed tuition and transportation, we kind of got lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4550.976s">There</a>  was a increase of about $600,000 in special ed tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4558.178s">But</a>  because we did not use all our circuit breaker money this year, we have some bandwidth to offset those increases with circuit breaker money that we will receive in FY25, and then some we'll receive in FY26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4583.927s">Right</a>  now, I have this line item as being level funded, but it really would have put a hole in the budget if we had to come up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4593.995s">We</a>  had a number of new students this year that came to the district that needed an outside placement, but we do have a couple of residential placements that are aging out next year, so that helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4610.087s">Same</a>  thing with transportation, and here's my <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4614.067s">my</a>  guess on how this happened, but as I was going through the budget this year, well, I get that I'm thinking about a yellow bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4629.094s">So</a>  for special ed, we had a significant increase this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4637.978s">And</a>  then the next two years are smaller increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4641.319s">We</a>  entered into a three-year contract <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4644.152s">with</a>  North Reading Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4647.674s">And</a>  we'll be able to utilize some, we'll be able to utilize some balances in Circuit Breaker to offset those increases in Special Ed Transportation, which as of a couple of years ago, the Circuit Breaker now takes into account transportation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4670.205s">So</a>  transportation is eligible for that reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4676.245s">The</a>  special education department has a program that they call project transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4683.507s">And</a>  it's for students that have completed high school, but will still be with us until they turn 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4691.19s">And</a>  so they've never really had a budget to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4695.991s">They've</a>  kind of cobbled together different amounts of money from different <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4702.923s">sources</a>  and including, you know, parents' generosity, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4707.124s">So</a>  this year we decided it's very small money for a very worthwhile program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4714.565s">So</a>  we'll continue to, we'll provide for that in FY26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4722.147s">And</a>  the director at the Curtis Tufts asked if she could have her own supply budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4731.143s">which</a>  is fine, again, it's short money, but it kind of gives her a little more ownership to meet her needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4740.048s">Before</a>  that, she would just typically go to the special ed office and try to get funds from the administrative office for her supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4757.397s">She</a>  also asked that if we could <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4760.967s">make</a>  sure the, you know, it was always intended that the floater would provide some administrative support to the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4770.816s">So,</a>  but what was missing was a consistent day during the week where she could kind of rely on that person to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4778.684s">So</a>  we're trying to work out the scheduling of that so we can make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4784.97s">And</a>  then the, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4787.123s">Special</a>  Ed director wants to review the access program at the McGlynn Middle to look at staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4795.947s">There's</a>  some concerns with possibly growing enrollment in that program next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4802.329s">And</a>  we do have more special needs students that require a year round programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4810.993s">So</a>  the budget, which is around <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4816.974s">$280,000</a>  right now is projected to increase to about 330 some odd in 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4828.137s">The</a>  EL program is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4830.218s">And</a>  may I add to your earlier question, this is another area that we have to look at because of the nature of that program and the families that are coming to MedFed to be in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4847.864s">If</a>  you remember last year, we had a significant EL enrollment in kindergarten in FY24, and we provided for two EL teachers at grade one to accommodate those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4866.79s">And</a>  speaking with the director, we'll move that second teacher into grade two for next year, and then we'll keep an eye on <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4877.005s">enrollment</a>  as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4880.827s">The</a>  health services, we did add a nurse in the supplemental. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4889.252s">They</a>  were requesting a health record system that is really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4900.859s">The</a>  designers of the system like to say, made by nurses for nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4906.698s">And</a>  that this is gonna help a lot with the reporting that they have to do with DPH because the software is designed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4919.742s">And</a>  we'll get this in the first year of this grant, the cost of the application and the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4930.145s">So</a>  there's a lot of work that needs to be done to integrate <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4934.41s">uh,</a>  this application into the school brains system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4938.652s">Um,</a>  and then we will have to pick this up and FYI 27, it will no longer be grant eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4946.157s">And</a>  then she did ask that her laptops be refreshed with Mac books. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4951.319s">And</a>  we, um, completed that, uh, a couple of weeks ago, at least completed the ordering. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4957.263s">So</a>  that that's going forward this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4963.636s">guidance</a>  requested that the two Councilors cut at the middle school be restored, possibly add a college and career Councilor maybe as a stipend position, but somebody that could, you know, take the lead on the needs of those students that require those services. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4992.759s">We</a>  talked about adding to the PSAT subsidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=4999.603s">So</a>  a lot of students can pay for their own, but some students need a little bit of support in order to take that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5006.686s">And</a>  that support comes out of this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5012.47s">And</a>  then she also, I don't know if you're familiar with recovery high schools, but they're a little bit like a special needs outplacement <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5023.981s">but</a>  they usually have students that are referred that have substance issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5033.808s">And</a>  I don't think we need to put a placeholder in because I think we'd probably be able to cover it, but it is expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5044.095s">But</a>  we haven't, there hasn't been a need for that for the last couple of years either. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5053.695s">The</a>  director of library media suggested that we hire a district-wide library assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5060.357s">So</a>  a few years back, the assistants accepted in the high school were eliminated in favor of having full-time librarians in each library. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5073.18s">But</a>  there is some need to collect books and get them back on the shelves. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5085.008s">log</a>  in new books, some kind of like low level administrative duties that could support the librarians and takes time away from their teaching assignments and other things they have to do in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5104.784s">So</a>  for other operational, we are looking at a position to kind of provide leadership in the technology area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5113.877s">So</a>  this is something that we still haven't fully figured out, but our technology is kind of spread over different departments and it really needs to be organized in the same way facilities is organized so that people can be making sure that servers are refreshed on a timely basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5142.775s">power</a>  supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5146.196s">We</a>  are up to date on the latest releases for security reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5153.398s">So</a>  that is under discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5157.459s">There</a>  was some discussion earlier, do we need to somehow support our diversity needs in the school department? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5169.523s">We</a>  rely on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5171.57s">in</a>  their person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5172.431s">And</a>  so we're taking a look at, you know, whether it makes sense to have our own or work something out with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5184.658s">So,</a>  as I said before, the community schools, without the Edgley account being involved, it would cost $127,000 to kind of allocate, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5198.128s">two</a>  salaries on a 60-40 basis, 60% to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5205.732s">But</a>  I need to sit down with the athletic director, kind of get a better handle on the time he spends in each of these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5218.158s">At</a>  the beginning of the school year, we established a city year program in two schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5227.952s">So</a>  we are thinking about whether or not we should continue those programs into FY26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5238.094s">We</a>  did, as happened last year, we had, you know, we, in order to deal with a severe budget situation in FY24, there were a number of paras that was shifted to the before and after school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5256.558s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5259.532s">It</a>  really, you know, that's not, it's something that was necessary to do that year, but we should be working to undo that and get those people back on the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5271.721s">I</a>  will say that through attrition, we've kind of whittled it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5277.485s">I</a>  think there's 17 paras that are on this revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5283.99s">So</a>  it might be that we don't need to move five, but we should probably try to move a couple <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5289.673s">at</a>  least, and kind of keep an eye on that in the future years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5294.595s">And</a>  then we've talked about, as part of overall technology organization, whether we have a need for a high school registrar. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5304.759s">I</a>  think there was one at the high school a few years back, but I think our position right now is we're gonna wait until we have a vacancy in our data reporting, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5319.127s">position</a>  so we want to get that filled and get that person up to speed so that person could support a new registrar if we wanted to go forward with that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5334.853s">So</a>  does anyone have any questions on that list or where we're at?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5351.542s">No,</a>  thank you so much for the presentation, Mr. McHugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5354.944s">Very</a>  detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5356.906s">Any</a>  questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5358.047s">And</a>  if not, we can move on to our last agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5361.309s">I</a>  have a six affordable housing trust meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5364.231s">So</a>  just throwing it out there that I have to leave around six. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5368.245s">So</a>  if there's no questions, thank you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5370.808s">And</a>  I think you said you were going to send it to us by email as well so that we have it and can further review.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5385.363s">Yeah,</a>  let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5386.364s">It's</a>  kind of embedded in a <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5389.196s">large</a>  spreadsheet, but I could probably print it out and PDF it.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5394.12s">Even</a>  just this tab, I think, would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5397.784s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5400.826s">Great.</a> </p>
