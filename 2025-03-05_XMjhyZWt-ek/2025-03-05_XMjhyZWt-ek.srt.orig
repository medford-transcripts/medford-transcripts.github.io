[SPEAKER_07]: Member so present, Mayor Lago-Kern.

38
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Present, six, seven present, zero absent.

39
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:56,626
[SPEAKER_04]: If we all may rise to salute the flag, please.

40
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:08,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

41
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:22,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Agenda item number three is the MSBA Accelerated Repair Statements of Interest, SOI.

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:38,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent, and this is concerning the district's intention to submit a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority MSBA accelerated program on behalf of the Roberts, the Misituck, and the Brooks Elementary Schools.

43
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:46,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Memphis School Committee is hereby asked to approve three separate motions hereby authorizing the administration to formally submit the statement of interest

44
00:02:47,397 --> 00:03:03,344
[SPEAKER_04]: For the schools listed below under priority five, replacement, renovation and modernization of school facility systems, such as roofs, windows, boilers, heating and ventilation systems to increase energy conservation and decrease energy related costs in school facilities.

45
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one is the Roberts Elementary School roof and heat pump.

46
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:10,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Two is Mississippi Tech Elementary School roof and heat pump.

47
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And number three is Brooks Elementary School roof and heat pump.

48
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:18,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing, I don't know if you have anything to add before we take votes and discuss.

49
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:24,838
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just appreciate the committee's consideration of this.

50
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:31,164
[SPEAKER_09]: This window is open now until March 21st, and then we anticipate it will be closed for approximately two years.

51
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:39,432
[SPEAKER_09]: So now is an opportunity to at least get into the pipeline and have the opportunity to make decisions as we move forward with these three schools.

52
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:43,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

53
00:03:44,245 --> 00:04:01,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so the general public's aware, this is the same process we took, just a different category under MSBA as it relates to the work we're doing for the new high school, which we're now excited to share last week that we're in the feasibility study.

54
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just the first phase of trying to get that

55
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:09,489
[SPEAKER_04]: portion of these projects paid for through the MSBA.

56
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:13,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank all that are working on these applications from the chair.

57
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:19,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Needed projects, of course, is one that has to worry about city and school budgets.

58
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:23,900
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work that we are doing on our HVAC and our high school and now these roofs.

59
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:42,555
[SPEAKER_04]: nevermind city-side projects, but definitely getting at least 50% reimbursement is something that you just can't pass up trying to do when you have buildings that are 25 years old at this point and their roofs are at the life expectancy or gonna be there shortly.

60
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

61
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau, then Member Graham.

62
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:46,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

63
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there an exact set of language that I should have the motion?

64
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:53,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that why Member Graham has her hand up?

65
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,064
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my question.

66
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:56,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

67
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:00,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there is.

68
00:05:00,997 --> 00:05:06,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushing, this language that you've shared with me, I'm just going to pop in the chat.

69
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:07,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

70
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm happy to read it out loud.

71
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:24,922
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the other piece of context for all of this, just so that if anybody else is listening besides the committee that's sort of been through all this with us, when we looked at the capital plan, which we approved back in December,

72
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,893
[SPEAKER_05]: December, I believe it was December in that plan.

73
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:46,660
[SPEAKER_05]: We made recommendations to pursue these accelerated repair applications when the window opened, because at that time, what we did know is this window is open again for the 1st time in a while.

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

75
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was open last year, potentially, but was closed to us when we would have needed to use it for.

76
00:05:56,404 --> 00:06:00,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the McGlynn Andrews project, and, um.

77
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The is doing a lot to try to combat.

78
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:12,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the sort of skyrocketing cost of construction across all of their projects, which is what led to them freezing this program.

79
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is.

80
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:42,154
[SPEAKER_05]: seems like it's the first program to freeze when something happens that is unexpected and I'm glad that we have this window open that we might be successful with one or multiple of these projects because at best if everything goes as planned this will not come around again for two years which means we would not know an answer for three years which means we're probably looking at

81
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:52,151
[SPEAKER_05]: 5 years from now that, like, these things would be repaired and replaced and I am really worried based on what I hear about the.

82
00:06:52,732 --> 00:07:03,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like the roofs and the HVACs from the process that we've been going through with McGlynn and doing these many assessments to figure out how to submit these applications that.

83
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:30,231
[SPEAKER_05]: sometime between now and five years from now like we are going to be looking at all of these projects as non-optional projects so um i i know dr cushing has been like really hustling to get this done in collaboration with some of the team that is working on mclenny andrews um and just sort of trying to position us to take advantage of a potential grant so thank you dr cushing for

84
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:36,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, for doing that, and I will, I'll read this and I will also pop it in the chat.

85
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:43,693
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just real quick, if I can, I apologize for interrupting.

86
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:57,737
[SPEAKER_09]: This language that is going to be read is extraordinarily specific and prescribed to the largest extent where specific things have been put in around the priority, the address of the school, things like that.

87
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:04,579
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, the language is prescribed by MSBA and specifically taken from their resources.

88
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, which made it really easy.

89
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't have to come up with this.

90
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:35,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will make a motion that reads having convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025, prior to the SOI submission closing date, the Medford school committee of the city of Medford in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances has voted to authorize a superintendent to submit to the Massachusetts school building authority, the statement of interest form dated March, 2025 for the Roberts elementary school

91
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:42,583
[SPEAKER_05]: located at, what is the exact address?

92
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:43,823
[SPEAKER_05]: 35 Court Street, I believe.

93
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:43,823
35?

94
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:46,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.

95
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:47,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

96
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:55,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Court Street, Medford, Mass.

97
00:08:55,646 --> 00:09:03,228
[SPEAKER_05]: 02155, which describes and explains the following deficiencies and the priority categories for which the application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future.

98
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:15,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Priority 5 replacement, renovation or modern modernization of school facility systems, including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology.

99
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:24,371
[SPEAKER_05]: This work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the city of Medford as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure.

100
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:32,397
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for staff and students to function at maximum learning capacity.

101
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:51,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness, and hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School Building Authority,

102
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:59,839
[SPEAKER_05]: or commits Medford Public Schools of the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

103
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And here it comes in the chat.

104
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:13,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I am forever grateful you didn't expect me to type that up as it went, since you went.

105
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it's not letting me send it.

106
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:22,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's too long.

107
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:25,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there's a limit.

108
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:30,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham, would you like me to share the document with members?

109
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:34,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

110
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:37,453
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

111
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It is in the document.

112
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:45,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I just read, we can share with you if that works.

113
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:47,737
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion on the floor.

114
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,951
[SPEAKER_04]: by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

115
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:52,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

116
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:57,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless that's a problem because I have a child with the Roberts, but I assume that's fine.

117
00:10:57,932 --> 00:10:58,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's fine.

118
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:01,873

119
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:04,173

[SPEAKER_04]: I also have a student at the Roberts, but I'm going to vote in favor of all three.

132
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes.

133
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,859
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 the affirmative, 0 the negative.

00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:46,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Having convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025.

142
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:53,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to the submission closing date, the city council of the city.

143
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, this is the wrong 1. hold on.

144
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:56,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the wrong place.

145
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:57,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

146
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:07,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

147
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:25,673
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Medford School Committee of the city of Medford, in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances, has voted to authorize the superintendent to submit the Massachusetts School Building Authority Statement of Interest Form dated March 2025 for the Mississauga Elementary School, 37 Hicks Avenue, Medford, Mass.

148
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:34,296
[SPEAKER_05]: 02155, which describes and explains the following deficiencies and priority categories for which an application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future.

149
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:38,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Priority five is replacement, renovation, or modernization of school facility systems

150
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:44,480
[SPEAKER_05]: including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old, and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology.

151
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,642
[SPEAKER_05]: The work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the City of Medford as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure.

152
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:59,644
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for staff and students to function at maximum learning capacity.

153
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:02,645
[SPEAKER_05]: The roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness.

154
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:25,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, that Massachusetts in no way guarantees the acceptance or the approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, any funding commitment to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, or commits Medford Public Schools of the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

155
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:30,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Grams, Member Roussel.

156
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:34,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the document, there seem to be duplicates for each school.

157
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because there's votes that have to be taken by the council as well.

158
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:42,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just need to go to the school committee section.

159
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:42,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

160
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:43,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

161
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:45,799

[SPEAKER_05]: the awarding of a grant or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School Building Authority or commits the Medford Public Schools of the City of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority?

187
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:41,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve.

188
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:44,440

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

207
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:21,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a note for everybody that these do also need to be approved by the council and Dr. Cushing is working on a submission to them in time for their meeting next week.

208
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:23,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

209
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:24,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

210
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:34,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have the fiscal year 26 budget areas of chapter 90 revolving funds, enrollment projections, and class size.

211
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:38,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll turn it over to our budget analyst, Mr. Gerald McHugh.

212
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:44,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

213
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:49,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to attempt to share my screen.

214
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,690
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.

215
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,323
[SPEAKER_07]: At the bottom right, Jerry, next to the slider.

216
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,504
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always hard.

217
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:11,664
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

218
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:13,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see it OK?

219
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:13,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

220
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:17,846
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

221
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:33,451
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this meeting, I'm going to give an overview of what we found for enrollment projections for next year, how that translates in the class sizes projected,

222
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:46,138
[SPEAKER_00]: a brief overview of chapter 70 budget and kind of how we divided up the override questions.

223
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:59,684
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm gonna go through kind of the initial asks from all the principals and directors in the school system.

224
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:04,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's gonna be a lot there and the bottom line is gonna be

225
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:22,770
[SPEAKER_00]: a little eye popping, but we're not suggesting that we're gonna attempt to fund everything that was asked for, but we do wanna encourage principals and directors to not be shy about stating what they think they need for their program.

226
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:26,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerry, do you want us to save questions till the end?

227
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:34,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I did allow for some time for questions at the end, but I suppose,

228
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,402
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's any clarification that it might make sense to interrupt.

229
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:46,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And sorry, while I'm here, will we get a copy of this?

230
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:48,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it was in our- Yes.

231
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

232
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we'll get it up on the website tomorrow.

233
00:18:56,145 --> 00:19:03,007
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're predicting an increase in kindergarten enrollment, and of course, that's just a best guess.

234
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:15,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I did note that there was 699 births in Medford for the year that the kindergarten class is entering.

235
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:28,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I took an average of the percent of births in the prior three years that translated into kindergarten enrollment.

236
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:32,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I made my projections based on that.

237
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:50,085
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll of course keep an eye on that, you know, through the registration process, but we are proposing, you know, to have sufficient teachers to handle that increase in enrollment.

238
00:19:53,928 --> 00:20:00,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So the enrollment by grade, it's somewhat stable, although,

239
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:06,997
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been this history in recent years where one kindergarten is high and then the next year the kindergarten is low.

240
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:13,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as these grades progress through the elementary, there's ups and downs.

241
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:19,104
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll get to the total enrollment and it's somewhat stable.

242
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:29,710
[SPEAKER_00]: This will necessitate principals to kind of move their teaching staff around because some

243
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:47,966
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they might've had four grade twos this year, and they only have three grade threes next year, but one of those second grade teachers will probably have to move to grade three, unless they still needed four in grade two.

244
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've accounted for that.

245
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:58,472
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's your middle school grades and the high school.

246
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:07,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took a cut by school as well.

247
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:12,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So Roberts is really large.

248
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we should be keeping an eye on.

249
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:25,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the schools are pretty close to what they had this year.

250
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:32,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that increased kindergarten enrollment is driving up that number for them slightly.

251
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the middle schools are pretty stable.

252
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:52,459
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the high school we expect will increase a little bit because of the ninth grade coming in and the Curtis Tufts will be somewhat stable this year.

253
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:56,641
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really depends on, that's based on students we know about.

254
00:21:58,122 --> 00:22:02,544
[SPEAKER_00]: And there could be other students assigned to Curtis Tufts during the FY26 school year.

255
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:12,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the totals for the last three years, actual as of October 1.

256
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:26,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on the October 1, 24 enrollment, we use that as a baseline to form a projection for FY 26.

257
00:22:28,026 --> 00:22:31,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So about, you know, 34,

258
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:48,661
[SPEAKER_00]: students, let's see, it's an increase of about 65 students, 34 is from the kindergarten enrollment, 23 is from the high school, and then the rest is kind of sprinkled around throughout the remaining schools.

259
00:22:51,342 --> 00:23:00,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did class size, you know, after I got some feedback from the principals this year, we changed a little bit how we're doing class size.

260
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:11,666
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wasn't originally taking into account students that are mainstreamed in specialist classes.

261
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:27,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried this methodology this year where we took the number of regular ed grades in the school for a particular grade and then divided it by the total student enrollment.

262
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will make sure that they,

263
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:34,945
[SPEAKER_00]: specialists will have a reasonable caseload.

264
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:45,673
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, I think, compared to other school districts I know about, these are pretty generous class sizes, I think.

265
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:59,003
[SPEAKER_00]: But Chapter 70, as we found out, kind of the basis for the override was the conclusion that the

266
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:15,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 70 budget and Chapter 70 state, the foundation budget and the Chapter 70 state aid really do not provide MEDFED with the funds they need to run their district.

267
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:21,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, right now this is based on the governor's budget.

268
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 70 for MEDFED will increase by $338,000.

269
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:38,728
[SPEAKER_00]: That's based on many school districts actually get the minimum state funding.

270
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:44,032
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't qualify for chapter 78, as is the case with MedFed.

271
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:53,078
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically governors have begun this process by giving $30 per student.

272
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor Healey constructed her budget based on $75 per student.

273
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:10,478
[SPEAKER_00]: And if my memory serves last year at the conclusion of the state budget process, it was up to about $104 per pupil.

274
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:22,725
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that number will rise and give the city a little bit of extra funding to offset their appropriations school department.

275
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:24,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

276
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:31,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you can see the question from the mayor, but should that actually say FY25 and FY26?

277
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:38,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't know if that was, sorry.

278
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:39,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

279
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:45,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, because you said it will be going up, so I thought FY25 were finalized.

280
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:55,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I used last year's template, and I did forget, but I'll fix that at the end of the,

281
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:57,352
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.

282
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:58,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

283
00:25:58,553 --> 00:25:59,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

284
00:25:59,133 --> 00:25:59,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

285
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:19,064
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we had the ballot questions this year and thanks to the voters of Medford coming to the rescue, providing $7 million in additional budget authority for Medford Public Schools.

286
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:25,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Question seven provided $3 million for kind of general school expenses.

287
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:38,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And 4 million was dedicated towards the creation of a high school schedule along with providing funds for teacher and paraprofessional compensation.

288
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:52,817
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this got divided up is we were grateful to the mayor and the city council who advanced one

289
00:26:53,844 --> 00:27:03,968
[SPEAKER_00]: million, $750,000 to the school department to kind of finalize our school budget last year.

290
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And it prevented further cuts.

291
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can remember there were a lot of cuts that had to be made in last year's budget.

292
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:21,336
[SPEAKER_00]: So the city was willing to take a risk and provide those funds upfront and hoping that the override would pass, which it did.

293
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:23,577
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the 7 million,

294
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:33,912
[SPEAKER_00]: that 1.7 was retained so it could go to fund the amount of money that the city already provided to the school department.

295
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:36,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And that left $5,250,000 to add to the budget.

296
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:39,954
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this year we're working with a budget of $83 million.

297
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:59,479
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, I know the school committee was very interested in some of the special revenue funds that we have.

298
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:06,743
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna try to quickly go through the list of these items.

299
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:08,824
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have federal grants.

300
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:16,528
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see, I have a column for FTEs funded, and I haven't got to that yet.

301
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,311
[SPEAKER_00]: But particularly with the federal grants,

302
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:25,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Those grants are at risk, as many of you are aware.

303
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:37,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have to get a handle of who we're funding off of these grants and just be prepared in the event that funding is cut.

304
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:44,520
[SPEAKER_00]: But that will be part of the budget narrative when you get the budget document.

305
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,841
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our ESSER group, Title I, Title IIa,

306
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Title one is for reading and math instruction.

307
00:28:56,343 --> 00:29:03,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Title two A is professional development and maybe, is it class size?

308
00:29:04,104 --> 00:29:05,945
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it for class size reduction.

309
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:09,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Title three is for our EL program.

310
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:14,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this student support, academic enrichment.

311
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:20,908
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Saturday Academy, terrific, okay.

312
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the VOTE program has the Perkins Grant.

313
00:29:28,652 --> 00:29:32,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Special Ed has the IDEA.

314
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:46,279
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a significant special needs population, which is why this amount is so high, and this funds teachers and medical contracts.

315
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:53,888
[SPEAKER_00]: other types of contracts that are needed for our special needs students and out-of-district tuition.

316
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:07,773
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a new IEP being mandated to be implemented, so we did receive some funds to implement that new IEP.

317
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:16,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get a separate IDEA funding that supports the preschool program.

318
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:39,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got this year, we got vacation acceleration academies and Molly Lorden spearheaded an effort to take advantage of a cybersecurity grant that was available earlier this year.

319
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And we in fact were awarded it.

320
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:47,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Our health services department

321
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:52,292
[SPEAKER_00]: receives comprehensive school health services grant from DPH.

322
00:30:54,713 --> 00:31:04,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are a fiscal agent for Medford Family Network and they receive a federal grant, coordinated family and community engagement.

323
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:15,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a small grant to support proficiency outcomes for our EL students and then the state

324
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:20,477
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, kicked in another $5,500 for that federal grant that we got.

325
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:45,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we also, um, had, uh, qualified for reimbursement for a portion of our out of district, uh, uh, tuitions and transportation, uh, over a certain amount, uh, any tuition that's over a certain amount of money that's based on your foundation per pupil amount.

326
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:52,095
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% of that difference is eligible for reimbursement from the state.

327
00:31:53,236 --> 00:32:03,501
[SPEAKER_00]: So our special education department prepares an initial claim every year, and then we get reimbursement based on that claim.

328
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:14,867
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the last quarter, there's a reconciliation to get the actual student costs lined up with what we

329
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:16,303
[SPEAKER_00]: already received.

330
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:22,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also get reimbursed for our homeless transportation.

331
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:35,150
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've never budgeted this, but this year I want to utilize some of these funds to offset our homeless transportation budget.

332
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we can free up maybe 300,000

333
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:49,646
[SPEAKER_00]: or all the way to 391 to kind of offset the homeless transportation in the general fund.

334
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:56,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And that provides us a little bit of relief to address other needs in the budget.

335
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:01,155
[SPEAKER_00]: We have private grants.

336
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:03,677
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Crystal Campbell Betterment Project.

337
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:08,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Cummings Foundation provides money for the

338
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:15,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Center of Civic and Social Responsibility.

339
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:21,225
[SPEAKER_00]: They also receive donations from the public, so that's in a third account.

340
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:27,490
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a scholarship in the memory of Leah Kalleri-Clark.

341
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:36,758
[SPEAKER_00]: We help the Medford Education Foundation manage the distribution of funds to our

342
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:43,951
[SPEAKER_00]: teachers that apply for grants through the Medford Education Foundation.

343
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:51,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Another private grant is Children's Trust from Medford Family Network.

344
00:33:52,558 --> 00:34:01,245
[SPEAKER_00]: That is in the deficit, but it's mainly, we're still kind of unraveling accounting problems with that.

345
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:03,447
[SPEAKER_00]: They have several,

346
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,942
[SPEAKER_00]: several pots of money, and then they have people could be funded over two or three different pots.

347
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:18,224
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's not executed perfectly, then you can get this situation.

348
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:23,886
[SPEAKER_00]: But this grant is well managed by the person that's assigned to it.

349
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:28,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will, I'm not concerned about that right now.

350
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, these funds,

351
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:43,473
[SPEAKER_00]: are only through the end of February and it's being compared to a full year's worth of funding from FY24.

352
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:50,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Midford Family Network also does some fundraising and that goes into their gift account.

353
00:34:50,677 --> 00:35:01,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the school department receives gifts and donations at various times and it goes into this account.

354
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:03,238
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.

355
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for our revolving funds, oh, okay.

356
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,981
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, just to clarify, that's the balance, right?

357
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:15,041
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the spending on it?

358
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:16,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's not the spending.

359
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:17,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

360
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:20,042
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's available after the spending.

361
00:35:20,062 --> 00:35:20,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

362
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:27,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm happy to, you know, maybe at a different time, we could kind of take a deeper dive into the

363
00:35:30,658 --> 00:35:37,541
[SPEAKER_00]: the revolving funds and we could get, I mean, I have a history of revenue and spending for each of these accounts.

364
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:39,843
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just wanted to make sure that was.

365
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not the spending, that's a good question.

366
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:55,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing about revolving funds is that the expenses hit right away, but the revenue typically lags because of reporting.

367
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,551
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes through a lot of

368
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:08,388
[SPEAKER_00]: fees come through the website, and then they have to be downloaded here at the school department, prepare a report that has to go up to City Hall.

369
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:15,932
[SPEAKER_00]: City Hall has to match it up with the deposit they received, and then it gets into the admin system.

370
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:25,879
[SPEAKER_00]: So the revenue does lag behind, and the balances at the end of the year will reflect all the revenue that was collected.

371
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:42,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, so some of these, I mean, you're familiar with the early education program, Medford is fee-based, school lunch is fee-based.

372
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:58,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Those balances are down mainly for the reason that I talked to you about it, but it's also the school lunch director is really doing a good job replacing equipment and updating equipment, utilizing those revolving funds.

373
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,656
[SPEAKER_00]: school athletics, driver's ed.

374
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:12,482
[SPEAKER_00]: We charge students if they break their Chromebook or they lose their Chromebook.

375
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:22,268
[SPEAKER_00]: At one time we accepted students from out of district down at the Curtis Tufts and we charged tuition.

376
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:29,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do still have balance in that account which we use to charge one of the individuals

377
00:37:31,675 --> 00:37:33,717
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching their kids corner.

378
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:56,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's a situation where the revenue lags, the actual spending, but we've been, there's another thing that we're working on right now is that we've always had this practice of holding slots for employees.

379
00:37:56,652 --> 00:38:01,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, you know, if you have a very efficient, soon to be mom,

380
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:08,438
[SPEAKER_00]: She's on the phone four or five months ahead of when she needs it to make sure she gets a slot.

381
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:15,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And the budget is really based on almost full utilization of all the seats.

382
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:22,023
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's creating a little bit of a problem with the revenue projections that we're trying to address now for next year.

383
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:24,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry?

384
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

385
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:26,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Member Russo.

386
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:27,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

387
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:34,307
[SPEAKER_07]: The shore tuition going up is confusing, because I didn't think we had shore occupying any classroom.

388
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:37,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So was there money that shore owed us and we just got it?

389
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:38,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

390
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:39,849
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went in.

391
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:47,033
[SPEAKER_00]: What typically happens when you have out of district students in your district, you can set up a revolving fund.

392
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:54,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a balance from back in the day when we collected tuition for those students.

393
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:58,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And little by little, we've been kind of spending it down.

394
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:01,729
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, it goes from 176 at the end of 24.

395
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:04,910
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down to 98 as of February.

396
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's an error.

397
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:08,111
[SPEAKER_00]: The 176 is 17,000.

398
00:39:08,151 --> 00:39:08,111
176,000?

399
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:12,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that should be a comma, yeah.

400
00:39:12,432 --> 00:39:12,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sorry.

401
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:13,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I was confused by that.

402
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:14,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

403
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:54,190
[SPEAKER_00]: catch there's no more there's no more revenue coming into that account and that that's also the same for uh vocational uh tuition as well um i think the last student that we have from out of district is a senior this year uh and then of course we have the before and after school program um the edgley field now these next two accounts one um you know the

404
00:39:54,589 --> 00:40:05,458
[SPEAKER_00]: In community schools, I don't know when the decision was made, but it was before my time, but I'm sure it was necessary to get through a tough budget year.

405
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:16,747
[SPEAKER_00]: But the director of athletics and his administrative assistant are charged to community schools.

406
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:21,431
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could have been that there were like sufficient

407
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:26,387
[SPEAKER_00]: funds in that year to be able to do that.

408
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:35,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the director of athletics does have a responsibility for scheduling the people that rent our school buildings.

409
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:44,299
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really unsustainable because we don't have the rent coming in to cover those salaries anymore.

410
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:48,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we'll try to do before the budget

411
00:40:49,352 --> 00:41:07,207
[SPEAKER_00]: is finalized is figure out some kind of allocation method where it kind of makes sense for the director to be charged a portion to Edgeley Field, a portion to community schools, and a portion to the general fund, and the same for his administrative assistant.

412
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:11,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will provide some relief to this revolving fund.

413
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:28,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pool, they're doing a little bit better, as you can see from the deficit is going down, but we did change the rates at the beginning of the year, so that's helped.

414
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:40,683
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I've done, one thing that also may be unsustainable in the pool is that the use of the pool by our own students

415
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:47,294
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is important, but it's right now it's being absorbed into this fund, which doesn't have the money.

416
00:41:48,854 --> 00:42:01,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we can either, uh, so right now, um, I directed, um, the pool director to fund the chemicals that are used in the pool.

417
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:07,778
[SPEAKER_00]: We're funding those out of the facilities department right now to kind of compensate for the school use.

418
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:09,538
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um,

419
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:18,310
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward, we might have to figure out some kind of allocation on the general fund to support the pool.

420
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:28,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the Medford Family Network also has a revolving fund that they call the Parent-Child Account.

421
00:42:32,037 --> 00:42:34,899
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to, that was a lot.

422
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wanna, let me see.

423
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're gonna get into,

424
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:40,999
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of all the different asks.

425
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:47,221
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next few slides, I don't know if we wanna stop and entertain any questions so far.

426
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:52,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a question from the chair if I don't see any hands raised.

427
00:42:54,064 --> 00:43:06,209
[SPEAKER_04]: In the CFO world and maybe the superintendent too, where are we at with the federal uncertainty and how our schools

428
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,334
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, taking that into account and budgeting.

429
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:29,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I know us mayors are talking about it on the city side mainly, but I have recently learned that there's a city or two that are nervous enough to be, is gonna be, you know,

430
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:31,805
[SPEAKER_04]: affecting their budgets.

431
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:37,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just didn't know where we are, because you did have a slide with all the federal monies and grant monies that come in.

432
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:42,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, is there any of them that are of concern?

433
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we hearing any word on any of them that they might be cut or reduced or anything like that?

434
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:50,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so we can keep an eye on it.

435
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:54,575
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard any specifics.

436
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:56,516
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely have to keep an eye on it.

437
00:43:58,977 --> 00:44:00,258
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to budget

438
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:08,929
[SPEAKER_00]: some money in undesignated salaries to maybe address three or four positions.

439
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:27,877
[SPEAKER_00]: What's unclear is whether the grants are going to be completely eliminated or are they simply eliminating the bureaucracy and giving the money or some portion of the money directly to the states.

440
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:33,626
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we'll just have to see what direction they go in.

441
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:47,772
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, these are grants that affect every community, red states, blue states, urban, rural.

442
00:44:48,412 --> 00:44:55,374
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, there'll be a lot of pushback, I think, if this attempts to cut them completely, so.

443
00:44:57,647 --> 00:44:57,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

444
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:09,756
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hear about, you know, cutting, you know, eliminating the Department of Education, it's possible that these programs will just move over to the United States Treasury and will be dispersed from there.

445
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:12,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to say?

446
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:14,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I was only going to just follow up.

447
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:20,244
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the title grants are the ones that fall under ESSA, Every Student Succeeds Act.

448
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:23,186
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the ones that are linked to the,

449
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:35,042
[SPEAKER_02]: the competency determination and our compliance with making sure that we are compliant to the state standards and frameworks.

450
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:43,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now for Title I in Medford, we are using it solely for early literacy and reading skills at the elementary level.

451
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:49,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And to Jerry's point, Title II is a lot around professional development and learning.

452
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:54,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We do fund some consultancies in there, some of that

453
00:45:55,011 --> 00:45:58,833
[SPEAKER_02]: funding is used to help us continue our partnership with Hill for Literacy.

454
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:03,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Title III, as he said, is through Paul Teixeira.

455
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:11,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Title IV is a lot of stipends and used to, as it's stated here, support students.

456
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of our fiscal 25 funding went to help with the High School Saturday Academy.

457
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:28,019
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that I would say, there's definitely a lot of conversation going on, a lot of monitoring of the current situation.

458
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:37,704
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been no change, but there is definitely some rhetoric around maybe, you know, just fear.

459
00:46:38,744 --> 00:46:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And if districts and states are not compliant with federal mandates and executive orders, you know, the threat is that this is the type of things that they will remove.

460
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,162
[SPEAKER_02]: from funding districts federally.

461
00:46:55,602 --> 00:47:00,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course it warrants monitoring, but at this time, there's no change.

462
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:05,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Guzzi.

463
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:07,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And Member Graham?

464
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:26,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I just I saw I got a couple of questions related to this from a constituent and on the same day, I saw 1 of our representatives post about this very topic.

465
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:32,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just dug up her post and I'm going to put it in the chat to sort of.

466
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:55,966
[SPEAKER_05]: frame like how does money come to us like there's very little money that comes directly to us directly from the feds um so um i just thought this was like a helpful context oh it's too big um i'm just going to give you the facebook link i guess because i can't give you the whole quote um but um

467
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:08,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I find her to be very helpful and factual in her understanding of how school funding works.

468
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:15,027
[SPEAKER_05]: She's sort of a legend in Massachusetts, and she should be in a much more broad way than that.

469
00:48:15,087 --> 00:48:17,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that will actually take you to her post.

470
00:48:20,212 --> 00:48:25,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me, I will send it to you all separately.

471
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:32,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And her name is Tracy O'Connell Novick, and she is a wealth of information.

472
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:40,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy to read it to you all, but she basically, she says,

473
00:48:41,775 --> 00:48:47,720
[SPEAKER_05]: that something I see a lot, perhaps, of people perhaps simply not knowing how federal aid to school districts works.

474
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,963
[SPEAKER_05]: In the vast majority of cases, federal aid to school districts goes through state ed agencies.

475
00:48:52,483 --> 00:48:57,687
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some exceptions, and this doesn't, for example, speak to DOD schools or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

476
00:48:58,288 --> 00:49:00,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Districts are not on their own, though, for the most part.

477
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:03,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Your federal aid is conditioned on written agreements between the state and federal governments.

478
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:10,858
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no TAP that runs directly to your school district, and thus, this isn't every little school district's fight.

479
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:19,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the world changes, like, every minute right now, but that is helpful context.

480
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:32,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So for all of our, like, wishes about what Dessie might do differently in the world right now, I think we're all on that same side.

481
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:35,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

482
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:43,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But just point, I mean, I do think that's important to also note though, because there is a difference, right, between competitive grants and non-competitive grants.

483
00:49:44,063 --> 00:49:53,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And most, not all, but like most of these grants that Jerry is highlighting, we receive an allocation based on our demographics, our enrollment.

484
00:49:54,408 --> 00:50:03,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're kind of assigned the amount that we have to work with and budget for in the various categories.

485
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:21,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I wanted just to give you an idea of what the principals and program directors have been asking.

486
00:50:22,632 --> 00:50:33,582
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made some tentative decisions on things we might include in the budget, but it's very limited right now.

487
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:43,412
[SPEAKER_00]: where we know we're gonna have, we have to provide a reserve for our collective bargaining agreements.

488
00:50:44,252 --> 00:50:57,856
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have teachers, we do have staff that are under agreement with the collective bargaining that will have an increase next year, that has to be accounted for.

489
00:50:59,216 --> 00:51:01,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people have step increases

490
00:51:03,014 --> 00:51:06,837
[SPEAKER_00]: or a lot of people have step increases that also have to be accounted for too.

491
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:12,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So once that's taken care of, then we can kind of address some of these other needs.

492
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:19,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of right now where I'm at.

493
00:51:20,406 --> 00:51:32,515
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a handful of budgets that I really haven't gone through with a fine tooth comb, but we, and keep in mind that the numbers that I,

494
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:38,877
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at is not a budget number, it's the increase over FY25.

495
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:52,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're anticipating we'll have to increase our reserve for expiring collective buying agreements by 1.3 million.

496
00:51:54,347 --> 00:52:02,273
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already plugged in FY26 salaries for everybody if they

497
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:13,837
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are under a collective bargaining agreement in FY26, we used whatever was proposed for that employee for FY26.

498
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:20,481
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not, we're using their current amount.

499
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:26,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And those funds are provided on that first line under our reserve.

500
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:40,483
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a handful of unforeseen expenses that we had to add to FY25 after the budget was approved, and I'll go through that list with you.

501
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:57,355
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tentatively sought to include some new spending, and then I'll go through the list I want to see just to give you an idea of what's being asked for.

502
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,011
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of to be determined.

503
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:05,454
[SPEAKER_00]: That totals 2.7 million right now.

504
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:17,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's no expectation that we're gonna be able to fund everything that was asked for, but all the expenses will be evaluated.

505
00:53:18,683 --> 00:53:19,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the asks, it may,

506
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:29,026
[SPEAKER_00]: behoove us to wait until the new school schedules are established.

507
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:37,635
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to switch to a different spreadsheet.

508
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:40,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to stop sharing this one and

509
00:53:59,892 --> 00:54:07,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, the wrong one.

510
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.

511
00:54:18,906 --> 00:54:24,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is a new spending that we've included so far.

512
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:27,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we kind of reserve the right to

513
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:39,963
[SPEAKER_00]: to take some of these off if we have to demalice the budget, but we do want to increase our capacity in our tech area.

514
00:54:42,424 --> 00:54:54,690
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified this year every single software application that we're using, and it totals close to $800,000 worth of annual licenses

515
00:54:58,175 --> 00:55:24,546
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that our students and staff are using a lot of this technology for research, for instruction, for professional development, for keeping track of our students with demographic information, keeping track of their grades and things like that.

516
00:55:26,738 --> 00:55:29,919
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we have to have a reliable network.

517
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:52,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this will do is that the kind of the network support is within the group of people that are under Molly Layden that support the school, the teachers and the students with getting their computers running, their printers running.

518
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:54,949
[SPEAKER_00]: So we intend to keep those

519
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:56,988
[SPEAKER_00]: that same number of positions.

520
00:55:57,569 --> 00:56:15,722
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us an extra position that can deal exclusively with network issues and we'll be able to serve the staff and students better in the school with the compliment of staff that we have there.

521
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:22,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have, you know, aging service and

522
00:56:22,998 --> 00:56:24,679
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted power supplies.

523
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:37,064
[SPEAKER_00]: These power supplies would keep our computers running in the event of a power outage and a lot of them don't work or they're beyond their life expectancy.

524
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:48,229
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a separate project going to replace air conditioning that's in the computer rooms at each school too.

525
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:52,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those are out and of course that creates a very

526
00:56:53,130 --> 00:57:00,352
[SPEAKER_00]: risky situation when those rooms heat up too much.

527
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:19,279
[SPEAKER_00]: We do think we have sufficient teachers to implement those class sizes that I showed you earlier, except we would need another elementary teacher at the Brooks.

528
00:57:21,193 --> 00:57:32,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of a little bit back and forth whether we should hold back on that and wait until we get closer to the start of the school year to see if those additional students materialize.

529
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,764
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we're suggesting that we wanna go forward with that position.

530
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:48,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had a meeting with the principals and we went over there.

531
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:53,768
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of teachers they have per class.

532
00:57:53,828 --> 00:57:57,469
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there was a concern with the Missituck.

533
00:57:57,529 --> 00:58:12,572
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that will be on the list that I showed you, but all the, I believe all the teachers that the principals need in the elementary schools are provided for in the budget right now.

534
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:19,634
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can go, if you wanted to see kind of details about

535
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:25,960
[SPEAKER_00]: how many classrooms we have at each grade at each school, we can certainly go through that at another time.

536
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:35,548
[SPEAKER_00]: The world language director asked for a stipend to provide a French II.

537
00:58:38,423 --> 00:58:43,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, an existing teacher would pick up an extra section to do that.

538
00:58:43,847 --> 00:58:47,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, with the new schedule, there may be no need for that.

539
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:52,054
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be able to be absorbed, but we'll keep an eye on that.

540
00:58:54,235 --> 00:59:06,885
[SPEAKER_00]: When we approved our compensation plan for hourly rates, we identified security monitors as a possible

541
00:59:07,762 --> 00:59:11,923
[SPEAKER_00]: security monitor substitutes as a possible need.

542
00:59:11,963 --> 00:59:24,887
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will provide a small budget, at least initially, if we utilize a daily sub for security monitor.

543
00:59:25,948 --> 00:59:35,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are expanding the number of students that can take the PSAT, sophomores and juniors

544
00:59:36,764 --> 00:59:43,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at all, all sophomores and juniors, I think are contemplated to take the PSAT next year.

545
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:49,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that requires an increase to that subsidy of $2,000.

546
00:59:49,307 --> 00:59:51,447
[SPEAKER_00]: The current budget is $4,000.

547
00:59:56,509 --> 01:00:02,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for budget adjustments, these are, let me see if I can make this a little bigger.

548
01:00:12,053 --> 01:00:25,980
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are things, you know, for operations we had because of, we had students move into the district that required one-on-one paras that come to the district with IEPs.

549
01:00:27,581 --> 01:00:39,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to put on three one-on-one paras at the Mississauga and an additional special ed para at the Roberts.

550
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:51,949
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, we currently fund lunch monitors in the lunch fund, which is not appropriate.

551
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:58,275
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get written up by DESI if we haven't already done so.

552
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:08,063
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll propose to bring those salaries onto the general fund.

553
01:01:09,644 --> 01:01:10,625
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two,

554
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:18,060
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of software that are no longer eligible for grant funding that are integral to our instruction.

555
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:35,133
[SPEAKER_00]: One is ST Math software, and the other is the MAP assessment program that we will have to provide for in the general fund next year.

556
01:01:39,998 --> 01:02:06,683
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, to deal with vacancies and illnesses at the vocational school, we added a building sub, although, no, we added an academic lead, I think, to support the vocational program, and that is working very well right now, and so we're

557
01:02:07,002 --> 01:02:11,323
[SPEAKER_00]: proposing that we add that to the budget next year when we fix it.

558
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:23,667
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have frequently used daily subs in the health services program, but we don't really have a budget for that.

559
01:02:23,967 --> 01:02:31,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna establish a budget in FY26 for those needs.

560
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:35,591
[SPEAKER_00]: For security monitors, one security monitor

561
01:02:37,009 --> 01:02:58,778
[SPEAKER_00]: was added this year because we have one night shift building monitor at the high school and we weren't able to provide that building monitor with a work-free dinner at the appropriate time.

562
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:04,700
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had some concerns with coverage over on the pool side.

563
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:07,374
[SPEAKER_00]: on a door on that side.

564
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:11,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added a building monitor for that purpose.

565
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:31,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in reviewing the staff, so we take a kind of look, we look at, you know, the FTEs that were authorized in FY25 versus what we actually have in the payroll and a additional security monitor popped up at the high school.

566
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:33,005
[SPEAKER_00]: So through,

567
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:38,748
[SPEAKER_00]: miscommunication, I think, that a position got filled that didn't really exist.

568
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:44,729
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of evaluating, you know, how we want to deal with that second position right now.

569
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:48,070
[SPEAKER_00]: But one is definitely needed.

570
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:59,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as I said, we went through all the instructional software that's used throughout the building and throughout the school system.

571
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:01,013
[SPEAKER_00]: And these,

572
01:04:03,352 --> 01:04:19,918
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as these became available, my guess is that people would just kind of figure out accounts they already had that they might have some slack in a particular year to fold in software.

573
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:31,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it was charged to textbooks, sometimes it was charged to instructional supplies, sometimes to contract services,

574
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:39,032
[SPEAKER_00]: But for interview reporting, it should be reported under a category that's called instructional software.

575
01:04:39,752 --> 01:05:02,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've identified all those and for what we need to get those accounts right size, we would have to add $58,000 to various accounts over the school system to make sure that those, that software is fully

576
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:03,133
[SPEAKER_00]: funded.

577
01:05:04,294 --> 01:05:10,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

578
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerry, I may ask a question.

579
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:23,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I know every year the city adds like a position or two and then the schools is moving things around and maybe does the same, adds several positions.

580
01:05:24,308 --> 01:05:30,532
[SPEAKER_04]: This year we're adding quite a few more than that, obviously, because of the overrides.

581
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:31,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you budgeting at all?

582
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:42,220
[SPEAKER_04]: on the school side for the 20,000 plus per person it costs for insurance, or is that something that would be doing on the city side?

583
01:05:43,281 --> 01:05:49,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pointing it out, because I know the school side alone is 11, maybe 11 and a half million for insurance.

584
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:52,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah.

585
01:05:52,588 --> 01:06:00,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that the practice here, Mayor, is that that was always accounted for on the city side.

586
01:06:02,503 --> 01:06:09,334
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we could have a conversation if you wanted these people are already on the payroll so they're already baked into FY 25.

587
01:06:13,073 --> 01:06:14,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on this page.

588
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, this page and I know there's been a few others with new proposed positions.

589
01:06:19,197 --> 01:06:23,719
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I think it's going to be more than usual with the override.

590
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:31,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to point that out because it's just a large expense for a city and school that we, yeah, I think we do take on the city side.

591
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:37,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know if you were budgeting that 20,000 or so or more per person per new hire.

592
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:41,590
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not yet, but you would have the increase in the chapter 70

593
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,341
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to help support that.

594
01:06:46,422 --> 01:07:01,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't think at the end of the day, um, the, the, the, the, the question eight was really to address compensation.

595
01:07:02,073 --> 01:07:11,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So not to add people, uh, and then question three, I mean, question seven, uh, the 3 million.

596
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:16,292
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically stabilizing some of these budgets.

597
01:07:16,372 --> 01:07:28,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is how we're fully funding our instructional software and looking at facilities maintenance and the needs of our technology.

598
01:07:29,054 --> 01:07:39,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you'll find that we're not really in a position to add a lot of new staff in my mind right now.

599
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:40,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

600
01:07:46,258 --> 01:07:57,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I wanted to just kind of give you an idea of what the principals and directors were asking for.

601
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:08,422
[SPEAKER_00]: At the high school, the principal would like to start, oh, she asked for funds for Acceleration Academy, and I think we have that covered.

602
01:08:08,662 --> 01:08:10,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that covered in the grant?

603
01:08:11,642 --> 01:08:12,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a Saturday.

604
01:08:12,683 --> 01:08:14,503
[SPEAKER_01]: The Saturday Academy, yes.

605
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:14,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

606
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:17,568
[SPEAKER_00]: not the Acceleration Academy.

607
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:43,954
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very interested in establishing an alternative program at the high school in that this program would be similar to the Curtis Tufts, but different from the Curtis Tufts, these would students that don't have identified special needs, but need smaller groups and kind of a little extra therapeutic support

608
01:08:46,385 --> 01:09:01,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And she does have a grand vision for this program, but what we are looking at is kind of more or less a pilot and start out with a small group of students and see how that works out.

609
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:12,494
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'd be a lead siteman attached to kind of take care of some administrative duties within that approach.

610
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:28,359
[SPEAKER_00]: more funds for the summer school, an advisory, I guess this would be a curriculum committee for SEL, whiteboards.

611
01:09:30,881 --> 01:09:37,786
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd like to add funds for bathroom duty, but that's something that I haven't taken a look at yet.

612
01:09:38,547 --> 01:09:43,911
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see, she asked for a number of positions which are

613
01:09:44,425 --> 01:09:54,589
[SPEAKER_00]: are listed under the directors, but our teacher, band teacher, which we took care of in the supplemental theater teacher.

614
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:04,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Three were language teachers, and we'll give a few more details in a minute on those.

615
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:11,197
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two engagement specialists that would support working with the students.

616
01:10:13,607 --> 01:10:15,748
[SPEAKER_00]: address attendance and behavior.

617
01:10:18,308 --> 01:10:24,249
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Vogue program, we more or less took care of a lot of the asks through the supplemental.

618
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:42,033
[SPEAKER_00]: He is looking for an assistant due to increases in his program, enrollment in his program, and just somebody to help out with the administrative duties at the vocational school.

619
01:10:44,153 --> 01:11:04,817
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andrews principal asked for a full or part-time special ed meeting teacher and was looking for either a para or a behavior specialist to run a in-school suspension program with a restorative practices curriculum.

620
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,878
[SPEAKER_00]: At the McGlynn, we did talk about the

621
01:11:14,674 --> 01:11:17,856
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative assistant position, and that got added in the supplemental.

622
01:11:19,177 --> 01:11:26,240
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also looking for funds to utilize a guidance counselor to help with the schedule over the summer.

623
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:32,382
[SPEAKER_00]: The MISADUC asked for grade two, which we've provided for.

624
01:11:32,402 --> 01:11:42,447
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roberts was looking for a special ed reading teacher, a BCBA, and a math interventionist.

625
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:52,537
[SPEAKER_00]: The ELA director asked if we consider two literacy interventionists at each middle school.

626
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:08,210
[SPEAKER_00]: The world language director was interested in restoring one Spanish teacher that was cut in 25, and then adding a second Spanish teacher to expand offerings.

627
01:12:09,064 --> 01:12:18,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And to, sorry, there's a typo there, but to create a sign language strand within her department as well.

628
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:29,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the extra section for French too, which we've tentatively signed off on.

629
01:12:30,016 --> 01:12:37,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, for math, we had this ST Math that we're bringing into the general fund.

630
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:57,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, she did offer to reduce her supply line because based on her needs, they're well, they have less of a need for textbooks and supplies because of the technology that's used.

631
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:07,495
[SPEAKER_00]: The athletics, I haven't been able to go through and I will within the next few days,

632
01:13:09,205 --> 01:13:13,326
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been typically running over their budget.

633
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:23,869
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to look at, you know, how we can structure that account to figure out what are we going to charge to the athletic revolving fund?

634
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:29,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do we want to provide for in the, in the general fund budget?

635
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:41,974
[SPEAKER_00]: The Food Service Director provided for new appliances at the various schools and she has sufficient funding in her evolving fund for that.

636
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:47,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Visual and Performing Arts would like to add an art teacher.

637
01:13:48,581 --> 01:13:55,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this was kind of thinking similar to world language that there might be a need for more

638
01:13:57,487 --> 01:14:04,648
[SPEAKER_00]: more of these types of sections when the new schedule gets created, but that I think is to be determined.

639
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:08,869
[SPEAKER_00]: We restored the band teacher at the high school.

640
01:14:10,629 --> 01:14:25,272
[SPEAKER_00]: She also asked that the theater teacher be restored and have a part-time elementary band teacher and then increase her supply line by $4,000.

641
01:14:27,327 --> 01:14:29,828
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which I think is, you know, has merit.

642
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:49,319
[SPEAKER_00]: At the buildings and grounds, we, we, um, we added when we finally settled the Teamstess contract, we were able to add two swing stiff custodians, and that's been helpful in, in keeping the overtime down.

643
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:55,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the budget had already been passed by the time that, um,

644
01:14:56,317 --> 01:15:02,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Labor agreement got worked out, so we added those in the supplemental along with an assistant director for buildings and grounds.

645
01:15:04,564 --> 01:15:17,854
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still have to do some analysis on the cleaning contract, the maintenance lines, and the utility lines to make sure that those are sufficiently funded.

646
01:15:20,276 --> 01:15:26,021
[SPEAKER_00]: In curriculum instruction, we talked about the MAP and the STMATH

647
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:41,012
[SPEAKER_00]: That map is really should be 38,000, I think not 45, but all this will continue to be gone over before we finalize the budget.

648
01:15:43,513 --> 01:15:50,816
[SPEAKER_00]: For special ed tuition and transportation, we kind of got lucky.

649
01:15:50,976 --> 01:15:54,277
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a increase of about $600,000 in special ed tuition.

650
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:14,985
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we did not use all our circuit breaker money this year, we have some bandwidth to offset those increases with circuit breaker money that we will receive in FY25, and then some we'll receive in FY26.

651
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:32,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I have this line item as being level funded, but it really would have put a hole in the budget if we had to come up with that.

652
01:16:33,995 --> 01:16:47,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a number of new students this year that came to the district that needed an outside placement, but we do have a couple of residential placements that are aging out next year, so that helped.

653
01:16:50,087 --> 01:16:52,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with transportation, and here's my

654
01:16:54,067 --> 01:17:09,034
[SPEAKER_00]: my guess on how this happened, but as I was going through the budget this year, well, I get that I'm thinking about a yellow bus.

655
01:17:09,094 --> 01:17:16,397
[SPEAKER_00]: So for special ed, we had a significant increase this year.

656
01:17:17,978 --> 01:17:21,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next two years are smaller increases.

657
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:23,580
[SPEAKER_00]: We entered into a three-year contract

658
01:17:24,152 --> 01:17:25,813
[SPEAKER_00]: with North Reading Transportation.

659
01:17:27,674 --> 01:17:50,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be able to utilize some, we'll be able to utilize some balances in Circuit Breaker to offset those increases in Special Ed Transportation, which as of a couple of years ago, the Circuit Breaker now takes into account transportation as well.

660
01:17:50,205 --> 01:17:53,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So transportation is eligible for that reimbursement.

661
01:17:56,245 --> 01:18:02,767
[SPEAKER_00]: The special education department has a program that they call project transition.

662
01:18:03,507 --> 01:18:10,350
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's for students that have completed high school, but will still be with us until they turn 21.

663
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:15,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've never really had a budget to work with.

664
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:20,113
[SPEAKER_00]: They've kind of cobbled together different amounts of money from different

665
01:18:22,923 --> 01:18:27,064
[SPEAKER_00]: sources and including, you know, parents' generosity, et cetera.

666
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:33,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year we decided it's very small money for a very worthwhile program.

667
01:18:34,565 --> 01:18:39,866
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll continue to, we'll provide for that in FY26.

668
01:18:42,147 --> 01:18:49,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And the director at the Curtis Tufts asked if she could have her own supply budget.

669
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:58,847
[SPEAKER_00]: which is fine, again, it's short money, but it kind of gives her a little more ownership to meet her needs.

670
01:19:00,048 --> 01:19:14,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, she would just typically go to the special ed office and try to get funds from the administrative office for her supplies.

671
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:19,258
[SPEAKER_00]: She also asked that if we could

672
01:19:20,967 --> 01:19:30,796
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the, you know, it was always intended that the floater would provide some administrative support to the director.

673
01:19:30,816 --> 01:19:38,624
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but what was missing was a consistent day during the week where she could kind of rely on that person to come down.

674
01:19:38,684 --> 01:19:43,368
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to work out the scheduling of that so we can make that happen.

675
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:45,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the,

676
01:19:47,123 --> 01:19:55,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Special Ed director wants to review the access program at the McGlynn Middle to look at staffing.

677
01:19:55,947 --> 01:20:02,309
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some concerns with possibly growing enrollment in that program next year.

678
01:20:02,329 --> 01:20:10,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have more special needs students that require a year round programming.

679
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:16,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So the budget, which is around

680
01:20:16,974 --> 01:20:24,896
[SPEAKER_00]: $280,000 right now is projected to increase to about 330 some odd in 26.

681
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:29,878
[SPEAKER_00]: The EL program is fine.

682
01:20:30,218 --> 01:20:45,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And may I add to your earlier question, this is another area that we have to look at because of the nature of that program and the families that are coming to MedFed to be in that program.

683
01:20:47,864 --> 01:21:05,870
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember last year, we had a significant EL enrollment in kindergarten in FY24, and we provided for two EL teachers at grade one to accommodate those students.

684
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:15,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking with the director, we'll move that second teacher into grade two for next year, and then we'll keep an eye on

685
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:18,406
[SPEAKER_00]: enrollment as we go forward.

686
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:27,351
[SPEAKER_00]: The health services, we did add a nurse in the supplemental.

687
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:40,599
[SPEAKER_00]: They were requesting a health record system that is really good.

688
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:45,582
[SPEAKER_00]: The designers of the system like to say, made by nurses for nurses.

689
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:59,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this is gonna help a lot with the reporting that they have to do with DPH because the software is designed to do that.

690
01:21:59,742 --> 01:22:10,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get this in the first year of this grant, the cost of the application and the implementation.

691
01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:13,526
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of work that needs to be done to integrate

692
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:17,692
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, this application into the school brains system.

693
01:22:18,652 --> 01:22:24,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then we will have to pick this up and FYI 27, it will no longer be grant eligible.

694
01:22:26,157 --> 01:22:31,079
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she did ask that her laptops be refreshed with Mac books.

695
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:37,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, um, completed that, uh, a couple of weeks ago, at least completed the ordering.

696
01:22:37,263 --> 01:22:39,604
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's going forward this year.

697
01:22:43,636 --> 01:23:11,895
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance requested that the two counselors cut at the middle school be restored, possibly add a college and career counselor maybe as a stipend position, but somebody that could, you know, take the lead on the needs of those students that require those services.

698
01:23:12,759 --> 01:23:19,463
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about adding to the PSAT subsidy.

699
01:23:19,603 --> 01:23:25,986
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of students can pay for their own, but some students need a little bit of support in order to take that.

700
01:23:26,686 --> 01:23:28,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And that support comes out of this account.

701
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:42,615
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she also, I don't know if you're familiar with recovery high schools, but they're a little bit like a special needs outplacement

702
01:23:43,981 --> 01:23:52,847
[SPEAKER_00]: but they usually have students that are referred that have substance issues.

703
01:23:53,808 --> 01:24:02,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we need to put a placeholder in because I think we'd probably be able to cover it, but it is expensive.

704
01:24:04,095 --> 01:24:09,919
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't, there hasn't been a need for that for the last couple of years either.

705
01:24:13,695 --> 01:24:20,277
[SPEAKER_00]: The director of library media suggested that we hire a district-wide library assistant.

706
01:24:20,357 --> 01:24:32,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years back, the assistants accepted in the high school were eliminated in favor of having full-time librarians in each library.

707
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:42,263
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some need to collect books and get them back on the shelves.

708
01:24:45,008 --> 01:25:02,682
[SPEAKER_00]: log in new books, some kind of like low level administrative duties that could support the librarians and takes time away from their teaching assignments and other things they have to do in the library.

709
01:25:04,784 --> 01:25:13,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So for other operational, we are looking at a position to kind of provide leadership in the technology area.

710
01:25:13,877 --> 01:25:41,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we still haven't fully figured out, but our technology is kind of spread over different departments and it really needs to be organized in the same way facilities is organized so that people can be making sure that servers are refreshed on a timely basis.

711
01:25:42,775 --> 01:25:43,855
[SPEAKER_00]: power supplies.

712
01:25:46,196 --> 01:25:53,338
[SPEAKER_00]: We are up to date on the latest releases for security reasons.

713
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:57,439
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is under discussion.

714
01:25:57,459 --> 01:26:08,882
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some discussion earlier, do we need to somehow support our diversity needs in the school department?

715
01:26:09,523 --> 01:26:10,863
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely on the city.

716
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:12,351
[SPEAKER_00]: in their person.

717
01:26:12,431 --> 01:26:20,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're taking a look at, you know, whether it makes sense to have our own or work something out with the city.

718
01:26:24,658 --> 01:26:33,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I said before, the community schools, without the Edgley account being involved, it would cost $127,000 to kind of allocate,

719
01:26:38,128 --> 01:26:45,231
[SPEAKER_00]: two salaries on a 60-40 basis, 60% to the general fund.

720
01:26:45,732 --> 01:26:55,516
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to sit down with the athletic director, kind of get a better handle on the time he spends in each of these programs.

721
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:07,102
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the school year, we established a city year program in two schools.

722
01:27:07,952 --> 01:27:14,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are thinking about whether or not we should continue those programs into FY26.

723
01:27:18,094 --> 01:27:35,538
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, as happened last year, we had, you know, we, in order to deal with a severe budget situation in FY24, there were a number of paras that was shifted to the before and after school program.

724
01:27:36,558 --> 01:27:36,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And

725
01:27:39,532 --> 01:27:51,161
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, you know, that's not, it's something that was necessary to do that year, but we should be working to undo that and get those people back on the general fund.

726
01:27:51,721 --> 01:27:57,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that through attrition, we've kind of whittled it down.

727
01:27:57,485 --> 01:28:03,890
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's 17 paras that are on this revolving fund.

728
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:09,214
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be that we don't need to move five, but we should probably try to move a couple

729
01:28:09,673 --> 01:28:13,615
[SPEAKER_00]: at least, and kind of keep an eye on that in the future years.

730
01:28:14,595 --> 01:28:24,739
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've talked about, as part of overall technology organization, whether we have a need for a high school registrar.

731
01:28:24,759 --> 01:28:38,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was one at the high school a few years back, but I think our position right now is we're gonna wait until we have a vacancy in our data reporting,

732
01:28:39,127 --> 01:28:50,471
[SPEAKER_00]: position so we want to get that filled and get that person up to speed so that person could support a new registrar if we wanted to go forward with that position.

733
01:28:54,853 --> 01:29:01,695
[SPEAKER_00]: So does anyone have any questions on that list or where we're at?

734
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:14,924
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you so much for the presentation, Mr McHugh.

735
01:29:14,944 --> 01:29:16,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Very detailed.

736
01:29:16,906 --> 01:29:18,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the committee?

737
01:29:18,047 --> 01:29:21,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, we can move on to our last agenda item.

738
01:29:21,309 --> 01:29:24,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a six affordable housing trust meeting as well.

739
01:29:24,231 --> 01:29:26,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So just throwing it out there that I have to leave around six.

740
01:29:28,245 --> 01:29:30,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's no questions, thank you for the presentation.

741
01:29:30,808 --> 01:29:36,494
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you said you were going to send it to us by email as well so that we have it and can further review.

742
01:29:37,074 --> 01:29:37,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

743
01:29:38,015 --> 01:29:41,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Will we get this list that you just went through here as well?

744
01:29:41,979 --> 01:29:45,002
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be really helpful to see what people want.

745
01:29:45,363 --> 01:29:46,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me see.

746
01:29:46,364 --> 01:29:48,706
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of embedded in a

747
01:29:49,196 --> 01:29:53,800
[SPEAKER_00]: large spreadsheet, but I could probably print it out and PDF it.

748
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Even just this tab, I think, would be really helpful.

749
01:29:57,784 --> 01:29:58,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

750
01:30:00,826 --> 01:30:01,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

751
01:30:01,087 --> 01:30:01,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

752
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing and seeing no further questions, thank you, Mr. McHugh.

753
01:30:06,992 --> 01:30:10,175
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move on to number five, which is our executive session portion.

754
01:30:10,195 --> 01:30:14,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Upon motion to enter into executive sessions pursuant to Mass General Laws 30A, Section 21A,

756
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:34,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, the Memphis School Committee will be discussing ongoing collective bargaining negotiations with administrators and the Memphis Teachers Association.

757
01:30:35,293 --> 01:30:37,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to enter executive session?

758
01:30:39,155 --> 01:30:43,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will not, the Memphis School Committee will not convene in public session after the executive session.

759
