1
00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:07,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am admitting the guests.

2
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:32,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, members of the fifth grade family at Medford Public Schools.

3
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,131
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Dr. Cushing.

4
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:36,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the assistant superintendent for secondary.

5
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:42,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for your patience as we've let everybody in just shortly after six o'clock.

6
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:49,921
[SPEAKER_03]: We've disabled the waiting room at this point so that you can, if you do get knocked out for whatever reason, you'll be able to reenter with ease.

7
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:54,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for joining us this evening for Dr. Edouard-Vincent's

8
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:58,006
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation on the Middle School Lottery.

9
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:07,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like to ask our other guest from Central Administration to introduce herself to the team gathered here today.

10
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:11,316
[SPEAKER_00]: So hi, everybody.

11
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:12,697
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Bernadette Riccidelli.

12
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,458
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Director of Curriculum and Instruction.

13
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:16,720
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see some familiar faces.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy tonight's program, and I hope it is informative.

15
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:24,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

16
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:29,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this time, I'd like to turn the evening over to Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

17
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:31,348
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat is open if you do have questions.

18
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,991
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll also be able to take questions at the end of the presentation.

19
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:41,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put my email in the chat as well in case anyone has any questions that you would like to email directly to us.

20
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:44,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you and Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

21
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, good evening Mustang family.

22
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:50,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful to see so many of you on the call.

23
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:53,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited this evening.

24
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be sharing a slide presentation with you.

25
00:01:55,941 --> 00:02:01,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been a fairly similar slide presentation that we have shared in the past.

26
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:06,449
[SPEAKER_02]: We have updated some of the current dates to reflect the school year.

27
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:14,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hope as I go through this presentation that I'm able to answer some of your questions.

28
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:21,198
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding the lottery process and expectations and things for next year.

29
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:35,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Riccadeli and Dr. Peter Cushing, as they've already both spoken, are also here to support me in responding to any of the questions that you may have.

30
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So without much further ado, I'm gonna begin going through the slide deck and take you through the steps

31
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:48,994
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward.

32
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:49,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

33
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:11,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started this process,

34
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:15,506
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about correcting an imbalance.

35
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:28,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I came to Medford in 2018, this was what the schools looked like between the McGlynn Middle School and the Andrews Middle School.

36
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what brought about the birth of the lottery was,

37
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:41,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a perfect science but an attempt to balance the schools.

38
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, Dr Cushing Thank you.

39
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now you're looking at the pie chart of the Andrews Middle School.

40
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the racial breakdown that you're, you're looking at.

41
00:03:53,471 --> 00:04:00,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next slide is going to show you the economic status between the two schools.

42
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:09,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the McGlynn school with the blue being again, the percentage of students that received free lunch.

43
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Cushing, thank you.

44
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:15,982
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews,

45
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:21,207
[SPEAKER_02]: being a school from the socioeconomic status breakdown.

46
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:35,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was this discrepancy between the two schools that prompted us to say, let us come up with a way that we can try to better balance the two buildings.

47
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:55,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So the policy that was approved by the school committee was that for each of our four schools, 50% of students in fifth grade at each school would be assigned to either the Andrews or the McGlynn.

48
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:02,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there were a few very minor exceptions to this rule.

49
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:10,156
[SPEAKER_02]: If a student were to have a specific program level requirement,

50
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:23,284
[SPEAKER_02]: where they had program level education needs, then they would be assigned to the school that had a specific program to meet their needs.

51
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:31,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And so program level education needs do supersede sibling preference.

52
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of you may be saying, what do you mean by program level?

53
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:39,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if a student were to have

54
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:52,159
[SPEAKER_02]: an individualized ed plan educational plan and IEP, or if a student were to be identified as an EL, an English learner.

55
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:59,264
[SPEAKER_02]: then those students would be assigned to the school that carries the program.

56
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:18,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to just say that that was the, it's an important factor as I continue to go through the slides, because the schools, and as you see the slides going forward, where we just talk about it as like, you know, school A or school B, the schools do carry different programs.

57
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:30,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were a parent and you have an older sibling, an older child in a school, and you may say, you know, the schools are right next to each other.

58
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:34,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Each child has their own individual personality.

59
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested in sibling preference.

60
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:42,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them go through the lottery process and let's see what school the child gets assigned to.

61
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:51,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this was an example, and in 2019 the following school year in August of 19.

62
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That was where that fourth bullet talked about.

63
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:08,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk about, we call it sample school, school A and school B, but what I will say to you is we have two schools.

64
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:15,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I'm talking about the school, it could be the Andrews or it could be the McGlynn middle school.

65
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews school carries one set of students,

66
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:31,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It houses one of our specialized programs called the Therapeutic Learning Program.

67
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,061
[SPEAKER_02]: That program is housed at the Andrews School.

68
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:48,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Our English language, excuse me, our English learners, that special programming is housed at the McGlynn Middle School.

69
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:58,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanna qualify that because as I start to talk about the sample schools, I wanna explain what this particular sample school could look like.

70
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this particular school, there were 103 fifth grade students.

71
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:13,943
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we need to include three buffer seats for a particular school.

72
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:24,079
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the lottery takes place, we would be calculating 106 total seats.

73
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna explain to you what the buffer seats are.

74
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:39,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Of these 103 students, 20 students are identified as ELLs, English learners.

75
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,183
[SPEAKER_02]: They will attend middle school A.

76
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:50,705
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those students has a middle school A sibling preference.

77
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:58,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven have a middle school B sibling preference.

78
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:12,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Two students have a program requirement in special education that is housed at school A.

79
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:27,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And one student has a special program requirement that is housed in middle school B. We have 12 students that have an IEP.

80
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:34,118
[SPEAKER_02]: These are students that just may be receiving resource room services, but they do have an IEP.

81
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:38,820
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in a specialized program, but they do have IEP needs.

82
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the lottery takes place,

83
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:54,492
[SPEAKER_02]: The 20, the one, the seven, the two, the one and the 12, all of those numbers, those students are going to be assigned to a specific program.

84
00:09:55,192 --> 00:10:04,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So of the 103 students, 60 of them will be entering the general lottery.

85
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:07,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cushing?

86
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:26,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So of the remaining 60 students that are entering the general lottery, 50% of those students would be assigned from the different schools, would be assigned to each middle school.

87
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:38,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the same exact information that I was sharing with you on the previous slide, but what ended up happening was middle school A, these are the students that would be assigned.

88
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:45,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Middle school B also shows you the breakdown.

89
00:10:45,513 --> 00:11:02,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are 20 ELs, two students that are in a specialized program, one sibling preference, and six students that are on an IEP, possibly receiving resource room services.

90
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:11,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That means 29 students are already accounted for at middle school A.

91
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:18,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So the remaining number, there will be 21 students drawn from the lottery.

92
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:24,006
[SPEAKER_02]: The three buffer seats, I wanna explain that.

93
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:38,116
[SPEAKER_02]: The three buffer seats are actually imaginary people who are not yet enrolled in the Medford Public Schools, but will be enrolled after the official lottery takes place.

94
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,458
[SPEAKER_02]: At middle school A,

95
00:11:41,345 --> 00:12:05,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it does house our EL programming, we allow three buffer seats because we have, it's almost like a rolling registration process where students are coming to the school every single month new students are being assigned to the district and we need to account for that growing population.

96
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:08,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So middle school A will have 53 students

97
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:17,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And the remaining 53 students will be assigned to middle school B. And so this is the breakdown.

98
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:21,115
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one student assigned to a specialized program.

99
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:32,399
[SPEAKER_02]: There were seven sibling preference requests and six students on the IEP, which is a separate draw.

100
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are 39 students

101
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:47,096
[SPEAKER_02]: from the lottery that are going to go into this lottery process, leaving us with a balance between the two schools in terms of the total number of individuals.

102
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:57,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, here is another way to look at the exact information that I was explaining in a table format.

103
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Remembering that this particular sample school had 106 total fifth graders.

104
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:10,055
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the breakdown of what happens.

105
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, middle school A houses the EL program, middle school B does not.

106
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,081
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why you see a zero.

107
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:26,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Both schools have specialized special education programs.

108
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:35,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are two students assigned to middle school A, one student assigned to middle school B.

109
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: that classifies as the specialized education program.

110
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:49,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Students that have an IEP need, we had a total of 12 students.

111
00:13:50,577 --> 00:14:01,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we conduct a separate draw for those students and to balance the numbers between the schools, this particular example was 12 students.

112
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:06,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So six would be assigned to middle school A and six would be assigned to middle school B.

113
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:15,316
[SPEAKER_02]: The next line shows sibling preference and the EL buffer.

114
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:23,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Since middle school A houses the EL programming, there's a three there, but middle school B does not, there's a zero.

115
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:33,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So the actual students who end up going into the lottery are what you're looking at, that bar in yellow.

116
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,053
[SPEAKER_02]: 21 students entered the lottery going into middle school A,

117
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:53,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And 39 entered the lottery or part of the official lottery and were assigned to middle school B. And in keeping with balancing the numbers, each school received 53 students.

118
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:02,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we talk about our incoming L students.

119
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:11,725
[SPEAKER_02]: We have English learners who come to the Medford Public Schools that are speaking, you know, different languages.

120
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:30,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And by, according to DESE, the same way we are required to provide special education services for students that are on an IEP, students that are English learners are also entitled to special education with special licensed teachers who have their ESL license.

121
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:51,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So this particular slide where I talked about the three buffer seats, when we look at all four elementary schools and each school is given three buffer seats, it's a total of 12 seats that are reserved as buffer seats at the McGlynn Middle School.

122
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,136
[SPEAKER_02]: That is to accommodate new students that will arrive over the course of the year.

123
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:07,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the conservative number that we had selected in 2018 was three seats per school totaling 12 seats.

124
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:26,082
[SPEAKER_02]: What I can say to you is right now we are seeing a large influx of newcomers coming to the Medford Public Schools, and we have far exceeded that number, 12 seats.

125
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want you to know it's a conservative number.

126
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:37,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we're holding three seats, we've actually exceeded that number, even this given year, significantly.

127
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:39,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing?

128
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:46,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanna go through our timeline of events.

129
00:16:48,804 --> 00:17:01,329
[SPEAKER_02]: On Friday, March 11th, the sibling opt-in, opt-out form will be emailed, was emailed to parents.

130
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:09,832
[SPEAKER_02]: The email was sent and that email address is mslottery at medford.k12.ma.us.

131
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:21,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, Wednesday, March 16th, is the information session that you are participating in right now.

132
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:33,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow, Thursday, March 17th, the sibling opt-in, opt-out forms will be submitted.

133
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,323
[SPEAKER_02]: On Thursday, March 24th,

134
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:47,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Each grade five student will receive a lottery number in a letter to you, the parents and caregivers.

135
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Students will carry this letter home.

136
00:17:52,277 --> 00:18:01,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So a week from tomorrow on Thursday, March 24th, you will receive a lottery number for your child.

137
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:20,100
[SPEAKER_02]: On Thursday, excuse me, on Tuesday, April 5th at four o'clock in the afternoon, we will be on Zoom and we will actually conduct the lottery.

138
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:27,866
[SPEAKER_02]: On Tuesday, April 5th, while we are conducting the lottery, it's a very quick process.

139
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:49,492
[SPEAKER_02]: We will conduct a lottery and Dr. Riccadeli I'm going to ask you to jump in and kind of weigh in on what they can expect to see during this lottery drawing and what will take place because we want you to understand that it's not something where I'm, you know,

140
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:54,925
[SPEAKER_02]: putting everyone's name in a bucket and I'm pulling names out randomly.

141
00:18:55,425 --> 00:19:17,621
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a true lottery process so that it's up to the lottery when it goes in and we use a random number generator where Dr. Riccadeli, I'm gonna have her jump in to explain that process to you so you can understand what takes place again on that day, Tuesday, April 5th.

142
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:18,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Riccadeli?

143
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:19,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

144
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:20,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

145
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:24,470
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program that we use, the random number generator is stat track.

146
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,892
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used it for the past four years.

147
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:35,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will just randomly generate the numbers that are assigned to the McGlynn and the numbers that are assigned to the Andrews.

148
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:40,586
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past couple of years, what we did was we structured the lottery.

149
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,088
[SPEAKER_00]: The first year was in person.

150
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:59,003
[SPEAKER_00]: but because of COVID and since then we've done it virtually, we had been scheduling it so that the first school would take place at three o'clock, the second school at 3.15, the third at 3.30 and the fourth at 3.45.

151
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:06,405
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found is this happened so quickly that we did not need that amount of time.

152
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:11,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's super fast, it probably will be 10 minutes.

153
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:18,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people sometimes feel underwhelmed when they see it because there's no big fanfare.

154
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:24,531
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see our data manager, Kim Miles, she draws them.

155
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will see those numbers.

156
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:29,993
[SPEAKER_00]: We will post them to our blog.

157
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,074
[SPEAKER_00]: We will put them on our website.

158
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:38,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And the letters with the official assignments are going to go out as you can see from the schedule on Tuesday, April 12th.

159
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:44,698
[SPEAKER_00]: You are certainly welcome to join us on that day, Tuesday, April 5th at four o'clock.

160
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:54,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to not attend and then just wait for them to be posted onto our blog, you certainly can do that.

161
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:59,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the letters with the official assignment will be mailed out on April 2nd.

162
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:02,746
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to you whether you decide to join.

163
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:06,868
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have you there, but just know it's a really quick event.

164
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Riccardelli.

165
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to ask Dr. Cushing, where we have listed the middle school welcome or orientations.

166
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:21,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, would you like to speak from the middle school perspective for us?

167
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:28,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, so those are two evenings your children will know which middle school they are going to be attending.

168
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:34,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an opportunity for you to go tour the building, meet the principals, the assistant principals, some other members of the staff.

169
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:37,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there both evenings as well.

170
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:45,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you really get to get a sense of your child's school and the type of community that it is.

171
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:48,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like to say that the,

172
00:21:50,705 --> 00:22:01,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The sibling preference, the opt-in or opt-out per school committee policy, that's required as an affirmative yes or no.

173
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:04,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have those forms back from everybody.

174
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:10,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't submit it, we'll be giving you a phone call from one of our schools.

175
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:15,467
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you a phone call and just ask what your preference is so that we can make that determination.

176
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:19,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't honestly looked at it, but I'll be looking at it tomorrow.

177
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:33,360
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll resend that tomorrow morning as well, just so if you missed it, but it did come from MS lottery at Medford schools last Friday night at eight o'clock on the dot.

178
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:39,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So if by chance it ended up in your spam or your trash or for whatever, feel free to look for it there.

179
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:43,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a limited population that received it this year.

180
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, thank you for that.

181
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:50,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping you could put up slide 13 for us, please.

182
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:51,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can.

183
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:52,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was the final slide.

184
00:22:53,586 --> 00:23:11,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Riccadeli knows this is my favorite slide of the entire deck, because it talks about the process, but it actually, when I think about the lottery, it's actually,

185
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:19,111
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my favorite slide because it, it's not exact.

186
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:31,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a perfect science because we know that we've included the buffer seats, we know that we do have a few students that, you know,

187
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:47,109
[SPEAKER_02]: for the purposes of going through the lottery, a few students, and maybe a few of you on the phone call, you will receive more of an assignment letter because of where a specific program is housed.

188
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:57,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to be fully transparent about that, that some of the schools, as I was mentioning earlier, because they have specific program,

189
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:12,794
[SPEAKER_02]: specific programming and specific teachers with the official license that is needed according to, you know, our state regulations that some students will be assigned to a particular building.

190
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:19,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, everyone else who goes through this lottery process and participates

191
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:27,888
[SPEAKER_02]: and goes through the random generator process, the chances are that you could end up in either school.

192
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:41,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really our closest attempt at having it be a 50-50 chance of your child being assigned at one of the schools.

193
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:47,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have been working very, very diligently

194
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:48,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

195
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:58,791
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been working very diligently to have very similar programming between both schools.

196
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:02,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Cushing can really, really talk about that.

197
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:07,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Although they are two freestanding separate middle schools,

198
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:17,862
[SPEAKER_02]: afterschool program offerings, course offerings, scheduling, those kinds of things, they really, really mirror one another.

199
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:25,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And so children, students in either building would be having a very similar middle school experience.

200
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:29,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Cushing, would you mind speaking to that?

201
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:45,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have meetings frequently with our middle school principals to make sure that one is not doing you know something maybe completely different than the other, that if we're offering a program at one school that it's being offered, or something similar is being offered.

202
00:25:46,675 --> 00:26:08,387
[SPEAKER_03]: at the other school, there is a lot of work that's done on behalf of the principals and the PTOs to really provide a really great experience for the students in a social sense with dances and activities and other things along those lines, where say the Andrews one week might have a dance, the McGlynn might have a game and movie night.

203
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:17,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a few weeks later, it might be that the McGlynn is having a dance and the Andrews is doing an outdoor movie night and a pizza night, given whatever the weather might be.

204
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:23,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a real opportunity for them, for the students to be involved.

205
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,145
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a tremendous there's a joint club fair that last year it's held at both schools.

206
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:32,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So students will travel between the two schools for the club fair.

207
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll go visit some of the clubs in McGlynn.

208
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:41,453
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they'll go visit some of the clubs in the Andrews Gymnasium to see what they might be interested in.

209
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:48,477
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a, I don't wanna say unified because that's a specific term, but we have a united middle school sports team.

210
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have some intramural sports as well, like soccer.

211
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We've added to our GBL Middle School League this year, the opportunity for students to participate in volleyball.

212
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's upcoming.

213
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:05,693
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're looking for other ways.

214
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:20,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Dr. Cushing, could you tell them all the sports offerings that are available for our middle schoolers, which is this, this united team where we play against other districts for those that don't know what GBL is all about?

215
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:34,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So GBL stands for the greater Boston league, uh, the greater Boston league, a few years ago, uh, if you went to Medford high school, the greater Boston league looks a little bit different than it did when you went to Medford high school, it's gone through some transition over the last few years.

216
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:35,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And,

217
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:57,535
[SPEAKER_03]: actually I would say was on life support for a while there, but communities like Medford, Revere, Everett, Chelsea, and Somerville came together to resurrect the league, and the league has recently added Lynn English, Lynn Classical, and there are several other communities that are also looking to onboard with us.

218
00:27:58,495 --> 00:27:59,616
[SPEAKER_03]: in the next couple of years.

219
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:16,251
[SPEAKER_03]: We offer a tremendous amount of, of sports for our middle school students, basketball being some softball, baseball, cross country, and I'm blanking on some others but we do have a crew club.

220
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:18,952
[SPEAKER_03]: um, that has operated in the past.

221
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:22,073
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been suspended during COVID, but we really hope to bring that back.

222
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,213
[SPEAKER_03]: We offer intramural soccer.

223
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:29,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, I apologize that I'm blanking on the other sports offered.

224
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:33,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be happy to put that out and email to all the fifth grade parents and guardians.

225
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:41,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, um, really do have a great program at both middle schools for our students.

226
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:46,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I apologize if you hear bedtime starting in the background with my three and five year old.

227
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:57,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing, I just quickly looked in the chat, and Miss Rotolo was saying what about the after school programming that's available.

228
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:02,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So, now that your child will be transitioning, and should we be signing up now.

229
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:04,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent question.

230
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:27,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike a elementary school where you know you sign up and your child is an after school program until about six in the evening at the middle school level, the after school program is really, I would almost describe it as enrichment special projects that the kids are able to do.

231
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:32,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, students can play chess, they can do some robotics.

232
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:38,514
[SPEAKER_02]: There are all different types of activities that are offered in on both campuses.

233
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:39,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if

234
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:58,853
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a club and your child was in one building and that club was not offered in their building, your child is allowed to go right across the way to the other school and participate in the after school club program programming and we do have

235
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:06,069
[SPEAKER_02]: a late bus for students who participate in the afterschool programming.

236
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:19,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, remembering that the students are older, more mature, so they are able to take on greater responsibility as they get ready to eventually come up to the high school.

237
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:24,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Riccadeli or Dr. Cushing, please feel free to add to that.

238
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:28,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I don't have anything to add to that I think you did a really great job with it.

239
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have, I also received a question by email regarding students on IEPs, so I'd like to provide some clarity on that right now.

240
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:44,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if your child has a, an IEP that requires a specific program.

241
00:30:45,312 --> 00:31:00,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, whatever that may be for your specific child and that program is housed at the Andrews or it's housed at the McGlynn, your child will not participate in the lottery because that specific program is only at one school.

242
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,294
[SPEAKER_03]: If your child has an IEP that does not require a specific program.

243
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:15,865
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have a disability that requires them to receive academic support and interventions under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

244
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:27,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they will enter a separate lottery with other similarly situated students who have an IEP but don't require a specific program.

245
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:32,159
[SPEAKER_03]: They will then be drawn and they will be split between the two schools.

246
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just want to, and if, if the person who emailed me wants more clarity.

247
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:43,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to provide more over a phone call, but if you have a specific need.

248
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:49,350
[SPEAKER_03]: then you would go to that middle school and will not participate in the lottery.

249
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:58,836
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have an IEP that can be serviced at either school, you'll go into a separate lottery that will then equally divide the students between the two schools.

250
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:05,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?

251
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw one just come into the chat.

252
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me check that.

253
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:23,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, could you please show the charts of the MEW social economical distribution from the last three years after the lottery?

254
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a clear difference meaning this is working?

255
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:48,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually had, the first year we did it, we did a presentation to the school committee, which showed that the socioeconomic status was more balanced.

256
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't perfect, but the,

257
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:59,724
[SPEAKER_02]: The differences between the two schools did show a shift but every every single year when you do the lottery.

258
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:08,973
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have different results, different outcomes, but we definitely did see a shift.

259
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:14,071
[SPEAKER_02]: between the schools, where the schools were definitely better balanced.

260
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:21,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember doing that presentation the first year out after we had completed the process.

261
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:30,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, I don't really recall doing a follow-up presentation because at first there was a lot of

262
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:40,601
[SPEAKER_02]: concern of would the lottery work, and we know that there is a fluctuating population from year to year.

263
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:53,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the sample school, we gave you an example, and sometimes that number can go up, and sometimes the number can go down depending on the school and depending on the school year.

264
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:58,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some variability, but, you know,

265
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,969
[SPEAKER_02]: we at least try to level the buildings together.

266
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:06,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to at least give some context for that.

267
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:16,454
[SPEAKER_03]: The other question that we had come through the chat was, how many students do you anticipate participating in the lottery this year across the elementary schools?

268
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:27,656
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 3% of students who if everybody were to select sibling preference, that would be 3%.

269
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like everybody to know that there are two great middle schools that are quite literally right next door to each other.

270
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:39,281
[SPEAKER_03]: The students walk to the Andrews to pick up the buses.

271
00:34:40,502 --> 00:34:50,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is there is if you choose sibling preference, I respect it, but they are two great middle schools and that's your choice.

272
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,151
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just can't say enough.

273
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:56,754
[SPEAKER_03]: They're two great middle schools that we're really working to make better and more awesome each and every time.

274
00:34:56,914 --> 00:35:01,416
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got two great principals, two great assistant principals, and some really amazing staff.

275
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:15,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But if all students who have the option for sibling preference choose it, that's about 3% of the, I think it's about 316 students across the district right now in grade five.

276
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:17,945
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were to take a guess,

277
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:25,649
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we haven't run the numbers right now because that will be what we look at in the next couple of days.

278
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:43,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say we're looking at between 85 and 90% of students participating in the lottery outside of our EL, our special education population, and the sibling preference.

279
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the three outliers that we have to take into consideration.

280
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:50,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.

281
00:35:52,529 --> 00:36:02,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, the I is the lottery schedule for the kids with IEPs that receive support services, but not special programs the same.

282
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:03,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

283
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:08,479
[SPEAKER_03]: The draws actually, Bernadette, actually, if you want to speak to this.

284
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,441
[SPEAKER_03]: You're muted.

285
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:12,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

286
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:13,242
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

287
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:16,285
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens at the same time.

288
00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:19,366
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two draws for each school.

289
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,726
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actually eight draws.

290
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:24,767
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens so fast that you don't even realize that it's happening.

291
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:30,528
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the superintendent indicated in her presentation, there are two draws.

292
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:39,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So those students who are on an IEP that can go to either school because either school can service them, because we wanna make sure we balance

293
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:50,179
[SPEAKER_00]: the special ed programs at the schools, the two schools, that's why we do the additional lottery draw just for those students.

294
00:36:50,880 --> 00:37:00,612
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not even gonna notice, it's not, it happens so fast you don't even realize, but yes, two draws for each school for eight draws in total.

295
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:02,761
[SPEAKER_03]: We had another question.

296
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:08,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, will students in one school be able to participate in another school's activities like dances etc.

297
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:11,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So the answer that is yes we do hope to go back to that.

298
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:18,670
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not though a complete open door policy where, hey, everybody at the McGlynn if you want to come to the Andrews dance.

299
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:28,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Having been a middle school principal, dances at middle school are part rodeo, part carnival, and part dance.

300
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:35,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say that that's probably a 40%, 40%, 10% split with 10% being the dance part.

301
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,804
[SPEAKER_03]: As the kids get older, it's more of a dance.

302
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,667
[SPEAKER_03]: As the kids are younger, it's more a lot of running around.

303
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:43,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just an open door.

304
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, all 600 kids together.

305
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,409
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guest form.

306
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:58,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And if a child's friend wants to bring someone, then by all means, we have done that in the past, that was not something that was done the first year but that's something that I brought on.

307
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:11,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I really believe in bringing these schools together and bringing our kids together as much as possible so that when they enter our high school experience, we're as much one Medford and one community as possible.

308
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:23,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Melissa, saying thank you.

309
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:26,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I we are here.

310
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:27,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope that

311
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:50,517
[SPEAKER_02]: This presentation was able to answer any burning questions that you may have, but again, the purpose of the lottery is really our work at trying to balance the schools and maintaining similar programming, after-school programming, united sports between the teams.

312
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I were to say anything about the sports,

313
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:59,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard when you have to pick, when you have so many to choose from, when you're building a team to represent the district.

314
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:16,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know they can get a little competitive, but for those students who love being part of sports and athleticism and just thinking about when you eventually move on to high school, playing sports, it's a great, I think it's a great way to connect and make great friendships.

315
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:22,294
[SPEAKER_02]: and participating in all of the afterschool programming and activities that are available.

316
00:39:24,574 --> 00:39:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a completely different experience from elementary school, but I am sure very enjoyable experience for the students in middle school.

317
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the open houses will take place.

318
00:39:38,038 --> 00:39:44,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was May 10th and 11th, Dr. Cushing, correct me if I am wrong.

319
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,760
[SPEAKER_02]: May 10th and 12th, thank you.

320
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:53,175
[SPEAKER_02]: May 10th and 12th, you will be invited to those welcome orientation sessions.

321
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:54,556
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a lot of fun.

322
00:39:54,716 --> 00:40:08,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And you and your child have an opportunity to go on campus, walk the halls, and kind of imagine what the middle school experience will end up looking like.

323
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:11,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot of fun, and it's enjoyable.

324
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:30,196
[SPEAKER_02]: As the summer comes, we end up, now that we're in a much better place, we've done summer barbecue, the parent, the PTOs, in collaboration with the principals.

325
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:35,130
[SPEAKER_02]: conducted a barbecue in between the two campuses.

326
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the kids were together and it was really like a wonderful kickoff.

327
00:40:39,532 --> 00:40:41,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And that took place in August.

328
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:57,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember, a little bit before the official kickoff of school, but it's also another great opportunity for all the kids to be together, see each other and have the opportunity to go and look at their school building and realize like, this is real.

329
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting middle school very soon.

330
00:40:59,541 --> 00:40:59,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

331
00:41:01,617 --> 00:41:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were some great opportunities.

332
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:08,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Dr. Cushing is assistant superintendent of secondary schools.

333
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:17,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So he just put his email in there if there are specific questions about, you know, middle schools or more information.

334
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:24,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Riccadeli, her email is briccadeli at medford.k12.ma.us.

335
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:29,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Riccadeli is the lead on coordinating

336
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual lottery process and will, you know, work with families to make sure that you receive your number, and you have your number.

337
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:50,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, for whatever reason, if, if the envelope gets lost between the backpack and making it to the kitchen table.

338
00:41:52,238 --> 00:41:58,719
[SPEAKER_02]: please reach out to Dr. Riccadeli and she will be able to help you with your number assignment.

339
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And also Ms.

340
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:15,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim Miles, who will be coordinating the data and really she's the wizard of the lottery process, managing the backend for us and conducting it.

341
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:19,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our presentation for this evening.

342
00:42:20,894 --> 00:42:28,340
[SPEAKER_02]: and I will look to see if I see any raised hands or any other questions in the chat box.

343
00:42:30,082 --> 00:42:47,297
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that I would like to say is that the lottery will, all of our Zooms, I shouldn't say all, the overwhelming majority of our Zooms, be they school committee or anything else, we are also automatically broadcasting to our YouTube channel and they are automatically recorded and archived there.

344
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:48,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I put that in our chat.

345
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:58,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you wanna go and fast forward through parts of this presentation to see something you think you may have missed, or if you wanna share with a friend, by all means, please do so.

346
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:05,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Please feel free to share my email with any of your friends who may have missed that, and they want a specific individual conversation.

347
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:12,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, the lottery itself, you can also watch via YouTube as it will be broadcast.

348
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:15,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing you there.

349
00:43:17,212 --> 00:43:18,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone.

350
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great evening.

351
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

352
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:25,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, when is the lottery, Phil Contanzo was asking?

353

00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:28,057
