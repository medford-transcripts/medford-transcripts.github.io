24
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:12,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lungo-Kern.

25
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:13,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

26
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Six present, one absent.

27
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:16,674
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could all rise to salute the flag.

28
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:21,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

29
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,701
[SPEAKER_02]: and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

30
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:35,645
[SPEAKER_02]: We have continued business, which is number three.

31
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:37,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody received the policy.

32
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a recommendation to approve the Medford Public Schools Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan Policy, JICFB, with its first reading.

33
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Any question or a motion on the floor?

34
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:52,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo.

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:08,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to make a motion to suspend rule 46, which is, since you all probably don't have it up in front of you, it's the rule that we wrote that requires a second reading, because I don't know if anybody wants to come back in a week or two.

36
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't.

37
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:16,795
[SPEAKER_11]: And also because the policy is, frankly, relatively minor changes at best.

38
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some questions about that before we move to that question.

39
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:27,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Member Rousseau to move Rule 46 and seconded by Member Graham.

40
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:31,448
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Member Hayes and then Member McLaughlin who would like to ask a question before the rule is called.

41
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:33,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

42
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I am warning them.

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,371
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Member Hayes.

44
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, had her hand up first.

45
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:39,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Member McLaughlin.

46
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:40,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hayes.

47
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, I still had the same I brought up a question last time, and I know we ended up tabling.

48
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:54,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if maybe member McLaughlin was the one who requested the table, if she wants to talk about what her.

49
00:02:55,683 --> 00:03:04,429
[SPEAKER_04]: reason for tabling or what she's found since then, but I do still have the same question that I had asked last time that I'm not sure we ever really fully discussed.

50
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:13,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and that's what I'm wondering is if you, and I apologize because I'm on hold right now with Children's Hospital for something that's also urgent, so forgive me if I have to be interrupted for one second.

51
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:21,962
[SPEAKER_09]: That is, it was because we hadn't had the opportunity to read through it because it had not, it had been inadvertently

52
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,053
[SPEAKER_09]: We hadn't had the opportunity to read through it.

53
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So we asked to table it.

54
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,354
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had the opportunity to read through it, I would presume.

55
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:32,215
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I do have probably five or six questions that I want to ask.

56
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:49,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm curious if what member Russo is asking with not having the second read through, if he's asking that we move to approve the document without having the second read through, or is this an opportunity for us to have those questions discussed that we have that we didn't have the opportunity to do last time?

57
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor?

58
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:52,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Russo?

59
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just read the rule.

60
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:08,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Rule 46 states the first time that a policy recommendation appears on the agenda, the school committee will hear public comment on the item and engage in discussion and comment on the policy recommendation hereafter referred to as the first reading.

61
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:16,689
[SPEAKER_11]: The policy of pass will be placed on the next regular meeting agenda hereafter referred to as the second reading.

62
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,251
[SPEAKER_11]: In accordance with provision of rules,

63
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:25,655
[SPEAKER_11]: provisions of rule 75, the school committee may suspend this rule to adopt the policy upon first reading.

64
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:40,787
[SPEAKER_11]: A policy that is affirmed by majority vote on the second reading or upon suspension of the rules will become the policy of the school committee immediately upon another date as specified.

65
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,989
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is not to quell any conversations at all.

66
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:48,473
[SPEAKER_11]: This is merely so we do not have to return here in August, which we have to-

67
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to the chair members.

68
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:54,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So for that explanation and for the reading of the policy, I appreciate that.

69
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to clarify.

70
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:56,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much.

71
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:00,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other questions?

72
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:01,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin?

73
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I have more questions, but I believe, sorry, I'm sorry, one second.

74
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:12,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I have more questions, but I believe member Hayes, did you have your hand up to talk about what you wanted to talk about for last time?

75
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:14,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I did, yes.

76
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:16,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I would let member Hayes go first and then I would, thank you.

77
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:18,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really just a question.

79
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:26,877
[SPEAKER_04]: The question that I had last time was about the definitions used for bullying.

80
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:46,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you look at both the Massachusetts state law and the DESE, their model plan, they have the definition as basically as stated on the first page of the current proposed Medford policy.

81
00:05:46,724 --> 00:06:02,309
[SPEAKER_04]: which is defined as the repeated use by one or more students or a member of the school staff of a written verbal or electronic expression or physical act or gesture or any combination thereof directed at a target that and then list those five categories.

82
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does say in the

83
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:22,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Education model plan, it does state that for the definitions, including the bullying definition itself, districts may add specific language to these definitions to clarify them, but may not alter their meaning or scope.

84
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:26,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So then my question really is when we look at the

85
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:34,247
[SPEAKER_04]: The second page, or at least I have it printed up, the second page of the proposed policy for Medford.

86
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:36,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, point of information.

87
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

88
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we share the document on screen so people can know what we're referring to, please?

89
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do that if nobody has it handy.

90
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:50,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I have a printed copy, sorry.

91
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:51,876
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's fine.

92
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:52,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on one second.

93
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I can pull it up.

94
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,497
[SPEAKER_10]: shared screen, the numbered version that you're looking at?

95
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:04,700
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one I'm looking at.

96
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,064
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably easier to refer to the exact lines.

97
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:09,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

98
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:41,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So lines 50, starting at line 55.

99
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:58,315
[SPEAKER_04]: The bullying definition here, which is the one that's used, it says bullying investigations may be concluded with a finding of, and on line 55 it says it may be

100
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:10,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Concluded with the finding of bullying, a finding of bullying occurs when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the core of the problem.

101
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:24,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Bullying is abuse and occurs when a socially powerful, example given, popular or feared student mentally or physically abuses a weaker, e.g., example given, fearful student for the purpose of making them afraid or hurt.

102
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Bullying is the act of causing hurt, harm, or humiliation.

103
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:39,641
[SPEAKER_04]: That piece feels to me like it's changing the definition, the original definition in the, both in state law and the model, and adding that piece about a power differential.

104
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:54,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was my question, is to me that seems like a different definition than both on our first page of our model, our proposed, the definition that's given in lines 17 through 24 of this plan.

105
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:11,128
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a verbatim definition taken from the state law, which does not include that idea of a power differential is necessary for defining bullying.

106
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:26,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But the second definition in our plan, that one I just read at 55 through 61, adds that piece of a power differential that doesn't appear

107
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:30,317
[SPEAKER_04]: in the state definition or the model plan from DESE.

108
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:42,020
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, through the chair, is your recommendation then to take the definition from line 17 through 24?

109
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And are you requesting that 17 through 24 become 55 through 63?

110
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:54,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Or 55?

111
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is the definition of bullying.

112
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:03,711
[SPEAKER_10]: 55 through 61, I mean, 55 through 61.

113
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:04,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

114
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:10,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at line 62 and 63, there it talks about the pattern of behavior or repeated.

115
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:15,535
[SPEAKER_04]: So that more closely aligns with the state definition, the state law.

116
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:21,797
[SPEAKER_04]: But that piece about the power of a differential does not appear in the state law as part of what defines bullying.

117
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:35,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, I'm talking about, I'm requesting or suggesting that that piece needs to be taken out in terms of defining bullying, how we define bullying if an incident occurs.

118
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:42,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

119
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now this is just a recommendation, right?

120
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because we would need potentially a vote to amend.

121
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's a few hands up, so.

122
00:10:57,472 --> 00:11:02,054
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Dr. Edweb-Minson is just marking the document so that we understand.

123
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:09,559
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to be clear, I also did look at several districts in our area.

124
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:16,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at the bullying and intervention plans for Arlington, Somerville, Cambridge, Malden, Winchester, Woburn, Waltham,

125
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:26,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Lexington and Everett, and I didn't see in any of theirs any, as part of the definition of bullying, anything to do with the power differential.

126
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:32,115
[SPEAKER_04]: That only comes up, and it comes up also in the model plan from DESE.

127
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:39,959
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes up as a potential professional development topic for educators.

128
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:10,891
[SPEAKER_02]: While Dr. Edward-Vincent marks this up, Member Hayes, do you have any other questions before I turn it over to Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham, then Ms.

129
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:11,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandley?

130
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:24,699
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was my main point, just because that's so essential to the whole thing, is understanding what our definition of bullying is in order to determine when an incident will be classified as bullying.

131
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

132
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,340
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

133
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,140
[SPEAKER_02]: wait on the motion to amend as see many hands are up.

134
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go to member McLaughlin.

135
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:38,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor.

136
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:43,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I have about six lines that I wanted to discuss.

137
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:47,665
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if you want to have me do like half and then come back and do half.

138
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:53,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So it gives other folks an opportunity to talk before, you know, so I'm not monopolizing time.

139
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's start out.

140
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:58,224
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

141
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:02,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you pages, numbers 95 and 96 please.

142
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:03,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

143
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:11,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment.

144
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:13,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and so I was curious about.

145
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like some elaboration on that I'm not sure what that.

146
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:23,729
[SPEAKER_09]: in particular means, I mean, I know in the rest of it, there was, can we go up to the heading here, the subheading?

147
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is, such training may include- Regarding training, right.

148
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:31,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Being limited to informational students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school.

149
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably our most vulnerable students, which was outlined in section, in numbers 72 through 76 as well.

150
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:42,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

151
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:46,033
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I just wanted to be,

152
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:48,129
[SPEAKER_09]: clear that it was in the training.

153
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,053
[SPEAKER_09]: So just, I wanted some clarity on that.

154
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I see where it was.

155
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:53,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I was reading earlier where that was.

156
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:58,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that was 95 and 96, information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment.

157
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:04,389
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I would love a note to have that be qualified.

158
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:17,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it's 72 through 76, say C72 through 76, so that we're all on the same page and what that actually means, because I think it's just vague as information on students who are particularly at risk.

159
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:19,092
[SPEAKER_09]: for bullying in the environment.

160
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:24,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So just if we could refer back to the earlier document in terms of what that is referring to.

161
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe in parentheses as referenced, but not as referenced, but not limited to what is in 72 to 76, but not limited to.

162
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:38,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

163
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:40,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Laura.

164
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo Kern also, Esquire.

165
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate that.

166
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:49,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And then 118.

167
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:06,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Post the approved bullying prevention and intervention policy on the Medford Public Schools website.

168
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:16,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and so this is, again, I know we're having a meeting in September to talk more about accessibility of materials and what have you.

169
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:22,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is particularly important for translation.

170
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:33,340
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if we're posting the approved bullying prevention and intervention policy on the Medford Public Schools website, I think we need to make it accessible to all.

171
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It can't be just in this language.

172
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:42,422
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm wondering where we're having, you know, so I would add, you know, including accessibility features.

173
00:15:42,482 --> 00:16:02,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So whether that's, you know, translation or what have you, but I think in particular, as I think a lot of districts, you know, are doing and maybe experiencing some language barriers around some of this, we need to really be proactive about it.

174
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,861
[SPEAKER_02]: The school's website was just revamped.

175
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:15,678
[SPEAKER_02]: from the same development company as the city and the city has a dropdown section where it can be translated and I believe five languages.

176
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:23,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would assume the schools is the same, but I don't know if somebody from the school department can confirm, but I assume that it's the same.

177
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:27,044
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have translation available on our website as well.

178
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:31,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is definitely something that is available.

179
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:57,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and so I think one of the things we can talk about, and again, we have a motion to do this at the beginning of the year, is how folks know about that and actually having cultural brokers or community stakeholders actually try it out and see if it's translating and it's actually accurate because as we all know, you need to use plain language and there might be things here that are not translating across.

180
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:09,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Culture, so I would say that we test this out as part of the translation and accessibility that we'll be discussing in the beginning of the year.

181
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:19,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like a note there, and if that needs to be in a motion, I can do that, but I don't wanna, I wanna go through the document as a whole before motions are made.

182
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:26,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we do a second, whatever, reading of it today, not at another time, I can make the motion then if it makes it easier.

183
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do it right now.

184
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:29,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to email.

185
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:31,184
[SPEAKER_02]: We have community liaisons, five of them.

186
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

187
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:38,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just see if they'll take a look over the next 30 days.

188
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

189
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:40,372
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be excellent.

190
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:45,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I did meet with your Metro Connects folks earlier, and I'm excited about the cultural liaisons there.

191
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:48,959
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be a great opportunity to look through this and see if it's actually translating.

192
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:51,699
[SPEAKER_09]: well with the tool that's used on the website.

193
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mary.

194
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate that.

195
00:17:55,442 --> 00:18:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll do one more before I stop and let colleagues and others talk, and then I'll just get back in the queue again if that's okay.

196
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's number 120.

197
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,561
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah, under incident reporting.

198
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:17,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there was some, there's another section, so 120 in general, the incident reporting.

199
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:29,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it might be, unless I missed it and I read it a couple of times, so I'm not sure that I, can you show me the next section, please?

200
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:33,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, hold on right there.

201
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:40,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a line, it's either under incident reporting or investigation.

202
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:52,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it as a whole in incident reporting because I wanted to ensure, and maybe my colleagues remember, and if they don't, I can look at it while others are asking questions to find the particular line.

203
00:18:52,241 --> 00:19:02,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I did find one line that sort of addressed it, but I want to ensure that it did address it later in the incident reporting, that incident reports and documents will be shared with

204
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,151
[SPEAKER_09]: all parties involved.

205
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:17,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this goes back to the motion that we had previously, that when there are behavior incidents or other incidents in the school that are potentially related to this bullying incident that those are part of, and that they're not excluded.

206
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:26,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right here, 188, in short, copies of all bullying investigation forms were part of the student file, but I think there was also a part of sharing.

207
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they said part of the student file, which essentially makes it shareable, but I'm not sure.

208
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:55,460
[SPEAKER_09]: This goes back to the concern that, you know, potentially incident reports could have been taken before the actual bullying complaint occurs and that those should have been made available to parents and guardians of the party prior to the bullying and the bullying investigation and that they should be part of the bullying investigation is essentially what I'm saying.

209
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:58,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone have any comments on that?

210
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:04,882
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a motion that we made earlier, but I don't see it anywhere, unless I missed it here.

211
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make sure that it's covered.

212
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:12,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just tell me, you said line number 120?

213
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,495
[SPEAKER_09]: 170, it was the incident, no, yeah, 120, incident reporting.

214
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:17,277
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the whole section of incident reporting.

215
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:20,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because it's the issue of incident reporting.

216
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,402
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we have it, 188.

217
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:22,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

218
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:26,907
[SPEAKER_09]: It says ensure copies of all forms are in the student file.

219
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:29,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you go further down decision and findings?

220
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:30,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

221
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:34,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep going.

222
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:35,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

223
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:57,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm not, I'll have to search it to see if there's anything that says that to that effect, but essentially, you know, it does say that it should be part of the student's file, but it doesn't say anything about copies, unless I missed it, about copies to the respective parties.

224
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:08,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like that should be already, you know, under the previous motion, but I want to make sure that it's reiterated.

225
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So 120, if you want to go back to 120.

226
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:21,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe, Superintendent, if you could just make a note there on incident reporting and documentation.

227
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:36,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll just do a search while we're also conversing because I just did 120 because I felt like it fell under the whole section and didn't see anything specific to providing copies of incident reports.

228
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to understand what is it that you want?

229
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:48,320
[SPEAKER_09]: On incident reporting line 120, if you can make a comment right there with the Google Doc, thank you.

230
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:57,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Documentation provided to all parties, question mark, and we can go back and revisit that while I look to see

231
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:00,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we have to remember the student confidentiality.

232
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:05,025
[SPEAKER_10]: So documents are shared, student information is redacted.

233
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:12,147
[SPEAKER_10]: So information being shared with the parent regarding their child, we have to like follow the law.

234
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:18,349
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not able to just send everything with other students first and last names.

235
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,571
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%, and that's not what I'm asking, superintendent.

236
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally understand that, and I understand redaction.

237
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:27,253
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm asking, and this was already addressed on the floor,

238
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:40,684
[SPEAKER_09]: is that when there are incident reports, so behavior incident reports involving a student, okay, where that incident report goes to the principal's office, because it typically does if there's been behavior involved.

239
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:49,411
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had had a motion that when that happens, that information is sent to parents so that they're notified as soon as reasonably possible.

240
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:54,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the motion in front of me right now, so that they have copies of any incident reports.

241
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So for instance, if an individual

242
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:10,569
[SPEAKER_09]: had been getting five, 10, maybe incident reports of behavior issues as an individual with a disability, for example, maybe having, you know, some, you know, who knows what medical issues as well, you know, who knows what's going on.

243
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:19,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they get to the point of a behavior, I mean, a bullying report, had the parent been notified of those 10 prior incident reports, right, that it occurred.

244
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:25,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And in a lot of instances, talking with families, talking with CPAC, talking with others, that had not often been the case.

245
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And the principal might come to the,

246
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:33,673
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting after 10 incidents with 10 reports in their hand that the parents have never seen.

247
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:40,500
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, this happened just a month ago that I was made aware of, even after the motion was passed, that parents would get copies of incident reports.

248
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,924
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've had this discussion before, to clarify.

249
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I want here is to have something that

250
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:50,929
[SPEAKER_09]: indicates that that policy exists as well and where that is.

251
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'll just read through.

252
00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:00,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I did see something that said, you know, material will be added to the student file, which again, you know, when we say to the student file, what does that actually mean?

253
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:03,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we do have to consider FERPA, which we know is a federal law.

254
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's all kinds of nuances around here.

255
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:14,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So I understand what you're saying, superintendent, around redacted names, but if it's your child and your child was involved in an incident, you have the right to know that your child was involved in an incident.

256
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:19,934
[SPEAKER_09]: And you should be getting a copy of that incident report if it's gone on file with the principal in the office.

257
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:21,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was what we had previously discussed.

258
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:28,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And names can be redacted, but you should know about your child's incident and not find it out from other families, members, or other students.

259
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:35,149
[SPEAKER_10]: So Member McLaughlin, what I'm just trying to understand is what would you like me to add in the comment box?

260
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:38,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now in the comment box, I would just like you to add, please revisit

261
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:46,558
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll look at this while we're continuing the conversation, please revisit regarding copies of incident reports.

262
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:54,299
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will look through this section again because there was something that was related there, but it was very vague and I wanna make sure that it's clear.

263
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

264
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:58,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

265
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,581
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I will pass and defer to my colleagues for the next ones.

266
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:04,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

267
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham and then Ms.

268
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:09,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Brantley.

269
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

270
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Superintendent, can you go back to member Hayes' question?

271
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to respond to that.

272
00:25:22,078 --> 00:25:28,220
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what is being perceived as a discrepancy here is, in my mind, it's not.

273
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're talking, there's two things.

274
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:33,782
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a definition of bullying, which is what you have highlighted here.

275
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:42,199
[SPEAKER_08]: When you scroll down to that next section, the intent of that was to describe what the findings could look like and why.

276
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And this power differential is absolutely part of the law.

277
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:56,568
[SPEAKER_08]: But what we were trying to do, and the reason it's sub-bulleted, is to say an investigation could conclude in any number of ways.

278
00:25:57,428 --> 00:26:07,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did that because I think what we found in the feedback that we got was that lots of things come back as like, this is not bullying, it's conflict.

279
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:12,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's never been, it's never clear to families, like, what does that mean?

280
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:17,673
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is, in my mind, this is not in conflict with the definition.

281
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:23,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It is instead and rather an attempt as a sub bullet to number 49,

282
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:37,716
[SPEAKER_08]: to be a way to explain findings, not to redefine in any way, shape or form like what bullying is, but to qualify like how findings come to be.

283
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,737
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

284
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:48,439
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a ton of discussion about this in five subcommittee meetings and this idea of what findings look like and what

285
00:26:49,019 --> 00:27:01,352
[SPEAKER_08]: parents can reasonably expect was something we worked really hard on to try to qualify for people so that when they're reading this, we're starting to set expectations for folks that this is

286
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:07,009
[SPEAKER_08]: that many things could happen as the result of a bullying investigation.

287
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just one, a finding of bullying is just one of those things.

288
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was my response when it comes to member Hayes' question.

289
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:21,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And then can you scroll down to member McLaughlin's next question?

290
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:26,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, on this bullet.

291
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is a sub bullet.

292
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:35,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you scroll up to the actual bullet, the bullet is part of what Medford Public Schools will do.

293
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:40,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the second bullet there, if you scroll down a little bit,

294
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:52,053
[SPEAKER_08]: On row 80, MedBurgh Public Schools will provide age appropriate instruction on bullying intervention to students and professional development to build the skills of the staff as required by law.

295
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:55,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Staff will receive annual training on the bullying prevention intervention plan.

296
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:58,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Such training may include, but not be limited to, and then there's a list.

297
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: If I recall correctly, this list was part of the current policy.

298
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:15,506
[SPEAKER_08]: All that we did here was try to make it more clear what this list was because there were a lot of lists in the original policy and it was just sort of a mess to try to understand what it was.

299
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:18,108
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is framed as

300
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:29,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Things Medford public schools will do, we will provide age appropriate instruction and annual professional development that training may include but will not be limited to these things.

301
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really at the discretion of the superintendent to decide what that annual training looks like.

302
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:42,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And so one of those topics could be information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment.

303
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:57,709
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not unlike any other, so I am personally of the mind that we don't need to sort of complicate it with like a reference back to something because it's a sub-bullet that just describes the kinds of things that could happen in professional development.

304
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:05,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And then could you scroll down to Member McLaughlin's other question, incident reports?

305
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:18,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess what I was thinking about as you were talking, Member McLaughlin, is if that motion, and I think the answer is it's not quite there yet, but we made a motion about incident reports.

306
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:23,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we didn't do was codify it into policy.

307
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:32,214
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think incident reports can be about many, many things over and above what happens as it relates to this bullying report.

308
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:39,237
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I think would be most appropriate is for us to codify that incident report

309
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:42,616
[SPEAKER_08]: motion that we made into a policy.

310
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:55,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when we do that, we just come back and we make an update to this policy to add a reference that this bullying policy will substantially conform with that policy.

311
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:55,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So

312
00:29:56,815 --> 00:30:01,177
[SPEAKER_08]: When you write policy, you don't want to put things in lots of places because it becomes really hard to manage.

313
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:09,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think incident reporting in that context that we already passed is much, much bigger than it is specific to bullying.

314
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:15,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would rather see us formalize that as a policy and then come back to this document and reference.

315
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:19,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's just a suggestion on how we move forward on that question.

316
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,090
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I had, Mayor.

317
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

318
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:29,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Brantley?

319
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:34,364
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Member Hayes.

320
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:40,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

321
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Brantley, are you there?

322
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I think somebody may need to unmute her.

323
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, there she goes.

324
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like I still can't start my video, but that's OK.

325
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:51,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

326
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:53,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

327
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you can't start.

328
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:55,939
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

329
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:56,599
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's OK.

330
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:56,800
[SPEAKER_06]: It's OK.

331
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:18,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just wanted to say, in the fact of what member Hayes was saying, I just think all the refining that we did during all of these meetings was just so helpful to see happen as a parent, because those refinings were not there when we were in our situation.

332
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:26,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think as much depth as we can put in this, which I think we've done, this looks so good to me, it makes me so happy.

333
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:38,834
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have in here is just so helpful as a parent to know all the little details here and there that when you're in the midst of something traumatic, to know that you can read this and it all makes sense.

334
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:42,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can say, oh, this is exactly what was happening in our situation.

335
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,097
[SPEAKER_06]: This is exactly what's supposed to happen next.

336
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:50,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just think the refining that we did was just so helpful.

337
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be so helpful to the next set of parents that have to deal with something like this.

338
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:53,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully they don't.

339
00:31:55,751 --> 00:32:07,879
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm just curious on member McLaughlin's comment about, you know, if there were 10 incident reports and then a bullying report, I would like to think there wouldn't be 10 incident reports and then a bullying investigation, right?

340
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:18,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know that we had three before a bullying investigation and already an assault at that point.

341
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:21,908
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just hoping that,

342
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:31,107
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to go down, any parent doesn't have to go down that long road anymore that there will be, this policy will help nip everything immediately.

343
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:32,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know, is it a conflict?

344
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:33,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it bullying?

345
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:40,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And then how to put all the pieces together after that and how to actually execute the policy.

346
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to just comment on those things.

347
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:42,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

348
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:48,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

349
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Hayes and Member McLaughlin.

350
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:53,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

351
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:01,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So just going back again to the definition, so two things I guess I would like to just make clear.

352
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I have looked through the state law several times.

353
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:10,843
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no mention of the power differential except as a topic for professional development.

354
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:21,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'd be happy if someone wants to tell me where they're seeing it, but I did look back again, because I know that was also said at the last meeting, that it appears several times, and it only appears

355
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:29,774
[SPEAKER_04]: again, is a topic for professional development, not anywhere in terms of how you determine whether a particular incident is bullying.

356
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:46,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of how it's written in this policy, I think that's one of the important things after a committee has gone through as much time as this committee went through, then to present it to people with a fresh eye who look at this and say, but that doesn't make sense to me.

357
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at that with a fresh eye and saying, that particular piece doesn't make sense to me.

358
00:33:52,403 --> 00:34:05,151
[SPEAKER_04]: because it does seem to be saying the way that it's worded is that a finding of bullying occurs when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the core rule of problem.

359
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:20,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me as reading that, it says to me as a parent or as a school committee member, I'm looking at that thinking that's telling me that the only time an incident is going to be or one time when an incident is going to be considered bullying

360
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:25,310
[SPEAKER_04]: is when someone determines that there's a power differential.

361
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't see that anywhere in the state law.

362
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:32,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see that anywhere in the DESE model.

363
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:47,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, to me, that seems to suggest a change in the meaning or a change in the scope of the definition of how we're gonna determine bullying, which the state says we shouldn't do that, that we should not change the meaning or the scope.

364
00:34:50,328 --> 00:35:01,211
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were to go down this road, again, I wouldn't vote in favor of this in it because I think that it changes the meaning, but we'd have to define how someone would determine a power differential.

365
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:19,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an incredibly nuanced and difficult thing to determine in any situation, but certainly among students, how they define power, how the power structures are among students, I think would get us into some really tricky and gray areas.

366
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,943
[SPEAKER_04]: But more importantly than that, as I said, it's not part of the state definition.

367
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think it should be part of our definition.

368
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:29,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

369
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

370
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:39,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

371
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:40,415
[SPEAKER_12]: 125, please.

372
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:54,414
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is, yeah, we're still under the incident reporting piece.

373
00:35:54,494 --> 00:36:01,938
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I wanted to, first of all, if I could, through the chair, address member Graham's comments, which I appreciate.

374
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I have two things.

375
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:16,926
[SPEAKER_09]: One is I think maybe as part of like school committee onboarding for folks that are coming in or what have you is, you know, this sort of idea of this notion of codifying into policy.

376
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:18,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that,

377
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:28,521
[SPEAKER_09]: TAB, Tila Duhaime): Maybe folks you know aren't always clear that if emotion passes that it should be one would assume it would be implemented, but.

378
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:34,590
[SPEAKER_09]: TAB, Tila Duhaime): In that motion was passed, but I think to your point codifying it into policy.

379
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:36,123
[SPEAKER_09]: is another step.

380
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:38,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think we really need to be thinking about that on the floor.

381
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:51,173
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're making motions, if these motions need to go into policy to actually be enacted, it's gonna take up a lot more time in our policy subcommittee, but that's an interesting point and one that I hear you saying.

382
00:36:51,273 --> 00:37:00,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will definitely be revisiting that in the fall, but it's something that I would like the committee as a whole to consider.

383
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:13,721
[SPEAKER_09]: because it sounds like a slippery slope to me a little bit where if motions are passed, but and or aren't codified into policy, does that mean that they're not being enforced?

384
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:15,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have to also codify motions into policy?

385
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:20,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that's sort of another step that I'm questioning, but I appreciate again, that being brought up.

386
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:27,104
[SPEAKER_09]: The decisions and findings, can you scroll down to that please Mayor?

387
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually it's investigation and decision and finding.

388
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:35,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see anything in this material.

389
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:41,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, unless I'm wrong, I read through it, but I was marking through my notes and I don't see anything in here.

390
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it's back at investigation or maybe it's back at report.

391
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:56,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really sure where my colleagues think it should go, but I do think that we need something in this report that says, you know, we will provide a,

392
00:37:57,663 --> 00:37:59,847
[SPEAKER_09]: translation and interpretation as needed.

393
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:12,686
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know when you're sharing bullying reports, when you're sharing investigation findings, when you're sharing decision and findings, how is that being shared with our community who might not have English as

394
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:21,091
[SPEAKER_09]: a first language or might not have English at all and are getting their material translated through their student or through other folks.

395
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:29,574
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we need to say that we will provide translation and interpretation to families who have English as a second language.

396
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Another really important lesson that I learned

397
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:37,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too long ago, this was actually in the IEP process, where I was speaking with a mom.

398
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:38,453
[SPEAKER_09]: This was actually a while ago.

399
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:39,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't not too long ago.

400
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:41,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It was probably five or more years ago.

401
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:57,171
[SPEAKER_09]: But I had become friendly with a mom who was a native Vietnamese speaker, could converse in English, and I had reached out to the Vietnamese community advocates to support her and to get help for her.

402
00:38:58,032 --> 00:39:05,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had said, does she have the IEP translated into Vietnamese?

403
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember at the time saying, oh, no, no, she can speak English.

404
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:12,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was my naivete, ignorance, whatever you want to say.

405
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:19,343
[SPEAKER_09]: But speaking a language and deciphering complex content are two different things.

406
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:24,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to have it in one's original language or to have an interpreter or translator provided

407
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:37,161
[SPEAKER_09]: or translation of documents provided sorry interpreters speech translation is print so to have those things and provided I think is important and I don't see that on this document here again like to miss brownies point.

408
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:41,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly, Ms.

409
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:46,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Brownlee, that I would hope that there would not be incident reports that had not been shared.

410
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:55,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the whole point of why we're moving forward with so many of these things, because we were in the situation where those weren't shared.

411
00:39:55,221 --> 00:40:03,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And in some instances, we continue to be in the situation, and hopefully these things are remediating that, particularly training for principals and others.

412
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:07,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So I couldn't agree more, but I also think that this,

413
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:17,667
[SPEAKER_09]: interpretation of the report, interpretation of findings, interpretation of decision, interpretation of rights.

414
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:26,833
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to have somewhere that this material will be interpreted or translated for those whose language is not English as a first language.

415
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:30,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Murray, Dr. Edwards-Vincent for putting that in there.

416
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:31,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And then 178, please.

417
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:55,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that capture it just having it in front?

418
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:57,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know if it's going to be under decision and findings.

419
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:03,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be earlier with report filing, to be honest, because they need to know what's going on in the process.

420
00:41:04,184 --> 00:41:10,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would say maybe up as high as, yeah, add this to whatever the report, the incident under incident reports or something.

421
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:15,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you.

422
00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:19,069
[SPEAKER_12]: 178, please.

423
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:41,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, what was the number you said?

424
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:41,285
178.

425
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:44,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

426
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:56,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and so I just wanted to point out to the central student information, whether it's school brains or what have you to store these incident and investigation forms and

427
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,261
[SPEAKER_09]: all of the disciplinary remediation, all of those things.

428
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:06,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, again, I think that just needs to be vetted for FERPA and needs to be vetted for security.

429
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:09,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's just the note I would put there.

430
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:14,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what, you know, how does that, I don't know that it does in school brands.

431
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:15,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that they have the student ID in there.

432
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:17,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know that they have all these other records in there.

433
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:25,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what the requirements are for FERPA for, I know for our company, we have to submit forms when working with like state,

434
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,722
[SPEAKER_09]: programs to ensure that we have safety and security around this information.

435
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:37,304
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would just like a note around that, please.

436
00:42:38,404 --> 00:42:47,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Through the chair member McLaughlin, I don't know if you bullet 183 talks about how this information is a temporary record.

437
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,970
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is all part of

438
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:59,283
[SPEAKER_10]: what we're required to do, that discipline information is part of a temporary record and it's kept for six years after graduation of involved students.

439
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:01,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I hear you.

440
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:02,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's important.

441
00:43:02,804 --> 00:43:07,025
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm saying is that the 178 is saying maintain a central student information system.

442
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:12,226
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like it's wanting to digitally store incident, all of these forms.

443
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:14,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm saying around digital security around this,

444
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:16,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is it a paper storage?

445
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:16,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

446
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:24,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And are we ensured that this material is digitally stored and, you know, in a safe way that FERPA is not being violated for students?

447
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:27,683
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be my question, the digital piece.

448
00:43:27,703 --> 00:43:38,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have the, you know, do we have the digital certification to ensure that this information is stored securely under FERPA requirements is what I'm asking.

449
00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:38,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

450
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you and then 188.

451
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:21,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So, ensuring all copies of these, you know, are of all of these forms are kept in the student are placed in the student file, and I guess I would defer defer to.

452
00:44:25,824 --> 00:44:28,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Director of Pupil Services, Joan Bowen, on some of this.

453
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:36,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know just like, for example, for the individual behavior plans, yeah, they're in the student file, but that doesn't mean anybody can access them.

454
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:39,831
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they need to be in a secure situation.

455
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:48,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, for students who are on an IEP, if they have a behavior support plan, so that's how I would word it too, I would just behavior support plan.

456
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:50,716
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they have a behavior support plan,

457
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:56,767
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, there are people who can see it and then people, you know, and hopefully are reading it and are using it.

458
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:01,792
[SPEAKER_09]: But not everybody can because it might also contain medical information.

459
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:03,994
[SPEAKER_09]: It might contain, you know, who knows what.

460
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:11,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess what I'm saying there is, is that I would, I want to hear what the director of people's services has to say about this 188 to 190.

461
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:37,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So, my understanding with this so there's two different things so if a student is a student with a disability and they have a behavior support plan that is part of their, their record their special education binder that anyone that is providing services are working directly with that student has access to that file to look at it to read all the documents that are in there.

462
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:48,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I think bully investigation forms, reporting forms, those would go into more of a student record folder, which is separate from special education.

463
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:52,259
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be the folder that's kept with the guidance counselor.

464
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:06,782
[SPEAKER_01]: We also could come up with a way of storing that it's in one central office, maybe at central administration, my office, whoever's office that they come in, we keep them in a yearly,

465
00:46:07,903 --> 00:46:10,387
[SPEAKER_01]: older in a secure office, something like that.

466
00:46:10,427 --> 00:46:19,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just the within the district determining how we want to store those and to maintain confidentiality and FERPA and all of the above.

467
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:19,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

468
00:46:20,002 --> 00:46:21,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess I thank you.

469
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:33,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Bowen, so I guess on that 190, I would add that comment that, you know, so special education files are separate from quote student file.

470
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:45,730
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're talking about the records that are being destroyed in this sort of student record file versus special education, and they're under very different laws and what have you.

471
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to think, yeah, about how that is, how we wanna word that.

472
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:50,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

473
00:46:51,368 --> 00:47:00,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I only have two more left and I would ask my colleagues if they're okay with me just going through the two more before switching out or I know, through the chair member grams next.

474
00:47:02,254 --> 00:47:04,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it okay for me to go through two more, Mayor.

475
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:09,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, two more is fine and then we'll go to member and then hopefully we can.

476
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:11,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

477
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Five or so.

478
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:13,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

479
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:28,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so if physical injuries occurred and have not been examined, asking a nurse to examine the target and aggressor.

480
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:35,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a little bit of like, I don't know, there's a little bit of a question here.

481
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:42,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So one is obviously if the injury is severe enough that they need other care, it wouldn't be the nurse that's doing this, right?

482
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:44,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe in a

483
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:51,123
[SPEAKER_09]: in an emergency situation, the nurse is there, what have you.

484
00:47:51,163 --> 00:48:04,806
[SPEAKER_09]: But for example, in situations where there is abuse, it can be worse for the patient, and this is just trauma-informed practice.

485
00:48:05,026 --> 00:48:13,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Avery could talk to some of this as well, but if there's injuries that occur, having the individual

486
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:23,227
[SPEAKER_09]: relive the experience over and over and over again can cause additional trauma and can also affect the outcome of the.

487
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:29,337
[SPEAKER_09]: nature of the story sometimes in terms of what happened when.

488
00:48:29,877 --> 00:48:40,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm not sure what we're saying about asking us to examine the target and aggressor, especially if there's an emergent situation and it's more serious.

489
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:42,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to put a note there.

490
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:51,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to tag that for a second for conversation around what exactly, I mean, if the opportunity is available and the injuries are such that they're not severe enough for

491
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:56,436
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, an ambulance or police or what have you to be called, that might be different.

492
00:48:57,016 --> 00:49:05,099
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would love, I know she's not here right now, but I guess, you know, it would have been good to hear Avery's input on that or somebody's because I'm not.

493
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm not sure what the requirements are there.

494
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:09,381
[SPEAKER_09]: But just want to put a pin in that.

495
00:49:10,222 --> 00:49:11,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And then 365.

496
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:14,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's my last one.

497
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,764
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you guys for your patience.

498
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:29,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so PRS.

499
00:49:30,113 --> 00:49:35,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, I guess I would ask the director of people's services about this too.

500
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:46,005
[SPEAKER_09]: PRS is one option for collaboration with families, but it's usually involving special education or an individual with a disability, if I'm not mistaken.

501
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:51,008
[SPEAKER_09]: In other instances, it's not PRS, it's the office of civil rights.

502
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:54,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So director, yes, Bowen, if I could through the chair.

503
00:49:55,768 --> 00:50:03,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanna clarify that PRS can be families, general education families and special education families.

504
00:50:03,595 --> 00:50:18,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So a parent of a student who does not have a disability, if the bullying and plan was not followed, they have that ability to go through PRS to see if the district did follow their procedures and policy.

505
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:20,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

506
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:22,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's in terms of the procedure and policy.

507
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:27,270
[SPEAKER_09]: And what about how does that differentiate from the Office of Civil Rights?

508
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know that bullying incidents also go through the Office of Civil Rights.

509
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:35,151
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like if we're providing this, we also want to provide the information on the Office of Civil Rights.

510
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:39,272
[SPEAKER_09]: So why would we not also provide that information?

511
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:42,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Or would we?

512
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:43,873
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm saying.

513
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to defer to see, you know, like what is included in other bullying and preventions.

514
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:58,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look into it and get back to you, but I mean, I don't see why it shouldn't be in there.

515
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:07,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I think we have it on all the other documentation, so why not offer it as, you know, because it's part of the procedural safeguards for families regardless.

516
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:14,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's in part of the procedural safeguards for individuals with disabilities, but I think some parents might not understand that PRS

517
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:17,407
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I hadn't thought about that in terms of the procedure.

518
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:18,468
[SPEAKER_09]: They are about procedure.

519
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So I could see how it would be.

520
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:26,154
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be individuals without disabilities regarding procedure, but it also could fall under Office of Civil Rights.

521
00:51:26,234 --> 00:51:29,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that people need to know that there are both of those options.

522
00:51:29,697 --> 00:51:32,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I would ask.

523
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:36,543
[SPEAKER_12]: So the note I would put in there is include information on Office of Civil Rights, please.

524
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:39,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

525
00:51:40,146 --> 00:51:40,466
[SPEAKER_12]: That's me.

526
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:44,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham.

527
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

528
00:51:49,937 --> 00:51:53,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to make a motion to amend the policy at line 259.

529
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:12,255
[SPEAKER_08]: To insert a bullet that reads provide interpretation and translation services for families so that a comprehensive and productive collaboration can occur.

530
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna just put it in the chat so that everyone can read it.

531
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:19,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you repeat it one more time, Member Graham?

532
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I was just- I just put it in the chat.

533
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:22,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you did.

534
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:23,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

535
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:23,791
Yeah.

536
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm screen sharing, I'm not- Yeah.

537
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:27,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if I can find that.

538
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:28,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

539
00:52:29,953 --> 00:52:39,456
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the reason that it goes here is because it's an overarching requirement of central administration to make sure that this is available to families as they need it.

540
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:43,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And how you operationalize that is something that the central administration would be responsible for.

541
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

542
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:45,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

543
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

544
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:53,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call, please.

545
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:54,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau.

546
00:52:54,813 --> 00:52:55,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, we can't vote on this.

547
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:57,234
[SPEAKER_12]: We have another motion on the floor.

548
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you remind me what the other motion was?

549
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:08,377
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion is to suspend Rule 46 by me and seconded by Member Graham.

550
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, motion to suspend rule 46.

551
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:17,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call vote, please.

552
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:19,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham?

553
00:53:20,557 --> 00:53:20,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

554
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:22,578

555
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:24,000
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

556
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:25,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Kretz?

557
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:26,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

558
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:28,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin?

559
00:53:30,105 --> 00:53:30,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

560
00:53:31,806 --> 00:53:33,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McStone is absent.

561
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:35,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rossell?

562
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:35,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

563
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, motion is approved, five in the favor, one opposed, one absent.

564
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Now motion to amend line 259 with what is written in the chat by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin, roll call please.

565
00:53:57,218 --> 00:53:57,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

566
00:53:58,358 --> 00:53:58,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

567
00:53:59,618 --> 00:54:00,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hayes?

568
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:00,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

569
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kratz?

570
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

571
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:04,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

572
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:05,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

573
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:08,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Stone is absent, sorry.

574
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rossell, yes, Mayor Longo, current.

575
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:15,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

576
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:19,139
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that was six in the, seven in the affirmative.

577
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:21,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, no, Member Stone's absent, so six in one.

578
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

579
00:54:27,403 --> 00:54:29,244
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can just give me one more second.

580
00:54:30,624 --> 00:54:33,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Member McLaughlin's motion to amend,

581
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:44,936
[SPEAKER_02]: lines 95 to 96 to read as reference, but not limited to the language.

582
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll withdraw.

583
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:47,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

584
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:50,839
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can just give me like one second, I'm actually typing something about that.

585
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:51,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

586
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:53,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Hayes.

587
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:57,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

588
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:04,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to make sure I know when I was speaking about the definition, I'm not sure that I clearly made a motion to

589
00:55:05,717 --> 00:55:12,240
[SPEAKER_04]: to remove the part about the power differential.

590
00:55:17,422 --> 00:55:18,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

591
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:22,704
[SPEAKER_02]: No official motion right now on that yet.

592
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:26,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'd like to make a motion if I can.

593
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:30,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, did you want to speak on that?

594
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:32,042
[SPEAKER_02]: or something else?

595
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:33,903
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I did wanna speak on that.

596
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:45,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And with all due respect around the power imbalance, stopbullying.gov and even Australia lists the power imbalance in the definition within the first sentence.

597
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:55,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I also, you're not supposed to speak about your personal experiences, but as someone who was pretty routinely bullied up through the sixth grade,

598
00:55:56,796 --> 00:56:00,438
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's probably why I do what I do, it was a definite imbalance of power.

599
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:08,482
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not for anything else than an imbalance of power until I was able to tip the scales.

600
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:14,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever it may be, it is definitely an imbalance of power.

601
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:17,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

602
00:56:18,527 --> 00:56:20,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor, do I still have the floor or have we moved on?

603
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:21,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

604
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:28,943
[SPEAKER_02]: While you were typing, Member Hayes made the motion to remove the imbalance of power language.

605
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:30,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there was a second.

606
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:31,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second out there?

607
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:33,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a point of information, Mayor.

608
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:38,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if I could get some clarity on the motion because- Point of information by Member McLaughlin.

609
00:56:40,328 --> 00:56:40,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Clarity on the motion.

610
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:41,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I ask a question?

611
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:42,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

612
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:43,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

613
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:44,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

614
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:48,552
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am hearing, if I'm hearing correctly,

615
00:56:49,577 --> 00:56:55,179
[SPEAKER_09]: The request is around using consistent language for bullying.

616
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have the language earlier as the definition of bullying.

617
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:10,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have these additional aspects of other sort of, I guess I would say second tier deeper digging into other sort of definitions of bullying.

618
00:57:11,877 --> 00:57:25,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what I'm hearing is consistency, but then if I'm not mistaken, I'm hearing through member Graham that it's about sort of subdividing under a different category, what those would be.

619
00:57:25,848 --> 00:57:32,433
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the issue is the power differential if I'm understanding the issue correctly, but let me just finish.

620
00:57:32,893 --> 00:57:39,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm asking if that is the issue is the power differential or is the issue that we're not using consistent language in the definition.

621
00:57:40,427 --> 00:57:49,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the issue is the power balance issue is the question because it leaves ambiguous who can decide whether there's a power differential or not.

622
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:51,956
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the questions I have about that.

623
00:57:52,156 --> 00:58:02,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll let member Hayes have the floor to answer those so we can move forward on this motion and then go to member Graham's language for the next roll call.

624
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:05,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

625
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So the issue I'm bringing up is

626
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:12,148
[SPEAKER_04]: is that the power differential does not occur in our state law definition.

627
00:58:12,268 --> 00:58:19,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I do understand and I have looked at the federal government's website, stopbullying.gov, and they do talk about a power differential.

628
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:24,651
[SPEAKER_04]: However, our state definition is very clearly does not include that.

629
00:58:25,731 --> 00:58:37,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my concern and my belief is that we are waiting into a change of the definition if we start to include that as part of the definition of the way that we

630
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:53,366
[SPEAKER_04]: of the way that we determine when a bullying incident has occurred, which is what this page says, that it will be determined to have occurred when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power.

631
00:58:53,726 --> 00:59:06,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do understand, and I think that we see that also in the state, the DESE's model plan, they do talk about the power differential as part of something that

632
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:10,488
[SPEAKER_04]: that educators need to have professional development about.

633
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:17,512
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not saying that doesn't exist, but they do not include that as part of the definition for determining when bullying has occurred.

634
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:31,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So my motion is to remove that power differential as it's worded anyway, it appears to be part of the definition and part of what we will use to determine when an incident is classified as bullying.

635
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it doesn't match the state law.

636
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:38,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

637
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:43,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm gonna see if there's a second on the floor to remove that language.

638
00:59:44,052 --> 00:59:49,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you just identify the number, line number that you wanna remove from?

639
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:49,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 55 to 61.

640
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:51,694
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

641
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And swapping or 55 through actually 63, I think.

642
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:55,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I would second.

643
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:09,473
[SPEAKER_02]: point of order.

644
01:00:09,493 --> 01:00:12,294
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 point of water member result.

645
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:15,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Members are only people allowed to make motions.

646
01:00:15,275 --> 01:00:20,056
[SPEAKER_11]: No offense to our superintendent members should make motions by stating the motion.

647
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:23,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Um and know what they're saying is their motion.

648
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:29,799
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to take minutes here so we can take votes and I have people like making suggestions and comments.

649
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:32,779
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a public legislative body.

650
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:35,320
[SPEAKER_11]: We are making motions to modify

651
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,703
[SPEAKER_11]: policy.

652
01:00:36,723 --> 01:00:42,068
[SPEAKER_11]: We are not having a conversation about my opinions of this, that, and the other, and what websites say what.

653
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:50,595
[SPEAKER_11]: So if members could do their jobs and make motions so that I can write the minutes and we can take legally binding votes, I would greatly appreciate it.

654
01:00:50,615 --> 01:00:50,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

655
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:52,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Rossell.

656
01:00:52,457 --> 01:00:58,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Member Hayes, I'm understanding that your motion is to remove the power

657
01:00:59,403 --> 01:01:06,128
[SPEAKER_02]: and balance language from section line item, section under policy line numbers 55.

658
01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:09,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I can state it.

659
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:13,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to remove lines 55 through 63 and reinsert or insert in their place line 17 through 24.

660
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:14,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

661
01:01:29,158 --> 01:01:33,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I ask for just one minute to read this?

662
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:37,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor, I have a comment before we vote.

663
01:01:37,704 --> 01:01:39,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, comment before you vote.

664
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:39,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

665
01:01:42,948 --> 01:01:48,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I think just trying to drop in a definition here totally sort of

666
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:55,466
[SPEAKER_08]: diminishes the entire intent of 49 all the way through to 64.

667
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,408
[SPEAKER_08]: That was written as a block intentionally.

668
01:01:58,528 --> 01:02:13,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I am absolutely not in favor of doing this in this way because it does not take into account the relationship of the three things that could come out of a finding, which is conflict, bullying or not bullying or conflict.

669
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:15,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you just,

670
01:02:16,144 --> 01:02:24,050
[SPEAKER_08]: change this piece, the integrity of the whole section is not quite right and it's confusing.

671
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:28,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am not in favor of this and I will vote no, I'll happily do that.

672
01:02:29,294 --> 01:02:40,643
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm asking my colleagues to really think about how to do this thing that they're asking us to do without compromising other really important components of this document.

673
01:02:42,104 --> 01:02:43,085
[SPEAKER_09]: May I ask a question?

674
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:45,935
[SPEAKER_12]: member McLaughlin.

675
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

676
01:02:50,959 --> 01:03:10,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that when I'm looking at this bullying, so I get that conflict bullying, not bullying, which I want to talk about the flow chart as well that Peter had created around helping simplify this because I think that's part of the issue is that we need to have some visual clarity because this is a, I forget how, 16 page document.

677
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:14,777
[SPEAKER_09]: That can be a lot and a lot of folks are TLDR, but also a lot of folks are visual learners.

678
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,880
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't addressed that piece either, which I want to address before this meeting is over.

679
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:31,246
[SPEAKER_09]: But this particularly suggests to me that a finding of bullying only occurs when there is students who are not considered to be equal in power.

680
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:36,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So when the incident is determined between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the quality of problem.

681
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:41,592
[SPEAKER_09]: So what if the students are equal in power and one is bullying the other?

682
01:03:42,632 --> 01:03:43,853
[SPEAKER_09]: How is that investigation

683
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:46,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we said earlier.

684
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:47,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, question.

685
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:51,476
[SPEAKER_09]: So how is that qualified if they are equal in power and there's a bullying?

686
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:53,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I respond to that?

687
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:56,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we did talk about that in subcommittee quite a lot.

688
01:03:56,458 --> 01:04:02,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great question, because I'm I'm trying to dissect to see if there's a middle ground somewhere in this line item.

689
01:04:02,081 --> 01:04:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, member Graham.

690
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:10,606
[SPEAKER_08]: So we we talked about this extensively with lots of principles on the phone and we really pressed them on this.

691
01:04:10,826 --> 01:04:12,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that they described

692
01:04:14,778 --> 01:04:21,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the same behavior could be bullying and it could be conflict.

693
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:26,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And the differentiation of those two things is really about power.

694
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:36,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you have two students who do not have a power differential and they are having a problem, that finding is gonna come back as conflict.

695
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So the two students are having conflict

696
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:52,227
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's a way forward and it is not like a sustained repetitive thing that that's exactly why so many things come back as conflict and not as bullying.

697
01:04:52,327 --> 01:05:07,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what the administrators described, and Dr. Cushing can keep me honest here if I am misremembering, but that they described that one of the reasons why parents are so upset when their finding comes back as conflict is because

698
01:05:09,403 --> 01:05:26,036
[SPEAKER_08]: the decision that's being made, and it's absolutely being made in all of these cases, is that these students, these two students in question, they legitimately are having a conflict, but the conflict is not exacerbated by this power differential.

699
01:05:26,577 --> 01:05:28,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And instead, the finding is conflict.

700
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:33,582
[SPEAKER_08]: The very same things can happen in the output of conflict versus bullying.

701
01:05:33,803 --> 01:05:35,504
[SPEAKER_08]: The very same things can happen.

702
01:05:36,044 --> 01:05:37,005
[SPEAKER_08]: The difference is,

703
01:05:38,366 --> 01:05:43,450
[SPEAKER_08]: it rises to the level of bullying when certain criteria are in place.

704
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:58,821
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we heard again and again and again from the administrators who do this every single day is that the actual thing that differentiates bullying from conflict is like, is this this idea of is there a power differential here?

705
01:05:58,861 --> 01:05:59,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes or no.

706
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:06,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, frankly, administrators are like assessing power differentials like all day long, every single day in a school.

707
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:10,188
[SPEAKER_08]: that's just sort of the nature of being an administrator in a school.

708
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:15,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that was one of the things we talked a lot about.

709
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:21,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And prior, like the policy, it said something like, well, it could be bullying or it could be conflict.

710
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:27,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was no qualification for like what that meant, why it meant, or like how parents could understand like

711
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:32,052
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that mean for me and what happens next?

712
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:40,466
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we really pushed the administrators on this like over the course of several meetings to help us define

713
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:44,208
[SPEAKER_08]: how can we set people's expectations about this thing?

714
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is why you have this.

715
01:06:46,109 --> 01:07:04,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the motion is to replace this piece, you're degrading this, the intent and the spirit of this section, which is to like help people understand what is conflict and what is bullying and what is, or that both could not be true.

716
01:07:05,175 --> 01:07:06,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And without,

717
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:14,523
[SPEAKER_08]: a thoughtful look at how this whole section works, like we're doing a disservice to the policy that we've worked really hard on.

718
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:21,449
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, just point of clarification maybe, or you know.

719
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:25,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of order or point of information with a question, point of order with a statement.

720
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:27,394
[SPEAKER_04]: With a statement, point of order.

721
01:07:27,895 --> 01:07:33,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate that you talked with the principals, I think that's important, but I also think that

722
01:07:35,066 --> 01:08:01,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the state law trumps what we believe to be true about, I mean, if there's a state definition and that straight definition does have criteria for what determines an incident to be actual bullying, and they don't include a power differential, again, I think that we're changing the scope of that definition by adding the power differential to it.

723
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:13,171
[SPEAKER_04]: There are actual criteria for why a conflict in the state law, how it becomes determined to be bullying it places the victim and reasonable fear of harm to himself or damage to their property.

724
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:14,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very well.

725
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: The very clearest part of it is that has to be three or more incidents.

726
01:08:18,813 --> 01:08:23,074
[SPEAKER_04]: That is repeated use three or more incidents and there's a series of five criteria.

727
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,354
[SPEAKER_04]: that lead to the finding of bullying.

728
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:33,198
[SPEAKER_04]: But those five criteria do not include a power differential in the state law and the state definition.

729
01:08:34,379 --> 01:08:36,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, Member McLaughlin.

730
01:08:37,082 --> 01:08:37,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

731
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:41,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Since I sort of had brought up this with questions, I appreciate getting the floor back again.

732
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:41,745
[SPEAKER_09]: One is

733
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:49,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear the nuance in this discussion, and I think it's important.

734
01:08:49,364 --> 01:09:03,157
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would really ask also our colleagues, as a whole, if we're not using value statements around individuals doing their work, or whether they're degrading something, or that sort of language.

735
01:09:03,357 --> 01:09:03,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at every policy

736
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,101
[SPEAKER_09]: subcommittee meeting with the exception of one.

737
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:20,430
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of this must have been the last conversation too, because I hadn't heard a lot of the argument around this, or I'll have to look back at the minutes because I don't recall a lot of the arguments or discussion around this.

738
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:27,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I can see both sides in terms of the power differential, but this is a very subjective thing, power differential.

739
01:09:28,055 --> 01:09:33,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like we had instances with our own family members who were very much being bullied.

740
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,881
[SPEAKER_09]: In this situation, there was a power differential.

741
01:09:37,442 --> 01:09:45,407
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not seen necessarily by the principal because the principal very likely doesn't understand nuances of middle school power dynamics.

742
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:49,850
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're very subtle and can be relational as opposed to physical.

743
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,170
[SPEAKER_09]: They can be all sorts of things.

744
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:55,713
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's why there's such clarity and why and how you find a

745
01:09:57,689 --> 01:10:16,321
[SPEAKER_09]: finding of bullying, and my concern my main concern about this which I think power differentials are an issue, and very much very often are the instances but not only and also it leaves to somebody discretion to determine whether there's a power differential as opposed to the other requirements that are part of state law which I think

746
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:17,401
[SPEAKER_09]: is critical.

747
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:36,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm a little, I'm a little conflicted around this, which is why I'm having or asking that this be thought out a little bit more to do the chair to member Graham's point I understand what you're saying about wanting to really clarify the conflict bullying and not bullying because believe me, ours was ruled conflict and it, you know,

748
01:10:37,447 --> 01:10:44,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And many others have been, as I've known, and I think would qualify under this, but it's because it leaves it so subjective to what this is.

749
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:50,259
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this even makes it more subjective, frankly, around the power differential.

750
01:10:50,339 --> 01:11:00,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know how to fix this, and I don't know if it's a state fix or what it is, but I think that maybe there's some middle ground, there's some opportunity for some rewarding or negotiation or something here, because

751
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:23,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear both sides of the argument and it's concerning for me, especially around, you know, and it still didn't answer the question is what happens when, you know, two people are in a situation and one is bullying the other, and it's not seen as a power differential, because for whatever reason, because maybe there's not a known power differential there.

752
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:28,899
[SPEAKER_09]: internally it's a power differential because somebody else is scared and the other one's not, but how does that determine?

753
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:31,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's such nuance, it's, you know, emotions.

754
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,361
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you know internally whether there's a power differential or not?

755
01:11:33,401 --> 01:11:40,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, but for all appearances sake, they're both on the football team, you know, one's the quarterback, one's the linebacker, I don't know.

756
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:47,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And what, you know, they seem to be equals, they're of the same height, weight, abilities, you know, all of those things, but clearly one is, you know, bullying and,

757
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:57,634
[SPEAKER_09]: the other is not, how do you know that there's a power, you know, what do you do if there's not a power differential, yet there is bullying, which I think is why there's that clarification under the definition.

758
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hear two competing things here.

759
01:12:02,077 --> 01:12:08,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Identifying and the difference of conflict bullying and not bullying or conflict, which I think is a tricky bit for everybody.

760
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:11,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other is being consistent with our definition.

761
01:12:12,102 --> 01:12:16,545
[SPEAKER_09]: and really clarifying what that is of bullying and making sure that we're aligning with what the state standard is.

762
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:20,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the third is that bullying often occurs when there's a power differential.

763
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:34,777
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure I know the solution, but I do think that just sort of plowing through or, you know, not plowing through, but saying, well, the subcommittee decided on this and this is why is not helpful because all of this committee, we're a committee of seven that needs to decide this material.

764
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why we're having the discussion.

765
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:36,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

766
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:50,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you member McLaughlin member Graham if you don't have if yours is on another motion and not on this, I'm going to move for roll call on.

767
01:12:54,807 --> 01:12:57,128
[SPEAKER_02]: question, and it is a tough decision for me.

768
01:12:57,308 --> 01:12:58,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I see both sides.

769
01:13:00,069 --> 01:13:14,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see the victim as eventually being the weaker, or the, yeah, I don't know, this is a tough one, but member Hayes' question, seconded by member McLaughlin, if we could call the roll, please.

770
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:15,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

771
01:13:16,654 --> 01:13:16,874
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

772
01:13:17,954 --> 01:13:18,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Hayes.

773
01:13:20,555 --> 01:13:20,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

774
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:22,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Kratz.

775
01:13:23,076 --> 01:13:23,196
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

776
01:13:24,676 --> 01:13:25,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

777
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:29,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

778
01:13:30,182 --> 01:13:30,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, you're muted.

779
01:13:31,003 --> 01:13:31,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I was muted.

780
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:32,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you.

781
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:34,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McStone, absent.

782
01:13:35,368 --> 01:13:36,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Russo, no.

783
01:13:36,309 --> 01:13:37,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor Longo, current.

784
01:13:42,887 --> 01:13:46,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, four in the affirmative, two in the negative motion.

785
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the motion fails.

786
01:13:50,152 --> 01:13:52,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 3-3, wasn't it?

787
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:53,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

788
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: 3-3, okay.

789
01:13:54,856 --> 01:13:55,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 3-3.

790
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:56,977
[SPEAKER_12]: So the motion fails.

791
01:13:57,538 --> 01:13:58,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion fails.

792
01:14:06,304 --> 01:14:11,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we make any suggestions about how to support some language here?

793
01:14:12,386 --> 01:14:12,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor.

794
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:14,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau.

795
01:14:14,888 --> 01:14:20,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I did have my hand up to speak before we took the last motion.

796
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:24,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Howard has his hand up too, excuse me.

797
01:14:24,156 --> 01:14:24,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

798
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:34,295
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when I joined the committee in 2018, we were assigned our subcommittees and I was, you know, a new member and very excited.

799
01:14:34,955 --> 01:14:44,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And Paula Vander Kloot, member Vander Kloot, who served with us for 30 years, leaned over and said, I really shouldn't need to be excited because subcommittees don't meet.

800
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:45,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was confused.

801
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And she said, subcommittees don't meet because the committee cannot trust each other ever.

802
01:14:50,461 --> 01:14:53,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So every member would either come to every subcommittee

803
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:57,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it was the subcommittee that had to make it a regular full meeting.

804
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:07,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been very proud of the fact that this committee has figured out how to trust each other in subcommittees.

805
01:15:08,377 --> 01:15:15,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think it's important to remember that we can vote against things, but finding a consensus isn't necessarily an option.

806
01:15:16,422 --> 01:15:20,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope everybody will vote no if you are not okay with the policy.

807
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:29,910
[SPEAKER_11]: But when a subcommittee recommends it, it is assumed that the subcommittee spent an inordinate amount of time that cannot happen on the floor

808
01:15:30,771 --> 01:15:34,973
[SPEAKER_11]: to come to the policy that they reported out, the policy recommendation.

809
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:36,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is- Point of information?

810
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:43,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Or actually, point of clarification though, through the member or so, if I may, through the chair.

811
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,941
[SPEAKER_09]: May I, Member Rousseau?

812
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:49,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if Chair stepped away.

813
01:15:50,443 --> 01:16:03,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just wanted to add, and I hear you, and it is a lot of work, and we do trust each other, and I think this is a tough subcommittee, and I think they're all important, and I think this is, you've done a lot of work on this subcommittee.

814
01:16:04,354 --> 01:16:04,875
[SPEAKER_09]: We all have.

815
01:16:05,675 --> 01:16:14,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that when discussion happens on the floor, things can happen that you hadn't thought of in subcommittee, where you do start to have different,

816
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:17,368
[SPEAKER_09]: positions and perspectives.

817
01:16:17,388 --> 01:16:19,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So that also has to be considered.

818
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:21,050
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not a matter of trust.

819
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:23,332
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be a matter of critical thinking.

820
01:16:25,974 --> 01:16:27,555
[SPEAKER_11]: May I continue?

821
01:16:27,615 --> 01:16:27,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

822
01:16:29,342 --> 01:16:34,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly met just to respond to remember a lot when I do not expect that the subcommittee thinks of everything.

823
01:16:35,805 --> 01:16:46,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why I think it's good practice remember just to come with a, I'd like to make some motion to change this to that, or insert this language here that we are an hour and 20 minutes into.

824
01:16:47,509 --> 01:16:50,571
[SPEAKER_11]: an agenda that is to approve or not the policy.

825
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:52,312
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not to write a new policy.

826
01:16:53,773 --> 01:16:58,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have strayed from that so wildly, it's kind of impressive.

827
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:03,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, again, nobody has to vote yes.

828
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:09,201
[SPEAKER_11]: If you just think this isn't right, this isn't legal, or whatever your other reasons are, vote no.

829
01:17:09,361 --> 01:17:10,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I urge you to vote no.

830
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:15,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I would vote no in a second if I didn't believe the policy was good.

831
01:17:15,124 --> 01:17:20,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And it would not, even if I thought my colleagues did great work to come to a policy decision.

832
01:17:20,649 --> 01:17:32,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's all I just wanted to say is that I hope we're not on the road towards never having subcommittees again, because if this is how we have to do every policy, I'm not sending stuff to subcommittee.

833
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna bring it to the floor and we're gonna spend four hours talking about everything.

834
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:42,187
[SPEAKER_11]: It just slows the amount of work we can get done down dramatically.

835
01:17:42,847 --> 01:17:43,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

836
01:17:43,768 --> 01:18:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just, if I may, if I may from the chair, I think it's a very important policy and I know we have a long agenda and we're all just thinking about how most of the time is gonna be taken up with this policy and we don't usually meet in the summer, but I think it's very important.

837
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:04,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that colleagues had questions

838
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:18,836
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 pages long, so I understand what you're saying, Member Russo, but I do wanna respect our colleagues asking good questions and struggling with some of the language.

839
01:18:18,896 --> 01:18:22,036
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Member McLaughlin.

840
01:18:22,056 --> 01:18:25,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I just also wanted to make a point of clarification here as well.

841
01:18:25,197 --> 01:18:31,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that subcommittee chairs don't get to decide whether something gets referred to the subcommittee, that's the committee as a whole.

842
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:34,940
[SPEAKER_09]: whether something gets referred to a subcommittee.

843
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So just for clarification.

844
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:45,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So member Graham, I think you were going to work on the, you were working on the last amendment and then hopefully we can take a vote on the full policy.

845
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:48,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

846
01:18:49,413 --> 01:18:57,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, point that actually Mayor, may I, because there were two or three items that we had commented on that I didn't realize I was going to have an opportunity to make a motion on if I wanted to.

847
01:18:57,938 --> 01:19:02,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was having discussion for the courtesy of other school committee members in the public.

848
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:10,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to scroll through those and see if I would like to put forward a motion before we are making a final vote, please.

849
01:19:13,546 --> 01:19:16,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, do we want to hear from Attorney Greenspan?

850
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:20,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Attorney Greenspan, are you

851
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:22,357
[SPEAKER_02]: need to talk to us about this policy.

852
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:44,719
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't attend all the subcommittee meetings, but as a suggestion on the finding, could it be that the finding of bullying could be pursuant to the definition which is listed at the beginning of the policy,

853
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:51,654
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in addition to include lines 56 through 62.

854
01:19:52,414 --> 01:20:02,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, it could include the definition or it could include this specific portion about balance of power.

855
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:12,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I make a motion that the section includes pursuant to the definition previously and the material 56 to 63, which I think is agreed.

856
01:20:14,757 --> 01:20:16,759
[SPEAKER_09]: some compromise and negotiation.

857
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,761
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you want to type that in the chat?

858
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:20,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I need the motion.

859
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:32,209
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion is to include pursuant to the definition of bullying on the lines, whatever, 17, you know, pursuant to the- Can I get the lines?

860
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:32,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

861
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:36,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, I'm not sure where the quotes and commas start.

862
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:41,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if we could type in the motion, just take your time, type it in on the chat, please.

863
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:41,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

864
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:43,342
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's in writing.

865
01:20:43,862 --> 01:20:44,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thanks.

866
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, I have two motions I'd be happy to make.

867
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:10,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

868
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:13,152
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't you make those motions?

869
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:14,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

870
01:21:16,434 --> 01:21:19,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first one is a motion to amend the proposed policy at line 371.

871
01:21:19,536 --> 01:21:23,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, there's a bug flying around my face.

872
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:32,264
[SPEAKER_08]: To add the following bullet, the office of civil rights is available to help families see the additional information at the following link for additional detail.

873
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:36,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there is a link to a fact sheet from the office of civil rights.

874
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:40,874
[SPEAKER_08]: and I just popped it into the chat.

875
01:21:42,116 --> 01:21:42,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

876
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:46,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So motion from member Graham, seconded by member Rousseau.

[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, may I have a motion again?

[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually trying to type my motion into the chat as was asked, and we moved on to another motion, which I'm, yeah, I know I didn't have a second on my motion because I was asked to clarify it in the chat.

880
01:22:03,374 --> 01:22:04,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is motion.

[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham?

890
01:22:58,804 --> 01:22:59,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

891
01:23:00,165 --> 01:23:00,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Hayes?

892
01:23:04,088 --> 01:23:04,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, yes.

893
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:06,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Kratz?

894
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:07,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

895
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:08,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

896
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:09,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

897
01:23:10,893 --> 01:23:11,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McStone, absent.

898
01:23:13,257 --> 01:23:13,557
[SPEAKER_11]: member.

899
01:23:13,597 --> 01:23:15,098
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, Maryland.

900
01:23:15,118 --> 01:23:15,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

901
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:15,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

902
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:19,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Succeeding affirmative one absent motion passes.

903
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:27,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's the next one motion to amend line 56 as follows.

904
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:35,432
[SPEAKER_08]: A finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above and may occur when the incident is determined to be between two and then it continues.

905
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:42,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And the definition was line 17 but we won't have that reference in, you know, because people won't be seeing the line numbers so I don't.

906
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:49,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's why I just said above because it's one of the, which is why, yeah, which is what the, my original motion was thank you.

907
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:51,836
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was asked for the line numbers so that's what you got.

908
01:23:52,096 --> 01:23:53,057
[SPEAKER_09]: But second, that's great.

909
01:23:53,137 --> 01:23:53,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

910
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:54,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, can you read that one more time.

911
01:23:55,038 --> 01:23:55,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

912
01:23:57,396 --> 01:23:58,077
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the chat.

913
01:23:58,457 --> 01:24:08,923
[SPEAKER_08]: A finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above and may occur when the incident is determined to be between two and then it continues unedited.

914
01:24:11,665 --> 01:24:14,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I'm confused as what's going to come after that.

915
01:24:14,327 --> 01:24:16,848
[SPEAKER_04]: There was something about pursuant to, and I don't.

916
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:20,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above.

917
01:24:21,451 --> 01:24:23,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Which was the line 17, the DESI definition.

918
01:24:23,512 --> 01:24:24,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it, okay, thank you.

919
01:24:25,771 --> 01:24:35,976
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the connection is, and may occur when the incident is determined and then everything else sort of stays as it is.

920
01:24:36,396 --> 01:24:36,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

921
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

922
01:24:38,437 --> 01:24:38,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

923
01:24:38,757 --> 01:24:40,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion on the floor, seconded.

924
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:41,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

925
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:44,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Who seconded it?

926
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,220
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

927
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I seconded it.

928
01:24:47,621 --> 01:24:48,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Melanie.

929
01:24:49,862 --> 01:24:51,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

930
01:24:51,643 --> 01:24:51,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

931
01:24:52,823 --> 01:24:53,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hayes.

932
01:24:53,724 --> 01:24:53,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

933
01:24:55,373 --> 01:24:55,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Democrats.

934
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:58,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

935
01:25:00,535 --> 01:25:00,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

936
01:25:02,035 --> 01:25:02,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

937
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:06,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember so, yes, Maryland.

938
01:25:06,817 --> 01:25:10,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 16 affirmative one absent motion passes.

939
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:11,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

940
01:25:12,782 --> 01:25:18,644
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the final motion, I will see if there's a motion on the floor to approve the policy as amended.

941
01:25:18,964 --> 01:25:25,386
[SPEAKER_09]: May I just, may I, for a point of clarification, I just want to scroll through the tabs to make sure we didn't miss anything.

942
01:25:26,146 --> 01:25:33,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Because again, as I was saying there, I just wanted the opportunity to ensure I wasn't making motions at the time because I thought we were having opportunity for discussion before motion.

943
01:25:34,049 --> 01:25:39,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So would you guys just indulge me for a minute where we can take it from the top and scroll through the tabs if you guys don't mind?

944
01:25:40,759 --> 01:25:41,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

945
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it's an, it is a very important document yet.

946
01:25:44,782 --> 01:25:45,663
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the definition.

947
01:25:46,344 --> 01:25:46,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

948
01:25:47,284 --> 01:25:47,745
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

949
01:25:47,785 --> 01:25:48,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

950
01:25:49,947 --> 01:25:50,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

951
01:25:50,347 --> 01:25:50,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

952
01:25:51,948 --> 01:25:52,529
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cleared.

953
01:25:57,433 --> 01:25:58,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

954
01:25:59,395 --> 01:25:59,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

955
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:00,195
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

956
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:04,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Because information on students, it was, it was around the action, the training they'll take.

957
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fine with that.

958
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

959
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,661
[SPEAKER_09]: We said that earlier.

960
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:08,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

961
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:12,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, copies of incident reports.

962
01:26:13,019 --> 01:26:27,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did not address this, and so I would make a motion to include a line in the Medford Public Schools will, and it can be, you know, the last line.

963
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:28,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we go up a little bit?

964
01:26:32,773 --> 01:26:33,153
[SPEAKER_09]: After 117, so 118.

965
01:26:36,078 --> 01:27:00,851
[SPEAKER_09]: ensure family caregivers, I would make a motion that the public schools will ensure family caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student with redacted information with respect to other individuals prior to investigation determination.

966
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:05,554
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna need all that language.

967
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,081
[SPEAKER_12]: You want me to type it in the chat.

968
01:27:09,363 --> 01:27:14,129
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be great, thank you sure so mps so line.

969
01:27:35,521 --> 01:27:38,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to take this call and then I'll be back.

970
01:27:46,506 --> 01:27:51,548
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to receive incident reports regarding their student redacted prior to investigation.

971
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

972
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:17,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So I make a motion to include in 118 under MPS will after ensure district staff is aware of policy in 118, MPS will ensure families or caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student redacted for identifying information prior to investigation.

973
01:28:17,438 --> 01:28:20,199
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can get a second, that would be helpful.

974
01:28:20,219 --> 01:28:23,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you got a friendly amendment?

975
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:26,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

976
01:28:27,798 --> 01:28:34,019
[SPEAKER_11]: to remove, we've moved on to just using caregivers under all circumstances instead of- Yes, yes, please, thank you.

977
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:48,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I would amend that to say MPS, and we say MPS at the top, Will, so I don't think we need to add that bit, but just ensure caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student redacted for identifying information prior to investigation, please.

978
01:28:49,303 --> 01:28:49,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

979
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:53,384
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor from Member McLaughlin,

980
01:28:55,316 --> 01:28:58,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Hayes, I have one question.

981
01:28:58,057 --> 01:29:01,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rossell, go ahead.

982
01:29:01,959 --> 01:29:11,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I just was, the prior to investigation part of that, I'm sorry for having just put it into the motion, into my minutes.

983
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:15,304
[SPEAKER_11]: That does imply that there will be no investigation.

984
01:29:15,324 --> 01:29:17,865
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this happens first period.

985
01:29:18,005 --> 01:29:23,907
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be no investigation that whole day until the report has made its way to the parents.

986
01:29:24,724 --> 01:29:25,525
[SPEAKER_11]: the caregivers.

987
01:29:26,245 --> 01:29:42,820
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm worried that administrators will, first of all, just simply violate it because it seems nearly impossible, but also it just, if they did follow it, the quality of the investigation, I would imagine would be degraded.

988
01:29:45,942 --> 01:29:47,823
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a point, and I think that's interesting.

989
01:29:47,884 --> 01:29:52,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying prior to investigation, because really they should receive incident reports when they happen.

990
01:29:52,727 --> 01:30:01,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Once your family can't receive incident reports regarding this, you can redactify and identify information within 24 hours of their occurrence.

991
01:30:05,076 --> 01:30:06,797
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may.

992
01:30:07,317 --> 01:30:07,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

993
01:30:08,578 --> 01:30:10,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau.

994
01:30:10,299 --> 01:30:10,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

995
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:15,403
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wonder, I mean, the incident report,

996
01:30:17,294 --> 01:30:27,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd have to grab them and look at them right this second, but is there not a lot of content that ends up on an incident report that is the result of the bullying investigation?

997
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:31,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to imagine how this will play out.

998
01:30:32,938 --> 01:30:41,020
[SPEAKER_11]: The clock is ticking and I'm just worried about creating some kind of weird,

999
01:30:42,358 --> 01:30:56,945
[SPEAKER_11]: situation and I'd like to hear from an administrator who would know how this would work in real life, because I don't, but we spent a lot of time subcommittee caring about that so yeah and I guess I would say I would like to move the question and I'm happy to revise it to within 24 hours of.

1000
01:31:00,499 --> 01:31:02,400
[SPEAKER_09]: of the incident report.

1001
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:06,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, that they can start investigating as soon as they want.

1002
01:31:06,622 --> 01:31:17,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not, this is not singular to just bullying incident reports, because we have, you know, and I'll codify that in policy in September, but specific to, you know, any incidents really, but within 24 hours.

1003
01:31:18,537 --> 01:31:24,260
[SPEAKER_09]: of the incident, I would say is reasonable to get a report that an incident occurred.

1004
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying that they're getting a full bullying report.

1005
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:35,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying the incident report, not the full bullying report, a report that an incident occurred, which you would hope they would get a phone call home that day.

1006
01:31:36,745 --> 01:31:40,047
[SPEAKER_09]: but within 24 hours they should get a record of an incident report occurring.

1007
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:56,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'm trying to avoid, and I would like to move the question, but what I'm trying to avoid is a parent being involved in this situation after 10 incidents have occurred and getting to the office and having, you know, the principal waving, you know, 10 incident reports in front of them and them being really outraged at not having known this.

1008
01:31:56,775 --> 01:31:59,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I have to say that's happened to more than one person.

1009
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:02,461
[SPEAKER_09]: There's my echo.

1010
01:32:02,901 --> 01:32:03,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, echo.

1011
01:32:05,002 --> 01:32:08,504
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to move the question, please, with the amendment.

1012
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:21,449
[SPEAKER_09]: NPS will ensure caregivers receive incident reports that occur as, oh, it does say it, that occur as a result of bullying within 24 hours of the incident.

1013
01:32:22,591 --> 01:32:38,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So member McLaughlin, that is my suggestion based on what I'm hearing is that we frame it that we're we're specifically qualifying that what we're talking about here are incident reports that recur as the result of bullying investigations, because otherwise they're going to be like housed outside of this completely.

1014
01:32:39,741 --> 01:32:45,105
[SPEAKER_08]: And that the parent caregivers need to receive these reports promptly.

1015
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:46,385
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that

1016
01:32:47,486 --> 01:32:58,401
[SPEAKER_08]: provide some flexibility to make sure that like the intent of as soon as you can is out there, but also allows the administrators to do what they need to do from a

1017
01:33:00,191 --> 01:33:01,191
[SPEAKER_09]: investigation standpoint.

1018
01:33:01,472 --> 01:33:01,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.

1019
01:33:01,972 --> 01:33:03,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure that I'm hearing you exactly.

1020
01:33:03,972 --> 01:33:07,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I am saying is, yes, if they're specific to the bullying incident, I agree.

1021
01:33:07,994 --> 01:33:15,517
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I am saying is that there could be five incident reports that are specific to this bullying incident, and they were not shared with the family.

1022
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:24,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is what I'm trying to prevent here is that NPS will ensure caregivers receive incident reports that occur, you know, within 24 hours of the incident.

1023
01:33:26,721 --> 01:33:28,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And will be, you know, included in

1024
01:33:29,332 --> 01:33:33,654
[SPEAKER_09]: of, you know, potentially be included in a bullying investigation.

1025
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:41,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's at least my suggestion that that belongs in the overarching policy about incident reports because

1026
01:33:42,045 --> 01:33:49,546
[SPEAKER_08]: you could have incidents that ultimately become part of a bullying investigation, but they aren't that when they start.

1027
01:33:49,766 --> 01:33:53,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that belongs more in that overarching policy than it does here.

1028
01:33:53,907 --> 01:33:59,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But I feel like we, oh, and you said make reference to it if we have, once we have that overarching.

1029
01:33:59,928 --> 01:34:05,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, so this document, okay, so I would like to, because I don't want to forget this as a placeholder, so I will modify, thank you.

1030
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:09,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I will modify my motion, but I will make a motion

1031
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:21,336
[SPEAKER_09]: that we have a reference to the incident reporting policy to be created in the fall of 2023 included in this bullying advisory.

1032
01:34:22,937 --> 01:34:24,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1033
01:34:24,678 --> 01:34:26,099
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the third motion.

1034
01:34:26,459 --> 01:34:29,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm withdrawing the previous motion.

1035
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:30,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one?

1036
01:34:31,382 --> 01:34:35,584
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion that NPS will ensure families caregivers receive incident reports, the one I typed up.

1037
01:34:36,325 --> 01:34:38,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you withdraw the motion to move the question first?

1038
01:34:41,966 --> 01:34:43,807
[SPEAKER_11]: That has all precedence in Robert's rules.

1039
01:34:43,847 --> 01:34:45,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, no, I know, I know, I know you don't.

1040
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:48,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know I'm sorry I'm reading at the same time.

1041
01:34:48,672 --> 01:34:52,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I will withdraw the motion to move the question which it didn't get picked up.

1042
01:34:52,876 --> 01:34:55,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, the question was not moved.

1043
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,904
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's kind of silly to withdraw it, but I will do that because it wasn't followed.

1044
01:35:01,865 --> 01:35:05,988
[SPEAKER_09]: regardless, but I will withdraw the motion to move the question.

1045
01:35:06,008 --> 01:35:17,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will revise my motion, withdraw the motion that NPS will ensure families and caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student redacted for identifying information prior to investigation.

1046
01:35:17,215 --> 01:35:20,357
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will make a new motion

1047
01:35:21,533 --> 01:35:22,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin?

1048
01:35:22,653 --> 01:35:23,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1049
01:35:24,194 --> 01:35:29,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I just made a suggestion in the chat that I think does both of the things that you're wanting to do.

1050
01:35:29,616 --> 01:35:30,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1051
01:35:30,596 --> 01:35:33,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are no motions on the floor with seconds at the moment, so.

1052
01:35:33,337 --> 01:35:34,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

1053
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:40,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I make a motion that NPS ensures caregivers receive incident reports that occur as the result of bullying investigation promptly.

1054
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:49,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And further, this policy will be amended to include reference to the incident reporting policy to be created in the fall of 2023 as soon as it becomes available.

1055
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:49,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1056
01:35:51,544 --> 01:35:53,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, on the motion.

1057
01:35:53,205 --> 01:35:55,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a second.

1058
01:35:55,745 --> 01:35:57,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin, is there a second?

1059
01:35:57,686 --> 01:35:58,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1060
01:35:58,726 --> 01:35:59,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Member Hayes.

1061
01:35:59,747 --> 01:36:00,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

1062
01:36:07,769 --> 01:36:08,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Grant?

1063
01:36:09,049 --> 01:36:09,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1064
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:11,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Hayes?

1065
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:11,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1066
01:36:13,091 --> 01:36:13,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Grant?

1067
01:36:14,131 --> 01:36:14,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1068
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:16,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin?

1069
01:36:17,012 --> 01:36:17,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1070
01:36:18,612 --> 01:36:19,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Mustone?

1071
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:19,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Absent.

1072
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:21,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau, yes.

1073
01:36:23,328 --> 01:36:23,928
[SPEAKER_12]: MaryLynn Gooker.

1074
01:36:27,012 --> 01:36:29,414
[SPEAKER_12]: She's on the phone, so I'll put her as absent.

1075
01:36:31,477 --> 01:36:35,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So five in the affirmative, two absent, motion passes.

1076
01:36:37,563 --> 01:36:37,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1077
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:41,467
[SPEAKER_09]: We just go down through the rest of the document quickly.

1078
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:41,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1079
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:51,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess I'm going to leave that up to administration to decide regarding the.

1080
01:36:51,202 --> 01:36:58,145
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I was here, I just could not mute so you can just.

1081
01:37:00,026 --> 01:37:00,947
[SPEAKER_12]: You're in and out mayor.

1082
01:37:02,547 --> 01:37:03,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounded like a yes.

1083
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:09,791
[SPEAKER_12]: And think that was a yes.

1084
01:37:13,092 --> 01:37:13,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to know.

1085
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:17,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, we can't hear you.

1086
01:37:18,059 --> 01:37:19,540
[SPEAKER_09]: You can put your vote in the chat.

1087
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,640
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be helpful.

1088
01:37:21,301 --> 01:37:22,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, through the vice chair.

1089
01:37:26,243 --> 01:37:31,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll wait to see what her vote is and we can amend the tally as necessary.

1090
01:37:34,008 --> 01:37:39,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any other motions for amendment on the floor or to be made?

1091
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:42,921
[SPEAKER_09]: May I finish this?

1092
01:37:43,681 --> 01:37:44,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

1093
01:37:44,722 --> 01:37:45,602
[SPEAKER_09]: This read through.

1094
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:46,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So special education.

1095
01:37:46,803 --> 01:37:48,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, we already agreed.

1096
01:37:48,344 --> 01:37:50,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so yeah, a place in the student file.

1097
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:54,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like a motion to amend 188 through 190.

1098
01:37:57,730 --> 01:38:02,814
[SPEAKER_09]: So are placed in the student file and or,

1099
01:38:05,177 --> 01:38:07,999
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't know how we address the special education file as being different.

1100
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:14,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Ensure copies of all bullying reports, individual behavior plans are placed in the student file.

1101
01:38:14,943 --> 01:38:17,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's two different types, as we said, of student files.

1102
01:38:19,186 --> 01:38:24,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we just add, are placed in the student file as required by law?

1103
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:25,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1104
01:38:26,991 --> 01:38:27,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1105
01:38:28,112 --> 01:38:32,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion to amend row 190 to add as required by law.

1106
01:38:32,855 --> 01:38:33,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1107
01:38:33,888 --> 01:38:34,849
[SPEAKER_08]: by member McLaughlin.

1108
01:38:35,389 --> 01:38:36,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

1109
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:36,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1110
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:38,331
[SPEAKER_08]: By member Hayes.

1111
01:38:41,033 --> 01:38:43,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of clarification, please.

1112
01:38:45,556 --> 01:38:46,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of so.

1113
01:38:49,258 --> 01:38:50,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, one second, too many.

1114
01:38:55,022 --> 01:38:56,663
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really just line 190, correct?

1115
01:38:57,063 --> 01:38:58,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, just at the end.

1116
01:38:59,825 --> 01:39:00,125
Thank you.

1117
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:08,967
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the next one all set, if I may, to the chair, the translation and interpretation.

1118
01:39:08,987 --> 01:39:09,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1119
01:39:09,067 --> 01:39:09,607

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1143
01:39:49,176 --> 01:39:52,358
[SPEAKER_12]: The vice chair, may we continue going through the end of the document?

1144
01:39:52,818 --> 01:39:52,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

1145
01:39:59,929 --> 01:40:01,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we make a motion on this?

1146
01:40:02,089 --> 01:40:02,389
[SPEAKER_12]: We did.

1147
01:40:02,749 --> 01:40:02,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

1148
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:03,650
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, that was passed.

1149
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:04,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1150
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:18,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to the superintendent as well for making the notes.

1151
01:40:22,273 --> 01:40:22,853
[SPEAKER_12]: That one's clear.

1152
01:40:22,873 --> 01:40:23,773
[SPEAKER_12]: That one's good.

1153
01:40:28,954 --> 01:40:29,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1154
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:41,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I, and I'm not gonna make a motion on this, but I do want to bring that to the attention of the administration to please circle back with Avery and check on what is appropriate for that.

1155
01:40:41,283 --> 01:40:42,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can revisit it if we need to.

1156
01:40:42,664 --> 01:40:44,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I can also circle back with Avery.

1157
01:40:45,244 --> 01:40:51,386
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like, it's basically anytime there's any physical contact, we want unwanted physical contact.

1158
01:40:51,486 --> 01:40:54,147
[SPEAKER_07]: We want students being checked out by our nursing staff.

1159
01:40:54,487 --> 01:40:55,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1160
01:40:56,187 --> 01:40:58,648
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of practice moving forward in all situations.

1161
01:40:59,332 --> 01:41:01,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and then this was already set for the civil rights.

1162
01:41:01,693 --> 01:41:02,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1163
01:41:03,754 --> 01:41:04,394
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're 13.

1164
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:05,114
[SPEAKER_12]: We're almost there.

1165
01:41:11,957 --> 01:41:12,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that one was.

1166
01:41:12,977 --> 01:41:13,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's the civil rights.

1167
01:41:17,659 --> 01:41:18,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay.

1168
01:41:19,963 --> 01:41:20,944
[SPEAKER_12]: The chair awaits a motion.

1169
01:41:23,126 --> 01:41:30,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve this bullying policy plan as amended.

1170
01:41:31,034 --> 01:41:31,674
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended.

1171
01:41:32,475 --> 01:41:32,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1172
01:41:33,696 --> 01:41:36,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion on the floor by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Hayes.

1173
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call.

1174
01:41:42,236 --> 01:41:42,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1175
01:41:42,556 --> 01:41:47,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just wanted to point of information or point of order, actually, sorry, excuse me.

1176
01:41:48,878 --> 01:41:53,320
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor did put in her yes for that vote, so we want to amend that motion.

1177
01:41:56,081 --> 01:42:04,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I make a motion to amend the motion regarding, oh my God, I'm tired, you guys, what motion was that that we were waiting for the mayor?

1178
01:42:04,563 --> 01:42:06,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even worry about it, it's okay.

1179
01:42:06,344 --> 01:42:06,644
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1180
01:42:07,284 --> 01:42:09,005
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the big one, as long as you can hear me now.

1181
01:42:09,605 --> 01:42:10,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can hear you now.

1182
01:42:11,005 --> 01:42:11,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1183
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:12,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't mean to interrupt you guys.

1184
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:13,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know if she wanted to do that.

1185
01:42:14,006 --> 01:42:15,006
[SPEAKER_09]: So my apologies.

1186
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we start from the top for the roll?

1187
01:42:19,827 --> 01:42:20,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I get to say yes twice.

1188
01:42:20,807 --> 01:42:21,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1189
01:42:22,008 --> 01:42:22,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1190
01:42:22,968 --> 01:42:24,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1191
01:42:25,248 --> 01:42:25,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1192
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:28,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1193
01:42:29,429 --> 01:42:31,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Stone absent members.

1194
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:32,950
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, Mayor Lungo Kern.

1195
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:34,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1196
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:36,931
[SPEAKER_03]: 16 affirmative one absent motion passes.

1197
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:41,191
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it.

1198
01:42:41,251 --> 01:42:42,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Great job, everybody.

1199
01:42:43,352 --> 01:42:45,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everyone, for all your hard work.

1200
01:42:46,493 --> 01:42:48,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I just have my hand up.

1201
01:42:48,414 --> 01:42:50,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just want to say the same.

1202
01:42:50,395 --> 01:42:51,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for your super hard work.

1203
01:42:52,076 --> 01:43:03,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that this was a lot and I really appreciated the communication today just around collaboration and, you know, seeing how things get done and how it's not always easy.

1204
01:43:03,681 --> 01:43:04,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1205
01:43:07,683 --> 01:43:08,183
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1206
01:43:09,839 --> 01:43:14,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one second to find my agenda, which is lost in a sea of tabs.

1207
01:43:19,067 --> 01:43:21,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we have other agenda items for tonight.

1208
01:43:34,301 --> 01:43:35,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I make it sorry.

1209
01:43:36,058 --> 01:43:39,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to make a motion to include the flowchart.

1210
01:43:39,559 --> 01:43:40,740
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't look at the flowchart.

1211
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:58,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we, can I make a motion that we revisit this plan in the first meeting in September to review a visual flowchart to ensure, yeah, to ensure, I'll write it in the thing.

1212
01:43:59,547 --> 01:44:03,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to revisit the wing.

1213
01:44:05,302 --> 01:44:08,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Policy plan to review.

1214
01:44:08,105 --> 01:44:11,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to review.

1215
01:44:11,128 --> 01:44:12,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just typing policy.

1216
01:44:12,209 --> 01:44:14,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking to review a visual.

1217
01:44:19,056 --> 01:44:22,298
[SPEAKER_12]: to assist in accessibility.

1218
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:33,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I'm making a motion to revisit the building policy plan at the first meeting in September to review a visual flow chart to assist in accessibility.

1219
01:44:34,424 --> 01:44:35,405
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could get a second.

1220
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:47,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I had a suggestion on this before we maybe make a motion.

1221
01:44:49,875 --> 01:45:07,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I would like to request that our new communications director, Mr. Thomas Dalton, who appears to be on the phone, welcome, Tom, that we ask the administration to actually

1222
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:19,457
[SPEAKER_08]: take the time to put this flowchart together in a way that is easy to understand and visual and lends itself to being able to be read by a screen reader, etc.

1223
01:45:19,477 --> 01:45:27,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And that that become a communication piece rather than like the school committee necessarily needing to vote on it.

1224
01:45:27,823 --> 01:45:30,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a better precedent for us to set.

1225
01:45:31,165 --> 01:45:32,206
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the other thing that

1226
01:45:32,786 --> 01:45:40,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super sensitive to with flowcharts is I do this work a lot with people and there are lots and lots of people in the world who can't read flowcharts.

1227
01:45:40,772 --> 01:45:42,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you either can or you can't.

1228
01:45:43,233 --> 01:45:44,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can't, you can't.

1229
01:45:44,714 --> 01:45:47,436
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, there's just like no, no navigating around that.

1230
01:45:47,456 --> 01:45:52,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I will also point out that flowcharts are incredibly hard for screen readers to process.

1231
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:58,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they'd have, it'd have to be extensively all tagged and it would be near impossible to do so.

1232
01:45:58,423 --> 01:46:15,764
[SPEAKER_08]: There's probably another kind of visual that would lend itself better to that, which I assume that our new communications director would be able to work through in advance and present it to us instead of having us have to discuss how it might happen on the floor.

1233
01:46:16,417 --> 01:46:23,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, I will withdraw the motion and I will ask that the community, welcome, Tom, we haven't met.

1234
01:46:23,999 --> 01:46:36,883
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will ask that the communication director is part of the conversation around the accessibility meeting that we already made a motion to have at the beginning of the year, both for language and other accessibility.

1235
01:46:36,903 --> 01:46:39,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that falls into that category, but that doesn't need to be a motion.

1236
01:46:39,764 --> 01:46:40,624
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay, thank you.

1237
01:46:41,545 --> 01:46:41,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

1238
01:46:43,825 --> 01:46:46,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I am still,

1239
01:46:46,681 --> 01:46:52,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe I am still looking for my agenda, which is literally lost in the abyss of my computer.

1240
01:46:53,082 --> 01:47:04,864
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to go to the shared drive and pull it from there.

1241
01:47:04,884 --> 01:47:10,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how it got so lost.

1242
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:33,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Where did you send it member Rousseau?

1243
01:47:33,346 --> 01:47:33,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Your email.

1244
01:47:36,188 --> 01:47:37,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, see.

1245
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably still in the ether.

1246
01:47:43,311 --> 01:47:44,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let me check again.

1247
01:47:44,192 --> 01:47:45,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there it is.

1248
01:47:45,052 --> 01:47:45,412
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

1249
01:47:45,472 --> 01:47:46,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

1250
