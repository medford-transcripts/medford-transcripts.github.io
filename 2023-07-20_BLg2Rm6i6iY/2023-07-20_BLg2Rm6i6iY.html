    <p>[f9NpRcOkIx4_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=72.013s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=73.473s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=73.953s">Six</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=75.173s">If</a>  we could all rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=78.514s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=82.239s">and</a>  to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=92.564s">We</a>  have continued business, which is number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=96.765s">Everybody</a>  received the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=97.946s">There's</a>  a recommendation to approve the Medford Public Schools Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan Policy, JICFB, with its first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=108.971s">Any</a>  question or a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=112.318s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[f9NpRcOkIx4_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=114.079s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to suspend rule 46, which is, since you all probably don't have it up in front of you, it's the rule that we wrote that requires a second reading, because I don't know if anybody wants to come back in a week or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=129.35s">And</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=130.991s">And</a>  also because the policy is, frankly, relatively minor changes at best.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=138.539s">I</a>  have some questions about that before we move to that question.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=142.022s">Motion</a>  by Member Ruseau to move Rule 46 and seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=147.525s">We</a>  have Member Hays and then Member McLaughlin who would like to ask a question before the rule is called. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=152.909s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=153.65s">I</a>  am warning them. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=154.47s">That's</a>  Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=155.571s">Sorry,</a>  had her hand up first. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=158.273s">And</a>  then Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=160.134s">Member</a>  Hays.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=161.82s">Thank</a>  you, I still had the same I brought up a question last time, and I know we ended up tabling. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=168.588s">I</a>  don't know if maybe member McLaughlin was the one who requested the table, if she wants to talk about what her. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=175.683s">reason</a>  for tabling or what she's found since then, but I do still have the same question that I had asked last time that I'm not sure we ever really fully discussed.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=185.09s">Right,</a>  and that's what I'm wondering is if you, and I apologize because I'm on hold right now with Children's Hospital for something that's also urgent, so forgive me if I have to be interrupted for one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=195.337s">That</a>  is, it was because we hadn't had the opportunity to read through it because it had not, it had been inadvertently <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=203.612s">We</a>  hadn't had the opportunity to read through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=205.153s">So</a>  we asked to table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=206.193s">So</a>  we had the opportunity to read through it, I would presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=208.634s">And</a>  now I do have probably five or six questions that I want to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=212.776s">So</a>  I'm curious if what member Ruseau is asking with not having the second read through, if he's asking that we move to approve the document without having the second read through, or is this an opportunity for us to have those questions discussed that we have that we didn't have the opportunity to do last time?</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=229.502s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=232.264s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[f9NpRcOkIx4_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=233.669s">I'll</a>  just read the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=235.831s">Rule</a>  46 states the first time that a policy recommendation appears on the agenda, the school committee will hear public comment on the item and engage in discussion and comment on the policy recommendation hereafter referred to as the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=249.022s">The</a>  policy of pass will be placed on the next regular meeting agenda hereafter referred to as the second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=257.209s">In</a>  accordance with provision of rules, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=260.051s">provisions</a>  of rule 75, the school committee may suspend this rule to adopt the policy upon first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=265.675s">A</a>  policy that is affirmed by majority vote on the second reading or upon suspension of the rules will become the policy of the school committee immediately upon another date as specified. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=281.127s">So</a>  this is not to quell any conversations at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=284.049s">This</a>  is merely so we do not have to return here in August, which we have to-</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=290.489s">Thank</a>  you to the chair members. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=291.809s">So</a>  for that explanation and for the reading of the policy, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=294.83s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=295.991s">Thanks</a>  so much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=299.652s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=300.512s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=304.433s">I</a>  have more questions, but I believe, sorry, I'm sorry, one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=307.394s">I</a>  have more questions, but I believe member Hays, did you have your hand up to talk about what you wanted to talk about for last time? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=313.575s">I</a>  did, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=314.476s">Okay,</a>  so I would let member Hays go first and then I would, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=318.177s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=320.154s">It's</a>  really just a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=321.094s">The</a>  question that I had last time was about the definitions used for bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=327.677s">And</a>  when you look at both the Massachusetts state law and the DESE, their model plan, they have the definition as basically as stated on the first page of the current proposed Medford policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=346.724s">which</a>  is defined as the repeated use by one or more students or a member of the school staff of a written verbal or electronic expression or physical act or gesture or any combination thereof directed at a target that and then list those five categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=363.009s">And</a>  it does say in the <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=366.618s">Department</a>  of Education model plan, it does state that for the definitions, including the bullying definition itself, districts may add specific language to these definitions to clarify them, but may not alter their meaning or scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=383.814s">So</a>  then my question really is when we look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=388.584s">The</a>  second page, or at least I have it printed up, the second page of the proposed policy for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=395.288s">Excuse</a>  me, point of information.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=396.908s">Point</a>  of information, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=399.29s">Can</a>  we share the document on screen so people can know what we're referring to, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=406.674s">I</a>  can do that if nobody has it handy. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=409.515s">Yeah,</a>  I have a printed copy, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=411.176s">All</a>  right, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=412.116s">Hold</a>  on one second.</p>

    <p>[X-UlsLTIb5Q_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=414.257s">I</a>  can pull it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=419.153s">shared</a>  screen, the numbered version that you're looking at?</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=423.779s">That's</a>  the one I'm looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=424.74s">It's</a>  probably easier to refer to the exact lines.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=428.785s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=458.621s">So</a>  lines 50, starting at line 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=466.887s">The</a>  bullying definition here, which is the one that's used, it says bullying investigations may be concluded with a finding of, and on line 55 it says it may be <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=479.209s">Concluded</a>  with the finding of bullying, a finding of bullying occurs when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the core of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=491.076s">Bullying</a>  is abuse and occurs when a socially powerful, example given, popular or feared student mentally or physically abuses a weaker, e.g., example given, fearful student for the purpose of making them afraid or hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=504.403s">Bullying</a>  is the act of causing hurt, harm, or humiliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=509.117s">That</a>  piece feels to me like it's changing the definition, the original definition in the, both in state law and the model, and adding that piece about a power differential. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=521.282s">So</a>  that was my question, is to me that seems like a different definition than both on our first page of our model, our proposed, the definition that's given in lines 17 through 24 of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=537.182s">which</a>  is a verbatim definition taken from the state law, which does not include that idea of a power differential is necessary for defining bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=554.149s">But</a>  the second definition in our plan, that one I just read at 55 through 61, adds that piece of a power differential that doesn't appear <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=567.216s">in</a>  the state definition or the model plan from DESE.</p>

    <p>[X-UlsLTIb5Q_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=574.718s">If</a>  I may, through the chair, is your recommendation then to take the definition from line 17 through 24? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=582.06s">And</a>  are you requesting that 17 through 24 become 55 through 63? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=594.528s">Or</a>  55?</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=594.888s">Yes,</a>  that is the definition of bullying.</p>

    <p>[X-UlsLTIb5Q_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=598.009s">55</a>  through 61, I mean, 55 through 61.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=603.951s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=604.511s">So</a>  if you look at line 62 and 63, there it talks about the pattern of behavior or repeated. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=611.113s">So</a>  that more closely aligns with the state definition, the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=615.895s">But</a>  that piece about the power of a differential does not appear in the state law as part of what defines bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=623.908s">So</a>  yes, I'm talking about, I'm requesting or suggesting that that piece needs to be taken out in terms of defining bullying, how we define bullying if an incident occurs.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=642.407s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=648.046s">Okay,</a>  now this is just a recommendation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=650.087s">So,</a>  because we would need potentially a vote to amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=655.09s">And</a>  I know there's a few hands up, so.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=657.472s">It</a>  looks like Dr. Edweb-Minson is just marking the document so that we understand.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=662.074s">And</a>  just to be clear, I also did look at several districts in our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=669.579s">I</a>  looked at the bullying and intervention plans for Arlington, Somerville, Cambridge, Malden, Winchester, Woburn, Waltham, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=676.707s">Lexington</a>  and Everett, and I didn't see in any of theirs any, as part of the definition of bullying, anything to do with the power differential. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=686.552s">That</a>  only comes up, and it comes up also in the model plan from DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=692.455s">It</a>  comes up as a potential professional development topic for educators.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=722.827s">While</a>  Dr. Edward-Vincent marks this up, Member Hays, do you have any other questions before I turn it over to Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham, then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=730.911s">Branley?</a> </p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=733.373s">No,</a>  that was my main point, just because that's so essential to the whole thing, is understanding what our definition of bullying is in order to determine when an incident will be classified as bullying.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=744.719s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=747.24s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=749.259s">wait</a>  on the motion to amend as see many hands are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=753.18s">So</a>  let's go to member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=757.982s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=758.702s">I</a>  have about six lines that I wanted to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=763.444s">So</a>  I don't know if you want to have me do like half and then come back and do half. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=767.685s">So</a>  it gives other folks an opportunity to talk before, you know, so I'm not monopolizing time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=775.303s">Yeah,</a>  let's start out. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=777.904s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=778.584s">Okay,</a>  thank you pages, numbers 95 and 96 please. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=783.086s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=786.607s">Information</a>  on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=791.949s">Yeah,</a>  and so I was curious about. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=796.07s">I</a>  would like some elaboration on that I'm not sure what that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=799.588s">in</a>  particular means, I mean, I know in the rest of it, there was, can we go up to the heading here, the subheading?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=803.749s">Yeah,</a>  this is, such training may include- Regarding training, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=806.869s">Being</a>  limited to informational students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=812.25s">So</a>  probably our most vulnerable students, which was outlined in section, in numbers 72 through 76 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=821.952s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=822.512s">All</a>  right, I just wanted to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=826.946s">clear</a>  that it was in the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=828.229s">So</a>  just, I wanted some clarity on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=831.206s">Yes,</a>  I see where it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=832.306s">I</a>  was reading earlier where that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=833.506s">Okay,</a>  so that was 95 and 96, information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=839.448s">And</a>  I guess I would love a note to have that be qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=844.529s">So</a>  if it's 72 through 76, say C72 through 76, so that we're all on the same page and what that actually means, because I think it's just vague as information on students who are particularly at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=858.051s">for</a>  bullying in the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=859.152s">So</a>  just if we could refer back to the earlier document in terms of what that is referring to.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=864.297s">So</a>  maybe in parentheses as referenced, but not as referenced, but not limited to what is in 72 to 76, but not limited to.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=878.208s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=878.948s">Thank</a>  you, Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=881.09s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn also, Esquire. <a href="https://youtu.be/BLg2Rm6i6iY&t=885.552s">Appreciate</a>  that.</p>
