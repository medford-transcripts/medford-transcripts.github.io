Member Rousseau, if you could call the roll, please.

12
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:48,292
Yes, thank you.

13
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:48,873
Member Graham?

14
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:49,533
Here.

15
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:51,074
Member Hayes?

16
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:55,597
Here.

17
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:57,389
Member Gretz.

18
00:00:57,969 --> 00:00:58,209
Yes.

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,250
Member McLaughlin.

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,551
Yes, present.

21
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:05,551
Member Mustone.

22
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:07,512
Absent.

23
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,192
Member Stone, present.

24
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:12,733
Mayor Lungo-Kern.

25
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:13,873
Present.

26
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,153
Six present, one absent.

27
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:16,674
If we could all rise to salute the flag.

28
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:21,535
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

29
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,701
and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

30
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:35,645
We have continued business, which is number three.

31
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:37,926
Everybody received the policy.

32
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:48,030
There's a recommendation to approve the Medford Public Schools Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan Policy, JICFB, with its first reading.

33
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,431
Any question or a motion on the floor?

34
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:52,958
Member Russo.

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:08,469
I'd like to make a motion to suspend rule 46, which is, since you all probably don't have it up in front of you, it's the rule that we wrote that requires a second reading, because I don't know if anybody wants to come back in a week or two.

36
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,210
And I don't.

37
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:16,795
And also because the policy is, frankly, relatively minor changes at best.

38
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,002
I have some questions about that before we move to that question.

39
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:27,485
Motion by Member Rousseau to move Rule 46 and seconded by Member Graham.

40
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:31,448
We have Member Hayes and then Member McLaughlin who would like to ask a question before the rule is called.

41
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:33,570
Yes, thank you.

42
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,450
I am warning them.

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,371
That's Member Hayes.

44
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,633
Sorry, had her hand up first.

45
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:39,374
And then Member McLaughlin.

46
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:40,575
Member Hayes.

47
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,727
Thank you, I still had the same I brought up a question last time, and I know we ended up tabling.

48
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:54,815
I don't know if maybe member McLaughlin was the one who requested the table, if she wants to talk about what her.

49
00:02:55,683 --> 00:03:04,429
reason for tabling or what she's found since then, but I do still have the same question that I had asked last time that I'm not sure we ever really fully discussed.

50
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:13,716
Right, and that's what I'm wondering is if you, and I apologize because I'm on hold right now with Children's Hospital for something that's also urgent, so forgive me if I have to be interrupted for one second.

51
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:21,962
That is, it was because we hadn't had the opportunity to read through it because it had not, it had been inadvertently

52
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,053
We hadn't had the opportunity to read through it.

53
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,033
So we asked to table it.

54
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,354
So we had the opportunity to read through it, I would presume.

55
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:32,215
And now I do have probably five or six questions that I want to ask.

56
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:49,482
So I'm curious if what member Russo is asking with not having the second read through, if he's asking that we move to approve the document without having the second read through, or is this an opportunity for us to have those questions discussed that we have that we didn't have the opportunity to do last time?

57
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,243
Mayor?

58
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:52,724
Member Russo?

59
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,250
I'll just read the rule.

60
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:08,762
Rule 46 states the first time that a policy recommendation appears on the agenda, the school committee will hear public comment on the item and engage in discussion and comment on the policy recommendation hereafter referred to as the first reading.

61
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:16,689
The policy of pass will be placed on the next regular meeting agenda hereafter referred to as the second reading.

62
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,251
In accordance with provision of rules,

63
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:25,655
provisions of rule 75, the school committee may suspend this rule to adopt the policy upon first reading.

64
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:40,787
A policy that is affirmed by majority vote on the second reading or upon suspension of the rules will become the policy of the school committee immediately upon another date as specified.

65
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,989
So this is not to quell any conversations at all.

66
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:48,473
This is merely so we do not have to return here in August, which we have to-

67
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,769
Thank you to the chair members.

68
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:54,690
So for that explanation and for the reading of the policy, I appreciate that.

69
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,951
I just wanted to clarify.

70
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:56,611
Thanks so much.

71
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:00,492
Any other questions?

72
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:01,852
Member McLaughlin?

73
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,874
I have more questions, but I believe, sorry, I'm sorry, one second.

74
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:12,995
I have more questions, but I believe member Hayes, did you have your hand up to talk about what you wanted to talk about for last time?

75
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:14,156
I did, yes.

76
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:16,916
Okay, so I would let member Hayes go first and then I would, thank you.

77
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:18,717
Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,074
It's really just a question.

79
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:26,877
The question that I had last time was about the definitions used for bullying.

80
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:46,185
And when you look at both the Massachusetts state law and the DESE, their model plan, they have the definition as basically as stated on the first page of the current proposed Medford policy.

81
00:05:46,724 --> 00:06:02,309
which is defined as the repeated use by one or more students or a member of the school staff of a written verbal or electronic expression or physical act or gesture or any combination thereof directed at a target that and then list those five categories.

82
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,550
And it does say in the

83
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:22,033
Department of Education model plan, it does state that for the definitions, including the bullying definition itself, districts may add specific language to these definitions to clarify them, but may not alter their meaning or scope.

84
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:26,116
So then my question really is when we look at the

85
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:34,247
The second page, or at least I have it printed up, the second page of the proposed policy for Medford.

86
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:36,888
Excuse me, point of information.

87
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,009
Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

88
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,331
Can we share the document on screen so people can know what we're referring to, please?

89
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,354
I can do that if nobody has it handy.

90
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:50,776
Yeah, I have a printed copy, sorry.

91
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:51,876
All right, that's fine.

92
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:52,777
Hold on one second.

93
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,338
I can pull it up.

94
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,497
shared screen, the numbered version that you're looking at?

95
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:04,700
That's the one I'm looking at.

96
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,064
It's probably easier to refer to the exact lines.

97
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:09,025
Okay.

98
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:41,343
So lines 50, starting at line 55.

99
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:58,315
The bullying definition here, which is the one that's used, it says bullying investigations may be concluded with a finding of, and on line 55 it says it may be

100
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:10,495
Concluded with the finding of bullying, a finding of bullying occurs when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the core of the problem.

101
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:24,303
Bullying is abuse and occurs when a socially powerful, example given, popular or feared student mentally or physically abuses a weaker, e.g., example given, fearful student for the purpose of making them afraid or hurt.

102
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,224
Bullying is the act of causing hurt, harm, or humiliation.

103
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:39,641
That piece feels to me like it's changing the definition, the original definition in the, both in state law and the model, and adding that piece about a power differential.

104
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:54,747
So that was my question, is to me that seems like a different definition than both on our first page of our model, our proposed, the definition that's given in lines 17 through 24 of this plan.

105
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:11,128
which is a verbatim definition taken from the state law, which does not include that idea of a power differential is necessary for defining bullying.

106
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:26,555
But the second definition in our plan, that one I just read at 55 through 61, adds that piece of a power differential that doesn't appear

107
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:30,317
in the state definition or the model plan from DESE.

108
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:42,020
If I may, through the chair, is your recommendation then to take the definition from line 17 through 24?

109
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,202
And are you requesting that 17 through 24 become 55 through 63?

110
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:54,608
Or 55?

111
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,989
Yes, that is the definition of bullying.

112
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:03,711
55 through 61, I mean, 55 through 61.

113
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:04,411
Right.

114
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:10,253
So if you look at line 62 and 63, there it talks about the pattern of behavior or repeated.

115
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:15,535
So that more closely aligns with the state definition, the state law.

116
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:21,797
But that piece about the power of a differential does not appear in the state law as part of what defines bullying.

117
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:35,380
So yes, I'm talking about, I'm requesting or suggesting that that piece needs to be taken out in terms of defining bullying, how we define bullying if an incident occurs.

118
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:42,667
Okay.

119
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,027
Okay, now this is just a recommendation, right?

120
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:53,669
So, because we would need potentially a vote to amend.

121
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,791
And I know there's a few hands up, so.

122
00:10:57,472 --> 00:11:02,054
It looks like Dr. Edweb-Minson is just marking the document so that we understand.

123
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:09,559
And just to be clear, I also did look at several districts in our area.

124
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:16,043
I looked at the bullying and intervention plans for Arlington, Somerville, Cambridge, Malden, Winchester, Woburn, Waltham,

125
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:26,172
Lexington and Everett, and I didn't see in any of theirs any, as part of the definition of bullying, anything to do with the power differential.

126
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:32,115
That only comes up, and it comes up also in the model plan from DESE.

127
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:39,959
It comes up as a potential professional development topic for educators.

128
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:10,891
While Dr. Edward-Vincent marks this up, Member Hayes, do you have any other questions before I turn it over to Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham, then Ms.

129
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:11,251
Brandley?

130
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:24,699
No, that was my main point, just because that's so essential to the whole thing, is understanding what our definition of bullying is in order to determine when an incident will be classified as bullying.

131
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,739
Yep.

132
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,340
OK.

133
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,140
wait on the motion to amend as see many hands are up.

134
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,341
So let's go to member McLaughlin.

135
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:38,602
Thank you, Mayor.

136
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:43,424
I have about six lines that I wanted to discuss.

137
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:47,665
So I don't know if you want to have me do like half and then come back and do half.

138
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:53,207
So it gives other folks an opportunity to talk before, you know, so I'm not monopolizing time.

139
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,844
Yeah, let's start out.

140
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:58,224
All right.

141
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:02,566
Okay, thank you pages, numbers 95 and 96 please.

142
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:03,286
Yep.

143
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:11,048
Information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment.

144
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:13,809
Yeah, and so I was curious about.

145
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,491
I would like some elaboration on that I'm not sure what that.

146
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:23,729
in particular means, I mean, I know in the rest of it, there was, can we go up to the heading here, the subheading?

147
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,849
Yeah, this is, such training may include- Regarding training, right.

148
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:31,750
Being limited to informational students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school.

149
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:41,512
So probably our most vulnerable students, which was outlined in section, in numbers 72 through 76 as well.

150
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:42,272
Yeah.

151
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:46,033
All right, I just wanted to be,

152
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:48,129
clear that it was in the training.

153
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,053
So just, I wanted some clarity on that.

154
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,246
Yes, I see where it was.

155
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:53,426
I was reading earlier where that was.

156
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:58,707
Okay, so that was 95 and 96, information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment.

157
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:04,389
And I guess I would love a note to have that be qualified.

158
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:17,051
So if it's 72 through 76, say C72 through 76, so that we're all on the same page and what that actually means, because I think it's just vague as information on students who are particularly at risk.

159
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:19,092
for bullying in the environment.

160
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:24,277
So just if we could refer back to the earlier document in terms of what that is referring to.

161
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:35,047
So maybe in parentheses as referenced, but not as referenced, but not limited to what is in 72 to 76, but not limited to.

162
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:38,888
Yes, please.

163
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:40,409
Thank you, Laura.

164
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,772
Mayor Lungo Kern also, Esquire.

165
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,273
Appreciate that.

166
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:49,535
And then 118.

167
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:06,925
Post the approved bullying prevention and intervention policy on the Medford Public Schools website.

168
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:16,631
Right, and so this is, again, I know we're having a meeting in September to talk more about accessibility of materials and what have you.

169
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:22,374
I think this is particularly important for translation.

170
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:33,340
And so if we're posting the approved bullying prevention and intervention policy on the Medford Public Schools website, I think we need to make it accessible to all.

171
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,201
It can't be just in this language.

172
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:42,422
And so I'm wondering where we're having, you know, so I would add, you know, including accessibility features.

173
00:15:42,482 --> 00:16:02,778
So whether that's, you know, translation or what have you, but I think in particular, as I think a lot of districts, you know, are doing and maybe experiencing some language barriers around some of this, we need to really be proactive about it.

174
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,861
The school's website was just revamped.

175
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:15,678
from the same development company as the city and the city has a dropdown section where it can be translated and I believe five languages.

176
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:23,262
So I would assume the schools is the same, but I don't know if somebody from the school department can confirm, but I assume that it's the same.

177
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:27,044
We do have translation available on our website as well.

178
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:31,466
So that is definitely something that is available.

179
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:57,930
Okay, and so I think one of the things we can talk about, and again, we have a motion to do this at the beginning of the year, is how folks know about that and actually having cultural brokers or community stakeholders actually try it out and see if it's translating and it's actually accurate because as we all know, you need to use plain language and there might be things here that are not translating across.

180
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:09,617
Culture, so I would say that we test this out as part of the translation and accessibility that we'll be discussing in the beginning of the year.

181
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:19,561
So I'd like a note there, and if that needs to be in a motion, I can do that, but I don't wanna, I wanna go through the document as a whole before motions are made.

182
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:26,663
So when we do a second, whatever, reading of it today, not at another time, I can make the motion then if it makes it easier.

183
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,062
I can do it right now.

184
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:29,022
I'm going to email.

185
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:31,184
We have community liaisons, five of them.

186
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,325
Yeah, I know.

187
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:38,590
I'm going to just see if they'll take a look over the next 30 days.

188
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,431
Thank you.

189
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:40,372
That would be excellent.

190
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:45,416
I did meet with your Metro Connects folks earlier, and I'm excited about the cultural liaisons there.

191
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:48,959
So that would be a great opportunity to look through this and see if it's actually translating.

192
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:51,699
well with the tool that's used on the website.

193
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,379
Thank you, Mary.

194
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
I really appreciate that.

195
00:17:55,442 --> 00:18:02,428
And then I'll do one more before I stop and let colleagues and others talk, and then I'll just get back in the queue again if that's okay.

196
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,270
So I think it's number 120.

197
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,561
yeah, under incident reporting.

198
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:17,225
And so there was some, there's another section, so 120 in general, the incident reporting.

199
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:29,295
So I think it might be, unless I missed it and I read it a couple of times, so I'm not sure that I, can you show me the next section, please?

200
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:33,458
Yeah, hold on right there.

201
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:40,896
I think there's a line, it's either under incident reporting or investigation.

202
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:52,201
I had it as a whole in incident reporting because I wanted to ensure, and maybe my colleagues remember, and if they don't, I can look at it while others are asking questions to find the particular line.

203
00:18:52,241 --> 00:19:02,865
Again, I did find one line that sort of addressed it, but I want to ensure that it did address it later in the incident reporting, that incident reports and documents will be shared with

204
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,151
all parties involved.

205
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:17,801
And so this goes back to the motion that we had previously, that when there are behavior incidents or other incidents in the school that are potentially related to this bullying incident that those are part of, and that they're not excluded.

206
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:26,108
Yeah, right here, 188, in short, copies of all bullying investigation forms were part of the student file, but I think there was also a part of sharing.

207
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,362
Yeah, they said part of the student file, which essentially makes it shareable, but I'm not sure.

208
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:55,460
This goes back to the concern that, you know, potentially incident reports could have been taken before the actual bullying complaint occurs and that those should have been made available to parents and guardians of the party prior to the bullying and the bullying investigation and that they should be part of the bullying investigation is essentially what I'm saying.

209
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:58,996
Does anyone have any comments on that?

210
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:04,882
There was a motion that we made earlier, but I don't see it anywhere, unless I missed it here.

211
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,785
I want to make sure that it's covered.

212
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:12,531
Can you just tell me, you said line number 120?

213
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,495
170, it was the incident, no, yeah, 120, incident reporting.

214
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:17,277
It's the whole section of incident reporting.

215
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:20,660
Yeah, because it's the issue of incident reporting.

216
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,402
So here we have it, 188.

217
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:22,983
Thank you.

218
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:26,907
It says ensure copies of all forms are in the student file.

219
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:29,670
Can you go further down decision and findings?

220
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:30,631
Sorry.

221
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:34,876
Keep going.

222
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:35,537
Sorry.

223
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:57,471
Yeah, I'm not, I'll have to search it to see if there's anything that says that to that effect, but essentially, you know, it does say that it should be part of the student's file, but it doesn't say anything about copies, unless I missed it, about copies to the respective parties.

224
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:08,080
I feel like that should be already, you know, under the previous motion, but I want to make sure that it's reiterated.

225
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,622
So 120, if you want to go back to 120.

226
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:21,331
And maybe, Superintendent, if you could just make a note there on incident reporting and documentation.

227
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:36,023
And then I'll just do a search while we're also conversing because I just did 120 because I felt like it fell under the whole section and didn't see anything specific to providing copies of incident reports.

228
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,517
I'm just trying to understand what is it that you want?

229
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:48,320
On incident reporting line 120, if you can make a comment right there with the Google Doc, thank you.

230
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:57,726
Documentation provided to all parties, question mark, and we can go back and revisit that while I look to see

231
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:00,903
Yeah, we have to remember the student confidentiality.

232
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:05,025
So documents are shared, student information is redacted.

233
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:12,147
So information being shared with the parent regarding their child, we have to like follow the law.

234
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:18,349
We're not able to just send everything with other students first and last names.

235
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,571
100%, and that's not what I'm asking, superintendent.

236
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,591
I totally understand that, and I understand redaction.

237
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:27,253
What I'm asking, and this was already addressed on the floor,

238
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:40,684
is that when there are incident reports, so behavior incident reports involving a student, okay, where that incident report goes to the principal's office, because it typically does if there's been behavior involved.

239
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:49,411
And we had had a motion that when that happens, that information is sent to parents so that they're notified as soon as reasonably possible.

240
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:54,495
I don't have the motion in front of me right now, so that they have copies of any incident reports.

241
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,417
So for instance, if an individual

242
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:10,569
had been getting five, 10, maybe incident reports of behavior issues as an individual with a disability, for example, maybe having, you know, some, you know, who knows what medical issues as well, you know, who knows what's going on.

243
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:19,517
And then they get to the point of a behavior, I mean, a bullying report, had the parent been notified of those 10 prior incident reports, right, that it occurred.

244
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:25,602
And in a lot of instances, talking with families, talking with CPAC, talking with others, that had not often been the case.

245
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,303
And the principal might come to the,

246
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:33,673
meeting after 10 incidents with 10 reports in their hand that the parents have never seen.

247
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:40,500
In fact, this happened just a month ago that I was made aware of, even after the motion was passed, that parents would get copies of incident reports.

248
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,924
So we've had this discussion before, to clarify.

249
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,167
And what I want here is to have something that

250
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:50,929
indicates that that policy exists as well and where that is.

251
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,250
And so I'll just read through.

252
00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:00,036
I did see something that said, you know, material will be added to the student file, which again, you know, when we say to the student file, what does that actually mean?

253
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:03,138
Because we do have to consider FERPA, which we know is a federal law.

254
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,939
I mean, there's all kinds of nuances around here.

255
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:14,826
So I understand what you're saying, superintendent, around redacted names, but if it's your child and your child was involved in an incident, you have the right to know that your child was involved in an incident.

256
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:19,934
And you should be getting a copy of that incident report if it's gone on file with the principal in the office.

257
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:21,575
And that was what we had previously discussed.

258
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:28,642
And names can be redacted, but you should know about your child's incident and not find it out from other families, members, or other students.

259
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:35,149
So Member McLaughlin, what I'm just trying to understand is what would you like me to add in the comment box?

260
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:38,693
Right now in the comment box, I would just like you to add, please revisit

261
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:46,558
and I'll look at this while we're continuing the conversation, please revisit regarding copies of incident reports.

262
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:54,299
And I will look through this section again because there was something that was related there, but it was very vague and I wanna make sure that it's clear.

263
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,000
Thank you.

264
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:58,760
Thank you.

265
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,581
And then I will pass and defer to my colleagues for the next ones.

266
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:04,081
Thank you.

267
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,902
Member Graham and then Ms.

268
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:09,362
Brantley.

269
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,214
Thank you.

270
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,416
Superintendent, can you go back to member Hayes' question?

271
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,917
I just wanted to respond to that.

272
00:25:22,078 --> 00:25:28,220
So I think what is being perceived as a discrepancy here is, in my mind, it's not.

273
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,341
So we're talking, there's two things.

274
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:33,782
There's a definition of bullying, which is what you have highlighted here.

275
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:42,199
When you scroll down to that next section, the intent of that was to describe what the findings could look like and why.

276
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,523
And this power differential is absolutely part of the law.

277
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:56,568
But what we were trying to do, and the reason it's sub-bulleted, is to say an investigation could conclude in any number of ways.

278
00:25:57,428 --> 00:26:07,691
And we did that because I think what we found in the feedback that we got was that lots of things come back as like, this is not bullying, it's conflict.

279
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:12,572
And it's never been, it's never clear to families, like, what does that mean?

280
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:17,673
So this is, in my mind, this is not in conflict with the definition.

281
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:23,215
It is instead and rather an attempt as a sub bullet to number 49,

282
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:37,716
to be a way to explain findings, not to redefine in any way, shape or form like what bullying is, but to qualify like how findings come to be.

283
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,737
So I just wanted to put that out there.

284
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:48,439
We had a ton of discussion about this in five subcommittee meetings and this idea of what findings look like and what

285
00:26:49,019 --> 00:27:01,352
parents can reasonably expect was something we worked really hard on to try to qualify for people so that when they're reading this, we're starting to set expectations for folks that this is

286
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:07,009
that many things could happen as the result of a bullying investigation.

287
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,390
And this is just one, a finding of bullying is just one of those things.

288
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,773
So that was my response when it comes to member Hayes' question.

289
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:21,754
And then can you scroll down to member McLaughlin's next question?

290
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:26,336
Yeah, on this bullet.

291
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,877
Again, this is a sub bullet.

292
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:35,721
So if you scroll up to the actual bullet, the bullet is part of what Medford Public Schools will do.

293
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:40,383
So in the second bullet there, if you scroll down a little bit,

294
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:52,053
On row 80, MedBurgh Public Schools will provide age appropriate instruction on bullying intervention to students and professional development to build the skills of the staff as required by law.

295
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:55,454
Staff will receive annual training on the bullying prevention intervention plan.

296
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:58,375
Such training may include, but not be limited to, and then there's a list.

297
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:04,759
If I recall correctly, this list was part of the current policy.

298
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:15,506
All that we did here was try to make it more clear what this list was because there were a lot of lists in the original policy and it was just sort of a mess to try to understand what it was.

299
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:18,108
So this is framed as

300
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:29,159
Things Medford public schools will do, we will provide age appropriate instruction and annual professional development that training may include but will not be limited to these things.

301
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,947
And it's really at the discretion of the superintendent to decide what that annual training looks like.

302
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:42,353
And so one of those topics could be information on students who are particularly at risk for bullying in the school environment.

303
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:57,709
It's not unlike any other, so I am personally of the mind that we don't need to sort of complicate it with like a reference back to something because it's a sub-bullet that just describes the kinds of things that could happen in professional development.

304
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:05,229
And then could you scroll down to Member McLaughlin's other question, incident reports?

305
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:18,463
So I guess what I was thinking about as you were talking, Member McLaughlin, is if that motion, and I think the answer is it's not quite there yet, but we made a motion about incident reports.

306
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:23,211
And what we didn't do was codify it into policy.

307
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:32,214
But I think incident reports can be about many, many things over and above what happens as it relates to this bullying report.

308
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:39,237
So what I think would be most appropriate is for us to codify that incident report

309
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:42,616
motion that we made into a policy.

310
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:55,634
And then when we do that, we just come back and we make an update to this policy to add a reference that this bullying policy will substantially conform with that policy.

311
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:55,835
So

312
00:29:56,815 --> 00:30:01,177
When you write policy, you don't want to put things in lots of places because it becomes really hard to manage.

313
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:09,202
And I think incident reporting in that context that we already passed is much, much bigger than it is specific to bullying.

314
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:15,025
So I would rather see us formalize that as a policy and then come back to this document and reference.

315
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:19,427
And so that's just a suggestion on how we move forward on that question.

316
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,090
That's all I had, Mayor.

317
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,041
Ms.

318
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:29,601
Brantley?

319
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:34,364
And then Member Hayes.

320
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:40,789
Ms.

321
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,549
Brantley, are you there?

322
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,032
I think somebody may need to unmute her.

323
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,033
Oh, there she goes.

324
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,496
It looks like I still can't start my video, but that's OK.

325
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:51,996
Can you hear me?

326
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:53,918
Yes.

327
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,218
I'm sorry, you can't start.

328
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:55,939
OK.

329
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:56,599
No, that's OK.

330
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:56,800
It's OK.

331
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:18,752
But I just wanted to say, in the fact of what member Hayes was saying, I just think all the refining that we did during all of these meetings was just so helpful to see happen as a parent, because those refinings were not there when we were in our situation.

332
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:26,913
And I just think as much depth as we can put in this, which I think we've done, this looks so good to me, it makes me so happy.

333
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:38,834
that we have in here is just so helpful as a parent to know all the little details here and there that when you're in the midst of something traumatic, to know that you can read this and it all makes sense.

334
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:42,276
And you can say, oh, this is exactly what was happening in our situation.

335
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,097
This is exactly what's supposed to happen next.

336
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:50,000
So I just think the refining that we did was just so helpful.

337
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,042
It's gonna be so helpful to the next set of parents that have to deal with something like this.

338
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:53,722
Hopefully they don't.

339
00:31:55,751 --> 00:32:07,879
And then I'm just curious on member McLaughlin's comment about, you know, if there were 10 incident reports and then a bullying report, I would like to think there wouldn't be 10 incident reports and then a bullying investigation, right?

340
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:18,846
I mean, I know that we had three before a bullying investigation and already an assault at that point.

341
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:21,908
So I'm just hoping that,

342
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:31,107
We don't have to go down, any parent doesn't have to go down that long road anymore that there will be, this policy will help nip everything immediately.

343
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:32,468
So we know, is it a conflict?

344
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:33,469
Is it bullying?

345
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:40,113
And then how to put all the pieces together after that and how to actually execute the policy.

346
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,134
So I just wanted to just comment on those things.

347
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:42,655
So thank you.

348
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:48,238
Thank you.

349
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,420
Member Hayes and Member McLaughlin.

350
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:53,568
Thank you.

351
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:01,515
So just going back again to the definition, so two things I guess I would like to just make clear.

352
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:04,397
I have looked through the state law several times.

353
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:10,843
There is no mention of the power differential except as a topic for professional development.

354
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:21,552
I mean, I'd be happy if someone wants to tell me where they're seeing it, but I did look back again, because I know that was also said at the last meeting, that it appears several times, and it only appears

355
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:29,774
again, is a topic for professional development, not anywhere in terms of how you determine whether a particular incident is bullying.

356
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:46,080
And in terms of how it's written in this policy, I think that's one of the important things after a committee has gone through as much time as this committee went through, then to present it to people with a fresh eye who look at this and say, but that doesn't make sense to me.

357
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,982
And I'm looking at that with a fresh eye and saying, that particular piece doesn't make sense to me.

358
00:33:52,403 --> 00:34:05,151
because it does seem to be saying the way that it's worded is that a finding of bullying occurs when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the core rule of problem.

359
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:20,301
And to me as reading that, it says to me as a parent or as a school committee member, I'm looking at that thinking that's telling me that the only time an incident is going to be or one time when an incident is going to be considered bullying

360
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:25,310
is when someone determines that there's a power differential.

361
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,112
And I don't see that anywhere in the state law.

362
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:32,213
I don't see that anywhere in the DESE model.

363
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:47,860
And I think that, to me, that seems to suggest a change in the meaning or a change in the scope of the definition of how we're gonna determine bullying, which the state says we shouldn't do that, that we should not change the meaning or the scope.

364
00:34:50,328 --> 00:35:01,211
If we were to go down this road, again, I wouldn't vote in favor of this in it because I think that it changes the meaning, but we'd have to define how someone would determine a power differential.

365
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:19,857
I think that's an incredibly nuanced and difficult thing to determine in any situation, but certainly among students, how they define power, how the power structures are among students, I think would get us into some really tricky and gray areas.

366
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,943
But more importantly than that, as I said, it's not part of the state definition.

367
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,865
So I don't think it should be part of our definition.

368
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:29,287
Thank you.

369
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,430
Member McLaughlin.

370
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:39,855
Thank you.

371
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:40,415
125, please.

372
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:54,414
And this is, yeah, we're still under the incident reporting piece.

373
00:35:54,494 --> 00:36:01,938
So I guess I wanted to, first of all, if I could, through the chair, address member Graham's comments, which I appreciate.

374
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,599
I guess I have two things.

375
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:16,926
One is I think maybe as part of like school committee onboarding for folks that are coming in or what have you is, you know, this sort of idea of this notion of codifying into policy.

376
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:18,927
I think that,

377
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:28,521
TAB, Tila Duhaime): Maybe folks you know aren't always clear that if emotion passes that it should be one would assume it would be implemented, but.

378
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:34,590
TAB, Tila Duhaime): In that motion was passed, but I think to your point codifying it into policy.

379
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:36,123
is another step.

380
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:38,804
And so I think we really need to be thinking about that on the floor.

381
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:51,173
If we're making motions, if these motions need to go into policy to actually be enacted, it's gonna take up a lot more time in our policy subcommittee, but that's an interesting point and one that I hear you saying.

382
00:36:51,273 --> 00:37:00,399
So I will definitely be revisiting that in the fall, but it's something that I would like the committee as a whole to consider.

383
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:13,721
because it sounds like a slippery slope to me a little bit where if motions are passed, but and or aren't codified into policy, does that mean that they're not being enforced?

384
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:15,982
Do we have to also codify motions into policy?

385
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:20,603
Like that's sort of another step that I'm questioning, but I appreciate again, that being brought up.

386
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:27,104
The decisions and findings, can you scroll down to that please Mayor?

387
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,272
Well, actually it's investigation and decision and finding.

388
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:35,853
I don't see anything in this material.

389
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:41,996
And again, unless I'm wrong, I read through it, but I was marking through my notes and I don't see anything in here.

390
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,978
And maybe it's back at investigation or maybe it's back at report.

391
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:56,282
I'm not really sure where my colleagues think it should go, but I do think that we need something in this report that says, you know, we will provide a,

392
00:37:57,663 --> 00:37:59,847
translation and interpretation as needed.

393
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:12,686
So you know when you're sharing bullying reports, when you're sharing investigation findings, when you're sharing decision and findings, how is that being shared with our community who might not have English as

394
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:21,091
a first language or might not have English at all and are getting their material translated through their student or through other folks.

395
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:29,574
So I think we need to say that we will provide translation and interpretation to families who have English as a second language.

396
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,335
Another really important lesson that I learned

397
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:37,012
Not too long ago, this was actually in the IEP process, where I was speaking with a mom.

398
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:38,453
This was actually a while ago.

399
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:39,334
It wasn't not too long ago.

400
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:41,115
It was probably five or more years ago.

401
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:57,171
But I had become friendly with a mom who was a native Vietnamese speaker, could converse in English, and I had reached out to the Vietnamese community advocates to support her and to get help for her.

402
00:38:58,032 --> 00:39:05,616
And they had said, does she have the IEP translated into Vietnamese?

403
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,317
And I remember at the time saying, oh, no, no, she can speak English.

404
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:12,460
And that was my naivete, ignorance, whatever you want to say.

405
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:19,343
But speaking a language and deciphering complex content are two different things.

406
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:24,886
And so to have it in one's original language or to have an interpreter or translator provided

407
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:37,161
or translation of documents provided sorry interpreters speech translation is print so to have those things and provided I think is important and I don't see that on this document here again like to miss brownies point.

408
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:41,299
I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly, Ms.

409
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:46,840
Brownlee, that I would hope that there would not be incident reports that had not been shared.

410
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:55,041
And that's the whole point of why we're moving forward with so many of these things, because we were in the situation where those weren't shared.

411
00:39:55,221 --> 00:40:03,223
And in some instances, we continue to be in the situation, and hopefully these things are remediating that, particularly training for principals and others.

412
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:07,224
So I couldn't agree more, but I also think that this,

413
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:17,667
interpretation of the report, interpretation of findings, interpretation of decision, interpretation of rights.

414
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:26,833
We have to have somewhere that this material will be interpreted or translated for those whose language is not English as a first language.

415
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:30,875
Thank you, Dr. Murray, Dr. Edwards-Vincent for putting that in there.

416
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:31,595
And then 178, please.

417
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:55,462
Does that capture it just having it in front?

418
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:57,982
Yeah, I don't know if it's going to be under decision and findings.

419
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:03,664
I think it's going to be earlier with report filing, to be honest, because they need to know what's going on in the process.

420
00:41:04,184 --> 00:41:10,466
So I would say maybe up as high as, yeah, add this to whatever the report, the incident under incident reports or something.

421
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:15,568
Yeah, thank you.

422
00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:19,069
178, please.

423
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:41,285
I'm sorry, what was the number you said?

424
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:41,285
178.

425
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:44,168
Thank you.

426
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:56,618
Yeah, and so I just wanted to point out to the central student information, whether it's school brains or what have you to store these incident and investigation forms and

427
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,261
all of the disciplinary remediation, all of those things.

428
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:06,764
I think, again, I think that just needs to be vetted for FERPA and needs to be vetted for security.

429
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:09,186
And so that's just the note I would put there.

430
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:14,209
Like what, you know, how does that, I don't know that it does in school brands.

431
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:15,569
I know that they have the student ID in there.

432
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:17,550
I just don't know that they have all these other records in there.

433
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:25,675
And I don't know what the requirements are for FERPA for, I know for our company, we have to submit forms when working with like state,

434
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,722
programs to ensure that we have safety and security around this information.

435
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:37,304
So I would just like a note around that, please.

436
00:42:38,404 --> 00:42:47,269
Through the chair member McLaughlin, I don't know if you bullet 183 talks about how this information is a temporary record.

437
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,970
So this is all part of

438
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:59,283
what we're required to do, that discipline information is part of a temporary record and it's kept for six years after graduation of involved students.

439
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:01,703
Yes, I hear you.

440
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:02,784
And I think that's important.

441
00:43:02,804 --> 00:43:07,025
What I'm saying is that the 178 is saying maintain a central student information system.

442
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:12,226
So it sounds like it's wanting to digitally store incident, all of these forms.

443
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:14,567
And I'm saying around digital security around this,

444
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:16,098
Or is it a paper storage?

445
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:16,578
I don't know.

446
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:24,262
And are we ensured that this material is digitally stored and, you know, in a safe way that FERPA is not being violated for students?

447
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:27,683
So that would be my question, the digital piece.

448
00:43:27,703 --> 00:43:38,049
Do we have the, you know, do we have the digital certification to ensure that this information is stored securely under FERPA requirements is what I'm asking.

449
00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:38,509
Thank you.

450
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,367
Thank you and then 188.

451
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:21,082
So, ensuring all copies of these, you know, are of all of these forms are kept in the student are placed in the student file, and I guess I would defer defer to.

452
00:44:25,824 --> 00:44:28,225
Director of Pupil Services, Joan Bowen, on some of this.

453
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:36,049
So I know just like, for example, for the individual behavior plans, yeah, they're in the student file, but that doesn't mean anybody can access them.

454
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:39,831
And so they need to be in a secure situation.

455
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:48,655
So for example, for students who are on an IEP, if they have a behavior support plan, so that's how I would word it too, I would just behavior support plan.

456
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:50,716
But if they have a behavior support plan,

457
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:56,767
you know, there are people who can see it and then people, you know, and hopefully are reading it and are using it.

458
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:01,792
But not everybody can because it might also contain medical information.

459
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:03,994
It might contain, you know, who knows what.

460
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:11,962
So I guess what I'm saying there is, is that I would, I want to hear what the director of people's services has to say about this 188 to 190.

461
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:37,915
So, my understanding with this so there's two different things so if a student is a student with a disability and they have a behavior support plan that is part of their, their record their special education binder that anyone that is providing services are working directly with that student has access to that file to look at it to read all the documents that are in there.

462
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:48,838
I think bully investigation forms, reporting forms, those would go into more of a student record folder, which is separate from special education.

463
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:52,259
So that might be the folder that's kept with the guidance counselor.

464
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:06,782
We also could come up with a way of storing that it's in one central office, maybe at central administration, my office, whoever's office that they come in, we keep them in a yearly,

465
00:46:07,903 --> 00:46:10,387
older in a secure office, something like that.

466
00:46:10,427 --> 00:46:19,161
So I think it's just the within the district determining how we want to store those and to maintain confidentiality and FERPA and all of the above.

467
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:19,962
Right.

468
00:46:20,002 --> 00:46:21,224
And so I guess I thank you.

469
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:33,979
Director Bowen, so I guess on that 190, I would add that comment that, you know, so special education files are separate from quote student file.

470
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:45,730
If we're talking about the records that are being destroyed in this sort of student record file versus special education, and they're under very different laws and what have you.

471
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,213
So we need to think, yeah, about how that is, how we wanna word that.

472
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:50,594
Thank you.

473
00:46:51,368 --> 00:47:00,173
I only have two more left and I would ask my colleagues if they're okay with me just going through the two more before switching out or I know, through the chair member grams next.

474
00:47:02,254 --> 00:47:04,316
Is it okay for me to go through two more, Mayor.

475
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:09,879
Yep, two more is fine and then we'll go to member and then hopefully we can.

476
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:11,500
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,420
Five or so.

478
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:13,141
Yep.

479
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:28,828
Yeah, so if physical injuries occurred and have not been examined, asking a nurse to examine the target and aggressor.

480
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:35,353
So there's a little bit of like, I don't know, there's a little bit of a question here.

481
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:42,118
So one is obviously if the injury is severe enough that they need other care, it wouldn't be the nurse that's doing this, right?

482
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:44,119
Or maybe in a

483
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:51,123
in an emergency situation, the nurse is there, what have you.

484
00:47:51,163 --> 00:48:04,806
But for example, in situations where there is abuse, it can be worse for the patient, and this is just trauma-informed practice.

485
00:48:05,026 --> 00:48:13,909
And I think Avery could talk to some of this as well, but if there's injuries that occur, having the individual

486
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:23,227
relive the experience over and over and over again can cause additional trauma and can also affect the outcome of the.

487
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:29,337
nature of the story sometimes in terms of what happened when.

488
00:48:29,877 --> 00:48:40,465
And so I'm not sure what we're saying about asking us to examine the target and aggressor, especially if there's an emergent situation and it's more serious.

489
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:42,247
So I just want to put a note there.

490
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:51,813
I just want to tag that for a second for conversation around what exactly, I mean, if the opportunity is available and the injuries are such that they're not severe enough for

491
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:56,436
you know, an ambulance or police or what have you to be called, that might be different.

492
00:48:57,016 --> 00:49:05,099
But I would love, I know she's not here right now, but I guess, you know, it would have been good to hear Avery's input on that or somebody's because I'm not.

493
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,021
Yeah, I'm not sure what the requirements are there.

494
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:09,381
But just want to put a pin in that.

495
00:49:10,222 --> 00:49:11,962
And then 365.

496
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:14,283
And that's my last one.

497
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,764
So thank you guys for your patience.

498
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:29,192
Yeah, so PRS.

499
00:49:30,113 --> 00:49:35,216
So again, I guess I would ask the director of people's services about this too.

500
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:46,005
PRS is one option for collaboration with families, but it's usually involving special education or an individual with a disability, if I'm not mistaken.

501
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:51,008
In other instances, it's not PRS, it's the office of civil rights.

502
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:54,251
So director, yes, Bowen, if I could through the chair.

503
00:49:55,768 --> 00:50:03,555
So I just wanna clarify that PRS can be families, general education families and special education families.

504
00:50:03,595 --> 00:50:18,927
So a parent of a student who does not have a disability, if the bullying and plan was not followed, they have that ability to go through PRS to see if the district did follow their procedures and policy.

505
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:20,068
Thank you.

506
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:22,909
And so that's in terms of the procedure and policy.

507
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:27,270
And what about how does that differentiate from the Office of Civil Rights?

508
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,610
Because I know that bullying incidents also go through the Office of Civil Rights.

509
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:35,151
So I feel like if we're providing this, we also want to provide the information on the Office of Civil Rights.

510
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:39,272
So why would we not also provide that information?

511
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:42,813
Or would we?

512
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:43,873
That's what I'm saying.

513
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,581
I would have to defer to see, you know, like what is included in other bullying and preventions.

514
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:58,602
I can look into it and get back to you, but I mean, I don't see why it shouldn't be in there.

515
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:07,304
Yeah, I mean, I think we have it on all the other documentation, so why not offer it as, you know, because it's part of the procedural safeguards for families regardless.

516
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:14,025
I know it's in part of the procedural safeguards for individuals with disabilities, but I think some parents might not understand that PRS

517
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:17,407
And, you know, I hadn't thought about that in terms of the procedure.

518
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:18,468
They are about procedure.

519
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,629
So I could see how it would be.

520
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:26,154
It could be individuals without disabilities regarding procedure, but it also could fall under Office of Civil Rights.

521
00:51:26,234 --> 00:51:29,677
So I think that people need to know that there are both of those options.

522
00:51:29,697 --> 00:51:32,219
So that's what I would ask.

523
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:36,543
So the note I would put in there is include information on Office of Civil Rights, please.

524
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:39,365
Thank you.

525
00:51:40,146 --> 00:51:40,466
That's me.

526
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:44,832
Member Graham.

527
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,535
Thank you.

528
00:51:49,937 --> 00:51:53,660
I wanted to make a motion to amend the policy at line 259.

529
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:12,255
To insert a bullet that reads provide interpretation and translation services for families so that a comprehensive and productive collaboration can occur.

530
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,989
I'm gonna just put it in the chat so that everyone can read it.

531
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:19,450
Can you repeat it one more time, Member Graham?

532
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,490
I'm sorry, I was just- I just put it in the chat.

533
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:22,491
Oh, you did.

534
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:23,111
Okay.

535
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:23,791
Yeah.

536
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,172
Because I'm screen sharing, I'm not- Yeah.

537
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:27,893
Let's see if I can find that.

538
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:28,673
Okay.

539
00:52:29,953 --> 00:52:39,456
And so the reason that it goes here is because it's an overarching requirement of central administration to make sure that this is available to families as they need it.

540
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:43,198
And how you operationalize that is something that the central administration would be responsible for.

541
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,230
Right.

542
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:45,670
Second.

543
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,090
Thank you.

544
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:53,112
Roll call, please.

545
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:54,773
Member Rousseau.

546
00:52:54,813 --> 00:52:55,873
Mayor, we can't vote on this.

547
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:57,234
We have another motion on the floor.

548
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,495
Can you remind me what the other motion was?

549
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:08,377
The motion is to suspend Rule 46 by me and seconded by Member Graham.

550
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,931
Okay, motion to suspend rule 46.

551
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:17,314
Roll call vote, please.

552
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:19,556
Member Graham?

553
00:53:20,557 --> 00:53:20,797
Yes.

554
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:22,578
Member Hayes?

555
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:24,000
No.

556
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:25,901
Member Kretz?

557
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:26,842
Yes.

558
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:28,944
Member McLaughlin?

559
00:53:30,105 --> 00:53:30,485
Yes.

560
00:53:31,806 --> 00:53:33,287
Member McStone is absent.

561
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:35,529
Member Rossell?

562
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:35,749
Yes.

563
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:44,973
Yes, motion is approved, five in the favor, one opposed, one absent.

564
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:55,917
Now motion to amend line 259 with what is written in the chat by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin, roll call please.

565
00:53:57,218 --> 00:53:57,738
Member Graham?

566
00:53:58,358 --> 00:53:58,578
Yes.

567
00:53:59,618 --> 00:54:00,059
Member Hayes?

568
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:00,899
Yes.

569
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,360
Member Kratz?

570
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,160
Yes.

571
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:04,861
Member McLaughlin?

572
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:05,561
Yes.

573
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:08,674
Member Stone is absent, sorry.

574
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,135
Member Rossell, yes, Mayor Longo, current.

575
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:15,817
Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

576
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:19,139
No, that was six in the, seven in the affirmative.

577
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:21,280
Sorry, no, Member Stone's absent, so six in one.

578
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,243
Thank you.

579
00:54:27,403 --> 00:54:29,244
If you can just give me one more second.

580
00:54:30,624 --> 00:54:33,466
And then Member McLaughlin's motion to amend,

581
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:44,936
lines 95 to 96 to read as reference, but not limited to the language.

582
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,016
I'll withdraw.

583
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:47,057
Sorry.

584
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:50,839
If you can just give me like one second, I'm actually typing something about that.

585
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:51,599
Okay.

586
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:53,920
Member Hayes.

587
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:57,362
Thank you.

588
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:04,526
I just wanted to make sure I know when I was speaking about the definition, I'm not sure that I clearly made a motion to

589
00:55:05,717 --> 00:55:12,240
to remove the part about the power differential.

590
00:55:17,422 --> 00:55:18,202
I have a question.

591
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:22,704
No official motion right now on that yet.

592
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:26,105
Okay, I'd like to make a motion if I can.

593
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:30,687
Dr. Cushing, did you want to speak on that?

594
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:32,042
or something else?

595
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:33,903
No, I did wanna speak on that.

596
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:45,349
And with all due respect around the power imbalance, stopbullying.gov and even Australia lists the power imbalance in the definition within the first sentence.

597
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:55,354
I also, you're not supposed to speak about your personal experiences, but as someone who was pretty routinely bullied up through the sixth grade,

598
00:55:56,796 --> 00:56:00,438
and it's probably why I do what I do, it was a definite imbalance of power.

599
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:08,482
It was not for anything else than an imbalance of power until I was able to tip the scales.

600
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:14,345
So whatever it may be, it is definitely an imbalance of power.

601
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:17,826
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

602
00:56:18,527 --> 00:56:20,748
Mayor, do I still have the floor or have we moved on?

603
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:21,048
Sorry.

604
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:28,943
While you were typing, Member Hayes made the motion to remove the imbalance of power language.

605
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:30,504
I don't know if there was a second.

606
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:31,504
Is there a second out there?

607
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:33,805
I had a point of information, Mayor.

608
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:38,728
I was wondering if I could get some clarity on the motion because- Point of information by Member McLaughlin.

609
00:56:40,328 --> 00:56:40,989
Clarity on the motion.

610
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:41,929
Can I ask a question?

611
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:42,609
Yep.

612
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:43,370
Point of information.

613
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:44,450
Yes, thank you.

614
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:48,552
So I am hearing, if I'm hearing correctly,

615
00:56:49,577 --> 00:56:55,179
The request is around using consistent language for bullying.

616
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,380
And we have the language earlier as the definition of bullying.

617
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:10,943
And then we have these additional aspects of other sort of, I guess I would say second tier deeper digging into other sort of definitions of bullying.

618
00:57:11,877 --> 00:57:25,508
I think what I'm hearing is consistency, but then if I'm not mistaken, I'm hearing through member Graham that it's about sort of subdividing under a different category, what those would be.

619
00:57:25,848 --> 00:57:32,433
And I think the issue is the power differential if I'm understanding the issue correctly, but let me just finish.

620
00:57:32,893 --> 00:57:39,699
So I'm asking if that is the issue is the power differential or is the issue that we're not using consistent language in the definition.

621
00:57:40,427 --> 00:57:49,954
And if the issue is the power balance issue is the question because it leaves ambiguous who can decide whether there's a power differential or not.

622
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:51,956
So those are the questions I have about that.

623
00:57:52,156 --> 00:58:02,924
Okay, I'll let member Hayes have the floor to answer those so we can move forward on this motion and then go to member Graham's language for the next roll call.

624
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:05,165
Thank you.

625
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:06,587
So the issue I'm bringing up is

626
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:12,148
is that the power differential does not occur in our state law definition.

627
00:58:12,268 --> 00:58:19,630
I do understand and I have looked at the federal government's website, stopbullying.gov, and they do talk about a power differential.

628
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:24,651
However, our state definition is very clearly does not include that.

629
00:58:25,731 --> 00:58:37,154
And so my concern and my belief is that we are waiting into a change of the definition if we start to include that as part of the definition of the way that we

630
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:53,366
of the way that we determine when a bullying incident has occurred, which is what this page says, that it will be determined to have occurred when the incident is determined to be between two students who are not considered to be equal in power.

631
00:58:53,726 --> 00:59:06,550
And I do understand, and I think that we see that also in the state, the DESE's model plan, they do talk about the power differential as part of something that

632
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:10,488
that educators need to have professional development about.

633
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:17,512
They're not saying that doesn't exist, but they do not include that as part of the definition for determining when bullying has occurred.

634
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:31,240
So my motion is to remove that power differential as it's worded anyway, it appears to be part of the definition and part of what we will use to determine when an incident is classified as bullying.

635
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,343
So I think it doesn't match the state law.

636
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:38,011
Sorry.

637
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:43,972
Okay, I'm gonna see if there's a second on the floor to remove that language.

638
00:59:44,052 --> 00:59:49,393
And can you just identify the number, line number that you wanna remove from?

639
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:49,753
It's 55 to 61.

640
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:51,694
That's right.

641
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,654
And swapping or 55 through actually 63, I think.

642
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:55,435
I would second.

643
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:09,473
point of order.

644
01:00:09,493 --> 01:00:12,294
24 point of water member result.

645
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:15,215
Members are only people allowed to make motions.

646
01:00:15,275 --> 01:00:20,056
No offense to our superintendent members should make motions by stating the motion.

647
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:23,337
Um and know what they're saying is their motion.

648
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:29,799
I'm trying to take minutes here so we can take votes and I have people like making suggestions and comments.

649
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:32,779
This is a public legislative body.

650
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:35,320
We are making motions to modify

651
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,703
policy.

652
01:00:36,723 --> 01:00:42,068
We are not having a conversation about my opinions of this, that, and the other, and what websites say what.

653
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:50,595
So if members could do their jobs and make motions so that I can write the minutes and we can take legally binding votes, I would greatly appreciate it.

654
01:00:50,615 --> 01:00:50,995
Thank you.

655
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:52,417
Thank you, Member Rossell.

656
01:00:52,457 --> 01:00:58,822
So, Member Hayes, I'm understanding that your motion is to remove the power

657
01:00:59,403 --> 01:01:06,128
and balance language from section line item, section under policy line numbers 55.

658
01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:09,971
I can state it.

659
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:13,874
It's to remove lines 55 through 63 and reinsert or insert in their place line 17 through 24.

660
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:14,214
Second.

661
01:01:29,158 --> 01:01:33,121
Can I ask for just one minute to read this?

662
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:37,204
Mayor, I have a comment before we vote.

663
01:01:37,704 --> 01:01:39,046
Okay, comment before you vote.

664
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:39,806
Member Graham.

665
01:01:42,948 --> 01:01:48,773
I think just trying to drop in a definition here totally sort of

666
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:55,466
diminishes the entire intent of 49 all the way through to 64.

667
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,408
That was written as a block intentionally.

668
01:01:58,528 --> 01:02:13,962
And so I am absolutely not in favor of doing this in this way because it does not take into account the relationship of the three things that could come out of a finding, which is conflict, bullying or not bullying or conflict.

669
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:15,343
And if you just,

670
01:02:16,144 --> 01:02:24,050
change this piece, the integrity of the whole section is not quite right and it's confusing.

671
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:28,854
So I am not in favor of this and I will vote no, I'll happily do that.

672
01:02:29,294 --> 01:02:40,643
But I'm asking my colleagues to really think about how to do this thing that they're asking us to do without compromising other really important components of this document.

673
01:02:42,104 --> 01:02:43,085
May I ask a question?

674
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:45,935
member McLaughlin.

675
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,038
Thank you.

676
01:02:50,959 --> 01:03:10,374
I think that when I'm looking at this bullying, so I get that conflict bullying, not bullying, which I want to talk about the flow chart as well that Peter had created around helping simplify this because I think that's part of the issue is that we need to have some visual clarity because this is a, I forget how, 16 page document.

677
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:14,777
That can be a lot and a lot of folks are TLDR, but also a lot of folks are visual learners.

678
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,880
We haven't addressed that piece either, which I want to address before this meeting is over.

679
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:31,246
But this particularly suggests to me that a finding of bullying only occurs when there is students who are not considered to be equal in power.

680
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:36,629
So when the incident is determined between two students who are not considered to be equal in power within the quality of problem.

681
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:41,592
So what if the students are equal in power and one is bullying the other?

682
01:03:42,632 --> 01:03:43,853
How is that investigation

683
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:46,013
And so we said earlier.

684
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:47,934
Yeah, question.

685
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:51,476
So how is that qualified if they are equal in power and there's a bullying?

686
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:53,677
Can I respond to that?

687
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:56,438
Because we did talk about that in subcommittee quite a lot.

688
01:03:56,458 --> 01:04:02,061
I think that's a great question, because I'm I'm trying to dissect to see if there's a middle ground somewhere in this line item.

689
01:04:02,081 --> 01:04:02,902
So yes, member Graham.

690
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:10,606
So we we talked about this extensively with lots of principles on the phone and we really pressed them on this.

691
01:04:10,826 --> 01:04:12,807
And one of the things that they described

692
01:04:14,778 --> 01:04:21,059
Like the same behavior could be bullying and it could be conflict.

693
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:26,401
And the differentiation of those two things is really about power.

694
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:36,863
And so if you have two students who do not have a power differential and they are having a problem, that finding is gonna come back as conflict.

695
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,944
So the two students are having conflict

696
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:52,227
and there's a way forward and it is not like a sustained repetitive thing that that's exactly why so many things come back as conflict and not as bullying.

697
01:04:52,327 --> 01:05:07,632
And so what the administrators described, and Dr. Cushing can keep me honest here if I am misremembering, but that they described that one of the reasons why parents are so upset when their finding comes back as conflict is because

698
01:05:09,403 --> 01:05:26,036
the decision that's being made, and it's absolutely being made in all of these cases, is that these students, these two students in question, they legitimately are having a conflict, but the conflict is not exacerbated by this power differential.

699
01:05:26,577 --> 01:05:28,378
And instead, the finding is conflict.

700
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:33,582
The very same things can happen in the output of conflict versus bullying.

701
01:05:33,803 --> 01:05:35,504
The very same things can happen.

702
01:05:36,044 --> 01:05:37,005
The difference is,

703
01:05:38,366 --> 01:05:43,450
it rises to the level of bullying when certain criteria are in place.

704
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:58,821
And what we heard again and again and again from the administrators who do this every single day is that the actual thing that differentiates bullying from conflict is like, is this this idea of is there a power differential here?

705
01:05:58,861 --> 01:05:59,582
Yes or no.

706
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:06,447
And, you know, frankly, administrators are like assessing power differentials like all day long, every single day in a school.

707
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:10,188
that's just sort of the nature of being an administrator in a school.

708
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:15,190
And so that was one of the things we talked a lot about.

709
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:21,232
And prior, like the policy, it said something like, well, it could be bullying or it could be conflict.

710
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:27,894
And there was no qualification for like what that meant, why it meant, or like how parents could understand like

711
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:32,052
What does that mean for me and what happens next?

712
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:40,466
And so we really pushed the administrators on this like over the course of several meetings to help us define

713
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:44,208
how can we set people's expectations about this thing?

714
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,049
And that is why you have this.

715
01:06:46,109 --> 01:07:04,495
So if the motion is to replace this piece, you're degrading this, the intent and the spirit of this section, which is to like help people understand what is conflict and what is bullying and what is, or that both could not be true.

716
01:07:05,175 --> 01:07:06,056
And without,

717
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:14,523
a thoughtful look at how this whole section works, like we're doing a disservice to the policy that we've worked really hard on.

718
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:21,449
If I may, just point of clarification maybe, or you know.

719
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:25,713
Point of order or point of information with a question, point of order with a statement.

720
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:27,394
With a statement, point of order.

721
01:07:27,895 --> 01:07:33,240
So I appreciate that you talked with the principals, I think that's important, but I also think that

722
01:07:35,066 --> 01:08:01,214
I think that the state law trumps what we believe to be true about, I mean, if there's a state definition and that straight definition does have criteria for what determines an incident to be actual bullying, and they don't include a power differential, again, I think that we're changing the scope of that definition by adding the power differential to it.

723
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:13,171
There are actual criteria for why a conflict in the state law, how it becomes determined to be bullying it places the victim and reasonable fear of harm to himself or damage to their property.

724
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:14,191
It's very well.

725
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:17,592
The very clearest part of it is that has to be three or more incidents.

726
01:08:18,813 --> 01:08:23,074
That is repeated use three or more incidents and there's a series of five criteria.

727
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,354
that lead to the finding of bullying.

728
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:33,198
But those five criteria do not include a power differential in the state law and the state definition.

729
01:08:34,379 --> 01:08:36,701
Mayor, Member McLaughlin.

730
01:08:37,082 --> 01:08:37,482
Thank you.

731
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:41,425
Since I sort of had brought up this with questions, I appreciate getting the floor back again.

732
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:41,745
One is

733
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:49,164
I can hear the nuance in this discussion, and I think it's important.

734
01:08:49,364 --> 01:09:03,157
And I would really ask also our colleagues, as a whole, if we're not using value statements around individuals doing their work, or whether they're degrading something, or that sort of language.

735
01:09:03,357 --> 01:09:03,998
I was at every policy

736
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,101
subcommittee meeting with the exception of one.

737
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:20,430
And some of this must have been the last conversation too, because I hadn't heard a lot of the argument around this, or I'll have to look back at the minutes because I don't recall a lot of the arguments or discussion around this.

738
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:27,955
I think I can see both sides in terms of the power differential, but this is a very subjective thing, power differential.

739
01:09:28,055 --> 01:09:33,179
And it's like we had instances with our own family members who were very much being bullied.

740
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,881
In this situation, there was a power differential.

741
01:09:37,442 --> 01:09:45,407
It was not seen necessarily by the principal because the principal very likely doesn't understand nuances of middle school power dynamics.

742
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:49,850
And they're very subtle and can be relational as opposed to physical.

743
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,170
They can be all sorts of things.

744
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:55,713
So I think that's why there's such clarity and why and how you find a

745
01:09:57,689 --> 01:10:16,321
finding of bullying, and my concern my main concern about this which I think power differentials are an issue, and very much very often are the instances but not only and also it leaves to somebody discretion to determine whether there's a power differential as opposed to the other requirements that are part of state law which I think

746
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:17,401
is critical.

747
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:36,386
So I'm a little, I'm a little conflicted around this, which is why I'm having or asking that this be thought out a little bit more to do the chair to member Graham's point I understand what you're saying about wanting to really clarify the conflict bullying and not bullying because believe me, ours was ruled conflict and it, you know,

748
01:10:37,447 --> 01:10:44,994
And many others have been, as I've known, and I think would qualify under this, but it's because it leaves it so subjective to what this is.

749
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:50,259
And I think this even makes it more subjective, frankly, around the power differential.

750
01:10:50,339 --> 01:11:00,810
So I don't know how to fix this, and I don't know if it's a state fix or what it is, but I think that maybe there's some middle ground, there's some opportunity for some rewarding or negotiation or something here, because

751
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:23,039
I hear both sides of the argument and it's concerning for me, especially around, you know, and it still didn't answer the question is what happens when, you know, two people are in a situation and one is bullying the other, and it's not seen as a power differential, because for whatever reason, because maybe there's not a known power differential there.

752
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:28,899
internally it's a power differential because somebody else is scared and the other one's not, but how does that determine?

753
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:31,120
I mean, it's such nuance, it's, you know, emotions.

754
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,361
How do you know internally whether there's a power differential or not?

755
01:11:33,401 --> 01:11:40,124
Or, you know, but for all appearances sake, they're both on the football team, you know, one's the quarterback, one's the linebacker, I don't know.

756
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:47,888
And what, you know, they seem to be equals, they're of the same height, weight, abilities, you know, all of those things, but clearly one is, you know, bullying and,

757
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:57,634
the other is not, how do you know that there's a power, you know, what do you do if there's not a power differential, yet there is bullying, which I think is why there's that clarification under the definition.

758
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,255
So I hear two competing things here.

759
01:12:02,077 --> 01:12:08,721
Identifying and the difference of conflict bullying and not bullying or conflict, which I think is a tricky bit for everybody.

760
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:11,583
And then the other is being consistent with our definition.

761
01:12:12,102 --> 01:12:16,545
and really clarifying what that is of bullying and making sure that we're aligning with what the state standard is.

762
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:20,308
And then the third is that bullying often occurs when there's a power differential.

763
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:34,777
And I'm not sure I know the solution, but I do think that just sort of plowing through or, you know, not plowing through, but saying, well, the subcommittee decided on this and this is why is not helpful because all of this committee, we're a committee of seven that needs to decide this material.

764
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,419
So that's why we're having the discussion.

765
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:36,939
Thank you.

766
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:50,860
Thank you member McLaughlin member Graham if you don't have if yours is on another motion and not on this, I'm going to move for roll call on.

767
01:12:54,807 --> 01:12:57,128
question, and it is a tough decision for me.

768
01:12:57,308 --> 01:12:58,428
I see both sides.

769
01:13:00,069 --> 01:13:14,413
I do see the victim as eventually being the weaker, or the, yeah, I don't know, this is a tough one, but member Hayes' question, seconded by member McLaughlin, if we could call the roll, please.

770
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:15,614
Member Graham.

771
01:13:16,654 --> 01:13:16,874
No.

772
01:13:17,954 --> 01:13:18,414
Member Hayes.

773
01:13:20,555 --> 01:13:20,775
Yes.

774
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:22,296
Member Kratz.

775
01:13:23,076 --> 01:13:23,196
No.

776
01:13:24,676 --> 01:13:25,377
Member McLaughlin.

777
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:29,922
Member McLaughlin.

778
01:13:30,182 --> 01:13:30,983
Sorry, you're muted.

779
01:13:31,003 --> 01:13:31,744
Sorry, I was muted.

780
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:32,565
Yes, thank you.

781
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:34,807
Member McStone, absent.

782
01:13:35,368 --> 01:13:36,229
Member Russo, no.

783
01:13:36,309 --> 01:13:37,090
Mayor Longo, current.

784
01:13:42,887 --> 01:13:46,970
Yes, four in the affirmative, two in the negative motion.

785
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,172
I'm sorry, the motion fails.

786
01:13:50,152 --> 01:13:52,034
That was 3-3, wasn't it?

787
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:53,535
Yeah.

788
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:54,676
3-3, okay.

789
01:13:54,856 --> 01:13:55,156
Yes, 3-3.

790
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:56,977
So the motion fails.

791
01:13:57,538 --> 01:13:58,078
Motion fails.

792
01:14:06,304 --> 01:14:11,188
Can we make any suggestions about how to support some language here?

793
01:14:12,386 --> 01:14:12,646
Mayor.

794
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:14,868
Member Rousseau.

795
01:14:14,888 --> 01:14:20,954
Yeah, I did have my hand up to speak before we took the last motion.

796
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:24,096
Howard has his hand up too, excuse me.

797
01:14:24,156 --> 01:14:24,417
Thank you.

798
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:34,295
You know, when I joined the committee in 2018, we were assigned our subcommittees and I was, you know, a new member and very excited.

799
01:14:34,955 --> 01:14:44,439
And Paula Vander Kloot, member Vander Kloot, who served with us for 30 years, leaned over and said, I really shouldn't need to be excited because subcommittees don't meet.

800
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:45,839
And I was confused.

801
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,001
And she said, subcommittees don't meet because the committee cannot trust each other ever.

802
01:14:50,461 --> 01:14:53,222
So every member would either come to every subcommittee

803
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:57,315
I don't know if it was the subcommittee that had to make it a regular full meeting.

804
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:07,517
I've been very proud of the fact that this committee has figured out how to trust each other in subcommittees.

805
01:15:08,377 --> 01:15:15,341
I do think it's important to remember that we can vote against things, but finding a consensus isn't necessarily an option.

806
01:15:16,422 --> 01:15:20,924
And I hope everybody will vote no if you are not okay with the policy.

807
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:29,910
But when a subcommittee recommends it, it is assumed that the subcommittee spent an inordinate amount of time that cannot happen on the floor

808
01:15:30,771 --> 01:15:34,973
to come to the policy that they reported out, the policy recommendation.

809
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:36,873
And this is- Point of information?

810
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:43,696
Or actually, point of clarification though, through the member or so, if I may, through the chair.

811
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,941
May I, Member Rousseau?

812
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:49,942
I'm not sure if Chair stepped away.

813
01:15:50,443 --> 01:16:03,854
Yeah, I just wanted to add, and I hear you, and it is a lot of work, and we do trust each other, and I think this is a tough subcommittee, and I think they're all important, and I think this is, you've done a lot of work on this subcommittee.

814
01:16:04,354 --> 01:16:04,875
We all have.

815
01:16:05,675 --> 01:16:14,943
And I think that when discussion happens on the floor, things can happen that you hadn't thought of in subcommittee, where you do start to have different,

816
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:17,368
positions and perspectives.

817
01:16:17,388 --> 01:16:19,629
So that also has to be considered.

818
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:21,050
And it's not a matter of trust.

819
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:23,332
It can be a matter of critical thinking.

820
01:16:25,974 --> 01:16:27,555
May I continue?

821
01:16:27,615 --> 01:16:27,775
Yes.

822
01:16:29,342 --> 01:16:34,944
I certainly met just to respond to remember a lot when I do not expect that the subcommittee thinks of everything.

823
01:16:35,805 --> 01:16:46,789
And that's why I think it's good practice remember just to come with a, I'd like to make some motion to change this to that, or insert this language here that we are an hour and 20 minutes into.

824
01:16:47,509 --> 01:16:50,571
an agenda that is to approve or not the policy.

825
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:52,312
It is not to write a new policy.

826
01:16:53,773 --> 01:16:58,315
And we have strayed from that so wildly, it's kind of impressive.

827
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:03,798
And, you know, again, nobody has to vote yes.

828
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:09,201
If you just think this isn't right, this isn't legal, or whatever your other reasons are, vote no.

829
01:17:09,361 --> 01:17:10,562
I urge you to vote no.

830
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:15,024
I would vote no in a second if I didn't believe the policy was good.

831
01:17:15,124 --> 01:17:20,589
And it would not, even if I thought my colleagues did great work to come to a policy decision.

832
01:17:20,649 --> 01:17:32,019
So that's all I just wanted to say is that I hope we're not on the road towards never having subcommittees again, because if this is how we have to do every policy, I'm not sending stuff to subcommittee.

833
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,163
I'm gonna bring it to the floor and we're gonna spend four hours talking about everything.

834
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:42,187
It just slows the amount of work we can get done down dramatically.

835
01:17:42,847 --> 01:17:43,188
Thank you.

836
01:17:43,768 --> 01:18:01,442
Well, I just, if I may, if I may from the chair, I think it's a very important policy and I know we have a long agenda and we're all just thinking about how most of the time is gonna be taken up with this policy and we don't usually meet in the summer, but I think it's very important.

837
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:04,265
I know that colleagues had questions

838
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:18,836
16 pages long, so I understand what you're saying, Member Russo, but I do wanna respect our colleagues asking good questions and struggling with some of the language.

839
01:18:18,896 --> 01:18:22,036
So with that being said, Member McLaughlin.

840
01:18:22,056 --> 01:18:25,177
I just also wanted to make a point of clarification here as well.

841
01:18:25,197 --> 01:18:31,798
It's that subcommittee chairs don't get to decide whether something gets referred to the subcommittee, that's the committee as a whole.

842
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:34,940
whether something gets referred to a subcommittee.

843
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,622
So just for clarification.

844
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:45,329
So member Graham, I think you were going to work on the, you were working on the last amendment and then hopefully we can take a vote on the full policy.

845
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:48,592
Yes.

846
01:18:49,413 --> 01:18:57,340
Sorry, point that actually Mayor, may I, because there were two or three items that we had commented on that I didn't realize I was going to have an opportunity to make a motion on if I wanted to.

847
01:18:57,938 --> 01:19:02,940
And I was having discussion for the courtesy of other school committee members in the public.

848
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:10,524
So I would like to scroll through those and see if I would like to put forward a motion before we are making a final vote, please.

849
01:19:13,546 --> 01:19:16,747
Mayor, do we want to hear from Attorney Greenspan?

850
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:20,249
Attorney Greenspan, are you

851
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:22,357
need to talk to us about this policy.

852
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:44,719
I didn't attend all the subcommittee meetings, but as a suggestion on the finding, could it be that the finding of bullying could be pursuant to the definition which is listed at the beginning of the policy,

853
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:51,654
and also in addition to include lines 56 through 62.

854
01:19:52,414 --> 01:20:02,860
So it's not, it could include the definition or it could include this specific portion about balance of power.

855
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:12,285
I make a motion that the section includes pursuant to the definition previously and the material 56 to 63, which I think is agreed.

856
01:20:14,757 --> 01:20:16,759
some compromise and negotiation.

857
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,761
So do you want to type that in the chat?

858
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:20,361
I need the motion.

859
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:32,209
The motion is to include pursuant to the definition of bullying on the lines, whatever, 17, you know, pursuant to the- Can I get the lines?

860
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:32,790
I'm sorry.

861
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:36,112
Member McLaughlin, I'm not sure where the quotes and commas start.

862
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:41,416
Yeah, if we could type in the motion, just take your time, type it in on the chat, please.

863
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:41,996
Sure.

864
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:43,342
then it's in writing.

865
01:20:43,862 --> 01:20:44,843
Yeah, thanks.

866
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,823
Mayor, I have two motions I'd be happy to make.

867
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:10,770
Yes.

868
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:13,152
So why don't you make those motions?

869
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:14,172
Okay.

870
01:21:16,434 --> 01:21:19,496
So the first one is a motion to amend the proposed policy at line 371.

871
01:21:19,536 --> 01:21:23,018
Sorry, there's a bug flying around my face.

872
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:32,264
To add the following bullet, the office of civil rights is available to help families see the additional information at the following link for additional detail.

873
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:36,746
And then there is a link to a fact sheet from the office of civil rights.

874
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:40,874
and I just popped it into the chat.

875
01:21:42,116 --> 01:21:42,457
Thank you.

876
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:46,904
So motion from member Graham, seconded by member Rousseau.

877
01:21:47,525 --> 01:21:48,066
Roll call, please.

878
01:21:51,828 --> 01:21:52,868
Sorry, may I have a motion again?

879
01:21:52,888 --> 01:22:03,314
I'm actually trying to type my motion into the chat as was asked, and we moved on to another motion, which I'm, yeah, I know I didn't have a second on my motion because I was asked to clarify it in the chat.

880
01:22:03,374 --> 01:22:04,895
So there is motion.

881
01:22:05,456 --> 01:22:07,797
We'll hold on this one until you've finished.

882
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:12,320

May we call the roll?

886
01:22:49,157 --> 01:22:51,979
I think, are you standing in for the mayor, vice chair?

887
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:52,900
Yeah, I'm here.

888
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:56,062
I'm just waiting for phone calls, but we're for good.

889
01:22:56,082 --> 01:22:58,124
Member Graham?

890
01:22:58,804 --> 01:22:59,024
Yes.

891
01:23:00,165 --> 01:23:00,626
Member Hayes?

892
01:23:04,088 --> 01:23:04,548
Sorry, yes.

893
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:06,250
Member Kratz?

894
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:07,090
Yes.

895
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:08,772
Member McLaughlin?

896
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:09,652
Yes.

897
01:23:10,893 --> 01:23:11,894
Member McStone, absent.

898
01:23:13,257 --> 01:23:13,557
member.

899
01:23:13,597 --> 01:23:15,098
So yes, Maryland.

900
01:23:15,118 --> 01:23:15,378
Okay.

901
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:15,939
Yes.

902
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:19,641
Succeeding affirmative one absent motion passes.

903
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:27,266
Okay, here's the next one motion to amend line 56 as follows.

904
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:35,432
A finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above and may occur when the incident is determined to be between two and then it continues.

905
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:42,390
And the definition was line 17 but we won't have that reference in, you know, because people won't be seeing the line numbers so I don't.

906
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:49,414
Yeah, that's why I just said above because it's one of the, which is why, yeah, which is what the, my original motion was thank you.

907
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:51,836
But I was asked for the line numbers so that's what you got.

908
01:23:52,096 --> 01:23:53,057
But second, that's great.

909
01:23:53,137 --> 01:23:53,397
Thank you.

910
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:54,918
I'm sorry, can you read that one more time.

911
01:23:55,038 --> 01:23:55,298
Sorry.

912
01:23:57,396 --> 01:23:58,077
It's in the chat.

913
01:23:58,457 --> 01:24:08,923
A finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above and may occur when the incident is determined to be between two and then it continues unedited.

914
01:24:11,665 --> 01:24:14,086
I'm sorry, I'm confused as what's going to come after that.

915
01:24:14,327 --> 01:24:16,848
There was something about pursuant to, and I don't.

916
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:20,971
Yeah, a finding of bullying is pursuant to the definition above.

917
01:24:21,451 --> 01:24:23,492
Which was the line 17, the DESI definition.

918
01:24:23,512 --> 01:24:24,473
Got it, okay, thank you.

919
01:24:25,771 --> 01:24:35,976
And then the connection is, and may occur when the incident is determined and then everything else sort of stays as it is.

920
01:24:36,396 --> 01:24:36,676
Got it.

921
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,116
Thank you.

922
01:24:38,437 --> 01:24:38,697
Okay.

923
01:24:38,757 --> 01:24:40,198
Motion on the floor, seconded.

924
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:41,178
Roll call, please.

925
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:44,820
Who seconded it?

926
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,220
I'm sorry.

927
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,541
I seconded it.

928
01:24:47,621 --> 01:24:48,261
Melanie.

929
01:24:49,862 --> 01:24:51,003
Member Graham.

930
01:24:51,643 --> 01:24:51,863
Yes.

931
01:24:52,823 --> 01:24:53,244
Member Hayes.

932
01:24:53,724 --> 01:24:53,884
Yes.

933
01:24:55,373 --> 01:24:55,873
Democrats.

934
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:58,374
Yes.

935
01:25:00,535 --> 01:25:00,875
Yes.

936
01:25:02,035 --> 01:25:02,636
Absolutely.

937
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:06,257
Remember so, yes, Maryland.

938
01:25:06,817 --> 01:25:10,299
Yes, 16 affirmative one absent motion passes.

939
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:11,299
Thank you.

940
01:25:12,782 --> 01:25:18,644
If that's the final motion, I will see if there's a motion on the floor to approve the policy as amended.

941
01:25:18,964 --> 01:25:25,386
May I just, may I, for a point of clarification, I just want to scroll through the tabs to make sure we didn't miss anything.

942
01:25:26,146 --> 01:25:33,989
Because again, as I was saying there, I just wanted the opportunity to ensure I wasn't making motions at the time because I thought we were having opportunity for discussion before motion.

943
01:25:34,049 --> 01:25:39,671
So would you guys just indulge me for a minute where we can take it from the top and scroll through the tabs if you guys don't mind?

944
01:25:40,759 --> 01:25:41,199
Thank you.

945
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,742
Cause it's an, it is a very important document yet.

946
01:25:44,782 --> 01:25:45,663
That's the definition.

947
01:25:46,344 --> 01:25:46,544
Yep.

948
01:25:47,284 --> 01:25:47,745
That's fine.

949
01:25:47,785 --> 01:25:48,185
Thank you.

950
01:25:49,947 --> 01:25:50,247
Yes.

951
01:25:50,347 --> 01:25:50,767
Thank you.

952
01:25:51,948 --> 01:25:52,529
That's cleared.

953
01:25:57,433 --> 01:25:58,013
Yeah.

954
01:25:59,395 --> 01:25:59,715
Okay.

955
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:00,195
That's fine.

956
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:04,319
Because information on students, it was, it was around the action, the training they'll take.

957
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,019
I'm fine with that.

958
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,120
Yes.

959
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,661
We said that earlier.

960
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:08,162
Thank you.

961
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:12,979
Yeah, copies of incident reports.

962
01:26:13,019 --> 01:26:27,389
So we did not address this, and so I would make a motion to include a line in the Medford Public Schools will, and it can be, you know, the last line.

963
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:28,490
Can we go up a little bit?

964
01:26:32,773 --> 01:26:33,153
After 117, so 118.

965
01:26:36,078 --> 01:27:00,851
ensure family caregivers, I would make a motion that the public schools will ensure family caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student with redacted information with respect to other individuals prior to investigation determination.

966
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:05,554
I'm gonna need all that language.

967
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,081
You want me to type it in the chat.

968
01:27:09,363 --> 01:27:14,129
That would be great, thank you sure so mps so line.

969
01:27:35,521 --> 01:27:38,182
I'm just going to take this call and then I'll be back.

970
01:27:46,506 --> 01:27:51,548
I'm just going to receive incident reports regarding their student redacted prior to investigation.

971
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,008
Yeah.

972
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:17,418
So I make a motion to include in 118 under MPS will after ensure district staff is aware of policy in 118, MPS will ensure families or caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student redacted for identifying information prior to investigation.

973
01:28:17,438 --> 01:28:20,199
If I can get a second, that would be helpful.

974
01:28:20,219 --> 01:28:23,820
Have you got a friendly amendment?

975
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:26,541
Sure.

976
01:28:27,798 --> 01:28:34,019
to remove, we've moved on to just using caregivers under all circumstances instead of- Yes, yes, please, thank you.

977
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:48,223
I would amend that to say MPS, and we say MPS at the top, Will, so I don't think we need to add that bit, but just ensure caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student redacted for identifying information prior to investigation, please.

978
01:28:49,303 --> 01:28:49,663
Second.

979
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:53,384
There's a motion on the floor from Member McLaughlin,

980
01:28:55,316 --> 01:28:58,037
Member Hayes, I have one question.

981
01:28:58,057 --> 01:29:01,758
Member Rossell, go ahead.

982
01:29:01,959 --> 01:29:11,162
I just was, the prior to investigation part of that, I'm sorry for having just put it into the motion, into my minutes.

983
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:15,304
That does imply that there will be no investigation.

984
01:29:15,324 --> 01:29:17,865
You know, this happens first period.

985
01:29:18,005 --> 01:29:23,907
There will be no investigation that whole day until the report has made its way to the parents.

986
01:29:24,724 --> 01:29:25,525
the caregivers.

987
01:29:26,245 --> 01:29:42,820
And I'm worried that administrators will, first of all, just simply violate it because it seems nearly impossible, but also it just, if they did follow it, the quality of the investigation, I would imagine would be degraded.

988
01:29:45,942 --> 01:29:47,823
You have a point, and I think that's interesting.

989
01:29:47,884 --> 01:29:52,347
I'm saying prior to investigation, because really they should receive incident reports when they happen.

990
01:29:52,727 --> 01:30:01,933
Once your family can't receive incident reports regarding this, you can redactify and identify information within 24 hours of their occurrence.

991
01:30:05,076 --> 01:30:06,797
If I may.

992
01:30:07,317 --> 01:30:07,677
Okay.

993
01:30:08,578 --> 01:30:10,239
Member Rousseau.

994
01:30:10,299 --> 01:30:10,640
Thank you.

995
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:15,403
I just wonder, I mean, the incident report,

996
01:30:17,294 --> 01:30:27,857
I'd have to grab them and look at them right this second, but is there not a lot of content that ends up on an incident report that is the result of the bullying investigation?

997
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:31,518
I'm just trying to imagine how this will play out.

998
01:30:32,938 --> 01:30:41,020
The clock is ticking and I'm just worried about creating some kind of weird,

999
01:30:42,358 --> 01:30:56,945
situation and I'd like to hear from an administrator who would know how this would work in real life, because I don't, but we spent a lot of time subcommittee caring about that so yeah and I guess I would say I would like to move the question and I'm happy to revise it to within 24 hours of.

1000
01:31:00,499 --> 01:31:02,400
of the incident report.

1001
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:06,562
So, you know, that they can start investigating as soon as they want.

1002
01:31:06,622 --> 01:31:17,067
And I'm not, this is not singular to just bullying incident reports, because we have, you know, and I'll codify that in policy in September, but specific to, you know, any incidents really, but within 24 hours.

1003
01:31:18,537 --> 01:31:24,260
of the incident, I would say is reasonable to get a report that an incident occurred.

1004
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,521
I'm not saying that they're getting a full bullying report.

1005
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:35,945
I'm saying the incident report, not the full bullying report, a report that an incident occurred, which you would hope they would get a phone call home that day.

1006
01:31:36,745 --> 01:31:40,047
but within 24 hours they should get a record of an incident report occurring.

1007
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:56,655
So what I'm trying to avoid, and I would like to move the question, but what I'm trying to avoid is a parent being involved in this situation after 10 incidents have occurred and getting to the office and having, you know, the principal waving, you know, 10 incident reports in front of them and them being really outraged at not having known this.

1008
01:31:56,775 --> 01:31:59,636
And, you know, I have to say that's happened to more than one person.

1009
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:02,461
There's my echo.

1010
01:32:02,901 --> 01:32:03,522
Hello, echo.

1011
01:32:05,002 --> 01:32:08,504
So I would like to move the question, please, with the amendment.

1012
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:21,449
NPS will ensure caregivers receive incident reports that occur as, oh, it does say it, that occur as a result of bullying within 24 hours of the incident.

1013
01:32:22,591 --> 01:32:38,641
So member McLaughlin, that is my suggestion based on what I'm hearing is that we frame it that we're we're specifically qualifying that what we're talking about here are incident reports that recur as the result of bullying investigations, because otherwise they're going to be like housed outside of this completely.

1014
01:32:39,741 --> 01:32:45,105
And that the parent caregivers need to receive these reports promptly.

1015
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:46,385
And so that

1016
01:32:47,486 --> 01:32:58,401
provide some flexibility to make sure that like the intent of as soon as you can is out there, but also allows the administrators to do what they need to do from a

1017
01:33:00,191 --> 01:33:01,191
investigation standpoint.

1018
01:33:01,472 --> 01:33:01,812
Yeah, right.

1019
01:33:01,972 --> 01:33:03,932
So I'm not sure that I'm hearing you exactly.

1020
01:33:03,972 --> 01:33:07,474
But what I am saying is, yes, if they're specific to the bullying incident, I agree.

1021
01:33:07,994 --> 01:33:15,517
But what I am saying is that there could be five incident reports that are specific to this bullying incident, and they were not shared with the family.

1022
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:24,400
And that is what I'm trying to prevent here is that NPS will ensure caregivers receive incident reports that occur, you know, within 24 hours of the incident.

1023
01:33:26,721 --> 01:33:28,782
And will be, you know, included in

1024
01:33:29,332 --> 01:33:33,654
of, you know, potentially be included in a bullying investigation.

1025
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:41,398
Yeah, I think it's at least my suggestion that that belongs in the overarching policy about incident reports because

1026
01:33:42,045 --> 01:33:49,546
you could have incidents that ultimately become part of a bullying investigation, but they aren't that when they start.

1027
01:33:49,766 --> 01:33:53,887
So I think that belongs more in that overarching policy than it does here.

1028
01:33:53,907 --> 01:33:59,868
But I feel like we, oh, and you said make reference to it if we have, once we have that overarching.

1029
01:33:59,928 --> 01:34:05,769
And then, so this document, okay, so I would like to, because I don't want to forget this as a placeholder, so I will modify, thank you.

1030
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:09,270
I will modify my motion, but I will make a motion

1031
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:21,336
that we have a reference to the incident reporting policy to be created in the fall of 2023 included in this bullying advisory.

1032
01:34:22,937 --> 01:34:24,638
Okay.

1033
01:34:24,678 --> 01:34:26,099
This is the third motion.

1034
01:34:26,459 --> 01:34:29,141
Sorry, I'm withdrawing the previous motion.

1035
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:30,722
Which one?

1036
01:34:31,382 --> 01:34:35,584
The motion that NPS will ensure families caregivers receive incident reports, the one I typed up.

1037
01:34:36,325 --> 01:34:38,686
Can you withdraw the motion to move the question first?

1038
01:34:41,966 --> 01:34:43,807
That has all precedence in Robert's rules.

1039
01:34:43,847 --> 01:34:45,789
Yes, no, I know, I know, I know you don't.

1040
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:48,472
Yeah, I know I'm sorry I'm reading at the same time.

1041
01:34:48,672 --> 01:34:52,716
Yes, I will withdraw the motion to move the question which it didn't get picked up.

1042
01:34:52,876 --> 01:34:55,359
Anyway, the question was not moved.

1043
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,904
So, it's kind of silly to withdraw it, but I will do that because it wasn't followed.

1044
01:35:01,865 --> 01:35:05,988
regardless, but I will withdraw the motion to move the question.

1045
01:35:06,008 --> 01:35:17,195
And I will revise my motion, withdraw the motion that NPS will ensure families and caregivers receive incident reports regarding their student redacted for identifying information prior to investigation.

1046
01:35:17,215 --> 01:35:20,357
And I will make a new motion

1047
01:35:21,533 --> 01:35:22,253
Member McLaughlin?

1048
01:35:22,653 --> 01:35:23,014
Yes.

1049
01:35:24,194 --> 01:35:29,596
I just made a suggestion in the chat that I think does both of the things that you're wanting to do.

1050
01:35:29,616 --> 01:35:30,416
Thank you.

1051
01:35:30,596 --> 01:35:33,177
And there are no motions on the floor with seconds at the moment, so.

1052
01:35:33,337 --> 01:35:34,037
Yes, thank you.

1053
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:40,220
I make a motion that NPS ensures caregivers receive incident reports that occur as the result of bullying investigation promptly.

1054
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:49,243
And further, this policy will be amended to include reference to the incident reporting policy to be created in the fall of 2023 as soon as it becomes available.

1055
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:49,943
Thank you.

1056
01:35:51,544 --> 01:35:53,185
Okay, on the motion.

1057
01:35:53,205 --> 01:35:55,065
I need a second.

1058
01:35:55,745 --> 01:35:57,186
Member McLaughlin, is there a second?

1059
01:35:57,686 --> 01:35:58,046
Second.

1060
01:35:58,726 --> 01:35:59,727
Seconded by Member Hayes.

1061
01:35:59,747 --> 01:36:00,407
Roll call, please.

1062
01:36:07,769 --> 01:36:08,269
Member Grant?

1063
01:36:09,049 --> 01:36:09,290
Yes.

1064
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:11,030
Member Hayes?

1065
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:11,870
Yes.

1066
01:36:13,091 --> 01:36:13,531
Member Grant?

1067
01:36:14,131 --> 01:36:14,371
Yes.

1068
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:16,292
Member McLaughlin?

1069
01:36:17,012 --> 01:36:17,352
Yes.

1070
01:36:18,612 --> 01:36:19,213
Member Mustone?

1071
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:19,893
Absent.

1072
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:21,886
Member Rousseau, yes.

1073
01:36:23,328 --> 01:36:23,928
MaryLynn Gooker.

1074
01:36:27,012 --> 01:36:29,414
She's on the phone, so I'll put her as absent.

1075
01:36:31,477 --> 01:36:35,841
So five in the affirmative, two absent, motion passes.

1076
01:36:37,563 --> 01:36:37,944
Thank you.

1077
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:41,467
We just go down through the rest of the document quickly.

1078
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:41,848
Thank you.

1079
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:51,182
Yeah, I guess I'm going to leave that up to administration to decide regarding the.

1080
01:36:51,202 --> 01:36:58,145
I'm sorry, I was here, I just could not mute so you can just.

1081
01:37:00,026 --> 01:37:00,947
You're in and out mayor.

1082
01:37:02,547 --> 01:37:03,308
Sounded like a yes.

1083
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:09,791
And think that was a yes.

1084
01:37:13,092 --> 01:37:13,652
It's hard to know.

1085
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:17,999
Mayor, we can't hear you.

1086
01:37:18,059 --> 01:37:19,540
You can put your vote in the chat.

1087
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,640
That might be helpful.

1088
01:37:21,301 --> 01:37:22,601
Sorry, through the vice chair.

1089
01:37:26,243 --> 01:37:31,106
So we'll wait to see what her vote is and we can amend the tally as necessary.

1090
01:37:34,008 --> 01:37:39,351
Are there any other motions for amendment on the floor or to be made?

1091
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:42,921
May I finish this?

1092
01:37:43,681 --> 01:37:44,262
Yeah, thank you.

1093
01:37:44,722 --> 01:37:45,602
This read through.

1094
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:46,723
So special education.

1095
01:37:46,803 --> 01:37:48,164
Yeah, yeah, we already agreed.

1096
01:37:48,344 --> 01:37:50,085
Oh, so yeah, a place in the student file.

1097
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:54,588
I would like a motion to amend 188 through 190.

1098
01:37:57,730 --> 01:38:02,814
So are placed in the student file and or,

1099
01:38:05,177 --> 01:38:07,999
You know, I don't know how we address the special education file as being different.

1100
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:14,603
Ensure copies of all bullying reports, individual behavior plans are placed in the student file.

1101
01:38:14,943 --> 01:38:17,305
So there's two different types, as we said, of student files.

1102
01:38:19,186 --> 01:38:24,389
Could we just add, are placed in the student file as required by law?

1103
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:25,490
Yes.

1104
01:38:26,991 --> 01:38:27,391
Thank you.

1105
01:38:28,112 --> 01:38:32,835
So motion to amend row 190 to add as required by law.

1106
01:38:32,855 --> 01:38:33,255
Second.

1107
01:38:33,888 --> 01:38:34,849
by member McLaughlin.

1108
01:38:35,389 --> 01:38:36,170
Is there a second?

1109
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:36,510
Second.

1110
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:38,331
By member Hayes.

1111
01:38:41,033 --> 01:38:43,454
Point of clarification, please.

1112
01:38:45,556 --> 01:38:46,116
Point of so.

1113
01:38:49,258 --> 01:38:50,719
Sorry, one second, too many.

1114
01:38:55,022 --> 01:38:56,663
It's really just line 190, correct?

1115
01:38:57,063 --> 01:38:58,784
Yes, just at the end.

1116
01:38:59,825 --> 01:39:00,125
Thank you.

1117
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:08,967
We have the next one all set, if I may, to the chair, the translation and interpretation.

1118
01:39:08,987 --> 01:39:09,047
Yep.

1119
01:39:09,067 --> 01:39:09,607
Thank you.

1120
01:39:10,608 --> 01:39:12,308
Can I take the roll call?

1121
01:39:12,549 --> 01:39:12,749
Sorry.

1122
01:39:12,789 --> 01:39:14,169
Yep, member Russo, you can call the roll.

1123
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:14,890
Sorry.

1124
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:18,051
Who was the first and second on this one?

1125
01:39:18,091 --> 01:39:18,431
I'm sorry.

1126
01:39:18,971 --> 01:39:20,792
Member McLaughlin and member Hayes.

1127
01:39:23,674 --> 01:39:24,094
Member Grant.

1128
01:39:24,914 --> 01:39:25,154
Yes.

1129
01:39:26,575 --> 01:39:26,975
Member Hayes.

1130
01:39:27,535 --> 01:39:27,775
Yes.

1131
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,716
Member McGrath.

1132
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:30,477
Yes.

1133
01:39:31,485 --> 01:39:33,686
Not member McCracken, sorry.

1134
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:34,667
Member McLaughlin.

1135
01:39:35,187 --> 01:39:35,547
Yes.

1136
01:39:36,828 --> 01:39:37,969
Member McStone absent.

1137
01:39:38,169 --> 01:39:39,090
Member Russo, yes.

1138
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,130
Mayor Landau-Kern.

1139
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:41,111
Yes.

1140
01:39:42,812 --> 01:39:44,473
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1141
01:39:44,513 --> 01:39:45,153
Motion passes.

1142
01:39:47,695 --> 01:39:48,135
Thank you.

1143
01:39:49,176 --> 01:39:52,358
The vice chair, may we continue going through the end of the document?

1144
01:39:52,818 --> 01:39:52,918
Yep.

1145
01:39:59,929 --> 01:40:01,009
Did we make a motion on this?

1146
01:40:02,089 --> 01:40:02,389
We did.

1147
01:40:02,749 --> 01:40:02,970
Oh, yeah.

1148
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:03,650
OK, that was passed.

1149
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:04,030
Thank you.

1150
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:18,232
Thank you to the superintendent as well for making the notes.

1151
01:40:22,273 --> 01:40:22,853
That one's clear.

1152
01:40:22,873 --> 01:40:23,773
That one's good.

1153
01:40:28,954 --> 01:40:29,314
Yeah.

1154
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:41,223
I, and I'm not gonna make a motion on this, but I do want to bring that to the attention of the administration to please circle back with Avery and check on what is appropriate for that.

1155
01:40:41,283 --> 01:40:42,643
And we can revisit it if we need to.

1156
01:40:42,664 --> 01:40:44,664
I can also circle back with Avery.

1157
01:40:45,244 --> 01:40:51,386
If you'd like, it's basically anytime there's any physical contact, we want unwanted physical contact.

1158
01:40:51,486 --> 01:40:54,147
We want students being checked out by our nursing staff.

1159
01:40:54,487 --> 01:40:55,787
Okay, thank you.

1160
01:40:56,187 --> 01:40:58,648
As a matter of practice moving forward in all situations.

1161
01:40:59,332 --> 01:41:01,653
Yes, and then this was already set for the civil rights.

1162
01:41:01,693 --> 01:41:02,093
Thank you.

1163
01:41:03,754 --> 01:41:04,394
So we're 13.

1164
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:05,114
We're almost there.

1165
01:41:11,957 --> 01:41:12,737
Yeah, that one was.

1166
01:41:12,977 --> 01:41:13,997
Yeah, that's the civil rights.

1167
01:41:17,659 --> 01:41:18,519
Yay.

1168
01:41:19,963 --> 01:41:20,944
The chair awaits a motion.

1169
01:41:23,126 --> 01:41:30,553
Motion to approve this bullying policy plan as amended.

1170
01:41:31,034 --> 01:41:31,674
As amended.

1171
01:41:32,475 --> 01:41:32,896
Second.

1172
01:41:33,696 --> 01:41:36,879
Motion on the floor by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Hayes.

1173
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,061
Roll call.

1174
01:41:42,236 --> 01:41:42,536
Yes.

1175
01:41:42,556 --> 01:41:47,878
Sorry, I just wanted to point of information or point of order, actually, sorry, excuse me.

1176
01:41:48,878 --> 01:41:53,320
The mayor did put in her yes for that vote, so we want to amend that motion.

1177
01:41:56,081 --> 01:42:04,283
I make a motion to amend the motion regarding, oh my God, I'm tired, you guys, what motion was that that we were waiting for the mayor?

1178
01:42:04,563 --> 01:42:06,024
Don't even worry about it, it's okay.

1179
01:42:06,344 --> 01:42:06,644
All right.

1180
01:42:07,284 --> 01:42:09,005
This is the big one, as long as you can hear me now.

1181
01:42:09,605 --> 01:42:10,885
Yeah, we can hear you now.

1182
01:42:11,005 --> 01:42:11,605
I'm sorry.

1183
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:12,626
I didn't mean to interrupt you guys.

1184
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:13,946
I didn't know if she wanted to do that.

1185
01:42:14,006 --> 01:42:15,006
So my apologies.

1186
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,987
Can we start from the top for the roll?

1187
01:42:19,827 --> 01:42:20,747
I get to say yes twice.

1188
01:42:20,807 --> 01:42:21,147
Yes.

1189
01:42:22,008 --> 01:42:22,428
Yes.

1190
01:42:22,968 --> 01:42:24,908
Yes.

1191
01:42:25,248 --> 01:42:25,508
Yes.

1192
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:28,469
Yes.

1193
01:42:29,429 --> 01:42:31,590
Member Stone absent members.

1194
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:32,950
So yes, Mayor Lungo Kern.

1195
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:34,090
Yes.

1196
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:36,931
16 affirmative one absent motion passes.

1197
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:41,191
We did it.

1198
01:42:41,251 --> 01:42:42,111
Great job, everybody.

1199
01:42:43,352 --> 01:42:45,733
Thank you, everyone, for all your hard work.

1200
01:42:46,493 --> 01:42:48,354
Man, I just have my hand up.

1201
01:42:48,414 --> 01:42:50,355
Yeah, I just want to say the same.

1202
01:42:50,395 --> 01:42:51,996
Thank you guys for your super hard work.

1203
01:42:52,076 --> 01:43:03,601
I know that this was a lot and I really appreciated the communication today just around collaboration and, you know, seeing how things get done and how it's not always easy.

1204
01:43:03,681 --> 01:43:04,041
Thank you.

1205
01:43:07,683 --> 01:43:08,183
You're welcome.

1206
01:43:09,839 --> 01:43:14,143
Give me one second to find my agenda, which is lost in a sea of tabs.

1207
01:43:19,067 --> 01:43:21,189
Because we have other agenda items for tonight.

1208
01:43:34,301 --> 01:43:35,622
Sorry, I make it sorry.

1209
01:43:36,058 --> 01:43:39,399
I have to make a motion to include the flowchart.

1210
01:43:39,559 --> 01:43:40,740
We didn't look at the flowchart.

1211
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:58,186
Can we, can I make a motion that we revisit this plan in the first meeting in September to review a visual flowchart to ensure, yeah, to ensure, I'll write it in the thing.

1212
01:43:59,547 --> 01:44:03,789
Motion to revisit the wing.

1213
01:44:05,302 --> 01:44:08,085
Policy plan to review.

1214
01:44:08,105 --> 01:44:11,068
Sorry to review.

1215
01:44:11,128 --> 01:44:12,109
I'm just typing policy.

1216
01:44:12,209 --> 01:44:14,672
I'm talking to review a visual.

1217
01:44:19,056 --> 01:44:22,298
to assist in accessibility.

1218
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:33,764
Okay, so I'm making a motion to revisit the building policy plan at the first meeting in September to review a visual flow chart to assist in accessibility.

1219
01:44:34,424 --> 01:44:35,405
If I could get a second.

1220
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:47,992
I just, I had a suggestion on this before we maybe make a motion.

1221
01:44:49,875 --> 01:45:07,790
I think I would like to request that our new communications director, Mr. Thomas Dalton, who appears to be on the phone, welcome, Tom, that we ask the administration to actually

1222
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:19,457
take the time to put this flowchart together in a way that is easy to understand and visual and lends itself to being able to be read by a screen reader, etc.

1223
01:45:19,477 --> 01:45:27,803
And that that become a communication piece rather than like the school committee necessarily needing to vote on it.

1224
01:45:27,823 --> 01:45:30,705
I think that's a better precedent for us to set.

1225
01:45:31,165 --> 01:45:32,206
And I think the other thing that

1226
01:45:32,786 --> 01:45:40,451
I'm super sensitive to with flowcharts is I do this work a lot with people and there are lots and lots of people in the world who can't read flowcharts.

1227
01:45:40,772 --> 01:45:42,172
And so you either can or you can't.

1228
01:45:43,233 --> 01:45:44,594
And if you can't, you can't.

1229
01:45:44,714 --> 01:45:47,436
And like, there's just like no, no navigating around that.

1230
01:45:47,456 --> 01:45:52,739
I will also point out that flowcharts are incredibly hard for screen readers to process.

1231
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:58,023
Um, they'd have, it'd have to be extensively all tagged and it would be near impossible to do so.

1232
01:45:58,423 --> 01:46:15,764
There's probably another kind of visual that would lend itself better to that, which I assume that our new communications director would be able to work through in advance and present it to us instead of having us have to discuss how it might happen on the floor.

1233
01:46:16,417 --> 01:46:23,219
Okay, well, I will withdraw the motion and I will ask that the community, welcome, Tom, we haven't met.

1234
01:46:23,999 --> 01:46:36,883
And I will ask that the communication director is part of the conversation around the accessibility meeting that we already made a motion to have at the beginning of the year, both for language and other accessibility.

1235
01:46:36,903 --> 01:46:39,704
So I think that falls into that category, but that doesn't need to be a motion.

1236
01:46:39,764 --> 01:46:40,624
So, okay, thank you.

1237
01:46:41,545 --> 01:46:41,845
Perfect.

1238
01:46:43,825 --> 01:46:46,066
Okay, so I am still,

1239
01:46:46,681 --> 01:46:52,582
I can't believe I am still looking for my agenda, which is literally lost in the abyss of my computer.

1240
01:46:53,082 --> 01:47:04,864
I'm just going to go to the shared drive and pull it from there.

1241
01:47:04,884 --> 01:47:10,125
I don't know how it got so lost.

1242
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:33,306
Where did you send it member Rousseau?

1243
01:47:33,346 --> 01:47:33,807
Your email.

1244
01:47:36,188 --> 01:47:37,108
Oh, see.

1245
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,050
Probably still in the ether.

1246
01:47:43,311 --> 01:47:44,172
Yeah, let me check again.

1247
01:47:44,192 --> 01:47:45,032
Oh, there it is.

01:47:45,052 --> 01:47:45,412
There it is.
