    <p>[hQQ4PYNrfCE_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=452.195s">They</a>  fixed that back in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=454.377s">These</a>  are all new issues that have been opened up in the last week and they're fixed.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=461.858s">We</a>  just had a meeting with the mayor, and Lauren was there giving us an update on the C-Click fix, and it seems like Lauren from the mayor's office is the monitor of the situation, but I'm not sure why something like that was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=474.523s">I</a>  don't know if my colleagues can see the pictures, the streets.</p>

    <p>[hQQ4PYNrfCE_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=478.304s">So</a>  that's the whole street.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=480.145s">That's</a>  the whole street.</p>

    <p>[hQQ4PYNrfCE_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=481.605s">They're</a>  in my driveway, they're in my front yard, they're in my backyard.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=488.248s">That's</a>  my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=489.82s">And</a>  so in March you, you reported the problem that one pothole was fixed, but nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=495.198s">And</a>  then. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=495.889s">There's</a>  been six more complaints, two of yours, four others, and nothing's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=499.731s">They</a>  just were all closed out.</p>

    <p>[hQQ4PYNrfCE_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=501.152s">And</a>  this neighbor is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=503.834s">I</a>  think she's 90, and she said that she's lived there for 62 years, and the street's never been paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=509.197s">And</a>  her husband, who passed away, used to come to this meeting every time that Mr. Notola came. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=515.621s">And</a>  he couldn't get anything done complaining about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=518.622s">He</a>  probably died 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=520.143s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=524.281s">I</a>  think this is the priority when we talk about taking $500,000 out of free cash to do sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=531.705s">I</a>  think streets need to be included in that or we need to take a better look at some of our streets and how they're crumbling and get some of these fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=541.589s">And</a>  obviously Evans Street, for people to report it multiple, multiple times on C-Click Fix and have to come to a council meeting and actually bring rocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=550.776s">We</a>  definitely see a problem, so I definitely move approval to see if we could get an estimate on how much it would cost to repave the street and what the recommendations would be if we weren't to repave the whole street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=565.787s">But</a>  to get some resolve, it's terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=569.83s">I</a>  always say we are being reactive rather than proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=573.095s">in</a>  this situation where you have a broken hip and a broken arm, it doesn't even look like we're being reactive.</p>

    <p>[hQQ4PYNrfCE_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=578.078s">If</a>  that was my daughter that broke her arm, and she rides, she's rollerblading, she learned how to ride her bike, and she's hitting rocks this big, and dumping, and not, you know, not one, she better not be hurt.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=593.153s">Oh,</a>  there's my rock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=594.333s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, that Evans Street be repaved, seconded by Vice President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=602.535s">She</a>  recognizes Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=603.815s">So</a>  much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=605.196s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=607.476s">I</a>  will support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=608.996s">But</a>  I can tell you firsthand, I've supported the last four times we've asked for Evans Street to be repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=616.938s">And</a>  we're still in the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=619.379s">So</a>  I would ask my colleagues tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=621.892s">The</a>  mayor asked for approval of 500,000 for sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=625.895s">We</a>  have over 8 million in free cash that we put contingent upon the 500,000 that Evans Street be repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=633.7s">So</a>  if we make it part of that report, we know Evans Street will be repaved and we won't be getting lip service anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=640.504s">I</a>  would venture to say that Evans Street is probably in the top five worst streets in the entire city without any hesitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=649.09s">And</a>  it's getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=650.618s">And</a>  pothole patrol is really not what's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=653.919s">You</a>  need a whole new grind down and repaving of the entire street curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=659.161s">So</a>  I would ask that my fellow colleagues, I'll be more than happy to put that forward when we discuss the paper for $500,000 for sidewalks, that Evans Street, Pinkett Street is probably the second worst street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=672.426s">So</a>  it's right next door to Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=674.967s">Then</a>  you have Wicklow, you have Pleasant Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=677.488s">I</a>  mean, you can go down the list of streets that are in <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=679.813s">deplorable</a>  condition, but these residents have had to deal with the street for long enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=685.435s">It's</a>  a public safety concern when you drive down the street, you kick up rocks, which is a very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=693.239s">And,</a>  you know, I think that's probably the best way of doing it because just merely another recommendation from this council is going to fall with the other four or five recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=705.724s">So</a>  I would ask that we put that on the paper that's a little further on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=710.288s">On</a>  the motion for approval, Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=715.789s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=716.729s">I</a>  appreciate the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=718.25s">I</a>  did come out yesterday and walk the streets with a couple of your neighbors, and it is horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=725.311s">I</a>  mean, I concur with my colleagues in the fact that one of the neighbors told me that she was bringing her groceries in about a year ago, and when she came back out, her back tire was gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=738.227s">because</a>  it was eaten by the sewer cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=742.128s">So</a>  that is a dangerous street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=746.249s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=748.23s">But</a>  we do have, I know that the mayor announced tonight that we were graded, I believe, a 99 on the open streets grant process to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=760.273s">So</a>  obviously there's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=761.914s">I,</a>  as one, will really push for the Evans Street <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=767.698s">resurfacing</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=769.919s">That's</a>  not a pothole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=772.72s">This</a>  is a whole resurfacing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=774.22s">And</a>  I think that Lauren did do her job by closing out that pothole, but understanding that Evans Street isn't a pothole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=783.503s">It's</a>  the whole street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=784.863s">So,</a>  thank you again.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=787.324s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=787.764s">So,</a>  on the motion for approval, I second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=789.945s">I</a>  see that, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=792.766s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=793.626s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=795.426s">Robert</a>  Cappucci of 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=798.248s">So,</a>  I mean, just a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=800.329s">When</a>  you say that Lauren did her job, there have been, going back a couple years now, reports to the city about this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=813.174s">It</a>  spills out into Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=816.035s">These</a>  rocks are in front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=818.796s">They're</a>  on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=822.898s">My</a>  question, I guess, is will we get a time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=828.173s">of</a>  when this will be done, because it is the summertime now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=832.275s">Kids</a>  are out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=833.516s">They're</a>  going to be all over that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=835.417s">It's</a>  only a matter of time before a tire spins one of these up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=839.379s">I</a>  mean, we've already had injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=842.16s">With</a>  all due respect, Mr. President, is there any way we can get some type of time frame on when to expect this street to be fixed?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=852.525s">I</a>  do not know the answer to the question, but I'm sure Councilor Scarpelli <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=857.054s">might</a>  add an amendment to his resolution that we ask for a timeframe on this when we place the question to the mayor's office.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=867.601s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=869.362s">I</a>  mean, when, you know, when we consider the surplus amounts completion of the project, uh, be a reported back to the council as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=879.269s">When</a>  we consider the surplus amounts in city coffers and you know, we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=884.857s">an</a>  endless list of taxes to be paid, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=888.3s">And</a>  no disrespect to this body, but this is—it's an abomination. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=895.726s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=896.466s">And</a>  the amount of money that we pay as residents and taxpayers, that this wasn't done two years ago when you were first informed of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=906.274s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=907.435s">Thank</a>  you very much, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=910.022s">Welcome,</a>  please state your name and address for the record, sir.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=912.844s">John</a>  Sorello, 20 Metcalf Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=916.707s">Mr.</a>  President, this is not an Evans Street problem, this is a citywide problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=921.45s">And</a>  as a matter of fact, I was shocked to learn how many public safety departments are understaffed in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=929.238s">And</a>  it was never brought up in the recent committee of the whole meeting with the mayor just a little while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=938.801s">And</a>  what it comes down to, I was shocked to learn that the Department of DPW, Public Works, has only 17 staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=950.965s">How</a>  could that be? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=951.965s">In</a>  a city the size of Medford, it should not be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=954.966s">Now,</a>  this is really a public safety problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=958.536s">And,</a>  and this, I think this department is really second to the police and the, uh, fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=965.02s">So</a>  this is what should be brought up when you have a discussion about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=970.783s">I</a>  mean, the whole council should go before the mayor and negotiate with the mayor to have these staffs improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=977.547s">I'm</a>  surprised to learn for instance, the police department is short, uh, 30 offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=983.811s">How</a>  could that be in the city side? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=985.772s">This</a>  is the first, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=987.711s">priority.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=989.793s">Is</a>  that redundant? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=990.573s">First</a>  priority? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=992.315s">Anyway,</a>  this is the first priority of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=997.879s">That's</a>  the reason we have government is for public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1001.262s">So</a>  this council should not pass a budget until it is agreed that public safety will be improved in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1009.608s">And</a>  we should have a Department of Public Works can deal with all of these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1013.611s">We</a>  have problems with sidewalks, with tree stumps, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1017.421s">with</a>  potholes, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1021.022s">So</a>  this should be dealt with, and this is the city council's great opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1031.664s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1033.365s">Just</a>  a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1034.505s">I</a>  think when Dr. Starello referred to 17 employees in the Department of Public Works, he was referring to 17 employees that were just exclusively assigned to the highway division. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1043.827s">But,</a>  Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to request <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1046.757s">that</a>  the matter be referred to the administration for inclusion in the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1051.581s">We</a>  just met with the mayor's office this morning, and they said that they're in the process of putting together a capital budget and a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1057.065s">And</a>  this is a capital expenditure, Mr. President, so I'd ask that they also put this on their list of items to add to the capital plan.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1066.952s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1067.853s">Mr.</a>  President, would it be possible to send the DPW down there tomorrow morning to put a temporary patch on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1075.003s">Obviously,</a>  the streets are not going to get paid tomorrow, but in the meantime... Point of information, Councilor Scott Pally. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1081.268s">Unless</a>  they do the whole street, it's really not a patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1083.65s">I</a>  mean, if they get on there, at least fill it on a temporary basis.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1089.135s">I</a>  think the big potholes they did, but walking with it yesterday, just... Well, it's abundantly clear to all of us that the streets are a hazard to everybody who lives there and drives on it, and it needs to be repaid, and it's been needing to be repaid for a decade.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1103.73s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1105.191s">Rob</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1107.732s">Maybe</a>  if they could come by and pick up all these loose rocks that are, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1113.175s">But</a>  if this gets added to the mayor's capital plan, what does that do in terms of a timeframe of fixing this street? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1120.578s">I</a>  mean, when do they meet on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1121.959s">When</a>  is that discussed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1123.32s">When</a>  is that approved?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1124.18s">Point</a>  of clarification, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1126.841s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks hit the nail on the head with regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1130.834s">that</a>  $500,000 free cash expenditure, associating this, Evans Street, making a condition of that, because the capital plan, the budget director, the mayor said it wouldn't be until they hire a budget director, which would be end of summer, fall, is when the capital plan would even be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1150.342s">So</a>  that would push it out a year or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1152.723s">So</a>  I think, too, if we can get councillors to condition Evans Street <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1157.176s">on</a>  that $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1157.796s">This</a>  is exactly why we wanted a list of the $500,000, how it was going to be spent, so that we know streets like Evans or sidewalks that are in complete disrepair are the ones that are going to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1168.86s">And</a>  I think Mr. Cairns, who's the DPW director, is getting a copy of the list for us as we speak, so we can possibly bring that up later tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1176.402s">If</a>  not, hopefully by next week.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1178.593s">So</a>  then my next question would be, knowing this, why would a councillor request to put this on the capital plan that's going to push it out another year or two? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1188.458s">It's</a>  unprecedented.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1191.439s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1193.48s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't feel as though we should be making one project contingent upon another. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1197.582s">Two</a>  weeks ago, we sat here and we talked about sidewalks, and there's a dire need for us to repair our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1202.184s">Last</a>  week, we talked about sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1203.605s">We</a>  talked about how there was a dire need to repair our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1206.279s">There's</a>  certainly a dire need to repair many of our streets, Evans Street being one of them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1210.561s">But</a>  I don't feel as though holding one construction project hostage and make it contingent upon another is a good policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1217.144s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1218.084s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1219.725s">I</a>  think one of the reasons that was brought up last week, the reason why we need new sidewalks is public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1225.007s">So</a>  we can have all the great sidewalks we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1227.629s">And</a>  then when a resident steps in the street into a six inch pothole line throughout the street, that's a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1235.439s">I</a>  think we have to address them when we see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1237.78s">And</a>  this has definitely been an issue for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1240.842s">The</a>  council president mentioned a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1242.943s">I</a>  think this is the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1243.964s">This,</a>  this is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1246.105s">This,</a>  this isn't something a wishlist would say out of the street, but like they haven't repaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1250.027s">This</a>  is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1251.708s">Um,</a>  and I, I did the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1253.209s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli did. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1254.589s">I</a>  took a walk around the neighborhood and this street, I'd venture to say is one of the top five in the city of worst streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1261.562s">So</a>  you can imagine the condition it's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1263.203s">So</a>  we have a motion of approval on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1265.844s">But</a>  I'm going to do it during, as Councilor Longo said, during that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1268.825s">People</a>  want to vote for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1269.926s">If</a>  not, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1271.007s">But</a>  the money's there, and the need is definitely there on this particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1275.489s">And</a>  residents have been waiting a long time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1277.29s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilors Lungo-Koehn, and Councilor Knight, all those in, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[hFAk--zIv7g_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1287.594s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, yes.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1293.298s">The</a>  amendment was to have Councilor Scarpelli ask that we have a time frame attached to that and vice-president Yeah, resurface the street have a time frame and vice-president Lungo-Koehn had the amendment to Cost estimate on that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1317.401s">And</a>  those were the two amendments to the main motion and yours was that it be added to the mayor's capital plan council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1327.384s">So</a>  on that motion, madam. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1333.746s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1516.908s">Correct,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1517.368s">This</a>  is on Cabot Road, the Mill Creek project, the residential project with the above ground parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1522.85s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1523.79s">Can</a>  you tell us about the scope of the project and what type of project it is?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1528.751s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1529.572s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1531.732s">The</a>  project is approximately 297 residential unit project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1536.393s">It</a>  does have 10% affordable units that will be set aside and allocated to a lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1542.584s">There</a>  are, as Council President read into the record, approximately 579 parking spaces in the parking garage of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1550.251s">So</a>  we're here for the gasoline in the tanks of those cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1554.154s">No</a>  underground storage tanks or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1558.317s">I</a>  did receive <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1559.965s">from</a>  the city clerk's office, the sign-offs from the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1564.748s">I</a>  can submit those into the record if those are not in your packages, but we did receive no substantive comments from the town boards on the application.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1580.277s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1582.759s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1583.739s">If</a>  you, I know in our packet has like a description of the site, so you have the two lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1588.822s">And</a>  then the project site is going to be separate than the garage? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1592.863s">Or</a>  are we building on top of the garage?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1596.164s">So</a>  we're not building on top of the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1598.544s">Actually,</a>  the building is going to wrap around the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1600.685s">So</a>  you won't be able to see the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1602.085s">One</a>  of the real benefits in the project is there's a nice open space, a nice park along the river that the project's going to enhance. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1609.706s">So</a>  what we're doing is wrapping the parking garage with the building so you won't see it when you're outside of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1615.308s">But</a>  no construction on top of it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1617.509s">And</a>  with regards to distances between the lot and the actual units, is there a decent, what's the distance between the lots and the, you know, the lot and the unit when you are talking about that much gasoline?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1630.498s">I</a>  just. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1633.38s">I</a>  do have to move with the project architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1634.961s">That</a>  might be a question for Mr. Carr.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1636.242s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1638.203s">Doug</a>  Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1641.136s">Your</a>  question is a good one, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1642.377s">There's</a>  a firewall around the entire garage, separating the residential use from the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1648.579s">The</a>  garage is fully sprinkled. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1650.34s">Fire</a>  Chief and all the people in this building have signed off on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1653.161s">As</a>  you know, it's under construction, but it's a very good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1656.722s">And</a>  as I mentioned before, I think that's, well, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1662.584s">Let</a>  me know if you have any further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1664.245s">I'm</a>  happy to answer them for you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1665.605s">So</a>  when you say firewall, if there was an explosion in the garage, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1670.24s">the</a>  apartments would be safe, so there's an actual wall, or are you talking about the space?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1675.022s">There's</a>  actually a concrete wall, and then there's actually a separate wall, separated from it, where the residents begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1682.004s">So</a>  it's standard construction for when you put a residential building against a parking garage.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1689.607s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1689.827s">Thank</a>  you, Doug. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1690.307s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1940.225s">Mr.</a>  President, I've reviewed the documents and I find it to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1943.187s">I'm</a>  very happy to see that you are going to be paving crib to crib, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1948.091s">Yes,</a>  I believe, Councilor, that that's gonna be worked out with the City Engineering Office in terms of a contribution that's gonna be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1957.039s">I</a>  believe that this is... <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1959.592s">Our</a>  work is in response to paving that's happening on, I believe, on the side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1964.734s">And</a>  so we're going to work with the engineering office to have them all paved at one at the same time after our work is completed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1975.799s">Provided</a>  that everything is done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1977.82s">Mr.</a>  President, I have a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1979.981s">The</a>  motion approved by Councilor Cavillo. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1981.602s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1983.383s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1986.704s">I</a>  believe you said working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1988.365s">Is</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1989.5s">So</a>  it's not definite that that's part of the, is that read into the, as an agreement?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1997.306s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2000.048s">Sorry,</a>  I might have misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2003.071s">I</a>  meant more that once our work with the project is complete, that that will be what happens.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2009.576s">I</a>  think that one of the biggest concerns are the questions from residents when the utilities do come in and they're supposed to lay <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2018.571s">the</a>  compact and make sure that it's left the way that they found it, that some of the areas in the community are still sinking now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2028.62s">Can</a>  we put an amendment to that to make sure that there's a certain timeline involved with the engineering department to give us help with the timeline, that if that does happen, that there's coverage? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2044.754s">So</a>  you'd like an amendment to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2047.093s">that</a>  there's a certain timeline allowed that if that, if this sinkage, that the, the, the department comes back to resurface that.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2058.221s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2059.261s">So,</a>  uh, in, I think, uh, by way of ordinance, there's a year, if I'm not mistaken, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2065.485s">Uh,</a>  Mr. Chairman, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2069.028s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2070.029s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2070.869s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2071.95s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2072.999s">Roughly,</a>  how long will this job take and when will the work be performed?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2078.521s">The</a>  work will be performed in the near to immediate future. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2083.183s">I</a>  believe that this is one of our next projects that we have scheduled for this summer, early this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2090.886s">Work</a>  will probably be commencing, I imagine, in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2093.927s">And</a>  it will typically take, due to the high traffic area, high street, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2101.027s">This</a>  project may take roughly one to two months.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2106.369s">One</a>  to two months? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2107.029s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2108.009s">And</a>  what time of the day will it be done?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2110.51s">Our</a>  typical work hours are between 7 to 3.30, but typically we work with the city depending on if there's traffic concerns and we have to work restricted hours in certain locations.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2125.253s">So</a>  you've worked with the police department already? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2128.115s">Because</a>  this is definitely a high-traveled area.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2131.077s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2134.099s">I</a>  don't believe we've reached out to the police department quite yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2140.264s">I</a>  believe we were going to wait from how the grant of vocation hearing came from this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2147.449s">And</a>  then we are going to then line up to talk with the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2153.813s">the</a>  police department in terms of details.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2157.595s">Mr.</a>  President, maybe at some point there should be a paper added to these reports dealing with traffic impact like we do for many other things in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2168.239s">And</a>  that may be helpful to see if there is going to be an alternate route that, you know, depending on the type of work and also what manpower is needed to protect the residents of this community around the construction area. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2183.74s">I'm</a>  not sure when we can discuss that, or maybe if it's a public safety subcommittee can discuss that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2189.821s">But</a>  I think it's an important issue, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2191.141s">The</a>  President Thank you, Counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2193.382s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2194.542s">Mr.</a>  Knight Mr. President, I think Counsel Knox took the words right out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2198.063s">A</a>  traffic management plan is something that I think we're going to need to start requiring when we start allowing public utilities to open up the ground, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2206.284s">And</a>  looking at this particular paper, I'm happy to see that the work is going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2211.182s">done</a>  from curb to curb, and I believe that this is done under a program, I think it's called SRFO or SROF, where the public utility actually gives the city the money, and then the city's responsible for going curb to curb, and the utility's actually going to get out of the pavement business and allow the city to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2226.507s">So</a>  that I'm very excited about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2228.229s">And</a>  that's also something I think we really need to take a long, hot look at and make standard on. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2231.972s">You</a>  know, we have the residents from Evans Street here talking about how patchwork repairs in the street have created a situation that they're in now where the place is falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2239.499s">And</a>  I think that as we move forward and we start opening streets up, we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2243.842s">really</a>  consider going curb-to-curb in the closing up of our streets when the work is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2248.524s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, provided that the public safety impact around our school is going to be addressed, I certainly have no problem with the paper.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2259.65s">Councilor</a>  Carfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2261.471s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2262.692s">And</a>  that was one thing I wanted to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2264.172s">You</a>  know that it would be advantageous to have this done before September when school starts because that pretty much is right almost in front of the school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2272.144s">Oh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2272.404s">Councilor,</a>  that, that, that will definitely happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2274.445s">Um,</a>  we are on a timetable because we, we will have to have our work complete in order for this, uh, for the, the street to be repaved at this, um, this fiscal year as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2285.228s">Mr.</a>  President, a motion of approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2287.629s">Motion</a>  approved by Councilor Caffiello.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2289.709s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2290.629s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2291.73s">Uh,</a>  through you to, uh, well actually Councilor Knight mentioned something earlier, but you know, uh, National Grid getting out of the paving business. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2298.812s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2300.265s">which</a>  is a good point, if they're giving the money to the city to actually pave the ground, pave the new road curb to curb, what happens in a case where Councilor Scarpelli mentioned the streets begins to sag? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2313.15s">Who's</a>  on the hook for it then? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2314.19s">Is</a>  that this national grid, you know, are they on the hook to foot the bill again or is that up to the city at that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2323.433s">And</a>  I'm not sure if anybody knows the answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2325.274s">Maybe</a>  that's a question that goes out to the city engineer, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2329.341s">I</a>  mean, I think that that's something, that's a question that needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2332.522s">I</a>  mean, if National Grid's trying to get out of the paving business, which I understand, and it is curb to curb, I think it's an important question to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2342.384s">Because</a>  a lot of these things do sag.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2344.285s">I</a>  cannot offer any amendments because I'm chairing the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2349.766s">But</a>  if I were on the floor, my amendment would be have the city engineer <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2355.475s">be</a>  prepared to explain all these matters to us at our budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2359.917s">Rather</a>  than torment her over the expense of money that we spend on rubber jackets for the men.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2367.96s">If</a>  we could amend the paper then to actually have the city engineer report back to us to find out who is responsible for the additional costs if the road does begin to sag after we've received the funding from national grid.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2385.082s">If</a>  I could speak to that briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2389.223s">Typically,</a>  if it's determined by the city engineer and National Grid agrees that it's a fault of our own trench, that there is settlement issues following the paving, then that would be something that National Grid would cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2406.75s">We</a>  guarantee all our trenches. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2411.888s">especially</a>  immediately following the repaving of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2415.469s">So</a>  that would be something that National Grid would cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2417.85s">But</a>  if it turned out to be a fault of the paving contractor or something where there was an issue with the pavement that was put down, that would be something that National Grid would not be looking to cover.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2433.234s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2433.634s">That's</a>  one of my main concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2434.635s">I</a>  mean, this is a problem throughout the city where, you know, time goes by. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2440.297s">if</a>  we know what it sags into the ground, if we know you have potholes and you have a whole street falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2445.039s">So,</a>  um, yeah, I think it's something that we need to have addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2448.401s">And</a>  if we could have the, uh, city engineer, uh, come back to us with a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2452.203s">I</a>  greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2453.444s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2987.509s">I'm</a>  not used to this mic, so do I sound all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2991.512s">I</a>  live at 158 Jerome Street, and I'm here to discuss Medford infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2998.277s">Evans</a>  Street was one of the topics of my conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3001.1s">I</a>  know you just mentioned resurfacing that road, but it's also going to need a new gas main and most probably a new water main before you can resurface it because nobody's been around there in 68 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3014.478s">So</a>  you should consider that as part of your schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3018.741s">So</a>  I just want to read my petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3020.762s">I've</a>  been trying to contact the mayor's office regarding infrastructure since January 1, and she hasn't responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3027.526s">So</a>  I have all the documentation over here, which I want to leave with the council as part of the official record. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3034.67s">And</a>  for now, I'm going to read my petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3038.532s">First,</a>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the brave men and women of our armed services <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3043.97s">including</a>  the police, for protecting our cherished

seven months worth of correspondence, and numerous calls to her office which have been completely ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3088.107s">Having</a>  worked for the engineering department last summer for five months, I have some major concerns regarding improvements to Medford infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3097.236s">And</a>  now I'm going to read <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3099.545s">The</a>  petition, it's actually in a petition format. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3101.827s">It</a>  wasn't sent to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3103.048s">I'm</a>  going to read it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3105.53s">Whereas</a>  numerous roadways in Medford are in disrepair, water mains are in need of replacement, drainage and sewer systems are in need of work, numerous neighborhoods have been waiting for years for promised improvements yet to materialize. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3121.464s">Whereas</a>  close to $10 million of state funds are available for this work, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3126.648s">whereas</a>  the citizens and taxpayers of Medford have a right to know how our tax money is being spent, whereas you made commitments in your campaign to openness, transparency, communication, accountability, and performance, whereas you state on your website you have completed budget reviews for all departments, whereas Water Project's plans for construction as far back as 2014 have not started yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3155.274s">This</a>  would indicate that other streets needing work, such as Evans, are simply added to the backlog. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3162.058s">So</a>  projects removing inflow and infiltration have been put on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3168.261s">We,</a>  the citizens of Medford, request the complete inventory of all engineering department projects in planning, out for bid, and under construction with a status and budget summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3182.089s">So</a>  water. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3184.252s">It</a>  is imperative that Medford complete essential water main replacement work this construction season, and it is already very late to get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3193.72s">Our</a>  streets such as Gurley, Dwyer, Evans could have been done last year, but the engineering department said they did not have the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3203.968s">This</a>  does not match the posted water main repair allocations for cities and towns on the MWRA website. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3212.562s">which</a>  indicates that they have $4 million available for water main repair, which hasn't been used. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3221.426s">As</a>  a matter of fact, it's a 10-year allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3225.068s">We're</a>  starting year seven of this $7 million 10-year allocation, and we haven't spent a penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3235.133s">So</a>  that's water. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3238.261s">Sewer</a>  is more or less similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3240.383s">Preventing</a>  sewer inflow and infiltration into the system and upkeep is an ongoing effort for any municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3250.07s">The</a>  city engineer stated the department is not interested in pursuing this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3256.274s">The</a>  current unused MWRA I&I allocation for Medford is now near $4 million at 75% grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3268.438s">Misusing</a>  or not using these funds is an extreme disservice to Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3273.701s">Please</a>  explain the status of this account and the ongoing efforts to improve the sewer systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3280.344s">Now</a>  roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3283.205s">Many</a>  roadways are in need of repair and we have received another $1 million of Chapter 90 for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3290.449s">What</a>  is the status of the roadway repair plans? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3294.931s">Evans</a>  should have been done last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3298.388s">but</a>  it's still not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3300.85s">The</a>  city has applied for $400,000 of state funding for sidewalk repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3307.014s">How</a>  will this effort be implemented? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3310.457s">Not</a>  to complete essential projects this season aggressively is not in keeping with the mission of City Hall or the performance and accountability standards the citizenry deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3322.586s">Another</a>  construction season is here, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3324.952s">and</a>  we cannot afford more lost opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3333.235s">And</a>  that was the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3337.276s">So</a>  now, I would like to submit the body of correspondence from me to the mayor's office, which I consider public, to be included in the city council official records. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3351.081s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3352.181s">Here,</a>  take this with you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3358.851s">Yeah,</a>  which I consider public to be included in the city council official records, hopefully part of this meeting records. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3365.656s">I</a>  know there's a lot of paper over there, but computers have a lot of storage these days, so it's no big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3373.501s">To</a>  be included in city council official records so the general public may have access to this information regarding city of Medford engineering and construction policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3384.018s">I</a>  hope this information will help Medford residents and I get real and deliberate answers from the mayor's office regarding these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3393.903s">I</a>  am here to petition for a meeting with the mayor to discuss her construction implementation plans for this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3402.807s">So</a>  in summary, the engineering department stated last summer they did not have the budget to do water main replacement, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3411.598s">on</a>  Gurley, Dwyer, or Evans Street, which I was pushing for, because they need to be reconstructed, and you can't reconstruct them unless the water main has been fixed first. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3423.305s">Otherwise,</a>  you ruin your paving job. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3428.928s">So</a>  the MWRA site indicates they have $4 million available for this water work for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3437.472s">The</a>  engineering department stated they were not interested in pursuing I&I sewer work while Medford had $3 million in the MWRA account at 75% grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3451.882s">We</a>  are applying for $400,000 of state funds for sidewalk repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3461.669s">With</a>  limited resources to implement this program, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3467.31s">Why</a>  hasn't construction started yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3469.551s">Our</a>  season is flying by and it appears we are not prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3472.773s">And</a>  so my offer to the mayor, in the correspondence you'll see I have numerous offers and suggestions to the mayor trying to push all of this infrastructure work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3489.621s">My</a>  offer to the mayor outlines what I think is a creative way for the engineering department to get needed help paid for by state, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3497.465s">and</a>  not city tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3500.046s">It's</a>  included in the package. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3501.987s">This</a>  is a freebie and a windfall for the city, and I still can't get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3509.31s">These</a>  are some of my observations and concerns, which are critical, especially when the engineering department and DPW say they are not interested in speaking to me, and the mayor hasn't released these budgets yet anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3525.198s">Could</a>  this be true? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3526.727s">So</a>  let me read that again, because it confused me.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3529.668s">Sir,</a>  you have one minute left.</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3531.389s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3532.349s">I</a>  encourage everyone who cares to read the backup material I have provided to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3539.771s">I</a>  hope you members of the City Council also take the initiative to read the material. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3545.093s">It</a>  will provide an insight into how decisions are made at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3549.635s">General</a>  public, please feel free to contact me with questions, concerns, or ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3556.542s">My</a>  information, my contact information is on the documentation I have submitted and hopefully the general public will be able to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3567.667s">Once</a>  again, I'm here to petition for a meeting with the mayor to discuss her construction implementation plans for this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3577.392s">Thanks</a>  again for the opportunity to speak before city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3581.694s">Sincerely,</a>  Eric. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3584.736s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Reed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3585.975s">May</a>  I chair recognizes Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3588.496s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3588.856s">Eric,</a>  if you don't mind, through the chair, you said you worked for the city of Medford?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3593.777s">I</a>  worked as a temp last summer for five months.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3598.278s">And</a>  what was your, what title position did you hold?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3601.339s">Engineer.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3601.759s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3606.42s">And</a>  we accomplished quite a bit last summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3608.701s">I</a>  started off doing the pothole repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3611.381s">We</a>  went off, moved on to sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3614.831s">I</a>  did a lot of the running around, all the measuring to get all these streets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3619.155s">I</a>  measured all of those streets up, got them ready for paving, and I did the drainage work over there at Boston Ave and Arlington and Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3634.13s">So</a>  I got quite a chunk done, and then I was let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3640.44s">And</a>  if you look at all the proposals I actually applied, you know, I offered to help engineering, and I had an outline to get all this street work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3649.387s">And</a>  I was constantly told that they're not interested in doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3652.089s">So</a>  here I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3654.03s">I</a>  still, it doesn't seem reasonable to me that that would be the answer, an appropriate answer from City Hall, that we have all this money, we have streets falling apart like Evans, and we're told that we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3670.988s">They're</a>  not interested in doing that work, that they don't have the budget when MWRA website clearly indicates that we have plenty of money there to do the work.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3682.193s">And</a>  when you had mentioned the $3 to $4 million with the 75% grant for sewer and then $4 million for water, so that's about $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3692.083s">in</a>  the MWRA that we could be applying for? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3694.326s">Is</a>  that what you mean?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3694.867s">Absolutely,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3696.689s">I</a>  asked these questions of the mayor's office, and when I didn't get any response, I went on Google, and it all came right up.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3707.421s">And</a>  these are the 0% loans or full grants?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3710.462s">Well,</a>  they vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3711.463s">I</a>  mean, I don't know what the conditions are on the water, but it's very generous terms, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3717.265s">But</a>  I know on the I&I, it's 75% grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3720.186s">You</a>  can't beat that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3723.327s">No,</a>  I thank you for your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3724.528s">I</a>  know probably Councilman Maxwell will talk about the inflow infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3728.249s">I</a>  know we have some serious work that needs to be done in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3731.79s">And</a>  we did grill the city engineer last budget</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3737.262s">Well,</a>  you know, I was, I was working on removing, uh, I and I three cash basins from, uh, a sewer line on, uh, what's that street called? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3747.507s">Right</a>  next to golden. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3748.487s">I</a>  forgot the name of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3750.328s">It's</a>  by, uh, McCarthy storage, Alexander or Frederick. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3755.35s">Uh,</a>  anyway, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3757.872s">It's</a>  the street down there full. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3762.054s">No,</a>  it's right next to golden. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3763.354s">It's</a>  between Harvard and golden. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3765.606s">I</a>  forget the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3766.266s">It's</a>  the, so anyway, we're working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3770.848s">And</a>  even that was stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3773.349s">There's</a>  a whole bunch of stuff we could have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3775.27s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3775.89s">I</a>  don't want to talk too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3776.951s">I</a>  don't want to take up too much of your time, but these are issues which I would hope people consider seriously because as you can see, they're starting to impact Medford residents in a public safety manner.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3790.597s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3791.477s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3791.917s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3793.905s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3794.706s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could, um, forward this paper to the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3799.349s">On</a>  the motion for Councilor Caraviello to forward the paper to the city engineer for commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3804.834s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3806.995s">And</a>  also, uh, to discuss an implementation plan with the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3812.74s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3814.061s">Uh,</a>  and thank you, Mr. Reed, for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3816.703s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3817.528s">I'd</a>  like to hear a little more about what your thoughts are or reasoning why, if there's funding available from the MWRA, what is the biggest hurdle in this city to not moving forward on some of these projects that are so much needed in this community?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3834.541s">You</a>  know, I've got to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3836.943s">I'm</a>  trying to get answers to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3838.965s">I</a>  can't get any reasonable answers, but from my perspective, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3842.765s">We</a>  had Gurley Dwyer and Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3845.066s">I</a>  was pushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3845.766s">They</a>  were slated. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3846.426s">All</a>  the documentation was on my computer, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3849.387s">We</a>  would have pushed them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3852.187s">I</a>  was into budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3853.188s">I</a>  was into working. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3857.169s">And</a>  so I don't know why that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3858.589s">I</a>  really have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3860.349s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense to me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3862.79s">Is</a>  it a lack of manpower? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3864.49s">Is</a>  it a lack of leadership?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3865.391s">Well,</a>  right now, clearly there's a lack.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3867.331s">I</a>  mean, it has to be something. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3868.451s">You</a>  were in the department for five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3870.771s">You</a>  must have some indication why.</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3872.232s">There's</a>  no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3873.353s">No</a>  communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3874.474s">I</a>  went out and did everything on my own initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3876.476s">I</a>  worked very well with Mark Shea, who is very good with field work and on the construction side. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3887.045s">I</a>  think we got a lot done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3890.207s">But</a>  as far as policy goes, I have no idea what the thought process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3896.432s">I'm</a>  trying to figure that out myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3899.692s">You</a>  know, I was shocked to find that the money was sitting there in such large sums recently after being told last summer that we didn't have budget to do a mountain of work that I was proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3911.495s">And</a>  if you read the documentation carefully, hopefully you'll be able to scan it and put it online, you'll see that there just <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3923.72s">leaves</a>  big questions, not good questions, very big questions.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3927.702s">So</a>  ultimately, in the engineer's office, who would be responsible for making sure that Medford takes advantage of these particular loans and grants from the MWRA?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3938.849s">Well,</a>  as an engineer, from my perspective, it's the responsibility of the engineering department to track <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3946.934s">the</a>  condition of Medford infrastructure, and make prioritized repairs, prepare the plans, prepare the design.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3955.177s">Who</a>  in particular?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3956.258s">It</a>  would have to be the leadership of the department.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3959.119s">So</a>  the chief engineer would be responsible?</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3961.58s">Well,</a>  technically, well, in any department, the leader obviously would define the mission.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3967.862s">I'm</a>  just going to caution that we not move to impugn anyone.</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3971.584s">Exactly,</a>  that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3973.329s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3974.19s">Well,</a>  you've made a lot of accusations, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3977.574s">So,</a>  you know, I don't think it's fair to... Budgets are budgets.</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3981.919s">I'm</a>  not accusing anybody.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3983.2s">No,</a>  you're not accusing, but when I'm asking the questions on where has there been a lack of communication and where is the process failed, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3992.722s">I</a>  mean, I think those are legit questions, and you were there for five months, and that's why I'm asking these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=3998.544s">Who</a>  would know best than someone that worked in the department? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4001.485s">And</a>  if there is funding available, and we were told on many occasions, because as you mentioned, Mr. Reed, that many of these grants and programs that are run by the MWRA are lengthy in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4014.51s">And</a>  if you don't take advantage in one year, you can actually take advantage the following year on projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4020.782s">as</a>  long as you have a plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4023.123s">So</a>  I've been told in the past that the city of Medford has exhausted all the revenue or funds, I should say, available from the MWRA and even the zero interest free loans that are, I think, outside of what you've discussed regarding what's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4043.787s">So</a>  I'm very concerned that if there is funding that the city is not taking advantage <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4049.781s">This</a>  council has talked ad nauseam about INI. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4053.983s">I</a>  think we're at about 50% inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4057.025s">It's</a>  costing the rate payers that pay water and sewer in this community millions of dollars to pay for inflow and infiltration and treat it as raw sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4068.131s">The</a>  leak detection program is another issue that we've had in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4072.514s">And</a>  so I'm very concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4075.135s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4076.476s">I</a>  think this paper should be forwarded to <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4078.924s">the</a>  city engineer for response. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4081.206s">Um,</a>  and also if need be that, uh, the mayor get involved, uh, to find out, uh, why we're not moving forward on projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4089.451s">Uh,</a>  if, if that is the case that Evans street, uh, you were working on a project on Evans street for the water main back some time ago, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4097.637s">It</a>  wouldn't make any sense for this council to approve the repaving of Evans street if the water main wasn't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4103.321s">So</a>  that's the first I'm hearing.</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4105.72s">Well,</a>  this is why I was trying to push so hard, because recognizing that it takes a year to get good settlement, you know, like your problem, the gas company, we don't want our water mains to do the same thing, have trench settlement. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4119.362s">So</a>  the idea is to get the water main done the year prior and then move in next year and do the roadway repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4125.304s">You</a>  know, you've got to remind the gas company they've got to jump on Evans Street too. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4131.485s">And</a>  that's how normally it's done, but now we're <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4134.615s">and</a>  everything's pushed out another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4136.256s">Water</a>  main wasn't done last year, so now what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4139.036s">They</a>  gotta wait another year for the roadway to get done? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4143.718s">That's</a>  where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4144.718s">That's</a>  basically where we're at.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4146.279s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4147.239s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4148.559s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello, that this paper be forwarded to the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4155.341s">Madam</a>  Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4156.201s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4156.421s">Just</a>  as an amendment, if we could get a response also from the mayor's office with regards to that package. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4162.293s">And</a>  if we can be scanned the documents, I know we can go to the city clerk and get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4166.294s">But</a>  if the council could be scanned, um, what you had given us so that we can review it at our own leisure at home, the entire packet was sent to us in our weekend packets on Friday.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4180.478s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4180.898s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4181.878s">On</a>  that emotion of a amendment by vice-president long occur, sir, please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4189.003s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4190.304s">Robert</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4194.047s">Just</a>  to address some of the things that were talked about here, I don't think Mr. Reid was coming up here to try to be accusatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4201.813s">I</a>  just think he was asking for accountability and transparency on issues that have been going on in the city of Medford for years, if not decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4212.281s">When</a>  I ran for this body in 2013, my main issue was the water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4217.923s">You're</a>  asking the citizens of Medford to pay for the rainwater in the snow melt. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4223.107s">You</a>  add that to the meals tax, the sales tax, the property tax, which is about to have a surcharge put on it, and we want answers as to why things are not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4232.895s">The</a>  Honorable Mike Marks asks, well, where do you think that the lack of communication came? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4238.96s">Well,</a>  you heard my neighbor and friend earlier tonight say four recent <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4245.878s">additions</a>  to C-Click Fix were taken down today as resolved, and obviously they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4251.819s">Those</a>  pictures I took were yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4253.78s">This</a>  gentleman is talking about a state allocation of $4 million that we could be using on top of what is in the excess of the water account now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4263.942s">It's</a>  like $7 million or something like that was the last report I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4268.523s">Now</a>  we're talking about $10 or $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4272.453s">It</a>  doesn't need to be discussed or pushed forward anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4276.255s">It's</a>  not just Devon Street, it's also Pinkard Street around the corner from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4281.878s">In</a>  working on several campaigns that I've worked on and ballot initiatives, walking around the city through the Heights, through South Medford, it's literally the whole city, with some streets being at an emergency condition, with matters of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4299.253s">we're</a>  asking questions about all the tax dollars that we pay and the fees that we pay, the parking meters, people paying after six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4307.68s">I</a>  mean, where is all this money going? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4311.183s">I</a>  think it's not being done because it looks great sitting in the accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4316.267s">And</a>  then Medford elected public servants can go around and say, well, Moody's just upgraded our credit rating to AAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4326.476s">And</a>  yeah, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4329.08s">on</a>  paper, but when you look through and walk through the city and you're wondering why communications are going ignored from people who work for the city, and you ask a question, it's like, where's the problems and where's the miscommunications? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4343.047s">It's</a>  right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4343.908s">And</a>  we're just asking for the work to be done that has been years in dire need of it happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4353.913s">You</a>  got the budget next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4355.734s">I</a>  hope a lot of people will come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4358.39s">and</a>  ask questions and hold you folks accountable and transparent to the citizens that are paying for all of this, that are not getting anything back when Dr. Stirello talked about the police department deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4374.685s">I</a>  hope people will come tomorrow night to the town hall that the chief will have at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4382.388s">and</a>  ask questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4383.768s">But</a>  I know you sigh, and I'm talking, and I'm taking too much time, President Dello Russo, but these are very important things. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4391.69s">It's</a>  a matter of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4392.91s">It's</a>  a matter of work not getting done with all of the money sitting there when petitions are being ignored for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4400.931s">I'm</a>  sorry, but it's really at the brink, and this body really needs to come together and do something to light a fire under this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4409.533s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4415.273s">All</a>  those in favor.</p>

    <p>[2MzH8zDWQL0_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4419.234s">Yes,</a>  I just want to emphasize that it's not budgets, it's really implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4424.355s">We</a>  need implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4426.736s">Because</a>  we can talk about budgets till we're blue in the face, but until people actually get together and figure out how we're going to get this done and come up with a real plan, it's just talk.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4438.359s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4440.16s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4442.209s">Reports</a>  of committee 16-5 24 committee of the whole report from May 25th 2016 on municipal aggregation We of the whole met last week Wednesday at 6 o'clock and the council office to hear a presentation on municipal electrical aggregation from the office of <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4467.021s">The</a>  environment, I think they call themselves the Office of Sustainability now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4472.084s">The</a>  purpose was to review and discuss the paper on municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4477.407s">There</a>  was an authorization plan presented to us, a rather steep schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4482.79s">There</a>  was a presentation to us on what is municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4487.053s">Homeowners</a>  would be able to choose which electric company they want, National Grid or Good Energy or others. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4494.483s">There</a>  will be a public hearing for people to sign up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4497.065s">There</a>  was a request to check other cities and towns to see how they may have dropped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4502.91s">And</a>  upon the motion of Councilor Caraviello, the paper was reported out of the committee, and that motion passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4510.836s">We</a>  are expecting in the coming weeks a presentation before us from the Office of Energy Environment on this matter, but you had presented to you <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4523.567s">a</a>  rather detailed explanation of the process, and I know Alicia Hunt is available to all of you to answer any of your questions you might have on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4547.242s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello to receive and place on file, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4550.684s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4551.244s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4553.122s">Uh,</a>  papers in the hands of the clerk by the, uh, request to council Cavill to, uh, take papers in the hand of the clerk under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4560.506s">All</a>  those in favor, all those opposed offered by president Dello Russo be resolved that the Medford city council offered sincere condolences to the family of the Reverend Francis Garrity on his recent passing father Garrity served at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4573.693s">Raphael</a>  parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4574.954s">He</a>  was pastor of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4575.914s">Francis</a>  of Assisi parish and also served for many years of the as chaplain <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4581.232s">of</a>  Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4583.333s">And</a>  I might add, he's a fellow alumnus of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4585.874s">Anselm</a>  College. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4587.375s">So</a>  if you would rise and join me in a moment of silence for this good priest and good former citizen of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4603.623s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Caraviello, it will be resolved that the Medford City Council discuss Republic Park ticketing <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4611.154s">of</a>  Gaston Street, the first day after Memorial Day, starting at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4619.436s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, 6 a.m., I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4701.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4702.004s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4705.167s">I</a>  too got the e-mails. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4706.388s">A</a>  lot of upset people who went out to work, said they were going to get the permit, you know, this week, and they have a ticket on their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4713.334s">It</a>  had to have come 6, 630 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4715.496s">I</a>  just feel like some warning should have been given or at least, you know, a couple days leeway for them to obtain the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4722.682s">I</a>  think the way it's worked in the past years is they've had a week or two to get their permit before the city jumped on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4730.835s">low</a>  way on how to collect revenue, where there is obviously other violations that aren't enforced at all, such as parking on some of our sidewalks in the city that really should have the attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4743.926s">And</a>  we don't give the attention to those types of violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4747.589s">So</a>  it is unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4748.77s">It</a>  felt terrible for the person, although there is signs up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4754.139s">And</a>  I hope that while the city solicitor and the mayor are looking into the issues with regards to the sale of Republic, that some of these things are addressed and discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4766.644s">And</a>  we make improvements through the whole system, obviously not the one or two little things that have been improved upon so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4774.268s">But</a>  we really need some serious improvement.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4776.508s">Mr.</a>  President, I would hope that the mayor's office would look into this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4781.08s">and</a>  hopefully make a recommendation to our republic to give these people a little bit of liberty in getting a permit.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4788.024s">On</a>  the motion, I'll caveat that these people be given a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4790.566s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4791.947s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to amend the paper to request that the traffic commission waive the tickets for all residents who purchase a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4798.771s">Same</a>  thing, but at least we can make official action of the traffic commission.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4802.113s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4804.194s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4806.035s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4806.896s">I</a>  think what we're seeing now is that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4809.47s">When</a>  you looked at the last financial report, it's clear to me that Republic is not taking in the money they expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4818.475s">And</a>  these are the type of things we're seeing now throughout the community, is that they're generating revenue any way they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4827.28s">And</a>  you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4829.261s">You</a>  know, when you outsource a program and lose local control, this is what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4835.904s">This</a>  is exactly what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4837.658s">Because</a>  if this was done in-house, like the original recommendation, we would have total control over what happens with the program, when the ticketing takes place, and how aggressive you're going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4849.446s">We</a>  were always told by Mae McGlynn, this program is not a revenue generator. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4854.309s">It's</a>  just to provide parking enforcement and public safety in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4859.488s">And,</a>  you know, you bet your bottom dollar that when you hire an outside company, that's not their train of thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4865.691s">Their</a>  train of thought is how much money and where can we maximize our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4869.894s">And</a>  so that's what we're seeing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4872.275s">This</a>  is no secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4873.996s">You</a>  know, we knew this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4875.737s">And</a>  when revenue starts to drop, we're going to find more and more angles that Republic is going to use to generate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4883.361s">So</a>  this is just the tip of the iceberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4885.702s">You</a>  know, it'd be nice if I agree with Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4888.347s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, Councilor Longo, and Councilor Knight's recommendation about asking that they receive their money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4897.229s">However,</a>  I think we should take it one step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4900.01s">And</a>  we heard from the mayor tonight that seniors are gonna be allowed to pay $25 up front for a senior pass per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4911.453s">And</a>  the seniors I've spoken with are still waiting for the free parking for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4917.878s">that</a>  they were promised back some seven or eight months ago that seniors wouldn't have to pay for parking in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4924.624s">So</a>  I'm a little disappointed in the negotiations that have taken place between the administration and Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4931.689s">And</a>  I think what we're seeing right now is a company running rampant in this community and really not caring what the administration has to say or what the administration wants to do about improving <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4947.146s">the</a>  traffic enforcement in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4948.886s">So</a>  I think, Mr. President, that, you know, Councilor Caraviello, I think you called for a meeting with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4957.449s">I'm</a>  not sure why we can't meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4959.229s">Maybe</a>  because we don't sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4961.109s">We</a>  can't meet with Republic.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4962.75s">Is</a>  there a reason, Mr. President, why we can't meet with Republic?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4973.513s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4973.993s">I</a>  think it's only appropriate now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4975.732s">We're</a>  the ones fielding the phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4977.693s">We're</a>  the ones getting the emails from angry residents that are concerned why they're getting ticketed and tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4983.874s">So,</a>  I think a meeting immediately, Mr. President, is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4988.696s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4995.918s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4997.238s">Rob</a>  Capucci again, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4999.719s">There's</a>  another issue going on at Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5001.96s">I'm</a>  not sure or not if it's supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5004.661s">I</a>  believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5005.885s">But</a>  these machines are supposed to shut down at 6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5008.847s">They're</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5010.468s">In</a>  the last month and a half, just walking through the city, I told a good dozen people, just tonight, I went to the store before coming here, and at 6.40, there was a young lady starting to feed money into the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5022.657s">And</a>  I said, no, you don't have to pay right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5025.039s">It's</a>  6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5026.24s">And</a>  she said, well, I didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5028.121s">And</a>  I said, well, it's on the parking sign, but it's written very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5031.744s">She</a>  said, well, it would have been a little bit more helpful if it was actually on the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5035.428s">itself,</a>  that it closes at 6 o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5040.13s">The</a>  machines lock at 6 o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5041.651s">You</a>  cannot put any more money in.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5044.912s">I've</a>  tried it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5047.173s">At</a>  6 o'clock, they will not take any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5049.914s">They</a>  lock.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5051.255s">Are</a>  you absolutely sure of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5052.475s">Because</a>  I've seen people feed <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5058.263s">If</a>  there's a way to request receipts and to look at that, because, I mean, you're putting in your personal information. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5067.065s">If</a>  people are paying after 6 o'clock, and, I mean, as Councilor Marks alluded to, they're trying to generate revenues, I wouldn't be surprised a bit if some of these machines are taking money after 6 o'clock, just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5081.928s">But</a>  I would look into their receipts, see if they are or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5086.029s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5095.138s">All</a>  those opposed, motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5097.18s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Caraviello, it will be resolved that the Medford City Council request an update from National Grid on the work being done on 4th Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5106.347s">Steel</a>  plates have been on Riverside Avenue and 4th Street for an extended period of time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5143.536s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5146.337s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5148.497s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5150.998s">Motion</a>  to suspend offered by <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5153.706s">Councilor</a>  Knight on today being the day of retirement of the President Emeritus of the Medford City Council, Robert A. Mayarco, Jr., who today retired after a 42-year career with Wells Fargo Securities. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5171.844s">Councilor</a>  Knight, the reason for your request for suspension of the rules.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5176.868s">Congratulations</a>  to Mr. Mayorca. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5178.649s">It</a>  wasn't for that, you really threw me off there for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5181.229s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to take paper 16-491, a $500,000 appropriation to replace sidewalks and stumps throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5185.971s">That</a>  is 16-491, $500,000 to replace sidewalks and stumps throughout the city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5189.352s">Councilor</a>  Knight, the paper is now before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5193.734s">We</a>  have with us, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5204.122s">gave</a>  us quite detailed testimony, the acting commissioner of public works, Mr. Brian Kerins, was with us in our meeting with the mayor today, at which we discussed many of the aspects of this, as well as we've discussed so many of them earlier this evening, which I'm sure will be repeated again. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5225.142s">But</a>  Mr. Kerins was going to bring to us <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5227.831s">some</a>  reports tonight, so he's going to hand those to the messenger so that we can have those. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5232.752s">Just</a>  to remind the councilors, of which they are also very well aware, but the public might not be, that because this paper was tabled, all the amendments that were on it were killed by parliamentary procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5247.535s">And</a>  so therefore, nothing was reported out, nor were there any formal requests made to department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5253.756s">But</a>  in his hyper-efficiency, Mr. Keran's <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5258.08s">Our</a>  acting superintendent has complied with our requests in a desire to serve the public very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5267.605s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5270.387s">Mr.</a>  President, I for one was satisfied at the last presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5273.768s">I</a>  feel as though our sidewalks need to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5275.829s">I</a>  feel as though a $500,000 appropriation is a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5278.791s">I</a>  don't think it's a good place to finish, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5281.113s">But</a>  with that being said, I think there were certain individual councilors here that had more concern than I did as to whether or not this was a worthwhile appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5287.536s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5300.401s">We</a>  have being given to us now a stump inventory, looks like by <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5306.205s">neighborhood,</a>  very detailed, and we have outstanding requests for sidewalk work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5312.988s">Again,</a>  quite detailed here, quite detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5324.874s">Madam</a>  Vice President, and if we could get an extra copy of that be placed in the record with the clerk's office.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5333.34s">If</a>  I could just ask a question, because it does look very detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5337.561s">So</a>  just going off the first one, the stumps, this is every stump on the list?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5343.563s">As</a>  of today.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5344.903s">As</a>  of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5345.563s">So</a>  total stumps, 192?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5348.404s">That's</a>  192 reported stumps in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5352.945s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5354.586s">And</a>  when we discussed it in committee this evening at 6 o'clock, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5360.077s">I</a>  think you said it would be about $100,000 to $125,000 to remove all 192 stumps.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5366.743s">That</a>  would be approximate, depending on the size.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5377.792s">And</a>  then if you could just explain what you printed out for the actual sidewalks to us.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5382.997s">On</a>  the sidewalks, Madam Vice President, is a breakdown on <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5387.059s">the</a>  date that the original call or request came into public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5394.621s">It's</a>  broken down by ward and precinct, the name of the individual making the request, the location, telephone number if they chose to give it to us, and a description as far as what they feel had to be done in front of their either business or residence.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5419.526s">And</a>  break that down, how many are in this?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5425.272s">Okay,</a>  all together, it was a little over 600 between both lists combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5435.633s">over</a>  600 sidewalks that need to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5438.415s">Yes,</a>  because on the stump inventory, Madam Vice President, that would also include replacing the sidewalks once they're removed as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5448.303s">So</a>  there'll be at least, with the stumps, 192 sidewalk panels replaced, because we do plan on getting rid of all 192 stumps? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5458.691s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5462.84s">The</a>  place in the panel was also included in your estimate of the 100 to 125? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5466.643s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5467.763s">So</a>  that brings this list down to about 400 panels?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5470.805s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5475.288s">Some</a>  of them you'll see, Madam Vice President, could be asphalt, but there isn't as many asphalt requests as there are concrete.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5486.736s">And</a>  with the 500,000, we'll do all the stumps in those panels, and then about how many <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5493.16s">I</a>  guess that's where my issue lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5494.601s">We</a>  won't know how many of the 400 on this list will be done.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5498.023s">You</a>  have two things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5499.224s">One,</a>  of course, we're already well into the season, so as far as how the actual bid prices come in, that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5507.967s">But</a>  then also, too, you only have four months left this year as far as where you can actually do concrete work. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5516.031s">You</a>  know, once you leave the month of October, there's a lot of risk involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5521.094s">So</a>  we'd have to cease operations and then pick up in April when there'd be a break in weather.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5533.761s">And</a>  do you have a directive of where <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5536.832s">where</a>  exactly you'd start on the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5538.533s">Are</a>  you going to start from the top of this list, or are we going to just kind of?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5542.916s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5543.776s">Each</a>  ward and precinct has locations that go back several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5551.14s">Those</a>  areas would be done first, the ones that are two or three or four years old, to try to clean them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5559.946s">And</a>  then we'd have them, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5563.17s">if</a>  we could have two crews out there, one solely dedicated to the tree stump list and the other just dedicated to the residential of the business list and just go from ward to different wards and precinct one by one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5584.104s">And</a>  the farthest we go back here is 2000 and</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5590.848s">There's</a>  several in the Madam Vice Chair that are 2014, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5597.772s">And</a>  I think there's a couple 2013.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5600.053s">My</a>  concerns would be the older ones get done obviously first and the ones that are obviously in the most disrepair get done first. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5617.163s">My</a>  main concerns initially when we talked about this for an hour last week is just that I don't want to dedicate $500,000 and then only have done, because you did say if there's many panels on one street, and even if they're not reported, we're going to do the whole street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5633.976s">My</a>  concern is I don't want to spend this $500,000 on a named 10 streets and not get the list done, especially the people that have been complaining for years or that have terrible sidewalks.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5646.169s">That</a>  is my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5647.029s">I</a>  can understand that, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5649.89s">Each</a>  location will be assessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5653.631s">Those</a>  that are obviously the most deplorable condition and the oldest would be addressed first. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5660.133s">And</a>  then as we get further into the contract, there may have to be some readjustments depending on need and location, getting most serious public safety threats done first.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5671.937s">If</a>  we can make that part of the paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5675.733s">condition</a>  on the vote that we do the oldest and the ones that are in most disrepair first. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5679.935s">Obviously,</a>  if the council could be updated after the fourth four months of what has been done.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5685.618s">Certainly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5686.099s">So</a>  if we could have some clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5687.779s">So</a>  we're going to have an amendment that the streets, the sidewalks be done, that the oldest and most outstanding be given priority and that the council be receive frequent updates <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5702.744s">as</a>  to the project's progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5706.365s">Did</a>  we understand that correctly, Madam Vice President?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5709.586s">That</a>  would be great.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5710.486s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5712.327s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5717.168s">Actually,</a>  I think Vice President Longo already mentioned it, but if you could just have a, when you've paved your last sidewalk and pulled your last stump out for the season, if you could just have a report like this just with an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5733.083s">just</a>  so we can see what was accomplished with the $500,000, you know, however much money is being appropriated here. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5740.785s">So</a>  it'd be nice just to kind of see actually how much we're getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5745.107s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5745.767s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5748.208s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5749.388s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd also like to request a copy of the RFP as well as the contract with the selected bidder when that becomes available to us.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5758.331s">But</a>  I move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5761.351s">amended</a>  by Councilor Knight, a request to the copy of the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5765.612s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5768.473s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5770.373s">Brian,</a>  I appreciate the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5772.793s">This</a>  is more thorough than we had two weeks before us, two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5778.555s">My</a>  question to you, Brian, I don't know if it was asked two weeks ago, but how do we rate when you get a call or an email from a resident, how do we rate the sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5790.215s">Do</a>  we have a key of conditions that we rate it and then give it a numerical number? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5797.98s">How</a>  do we go about this?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5800.221s">Well,</a>  first off, all right, is it a public safety hazard? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5805.184s">Which</a>  would be, we'll say, like a tree trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5807.665s">We</a>  have several panels that potentially are buckled. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5809.866s">All</a>  right, that's a public safety hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5812.128s">So</a>  that's, you know, top priority one, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5815.93s">Then</a>  you've got priority one, two, and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5818.171s">Priority</a>  two would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5819.769s">A</a>  sidewalk that has some pieces of asphalt, potentially concrete, that are missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5825.69s">And</a>  then priority three would be cosmetic, something like a hairline crack in a panel or two in front of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5833.992s">Or</a>  potentially a little dip in the asphalt that may be in front of the home, depending on what they have.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5841.514s">So</a>  on this particular outstanding request list that you gave us, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5846.678s">Is</a>  there a reason why they're not listed as priority one, priority two, priority three?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5853.639s">The</a>  reason for that is because the inspection of these different requests has just begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5858.84s">Up</a>  to this point, it's been strictly just an intake into our system because of funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5865.561s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5866.281s">So</a>  we don't even know from this current list what might be a minor repair, you know, a hairline fracture. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5876.244s">in</a>  the cement or something that requires, you know, a panel being raised because of a tree root. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5884.768s">So</a>  we don't know the extent of what's on this list.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5888.209s">As</a>  far as the accuracy of the tree stump contract, that's accurate as far as the tree stump one. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5895.552s">As</a>  far as the actual one with just the residents or the businesses on it, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5901.815s">No,</a>  but from past experience, most are usually accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5906.717s">In</a>  some cases, you realize that maybe their next door neighbor has the same problem, and that was never reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5913.539s">Right,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5914.94s">I</a>  guess what I'm getting at is I don't think anyone behind this reeling is opposed to doing sidewalks over. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5921.362s">But</a>  I could just state from previous experience, it was back in 2012 when I believe it was Jack Buckley was the DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5930.644s">that</a>  he came before us, he asked for the exact amount, 500,000, for sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5938.269s">He</a>  didn't present any supporting documentation at the time, and the council asked that he go back and provide a thorough list of what work needs to be done, where the locations are, the age of the request, and he did that back in 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5954.819s">And</a>  I have a copy of it in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5957.43s">And,</a>  uh, it's color coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5959.811s">And</a>  let me just state that, uh, he provides us a key and I'm not sure why it would change from one DPW director to the next DPW director, unless you come up with a much better way of tracking. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5973.899s">Then</a>  I can see why you changed the reporting, but I could just tell you from the two reports that I received, uh, the one back in 2012, uh, clearly delineates. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5985.971s">what</a>  has minor repair, what has poor, what they consider poor, and major. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5994.814s">And</a>  to me, that gives you at least an indication what you need to go after. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5999.596s">On</a>  your list, there's no indication. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6003.358s">I</a>  mean, you yourself just said we really didn't have the manpower to go out and do a thorough review of each of these sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6010.84s">This</a>  is just a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6012.641s">So</a>  anyone can call and say my sidewalk is awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6015.435s">Okay,</a>  with your name, address, ma'am, and they go on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6019.519s">So,</a>  you know, I still don't understand what we're going to accomplish on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6026.704s">Are</a>  we going to be replacing sidewalks that have a hairline fracture? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6031.809s">I</a>  mean, is that what the intention is of this $500,000?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6034.831s">No,</a>  absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6036.292s">Okay,</a>  it's strictly, you know, public safety has its, they have the number one priority now.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6043.703s">So,</a>  Brian, I don't want to cut you off, but what do we, because I've been hearing this year after year after year, what do we tell residents when they call up? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6051.548s">And</a>  they say, okay, I have a concern with my sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6054.63s">Doesn't</a>  it make sense to go out to the sidewalk, investigate it, then get back to the resident and say, ma'am, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6061.514s">We</a>  noticed you do have, you can't eat off your sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6064.256s">There</a>  is a hairline fracture, but in the list of priorities, you're not at the top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6069.74s">Your</a>  sidewalk probably won't be done for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6073.798s">people</a>  led to believe this sidewalk is going to be done that may have a hailing fracture, and it never gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6081.199s">You</a>  know what I'm saying?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6082.48s">There's</a>  no accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6083.9s">I</a>  realize what you're saying, but you also got to realize in 2012 and also in 2016, there's a significant change in staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6093.502s">The</a>  engineering division back then had two field inspectors, an assistant city engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6100.221s">a</a>  permit supervisor, and the city chief engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6105.004s">Today,</a>  there is no inspectors, okay, up to this point.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6109.427s">What</a>  happened with the inspectors?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6110.667s">Okay,</a>  that was before my time council.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6253.037s">Thank</a>  you, President Dillard. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6254.498s">So</a>  I think that was my concern two weeks ago when I asked for it, you know, because that is a lot of hours, a lot of manpower that we don't have to evaluate each and every sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6264.825s">But</a>  I did say, give us a list of <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6267.51s">you</a>  know, what are the first 10 to 100 sidewalks we will be replacing, so then we have a better idea of at least what streets we can tell people you're going to and that those sidewalks are going to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6279.475s">So,</a>  if the 500 is approved, we go out for an RFP, and we stabilize the money, how would you begin? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6287.659s">Where</a>  would you start? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6288.84s">With</a>  the stumps?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6289.5s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6291.141s">Well,</a>  depending on, you know, the successful bidder. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6295.24s">If</a>  he can supply us with two crews, I would go in two directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6299.884s">One</a>  would be stumps and, you know, stump and sidewalk combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6304.207s">Second</a>  avenue would be sidewalks only.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6309.171s">I</a>  mean, I would be comfortable tonight voting for the 192 stump removals, and I think we have a cost estimate of 100 to 150 on the higher end. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6320.06s">I</a>  completely believe that this list is <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6323.292s">is</a>  good enough and we can tell everybody on the stump list that their stump's going to be removed and their sidewalk panel is going to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6330.594s">And</a>  I think that's a good starting point, especially where we're taking it out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6334.356s">We're</a>  not going out to bond on this specific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6337.657s">But</a>  I have the concern, too, and I think that's where I was coming from two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6346.6s">I</a>  think this is definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6348.436s">a</a>  good start, and we definitely have every stump that's on this list in front of us, but I, too, we get calls every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6355.418s">You</a>  know, I was told my sidewalk's on the list in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6358.339s">Is</a>  it going to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6360.799s">I</a>  heard you were talking about 500,000, and I can't, we can't really tell them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6364.56s">I</a>  told one person specifically that we've requested a list of, you know, the top 100 that will definitely be done, but I, you know, we still can't answer that question, and I do appreciate the full list, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6378.264s">I</a>  guess I'm kind of torn as well, but I think that we can, I would, myself would move approval for knowing that the 192 stumps will be removed, definitely need to be removed, and I think that's something we should try to move on tonight, at least.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6395.135s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6396.536s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6397.157s">Mr.</a>  President, I think, you know, first and foremost, I think we need to get this project off the ground and started. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6403.441s">If</a>  we're going to sit here for another two weeks arguing who's going to get this in first, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6408.502s">The</a>  end of the season is going to be done, and we won't have any sidewalks then. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6411.823s">I</a>  mean, Mr. Cairns has only been on the job a couple of months, and Mr. Buckley did a great report there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6419.645s">And</a>  if we give Mr. Cairns some time, he can come up with a rating system. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6425.586s">But</a>  if we're going to sit here another week and let another week go by, another week go by, these contractors are going to get booked up, and we're not going to get anybody, and we're not going to get anything fixed, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6438.075s">on</a>  motion for approval by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6441.719s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6443.4s">Councilor</a>  Matz.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6444.621s">I</a>  think Councilor Lungo-Curran brought up a great suggestion about the 192 tree stumps which include panels, sidewalk panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6453.189s">So</a>  I think that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6455.151s">I</a>  would also ask my fellow colleagues that <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6457.405s">You</a>  know, if we do move approval on this, that we send a message or at least request from here on in that every sidewalk be reviewed and then graded, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6470.834s">So</a>  in the future, it might not happen now, but in the future, we have a report that we can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6476.097s">You</a>  know, it's easy to say, let's just move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6479.219s">But</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6480.68s">We're</a>  accountable to the residents of this community and the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6484.802s">And</a>  that's taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6485.963s">That's</a>  a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6487.547s">and</a>  taxpayer money, and from a business perspective, we should be able to look at it and say, here's a half a million, this is what we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6496.069s">This</a>  is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6497.849s">It's</a>  not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6499.23s">And</a>  not one person behind this reel can tell me, this is what we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6504.371s">Not</a>  one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6505.671s">So</a>  I don't think this is, you know, something that we should be.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6512.512s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6589.753s">That's</a>  all I'm asking.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6592.095s">It</a>  would be an amendment to this paper, Mr. President, because without it, I can't support any more work done, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6607.936s">Did</a>  Lungo have an amendment on that too? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6610.498s">Did</a>  you have an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6615.641s">Did</a>  you? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6617.342s">Previously?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6617.862s">No?</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6644.122s">They're</a>  just placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6644.702s">So</a>  you, you put in a C-Click fix, you get on the sideline list.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6647.705s">They're</a>  not, that would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6649.546s">Well,</a>  that's the whole, that's the whole point I brought up.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6652.068s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6652.729s">I</a>  mean, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6654.951s">So</a>  we have a motion for approval as amended by vice president Longo Curran and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6661.256s">I</a>  think there's a couple citizens behind you, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6664.299s">Commissioner</a>  who would like to speak, so we gladly welcome them and their input tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6669.584s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6670.184s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6723.337s">You</a>  don't want to have to go back there again. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6725.338s">But</a>  what that means is that you never have an accurate count of how much money you're going to be spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6731.423s">And</a>  not only is it not rated, but you don't necessarily know what's abutting it that also needs fixing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6739.049s">So</a>  even if you had that all rated, you still wouldn't have the numbers you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6743.693s">And</a>  it wouldn't really be doable until they get out there, unless they do like a full report on everyone, which sounds kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6750.088s">like</a>  it's difficult to do under the current circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6753.449s">I'm</a>  not saying that that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6755.35s">I'm</a>  saying that under—you're never going to have—like, that number that you want isn't available. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6764.514s">That's</a>  a broken system. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6767.895s">But</a>  I guess the question is, is the perfect going to be the enemy of the good here? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6772.417s">You</a>  absolutely should know how people's money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6776.689s">a</a>  serious hole in the system that you can't have that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6781.311s">But</a>  I don't know what two weeks is going to buy you in terms of getting that number, because they're not going to go out in two weeks probably to every site and say, all right, well, this guy, he has a giant hole down through the entire planet right here, and next door, that person's got a hairline crack. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6798.54s">They're</a>  not going to do that in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6801.931s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6802.512s">Is</a>  there some kind of compromise? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6804.113s">Is</a>  there—but the math just isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6806.736s">I</a>  mean, for sure it's going to be more than 500,000, but it could be a lot more than 500,000 when you factor in the stumps, which you don't know how much they said in the Committee—you said in the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6817.829s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6819.467s">Through</a>  the chair, who is also at the Committee of the Whole meeting, you know that they said that, you know, they don't know until they get to the stump, like how rooted it is in their, the stumps vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6831.451s">They</a>  do, you know, they have previous experience, and so they estimate it based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6836.473s">But</a>  just the way it's set up right now, like, that takes some of the money out of the sidewalks, except for the stuff that's used to patch up the sidewalk where the stump used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6848.92s">But</a>  I don't think there's a thing that's going to give you the number that's going to make you comfortable voting for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6853.943s">So</a>  I guess what you have to decide then is, what do you do about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6857.886s">And</a>  what are you willing to do in the meantime? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6860.027s">But</a>  the math's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6861.208s">Like,</a>  $500,000 is not going to cover that much, but it's going to get a start on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6866.231s">So</a>  that's what you have to work with.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6869.033s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6871.275s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6875.337s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6876.258s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6877.089s">conference</a>  president, uh, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman street method mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6884.474s">Um,</a>  just as a concerned citizen, taxpayer, et cetera, and for other taxpayers, uh, my concern with the old adage or saying is, uh, it ain't broke, don't fix it, but if it's broke, what you should fix it, obviously, especially on the side of safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6903.148s">Um,</a>  my concern is the 600, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6907.378s">or</a>  400 sidewalk panels, thereabouts, and 192 stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6913.441s">I'm</a>  not sure if it's 400 locations or 600 locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6917.744s">However,</a>  my concern is since they're on a list, so they made the grade, so to speak, as a problem, this $500,000 should hopefully be enough to take care of every single location. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6935.942s">and</a>  not start jumping down other addresses on the same street because, I mean, $400,000, you couldn't even do Clippership Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6945.907s">That</a>  would eat the whole business of $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6949.409s">So</a>  if they just say, well, my sidewalk is busted too, five doors down, well, did you at least call it in? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6957.753s">Chances</a>  are it was not called in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6959.254s">So</a>  they made the grade, but they must be in bad, bad shape and a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6966.58s">Through</a>  the chair, I'd like to ask Mr. Brian Curran a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6972.702s">On</a>  average, I'd like to know, first of all, one question is how many locations? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6978.444s">Is</a>  it 400 or 600 locations? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6982.126s">And</a>  then I have a follow-up question.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6983.986s">Okay,</a>  that'd be 600 combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6985.227s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6986.647s">And</a>  at the Committee of the Whole meeting with the Mayor, you had mentioned, I believe, it costs $25 per panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=6995.814s">for</a>  the concrete aggregated self material and $28 labor, which equals approximately, you believe, $53 average per panel, depending on how the contract comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7014.866s">A</a>  panel, I presume, is four feet by six feet, if that, not even. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7022.231s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7024.815s">So</a>  my final question to you would be, hopefully my final question is, on average, if you could just ballpark 600 locations on average per location, some might be yay big, some might be a lot bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7043.084s">Can</a>  you give me an average per location what the cost might be, please?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7052.943s">It's</a>  pretty hard to say, depending on the location, you could be one panel, two panels, maybe four and a driveway apron may be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7062.09s">Each</a>  location would have to be examined. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7064.391s">It's</a>  a case by case basis to come up with the actual final number.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7071.236s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7071.716s">So</a>  what's unknown. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7072.597s">So</a>  if we get $500,000 from the hard earned taxpayers money from the free cash that the city is holding, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7081.7s">If</a>  it's $1,000 a shot, I'm presuming that's going to cover 500 problem areas out of the 600 that's on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7091.785s">I'm</a>  just guesstimating this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7095.967s">However,</a>  Councilor Marks are eluded to past histories about this sidewalk repair business with tree stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7104.992s">And</a>  I'm not sure if he was accurate, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7107.376s">but</a>  the numbers didn't make much sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7109.117s">One</a>  million, then another million, that's two million, and the list of 400 or 600, and they never totally got completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7117.323s">So</a>  you're talking like 10, 20, $30,000 per shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7121.647s">I</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7122.307s">Hopefully</a>  this law will work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7125.169s">Thank</a>  you if you're listening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7126.63s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7131.634s">Any</a>  other citizens want to speak on this matter before we close off public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7136.41s">Welcome,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7139.231s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7140.251s">Rob</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7145.593s">I</a>  know you've already had the discussion about Evans Street and you've taken action on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7151.835s">But</a>  it looks like now you're, it's like piecemealing something when, you know, stepping outside of the box and look it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7161.078s">I</a>  think what a lot of people in Medford see is, like Mr. Reed spoke of before, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7166.259s">You</a>  have allocation of funds on the MWRA for, I believe you talked about sidewalks or something like $3 million, which 75% of which would be grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7178.164s">We</a>  see in the free cash account, something like six or $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7185.507s">What</a>  we don't understand as citizens paying all these taxes is how come it can't be that this commissioner's office can't be staffed? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7196.027s">with</a>  the right amount of people to survey the city, make the proper assessments, hire the people that we need, and get the job done when there's all this money that's at your fingertips to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7210.902s">We're</a>  talking about $500,000 that we don't even know what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7214.826s">We're</a>  talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7217.225s">complaints</a>  and registers made to SeeClickFix that are taken down and closed and resolved when they're obviously not. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7226.43s">It's</a>  just a hard thing to wrap your mind around, seeing almost tens of millions of dollars, when an understaffed department that doesn't even have the manpower to go out there and assess what needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7241.299s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. President, but it has to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7244.6s">Leadership</a>  has to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7245.98s">It</a>  has to be accountable and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7248.261s">It</a>  has to look at what we've got in order to fund the resources to get these jobs done that are years past due. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7260.023s">It's</a>  something to consider when you look at the budget next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7264.624s">I</a>  would like to say this, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7268.385s">The</a>  parks project that has gone on, because a lot of hits and a lot of criticism has been made, I've got to give kudos to. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7278.708s">You've</a>  got to also reward what's good as being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7282.589s">And</a>  Morrison Parks, our new basketball court and a few of the other parks, excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7288.43s">Excellent</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7289.271s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7290.691s">Mr.</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7291.771s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7293.232s">You</a>  know, it's insightful when you listen to the history <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7298.255s">and</a>  what's gone on in the past here and as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7302.797s">I</a>  did my own investigation and you see what other communities are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7306.899s">And</a>  for this situation, I think we're in an unfortunate situation for the fact that this is what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7314.543s">Not</a>  to say you look at it lightly, but you look at different communities and different communities have cement crews in place already that when there is a concern, the concern is dealt with <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7327.287s">as</a>  a case-to-case basis, not something saved up to 600 pieces that unfortunately isn't, you know, something that happened just this week, but over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7340.511s">So</a>  we have identified locations, and you see the concerns in some of the comment sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7348.133s">In</a>  some of the comment sections, you know, it says National Grid did X, Y, and Z. And, you know, I have concerns with that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7356.721s">But</a>  at the same time, constituents that I've talked to that have these concerns are living with sidewalks that are dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7366.804s">And</a>  stalling it now, I think it would be harmful to those constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7374.707s">But</a>  at the same time, it's something that we have to look at as a committee, looking at the budget and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7382.029s">Because</a>  a lot of these concerns are made because of <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7388.873s">systematic</a>  negligence in a sense that we had some faults and we need to correct them. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7395.376s">So,</a>  um, you know, I, I'd have to, I'd have to vote and move on with, with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7403.72s">So,</a>  um, thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7406.882s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7408.123s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by council on night as seconded by councilor Scarpelli, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7414.176s">as</a>  amended by Councilors Lungelkorn and Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7417.337s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, finally.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7419.918s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7420.879s">You</a>  know, Councilor Scarpelli has made a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7423.039s">You</a>  know, other cities have crews in place to do these things around the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7429.982s">Maintenance</a>  has been the Achilles heel of the city for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7434.564s">And,</a>  you know, every year it grows and we pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7439.205s">Now,</a>  I mean, you can see right now, I mean, 600 sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7446.129s">These</a>  sidewalks didn't break yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7448.03s">It's</a>  been long overdue and we made a small dent in it a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7452.872s">But</a>  again, sidewalks just keep coming and coming and coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7456.374s">I</a>  mean, we're an old city.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7463.357s">I'd</a>  ask that the amendments be read back and a roll call vote be taken, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7466.258s">Yes,</a>  we're prepared for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7469.94s">We're</a>  going to have a final amendment, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7475.277s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7476.118s">Mr.</a>  President, a little while ago, I mentioned that I was going to ask that Evans Street be put on this for a complete repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7482.942s">And</a>  then we heard from the gentleman that worked in the engineer's office saying that there's probably a need for a major water main and gas main on Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7494.628s">So</a>  at this point, it doesn't make sense to ask for a major repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7499.571s">But</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that the city administration, as a CPAPA, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7505.377s">look</a>  into whether or not a complete water main and gas main needs to be replaced on Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7513.4s">And</a>  if so, that that work be done immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7516.401s">And</a>  then we can discuss the repaving of the street, which will probably be part of that work anyways.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7521.903s">So</a>  we have a main paper, uh, that's been amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7525.544s">So</a>  a B paper then would be separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7529.325s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7529.865s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7530.225s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7531.005s">And</a>  the amendments were that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7533.355s">Uh,</a>  we, so we've just, uh, heard stated by Councilor Marks, the B paper, which we'll take the vote on first. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7540.636s">And</a>  then the main paper, which was the $500,000 allotment from free cash as requested, uh, by the mayor two weeks ago, um, in council on May 17th was amended first by vice president Lungo-Koehn, that we get an update, frequent updates on the progress of the project and that preference be given <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7561.613s">to</a>  the most outstanding or oldest sidewalks on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7566.437s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7568.619s">And</a>  most dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7570.241s">Yes,</a>  most dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7572.303s">And</a>  Councilor Marks had an amendment on there, which is escaping my mind, and Madam Clerk is going to share it with me in a second.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7580.53s">Sidewalks</a>  be assessed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7583.722s">sidewalks</a>  be assessed once they're reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7587.904s">And</a>  rated for future reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7589.745s">For</a>  future reference, once they are reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7592.986s">So,</a>  Madam Clerk, on the B paper offered by Councilor Marks, would you please call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7598.348s">That</a>  is regarding Evans Street and the water main.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7600.629s">Evans</a>  Street, and for an assessment on water, gas, and other utility replacements which need to be facilitated prior to a resurfacing of the thoroughfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7612.815s">Madam</a>  clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[hFAk--zIv7g_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7614.236s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7614.517s">With</a>  the vote of seven, the affirmative, none, then the negative B paper passes now onto the main paper.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7631.607s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[hFAk--zIv7g_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7632.988s">Councilor</a>  Calvelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7634.549s">Calvelli?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7635.569s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7636.43s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7637.51s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7637.79s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7638.531s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7638.991s">Vice</a>  President Lindelof-Burns? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7640.092s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7640.812s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7641.572s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7641.973s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7643.333s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7643.714s">Councilor</a>  Tolson?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7644.554s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7645.014s">With</a>  a vote of 70 affirmative, none in the negative, the main paper passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7649.176s">Thank</a>  you all very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7650.817s">And</a>  the records of the meeting of May 28th, 2016 will pass to Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7656.1s">Mr.</a>  Councilor, how indeed did you find those records?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7659.529s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7660.51s">I</a>  reviewed the records, found them to be in order, and move approval.</p>
