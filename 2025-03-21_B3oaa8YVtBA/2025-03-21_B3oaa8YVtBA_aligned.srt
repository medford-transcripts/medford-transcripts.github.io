So this is a public hearing and so we just ask in public hearings that those who are in favor or those who are opposed of the item before us present themselves to the podium and state just that, whether they're in favor or opposed when called forward.

26
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:53,526
It's not a period for discussion or merits as is custom in a public hearing.

27
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:58,568
So at this time, the chair invites anybody in favor of this item

29
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:07,777
Anybody in favor of this matter before us?

00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,259
No one is in favor.

31
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,599
Is the petitioner present?

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,980

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,221

Anybody else in favor?

44
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,890
Anybody else in favor?

45
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,212
Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting closed.

46
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,033
Anybody in opposition?

47
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:49,477
Is anybody in opposition to this matter before us at 67 Mystic Avenue?

48
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,178
Anybody in opposition?

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,182
Hearing and seeing none, I declare the meeting closed.

50
00:02:55,602 --> 00:03:02,245
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

51
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:04,726
Licensing.

52
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:09,969
Mr. President, I have reviewed the papers earlier in the week, and I find them to be in order.

53
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:13,651
Can you tell us what operation was there presently?

54
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,372
Are you taking over business?

55
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:15,932
Yes.

56
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:16,572
You are.

57
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:19,534
And can you tell us the scope of your business?

58
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,020
It is auto repair.

59
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:39,670
And also, we are applying for a dealer, class two auto dealer, that we are asking for permission to run the business as auto repair and use it for a dealer.

60
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,432
And you're asking also, have you applied yet for the auto dealer's license?

61
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:45,012
Yes.

62
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:46,213
You have applied.

63
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:46,633
Yes.

64
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,515
Is that application before us, Mr. Chairman?

65
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:52,215
This is, Mr. President.

66
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:53,416
This is also here.

67
00:03:54,476 --> 00:04:03,539
Presently, we have this on the operation for a class four auto repair and a body shop.

68
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:16,524
So on the recommendation of Councilor Caviello for approval, seconded by Vice President Longo Kern.

69
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:17,424
All those in favor?

70
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:19,605
Councilor Max?

71
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:25,359
Just wondering if I can ask the petitioner what type of off-street parking do you currently have?

72
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:31,602
We have a parking in front of the building and also a few parking space on the side of the building.

73
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,204
When you say in front of the building, on Publix Road?

74
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:35,724
Oh, no.

75
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:36,865
It is on a lot.

76
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,686
Roughly how many spots do you have?

77
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:44,469
It is around 15 in the front and around eight, nine on the side of the building.

78
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:46,370
And how many bays do you have?

79
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,190
Two.

80
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,231
Two bays?

81
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:48,491
Yes.

82
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:49,572
Thank you.

83
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,713
On the motion of approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Vice President Longo-Kern.

84
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,473
All those in favor?

85
00:04:58,593 --> 00:04:58,673
Aye.

86
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,714
All those opposed?

87
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,635
Congratulations.

88
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,336
Suspension of the rules.

89
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:04,237
Suspension of the rules.

90
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:05,858
Madam Vice President, for what purpose?

91
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:13,963
To allow residents from the Evans Street neighborhood to speak to the council on an issue.

92
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:16,184
Thank you, ma'am.

93
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,285
You may be seated.

94
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:20,227
Is it on the agenda?

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,181
It's not on the agenda.

96
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:26,221
I don't believe the residents put it on the agenda, but they asked.

97
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:29,362
Is there a resident from the Evans Street here to speak to the council?

98
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,003
Please present yourself to the podium.

99
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:33,344
State your name and address for the record.

100
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:35,944
Purpose of your presence.

101
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:38,505
Shawna Smith, 91 Evans Street.

102
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:39,606
I'm sorry, your name?

103
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:40,506
Shawna Smith.

104
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:41,646
Shawn Smith.

105
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,367
91 Evans Street.

106
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:44,087
91 Evans Street.

107
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:44,587
Welcome.

108
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:45,367
Thank you.

109
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,488
How can we help you?

110
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:50,249
My street's atrocious.

111
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:53,171
I can't hear what you're saying.

112
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:54,132
Your street's atrocious.

113
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,193
Your street is atrocious.

114
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,253
My street is atrocious.

115
00:05:56,313 --> 00:06:08,762
There's potholes, rocks, because the asphalt, there's no hot tub, there's no asphalt anymore, so the gravel that's underneath the big rocks, I have some in my pocketbook.

116
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:10,106
that I brought.

117
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:14,609
This is what my daughter is riding her bike on and wiping out.

118
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,529
A little boy broke his arm in September.

119
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,851
My mother broke her hip five years ago from the street.

120
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:21,152
I've called seven times.

121
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:22,873
I've called Town Hall.

122
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:26,474
I've filed two things on C-Click Fix.

123
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,295
They came out.

124
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,176
They fixed the big pothole in front of my house.

125
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,396
But it's not just the pothole.

126
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:36,279
It's the rocks, because you can patch it all you want, but the street's crumbling.

127
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:42,444
There was four open complaints on C-Click Fix this morning.

128
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:45,226
What is it that you want us to do for you?

129
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,387
You want the street paved?

130
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,048
Yeah, the street needs to be paved.

131
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,632
On the motion of Councilor Scott Pelley, that Evans Street be paved.

132
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:54,833
Madam Vice President.

133
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,398
Thank you, if we could allow the resident to finish.

134
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,938
It was open on CClickFix.

135
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,119
There was four of them that weren't from me.

136
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,079
I put two of them on there, but there was four of them from different neighbors.

137
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't know who they were, but I followed it.

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,622
I voted to have it fixed, and I got four alerts, one after another, on my email.

139
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:29,092
that Lauren in the mayor's office was happy to announce that the issue has been resolved and the issue is closed because it was fixed.

140
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:32,175
So they fixed the one pothole in front of your house.

141
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,317
They fixed that back in March.

142
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:38,401
These are all new issues that have been opened up in the last week and they're fixed.

143
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:54,503
We just had a meeting with the mayor, and Lauren was there giving us an update on the C-Click fix, and it seems like Lauren from the mayor's office is the monitor of the situation, but I'm not sure why something like that was closed.

144
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:58,004
I don't know if my colleagues can see the pictures, the streets.

145
00:07:58,304 --> 00:07:59,764
So that's the whole street.

146
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:00,945
That's the whole street.

147
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:05,246
They're in my driveway, they're in my front yard, they're in my backyard.

148
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:08,808
That's my street.

149
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,017
And so in March you, you reported the problem that one pothole was fixed, but nothing else.

150
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:15,438
And then.

151
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,691
There's been six more complaints, two of yours, four others, and nothing's been done.

152
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,032
They just were all closed out.

153
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,913
And this neighbor is one of them.

154
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:29,097
I think she's 90, and she said that she's lived there for 62 years, and the street's never been paved.

155
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:34,980
And her husband, who passed away, used to come to this meeting every time that Mr. Notola came.

156
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,542
And he couldn't get anything done complaining about it.

157
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:40,123
He probably died 20 years ago.

158
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,304
Yeah.

159
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:51,645
I think this is the priority when we talk about taking $500,000 out of free cash to do sidewalks.

160
00:08:51,705 --> 00:09:01,489
I think streets need to be included in that or we need to take a better look at some of our streets and how they're crumbling and get some of these fixed.

161
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:09,453
And obviously Evans Street, for people to report it multiple, multiple times on C-Click Fix and have to come to a council meeting and actually bring rocks.

162
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:25,707
We definitely see a problem, so I definitely move approval to see if we could get an estimate on how much it would cost to repave the street and what the recommendations would be if we weren't to repave the whole street.

163
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:29,290
But to get some resolve, it's terrible.

164
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,512
I always say we are being reactive rather than proactive.

165
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:37,678
in this situation where you have a broken hip and a broken arm, it doesn't even look like we're being reactive.

166
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:51,007
If that was my daughter that broke her arm, and she rides, she's rollerblading, she learned how to ride her bike, and she's hitting rocks this big, and dumping, and not, you know, not one, she better not be hurt.

167
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:54,213
Oh, there's my rock.

168
00:09:54,333 --> 00:10:02,515
Councilor Scarpelli, that Evans Street be repaved, seconded by Vice President Longo Kern.

169
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,775
She recognizes Councilor.

170
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:04,355
So much.

171
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,156
Thank you, Mr. President.

172
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,856
I will support this tonight.

173
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:16,298
But I can tell you firsthand, I've supported the last four times we've asked for Evans Street to be repaved.

174
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:18,858
And we're still in the same situation.

175
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:20,859
So I would ask my colleagues tonight

176
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:25,474
The mayor asked for approval of 500,000 for sidewalks.

177
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:33,140
We have over 8 million in free cash that we put contingent upon the 500,000 that Evans Street be repaved.

178
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,104
So if we make it part of that report, we know Evans Street will be repaved and we won't be getting lip service anymore.

179
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:48,430
I would venture to say that Evans Street is probably in the top five worst streets in the entire city without any hesitation.

180
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,071
And it's getting worse.

181
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:53,879
And pothole patrol is really not what's needed.

182
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,661
You need a whole new grind down and repaving of the entire street curb to curb.

183
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:11,786
So I would ask that my fellow colleagues, I'll be more than happy to put that forward when we discuss the paper for $500,000 for sidewalks, that Evans Street, Pinkett Street is probably the second worst street.

184
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:14,627
So it's right next door to Evans.

185
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,108
Then you have Wicklow, you have Pleasant Street.

186
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:19,429
I mean, you can go down the list of streets that are in

187
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:24,995
deplorable condition, but these residents have had to deal with the street for long enough.

188
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:32,459
It's a public safety concern when you drive down the street, you kick up rocks, which is a very dangerous situation.

189
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:45,204
And, you know, I think that's probably the best way of doing it because just merely another recommendation from this council is going to fall with the other four or five recommendations.

190
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:49,626
So I would ask that we put that on the paper that's a little further on the agenda.

191
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:55,749
On the motion for approval, Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Kelly.

192
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:56,709
Thank you, Mr. President.

193
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:57,870
I appreciate the residents.

194
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:05,071
I did come out yesterday and walk the streets with a couple of your neighbors, and it is horrible.

195
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:17,594
I mean, I concur with my colleagues in the fact that one of the neighbors told me that she was bringing her groceries in about a year ago, and when she came back out, her back tire was gone.

196
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:21,988
because it was eaten by the sewer cover.

197
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:26,229
So that is a dangerous street.

198
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:26,729
I know that.

199
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:40,193
But we do have, I know that the mayor announced tonight that we were graded, I believe, a 99 on the open streets grant process to move forward.

200
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:41,874
So obviously there's money.

201
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:45,535
I, as one, will really push for the Evans Street

202
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:48,498
resurfacing it.

203
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,139
That's not a pothole issue.

204
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,160
This is a whole resurfacing issue.

205
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:02,943
And I think that Lauren did do her job by closing out that pothole, but understanding that Evans Street isn't a pothole issue.

206
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:04,243
It's the whole street.

207
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:07,024
So, thank you again.

208
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:07,684
Thank you.

209
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:09,705
So, on the motion for approval, I second it.

210
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:11,325
I see that, Madam Vice President.

211
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,046
Please.

212
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,366
Thank you, Mr. President.

213
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:16,887
Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

214
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,269
So, I mean, just a few questions.

215
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:32,274
When you say that Lauren did her job, there have been, going back a couple years now, reports to the city about this street.

216
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:35,715
It spills out into Central Ave.

217
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:38,656
These rocks are in front yards.

218
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,417
They're on sidewalks.

219
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:47,720
My question, I guess, is will we get a time frame?

220
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:52,195
of when this will be done, because it is the summertime now.

221
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,236
Kids are out of school.

222
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,996
They're going to be all over that street.

223
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,938
It's only a matter of time before a tire spins one of these up.

224
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,819
I mean, we've already had injuries.

225
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,904
With all due respect, Mr. President, is there any way we can get some type of time frame on when to expect this street to be fixed?

226
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:16,627
I do not know the answer to the question, but I'm sure Councilor Scarpelli

227
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:27,041
might add an amendment to his resolution that we ask for a timeframe on this when we place the question to the mayor's office.

228
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,302
Thank you very much.

229
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:38,649
I mean, when, you know, when we consider the surplus amounts completion of the project, uh, be a reported back to the council as soon as possible.

230
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:43,572
When we consider the surplus amounts in city coffers and you know, we have,

231
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:48,280
an endless list of taxes to be paid, quite frankly.

232
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:55,165
And no disrespect to this body, but this is—it's an abomination.

233
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:56,326
It really is.

234
00:14:56,466 --> 00:15:05,754
And the amount of money that we pay as residents and taxpayers, that this wasn't done two years ago when you were first informed of this.

235
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,175
Thank you, Mr. President.

236
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:08,556
Thank you very much, sir.

237
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,644
Welcome, please state your name and address for the record, sir.

238
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:14,865
John Sorello, 20 Metcalf Street.

239
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,870
Mr. President, this is not an Evans Street problem, this is a citywide problem.

240
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:28,315
And as a matter of fact, I was shocked to learn how many public safety departments are understaffed in this city.

241
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:37,921
And it was never brought up in the recent committee of the whole meeting with the mayor just a little while ago.

242
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:49,884
And what it comes down to, I was shocked to learn that the Department of DPW, Public Works, has only 17 staffing.

243
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:51,885
How could that be?

244
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:54,346
In a city the size of Medford, it should not be.

245
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,847
Now, this is really a public safety problem.

246
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:04,260
And, and this, I think this department is really second to the police and the, uh, fire department.

247
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,903
So this is what should be brought up when you have a discussion about the budget.

248
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:17,167
I mean, the whole council should go before the mayor and negotiate with the mayor to have these staffs improved.

249
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:22,931
I'm surprised to learn for instance, the police department is short, uh, 30 offices.

250
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,732
How could that be in the city side?

251
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:26,653
This is the first,

252
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:28,392
priority.

253
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:30,533
Is that redundant?

254
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,854
First priority?

255
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:36,198
Anyway, this is the first priority of government.

256
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,781
That's the reason we have government is for public safety.

257
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:49,228
So this council should not pass a budget until it is agreed that public safety will be improved in the city.

258
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,331
And we should have a Department of Public Works can deal with all of these problems.

259
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,594
We have problems with sidewalks, with tree stumps,

260
00:16:57,421 --> 00:17:00,262
with potholes, et cetera.

261
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:06,943
So this should be dealt with, and this is the city council's great opportunity.

262
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,985
Mr. President, thank you very much.

263
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,465
Just a point of clarification.

264
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:22,487
I think when Dr. Starello referred to 17 employees in the Department of Public Works, he was referring to 17 employees that were just exclusively assigned to the highway division.

265
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:26,028
But, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to request

266
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:31,240
that the matter be referred to the administration for inclusion in the capital plan.

267
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:36,524
We just met with the mayor's office this morning, and they said that they're in the process of putting together a capital budget and a capital plan.

268
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:42,209
And this is a capital expenditure, Mr. President, so I'd ask that they also put this on their list of items to add to the capital plan.

269
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:47,633
Thank you, Mr. President.

270
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:54,278
Mr. President, would it be possible to send the DPW down there tomorrow morning to put a temporary patch on that?

271
00:17:55,003 --> 00:18:01,128
Obviously, the streets are not going to get paid tomorrow, but in the meantime... Point of information, Councilor Scott Pally.

272
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:03,590
Unless they do the whole street, it's really not a patch.

273
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,714
I mean, if they get on there, at least fill it on a temporary basis.

274
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:21,585
I think the big potholes they did, but walking with it yesterday, just... Well, it's abundantly clear to all of us that the streets are a hazard to everybody who lives there and drives on it, and it needs to be repaid, and it's been needing to be repaid for a decade.

275
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,731
Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,772
Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

277
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:32,755
Maybe if they could come by and pick up all these loose rocks that are, if that's possible.

278
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:40,298
But if this gets added to the mayor's capital plan, what does that do in terms of a timeframe of fixing this street?

279
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,879
I mean, when do they meet on that?

280
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,000
When is that discussed?

281
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,120
When is that approved?

282
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,761
Point of clarification, Madam Vice President.

283
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,963
I think Councilor Mox hit the nail on the head with regards to

284
00:18:50,834 --> 00:19:10,182
that $500,000 free cash expenditure, associating this, Evans Street, making a condition of that, because the capital plan, the budget director, the mayor said it wouldn't be until they hire a budget director, which would be end of summer, fall, is when the capital plan would even be discussed.

285
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:12,303
So that would push it out a year or two.

286
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:16,705
So I think, too, if we can get councillors to condition Evans Street

287
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:17,396
on that $500,000.

288
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:28,420
This is exactly why we wanted a list of the $500,000, how it was going to be spent, so that we know streets like Evans or sidewalks that are in complete disrepair are the ones that are going to get done.

289
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:36,322
And I think Mr. Cairns, who's the DPW director, is getting a copy of the list for us as we speak, so we can possibly bring that up later tonight.

290
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:37,763
If not, hopefully by next week.

291
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:47,737
So then my next question would be, knowing this, why would a councillor request to put this on the capital plan that's going to push it out another year or two?

292
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,559
It's unprecedented.

293
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,040
Point of information, Councillor Knight.

294
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,282
Mr. President, I don't feel as though we should be making one project contingent upon another.

295
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:01,764
Two weeks ago, we sat here and we talked about sidewalks, and there's a dire need for us to repair our sidewalks.

296
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,565
Last week, we talked about sidewalks.

297
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:05,886
We talked about how there was a dire need to repair our sidewalks.

298
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,201
There's certainly a dire need to repair many of our streets, Evans Street being one of them, Mr. President.

299
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:15,843
But I don't feel as though holding one construction project hostage and make it contingent upon another is a good policy.

300
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:18,024
Point of information.

301
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,565
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

302
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:24,467
I think one of the reasons that was brought up last week, the reason why we need new sidewalks is public safety.

303
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,328
So we can have all the great sidewalks we want.

304
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:34,832
And then when a resident steps in the street into a six inch pothole line throughout the street, that's a public safety concern.

305
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,380
I think we have to address them when we see them.

306
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,602
And this has definitely been an issue for a number of years.

307
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:42,543
The council president mentioned a number of years.

308
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:43,924
I think this is the time.

309
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,665
This, this is an emergency.

310
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:49,787
This, this isn't something a wishlist would say out of the street, but like they haven't repaid.

311
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:50,987
This is an emergency.

312
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,169
Um, and I, I did the same thing.

313
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,569
Counselor Scott Pelly did.

314
00:20:54,589 --> 00:21:00,993
I took a walk around the neighborhood and this street, I'd venture to say is one of the top five in the city of worst streets.

315
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,983
So you can imagine the condition it's in.

316
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,984
So we have a motion of approval on the floor.

317
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:08,445
But I'm going to do it during, as Councilor Longo said, during that paper.

318
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:09,746
People want to vote for it?

319
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:10,967
If not, that's fine.

320
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:15,229
But the money's there, and the need is definitely there on this particular street.

321
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:16,969
And residents have been waiting a long time.

322
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:26,774
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilors Longo, Kern, and Councilor Knight, all those in, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

323
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:28,515
Councilor Scarpelli, yes.

324
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:55,663
The amendment was to have Councilor Scarpelli ask that we have a time frame attached to that and vice-president Yeah, resurface the street have a time frame and vice-president Longo Kern had the amendment to Cost estimate on that

325
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:06,124
And those were the two amendments to the main motion and yours was that it be added to the mayor's capital plan council.

326
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:08,765
So on that motion, madam.

327
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:14,046
Yes.

328
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:15,507
Yes.

329
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,087
Yes.

330
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,608
We had an interruption in the calling of the roll.

331
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:23,009
Seven members in affirmative, none in the negative.

332
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:24,730
The motion passes.

333
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,124
On the motion of Council, it will no longer occur that we return to the regular order of business.

334
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:30,904
All those in favor?

335
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:33,865
All those opposed?

Advertise Medford Mercury May 23rd, 2016.

347
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,506

00:23:51,057 --> 00:24:05,045
in storage of above ground of 579 automotive vehicles, parking garage spaces, with an estimated 11,580 gallons of flammable vehicle gas tanks at 5 Cabot Road.

349
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:10,527
All those in favor, present yourself to the podium in state.

350
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,189
So are you the petitioner?

351

00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:28,112
Yes, sir.

00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:31,374
Anybody else in favor, present yourself to the podium, please.

358
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:33,194
Anyone else in favor?

359
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:38,196
Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting closed.

360
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:44,118
Anybody in opposition to this matter before us, please present yourself to the podium.

361
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,339
Anyone in opposition?

362
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,700
With no one.

363
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:58,641
presenting themselves in opposition, hearing and seeing none, the chair declares that portion of the meeting closed.

364
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:02,163
Mr. Caviello, Chairman of the Licensing Subcommittee.

365
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:04,185
Thank you, Mr. President.

366
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:07,907
Mr. President, I have reviewed the papers and they appear to be in order here.

367
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:15,593
This is for the new parking facility up in Wellington, correct?

368
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:16,133
Along the river?

369
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:17,328
Correct, sir.

370
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:22,470
This is on Cabot Road, the Mill Creek project, the residential project with the above ground parking garage.

371
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,150
Yes, sir.

372
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,951
Can you tell us about the scope of the project and what type of project it is?

373
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:29,091
Certainly.

374
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:29,872
Thank you.

375
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:35,613
The project is approximately 297 residential unit project.

376
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:41,875
It does have 10% affordable units that will be set aside and allocated to a lottery.

377
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:49,770
There are, as Council President read into the record, approximately 579 parking spaces in the parking garage of the building.

378
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:53,914
So we're here for the gasoline in the tanks of those cars.

379
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:56,055
No underground storage tanks or anything like that.

380
00:25:58,317 --> 00:25:58,958
I did receive

381
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:04,268
from the city clerk's office, the sign-offs from the departments.

382
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:15,214
I can submit those into the record if those are not in your packages, but we did receive no substantive comments from the town boards on the application.

383
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:21,158
Madam Vice President.

384
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,059
Thank you.

385
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:28,322
If you, I know in our packet has like a description of the site, so you have the two lots.

386
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:31,543
And then the project site is going to be separate than the garage?

387
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:35,803
Or are we building on top of the garage?

388
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:38,344
So we're not building on top of the garage.

389
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:40,504
Actually, the building is going to wrap around the garage.

390
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:42,025
So you won't be able to see the garage.

391
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:49,486
One of the real benefits in the project is there's a nice open space, a nice park along the river that the project's going to enhance.

392
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:54,187
So what we're doing is wrapping the parking garage with the building so you won't see it when you're outside of it.

393
00:26:55,308 --> 00:26:57,128
But no construction on top of it.

394
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:10,478
And with regards to distances between the lot and the actual units, is there a decent, what's the distance between the lots and the, you know, the lot and the unit when you are talking about that much gasoline?

395
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:11,819
I just.

396
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,941
I do have to move with the project architect.

397
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:16,202
That might be a question for Mr. Carr.

398
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:18,183
Thank you, Mr. Carr.

399
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,305
Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, West Medford.

400
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:22,337
Your question is a good one, Councillor.

401
00:27:22,377 --> 00:27:27,819
There's a firewall around the entire garage, separating the residential use from the garage.

402
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:29,719
The garage is fully sprinkled.

403
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,121
Fire Chief and all the people in this building have signed off on the project.

404
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:36,402
As you know, it's under construction, but it's a very good question.

405
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:42,544
And as I mentioned before, I think that's, well, that's all.

406
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:44,205
Let me know if you have any further questions.

407
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,225
I'm happy to answer them for you.

408
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:49,347
So when you say firewall, if there was an explosion in the garage,

409
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,722
the apartments would be safe, so there's an actual wall, or are you talking about the space?

410
00:27:55,022 --> 00:28:01,424
There's actually a concrete wall, and then there's actually a separate wall, separated from it, where the residents begin.

411
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:08,867
So it's standard construction for when you put a residential building against a parking garage.

412
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:09,767
Great.

413
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:10,187
Thank you, Doug.

414
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:10,988
You're welcome.

415
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:16,190
Mr. Carr.

416
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,310
Thank you.

417
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,531
Mr. President, a motion for approval.

418
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:31,014
Thank you very much.

419
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:31,014
505.

420
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:46,840

Tuesday.

422
00:28:47,807 --> 00:29:15,845
May 31st, 2016, on a petition of National Grid for permission to construct a location of mains for the transmission and distribution of gas in and under the public streets, lanes, highways, and places of the city of Medford and of the pipes, valves, governors, manholes, and other structures, fixtures, and at pertinences designed or intended to protect or operate said mains

423

this work can proceed forthwith, provided the following requirements are met.

428
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:28,194
No city-owned or private utilities or other structures are adversely impacted.

429
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:36,439
National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.

430
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:42,202
The finished trench will consist of a well-compacted gravel and asphalt-based course.

431
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:44,503
Given the routing of the new main,

432
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:52,899
National Grid will pay the city its cost of milling and paving the affected segment of High Street from curb to curb.

433

Plans can be viewed in the City Clerk's office downstairs in City Hall.

438
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:32,586
Chair, we'll open up this portion of the public hearing.

For those who are in favor, anybody in favor of this project, please present yourself to the podium.

440
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:38,670
Is the petitioner present?

441
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,007
Hi, state your name and address for the record, please.

442
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:48,327
Hi, Mr. President.

443
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:49,928
Chris Marr, National Grid.

444
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:51,148
Welcome.

445
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,588
And you are in favor of this?

446
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,249
Yes.

447
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:54,869
Anybody else in favor?

448
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:56,990
Anyone else in favor of this project?

449
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,691
Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting closed.

450
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:02,652
Anybody in opposition to this project?

451
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:04,732
Anyone in opposition?

452
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:12,995
Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the public hearing closed.

453
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:15,056
And the chair recognizes?

454
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:19,644
Councilor Caviello, Chairman of the... Thank you, Mr. President.

455
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:22,627
Mr. President, I've reviewed the documents and I find it to be in order.

456
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:27,210
I'm very happy to see that you are going to be paving crib to crib, is that correct?

457
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:36,318
Yes, I believe, Councilor, that that's gonna be worked out with the City Engineering Office in terms of a contribution that's gonna be done.

458
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:37,819
I believe that this is...

459
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:44,634
Our work is in response to paving that's happening on, I believe, on the side streets.

460
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:53,558
And so we're going to work with the engineering office to have them all paved at one at the same time after our work is completed.

461
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,680
Provided that everything is done correctly.

462
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,961
Mr. President, I have a motion for approval.

463
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,582
The motion approved by Councilor Cavillo.

464
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:03,123
Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

465
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:04,743
I'm sorry.

466
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:07,985
I believe you said working on it.

467
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:08,565
Is it?

468
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,666
So it's not definite that that's part of the, is that read into the, as an agreement?

469
00:33:17,306 --> 00:33:20,028
Okay, okay.

470
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:22,870
Sorry, I might have misspoke.

471
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:29,475
I meant more that once our work with the project is complete, that that will be what happens.

472
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:37,782
I think that one of the biggest concerns are the questions from residents when the utilities do come in and they're supposed to lay

473
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:47,899
the compact and make sure that it's left the way that they found it, that some of the areas in the community are still sinking now.

474
00:33:48,620 --> 00:34:02,552
Can we put an amendment to that to make sure that there's a certain timeline involved with the engineering department to give us help with the timeline, that if that does happen, that there's coverage?

475
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,295
So you'd like an amendment to that?

476
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:17,680
that there's a certain timeline allowed that if that, if this sinkage, that the, the, the department comes back to resurface that.

477
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:18,521
Okay.

478
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:25,365
So, uh, in, I think, uh, by way of ordinance, there's a year, if I'm not mistaken, is that correct?

479
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:28,407
Uh, Mr. Chairman, thank you.

480
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:29,348
Thank you.

481
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:30,409
Very good.

482
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:31,570
Uh, council marks.

483
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,190
Thank you.

484
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:37,041
Roughly, how long will this job take and when will the work be performed?

485
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:42,803
The work will be performed in the near to immediate future.

486
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:49,726
I believe that this is one of our next projects that we have scheduled for this summer, early this summer.

487
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:53,587
Work will probably be commencing, I imagine, in June.

488
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:59,490
And it will typically take, due to the high traffic area, high street,

489
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:05,808
This project may take roughly one to two months.

490
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,009
One to two months?

491
00:35:07,029 --> 00:35:07,249
Yes.

492
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:09,430
And what time of the day will it be done?

493
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:23,494
Our typical work hours are between 7 to 3.30, but typically we work with the city depending on if there's traffic concerns and we have to work restricted hours in certain locations.

494
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:27,995
So you've worked with the police department already?

495
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:29,997
Because this is definitely a high-traveled area.

496
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:31,298
Yes.

497
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:39,203
I don't believe we've reached out to the police department quite yet.

498
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:47,409
I believe we were going to wait from how the grant of vocation hearing came from this meeting.

499
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:53,113
And then we are going to then line up to talk with the chief of police.

500
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:55,834
the police department in terms of details.

501
00:35:57,595 --> 00:36:07,559
Mr. President, maybe at some point there should be a paper added to these reports dealing with traffic impact like we do for many other things in the community.

502
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:22,566
And that may be helpful to see if there is going to be an alternate route that, you know, depending on the type of work and also what manpower is needed to protect the residents of this community around the construction area.

503
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:29,801
I'm not sure when we can discuss that, or maybe if it's a public safety subcommittee can discuss that issue.

504
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,121
But I think it's an important issue, Mr. President.

505
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:32,982
The President Thank you, Counsel.

506
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:33,902
Counsel Knight.

507
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:37,743
Mr. Knight Mr. President, I think Counsel Knox took the words right out of my mouth.

508
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:46,224
A traffic management plan is something that I think we're going to need to start requiring when we start allowing public utilities to open up the ground, Mr. President.

509
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:50,685
And looking at this particular paper, I'm happy to see that the work is going to be

510
00:36:51,182 --> 00:37:05,790
done from curb to curb, and I believe that this is done under a program, I think it's called SRFO or SROF, where the public utility actually gives the city the money, and then the city's responsible for going curb to curb, and the utility's actually going to get out of the pavement business and allow the city to do it.

511
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:08,209
So that I'm very excited about, Mr. President.

512
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:11,612
And that's also something I think we really need to take a long, hot look at and make standard on.

513
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:19,078
You know, we have the residents from Evans Street here talking about how patchwork repairs in the street have created a situation that they're in now where the place is falling apart.

514
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:23,142
And I think that as we move forward and we start opening streets up, we need to

515
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:28,044
really consider going curb-to-curb in the closing up of our streets when the work is done.

516
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:37,269
But with that being said, Mr. President, provided that the public safety impact around our school is going to be addressed, I certainly have no problem with the paper.

517
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,390
Counselor Carfield.

518
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:42,672
Thank you, Mr. President.

519
00:37:42,692 --> 00:37:44,152
And that was one thing I wanted to bring up.

520
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:51,416
You know that it would be advantageous to have this done before September when school starts because that pretty much is right almost in front of the school.

521
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:52,364
Oh, yes.

522
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,265
Counselor, that, that, that will definitely happen.

523
00:37:54,445 --> 00:38:04,188
Um, we are on a timetable because we, we will have to have our work complete in order for this, uh, for the, the street to be repaved at this, um, this fiscal year as well.

524
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:06,728
Mr. President, a motion of approval.

525
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:09,469
Motion approved by Councilor Caffiello.

526
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:10,469
Councilor Falco.

527
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:11,470
Thank you, Mr. President.

528
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:18,732
Uh, through you to, uh, well actually Councilor Knight mentioned something earlier, but you know, uh, National Grid getting out of the paving business.

529
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:18,912
So,

530
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:32,729
which is a good point, if they're giving the money to the city to actually pave the ground, pave the new road curb to curb, what happens in a case where Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned the streets begins to sag?

531
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,130
Who's on the hook for it then?

532
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:41,272
Is that this national grid, you know, are they on the hook to foot the bill again or is that up to the city at that point?

533
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,214
And I'm not sure if anybody knows the answer to that.

534
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:48,675
Maybe that's a question that goes out to the city engineer, but, um,

535
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:52,462
I mean, I think that that's something, that's a question that needs to be asked.

536
00:38:52,522 --> 00:39:01,904
I mean, if National Grid's trying to get out of the paving business, which I understand, and it is curb to curb, I think it's an important question to ask.

537
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:03,684
Because a lot of these things do sag.

538
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:09,466
I cannot offer any amendments because I'm chairing the meeting.

539
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:14,447
But if I were on the floor, my amendment would be have the city engineer

540
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:19,897
be prepared to explain all these matters to us at our budget hearing.

541
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:26,900
Rather than torment her over the expense of money that we spend on rubber jackets for the men.

542
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:43,306
If we could amend the paper then to actually have the city engineer report back to us to find out who is responsible for the additional costs if the road does begin to sag after we've received the funding from national grid.

543
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,463
If I could speak to that briefly.

544
00:39:49,223 --> 00:40:06,289
Typically, if it's determined by the city engineer and National Grid agrees that it's a fault of our own trench, that there is settlement issues following the paving, then that would be something that National Grid would cover.

545
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,390
We guarantee all our trenches.

546
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:15,429
especially immediately following the repaving of the street.

547
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:17,670
So that would be something that National Grid would cover.

548
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:32,214
But if it turned out to be a fault of the paving contractor or something where there was an issue with the pavement that was put down, that would be something that National Grid would not be looking to cover.

549
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:33,594
Okay.

550
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:34,595
That's one of my main concerns.

551
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:38,896
I mean, this is a problem throughout the city where, you know, time goes by.

552
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:44,959
if we know what it sags into the ground, if we know you have potholes and you have a whole street falling apart.

553
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,361
So, um, yeah, I think it's something that we need to have addressed.

554
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:52,143
And if we could have the, uh, city engineer, uh, come back to us with a response.

555
00:40:52,203 --> 00:40:53,003
I greatly appreciate it.

556
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:53,724
Thank you.

557
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:56,905
On the motion approval by Councilor Caviello as amended.

558
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:57,666
Councilor Knight.

559
00:40:57,686 --> 00:40:58,566
Move approval Mr. President.

560
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:00,487
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

561
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:01,448

Aye.

563
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,769

and Underground Conduits, Metro Massachusetts City Clerk's Office.

567
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:22,598
You are hereby notified that by order of the Metro City Council, a public hearing will be given at the Howard F. Alderman Memorial Auditorium, 85 George B. Isis Drive, City Hall, Metro Massachusetts at 7 p.m.

568
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:32,907
on Tuesday, May 31st, 2016 on a petition by National Grid of North Andover, Massachusetts for permission to locate poles, wires, and fixtures

569
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:39,824
including the necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures along and across the following public way.

570
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:40,924
High Street.

571
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:54,869
National grid to remove and relocate a one SO pole on High Street at MH616 to new P26 plus or minus 10, one to two conduit.

572
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:59,591

northwesterly to be fed from manhole 616, a section of 1 to 2-inch conduit to be placed between the pole and the manhole on the sidewalk.

575
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,661
Sidewalk will be restored by a national grid on both sides.

576
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:31,883
Wherefore, it prays that after due notice and hearing as provided by law, it be permitted to excavate the public highways and to run and maintain underground electrical conduits together

577
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,891
with such sustaining and protecting fixtures as it may find necessary for the transmission of electricity.

578
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:47,533
Set underground conduits to be located substantially in accordance with the plan filed here with Mark National Grid, High Street, Metro Massachusetts, number 214991724292016.

579
00:42:49,173 --> 00:42:54,954
This was approved by the city engineer.

580
00:42:55,474 --> 00:43:00,815
Upon review of the petition, this work can be proceeded forthwith, provided the following are met.

581
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:06,083
No city owned or private utilities or other structures are adversely impacted.

582

All impacted sidewalk will be replaced in same or better condition, same or better condition.

584
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:30,710
The existing pole base will be removed and the affected sidewalk panel saw cut

585
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,240
and repoured.

586
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:41,043
There must be a minimum of three foot sidewalk clearance at the location of the new pole in order to meet ADA requirements.

587
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:49,685
Before beginning work, the contractor shall notify big safe dig safe and shall obtain applicable permits from the engineering division.

Good evening.

592
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:26,196
Tim Weifert, National Grid Electric, 170 Medford Street, Malden, Massachusetts.

593
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:27,217
Welcome.

594
00:44:27,317 --> 00:44:28,358
And you are in favor of this?

595
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:28,938
Yes, sir.

596
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:29,715
Thank you.

597
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:31,256
Anybody else in favor?

598
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:32,638
Anybody else in favor?

599
00:44:33,198 --> 00:44:35,800

600
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,661
Anybody in opposition of this?

601
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:42,865
Anybody in opposition of this project of polls being replaced?

602
00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:54,254
Hearing and seeing none, the chair declares this portion of the public hearing closed and recognizes the chairman, Cairo Viello.

603
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:54,775
Mr. Chairman.

604
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:56,276
Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:59,098
Mr. President, I, for one, am glad you're moving this poll.

606
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:01,939
The pole's been knocked down multiple times.

607
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:03,280
It's just on a bad spot.

608
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:13,904
In fact, the last time it was knocked down, I happened to be at the rotary with a truck pulling a trailer, hit the pole, and there was a gentleman walking by, and luckily I missed him.

609
00:45:14,164 --> 00:45:16,806
The guy would have died.

610
00:45:16,906 --> 00:45:17,826
I'm glad you're moving it.

611
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:19,807
Will you be moving it across the street, it looks like?

612
00:45:20,547 --> 00:45:20,827
Yes, sir.

613
00:45:22,128 --> 00:45:26,690
Mr. President, I think this is a good move, and a motion for approval.

614
00:45:28,263 --> 00:45:30,624
I'll have a motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

615
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:32,986
All those in favor?

616
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:34,967
Councilor Marks, please.

617
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:51,335
Just if we could, Mr. President, while we have a representative from National Grid, I was hoping that Tim could take back to his superior the fact that this council is overdue on a report for double polls throughout the community.

618
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:58,159
And if you remember, Mr. President, we were on a quarterly basis with National Grid

619
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:02,776
for a period of time because of the number of double poles throughout this community.

620
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:07,379
And I think over the last year, we kind of let our guard down a little bit.

621
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:12,002
But if you look around the city, you're going to notice an increased number of double poles.

622
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:14,464
And I realize they're not all national grid.

623
00:46:14,964 --> 00:46:19,327
It may be the phone company, it may be the cable company, it may be the city on some of these poles.

624
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:25,972
But I'd appreciate if you could send us a report on, I know there's a,

625
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:34,245
a system that's used, I forget the name of the system, where you guys log in the double polls and who's currently on it.

626
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:35,626
What's the name of the system?

627
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:39,068
I don't personally use a system, but I know what you speak of.

628
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:39,728
There's a system.

629
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:48,994
If you could generate a report on the location, how long the double poll has been there and who is on the poll, that would be helpful to this council.

630
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:49,414
Sure.

631
00:46:49,454 --> 00:46:50,615
I can look into getting that report.

632
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:51,235
Thank you.

633
00:46:52,556 --> 00:46:53,256
Thank you, Mr. President.

634
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:54,577
Thank you, council members.

635
00:46:55,128 --> 00:46:58,330
So on the motion approved by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Marks.

636
00:46:58,691 --> 00:46:59,471
All those in favor?

637
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:00,812
All those opposed?

638
00:47:02,093 --> 00:47:02,454
Thank you.

639
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:03,454
Congratulations.

640
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:04,455
The motion passes.

641
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:06,337
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

642
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,299
16-521, offered by Councilor Knight.

643
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:19,867
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in remembrance of firefighter Timothy Brennan as May 26 marks the one year anniversary of his untimely passing.

644
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:21,888
Be it further resolved that May 31st,

645
00:47:23,237 --> 00:47:28,100
May 31st City Council meeting tonight be dedicated and adjourned in his honor.

646
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,720
Councilor Knight.

647
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,901
Mr. President, thank you very much.

648
00:47:32,722 --> 00:47:46,129
May 26th represents a one-year anniversary of the passing of firefighter Timothy Brennan, a lifelong Metro resident who was known to be seen running around Barry Park as a child and running in and out of burning buildings as a firefighter, Mr. President.

649
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:46,889
He sadly missed.

650
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:51,972
He was a great public servant, but more importantly, he was a great friend and a great family man, Mr. President, and I ask that the council

651
00:47:52,438 --> 00:47:54,939
Indulge me in remembering him on this anniversary date.

652
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,702
Please, if you would all join us in a moment of silence for the deceased Metro Firefighter Brennan.

653
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:14,868
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

654
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:15,668
16-522.

655
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:20,110
Petition for class two auto dealers licensed by Elaine F. Herrera.

656
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:46,136
51 Tufts Street, number two, Somerville, Mass, for A and E auto repair, doing business as A-TEC, 67 Mystic Avenue, Mansford, Mass, on file, business certificate, building department, fire department, police and traffic impact treasurer, letter of compliance, state tax ID number, workman's compensation, bond application.

657
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:50,399
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

658
00:48:51,073 --> 00:48:55,396
I think the petitioner may have left.

659
00:48:55,696 --> 00:49:03,321
She answered a number of questions for us during the public hearing portion.

660
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:12,522
16-522.

661
00:49:12,622 --> 00:49:16,944
I think she might have thought that they were both at the same time when she left.

662
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:21,265
So we can table this and have her come back next week.

663
00:49:22,646 --> 00:49:24,166
Did you have particular questions for her?

664
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:26,727
She should be here.

665
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:27,727
I did have a couple of questions.

666
00:49:27,747 --> 00:49:31,709
On the motion of council, can I have you all to the table, all those in favor?

667
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:34,830
All those opposed?

668
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:40,852
16-523, petition by Eric M. Reed, 158 Jerome Street, Medford, to address the city council on infrastructure.

669
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:44,647
Good evening, everybody.

670
00:49:45,888 --> 00:49:46,909
My name is Eric Reed.

671
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:50,111
I'm not used to this mic, so do I sound all right?

672
00:49:51,512 --> 00:49:56,576
I live at 158 Jerome Street, and I'm here to discuss Medford infrastructure.

673
00:49:58,277 --> 00:50:00,699
Evans Street was one of the topics of my conversation.

674
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:12,688
I know you just mentioned resurfacing that road, but it's also going to need a new gas main and most probably a new water main before you can resurface it because nobody's been around there in 68 years.

675
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:18,320
So you should consider that as part of your schedule.

676
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:20,702
So I just want to read my petition.

677
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:26,525
I've been trying to contact the mayor's office regarding infrastructure since January 1, and she hasn't responded.

678
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:33,749
So I have all the documentation over here, which I want to leave with the council as part of the official record.

679
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,691
And for now, I'm going to read my petition.

680
00:50:38,532 --> 00:50:43,375
First, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the brave men and women of our armed services

681
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,371
including the police, for protecting our cherished freedoms.

682
00:50:48,611 --> 00:51:00,335
Thank you, Mayor Stephanie, for reminding us at the Veterans Memorial Service yesterday that freedom of speech and religion are our cherished rights because they are essential to protecting human dignity.

683
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:08,037
I thank all servicemen and women and veterans again for affording me the right to be here before the Honorable City Council.

684
00:51:09,557 --> 00:51:09,977
In peace.

685
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:12,178
And now,

686
00:51:12,993 --> 00:51:13,874
to the petition.

687
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:26,446
I'm here to petition the mayor's office to respond to my correspondence, seven months worth of correspondence, and numerous calls to her office which have been completely ignored.

688
00:51:28,107 --> 00:51:35,875
Having worked for the engineering department last summer for five months, I have some major concerns regarding improvements to Medford infrastructure.

689
00:51:37,236 --> 00:51:38,357
And now I'm going to read

690
00:51:39,545 --> 00:51:41,787
The petition, it's actually in a petition format.

691
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:43,008
It wasn't sent to anybody.

692
00:51:43,048 --> 00:51:43,829
I'm going to read it here.

693
00:51:45,530 --> 00:52:00,243
Whereas numerous roadways in Medford are in disrepair, water mains are in need of replacement, drainage and sewer systems are in need of work, numerous neighborhoods have been waiting for years for promised improvements yet to materialize.

694
00:52:01,464 --> 00:52:05,347
Whereas close to $10 million of state funds are available for this work,

695
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:31,874
whereas the citizens and taxpayers of Medford have a right to know how our tax money is being spent, whereas you made commitments in your campaign to openness, transparency, communication, accountability, and performance, whereas you state on your website you have completed budget reviews for all departments, whereas Water Project's plans for construction as far back as 2014 have not started yet.

696
00:52:35,274 --> 00:52:40,537
This would indicate that other streets needing work, such as Evans, are simply added to the backlog.

697
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,800
So projects removing inflow and infiltration have been put on hold.

698
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:59,287
We, the citizens of Medford, request the complete inventory of all engineering department projects in planning, out for bid, and under construction with a status and budget summary.

699
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:02,569
So water.

700
00:53:04,252 --> 00:53:12,899
It is imperative that Medford complete essential water main replacement work this construction season, and it is already very late to get started.

701
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:22,887
Our streets such as Gurley, Dwyer, Evans could have been done last year, but the engineering department said they did not have the budget.

702
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:31,935
This does not match the posted water main repair allocations for cities and towns on the MWRA website.

703
00:53:32,562 --> 00:53:40,686
which indicates that they have $4 million available for water main repair, which hasn't been used.

704
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,348
As a matter of fact, it's a 10-year allocation.

705
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:52,592
We're starting year seven of this $7 million 10-year allocation, and we haven't spent a penny.

706
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:56,654
So that's water.

707
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:00,062
Sewer is more or less similar.

708
00:54:00,383 --> 00:54:09,229
Preventing sewer inflow and infiltration into the system and upkeep is an ongoing effort for any municipality.

709
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:15,113
The city engineer stated the department is not interested in pursuing this work.

710
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:22,058
The current unused MWRA I&I allocation for Medford is now near $4 million at 75% grant.

711
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:32,980
Misusing or not using these funds is an extreme disservice to Medford residents.

712
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:38,943
Please explain the status of this account and the ongoing efforts to improve the sewer systems.

713
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:41,064
Now roadways.

714
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:49,328
Many roadways are in need of repair and we have received another $1 million of Chapter 90 for this year.

715
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:53,010
What is the status of the roadway repair plans?

716
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:56,332
Evans should have been done last year.

717
00:54:58,388 --> 00:54:59,549
but it's still not done.

718
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:06,714
The city has applied for $400,000 of state funding for sidewalk repair.

719
00:55:07,014 --> 00:55:08,836
How will this effort be implemented?

720
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:21,765
Not to complete essential projects this season aggressively is not in keeping with the mission of City Hall or the performance and accountability standards the citizenry deserve.

721
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:24,347
Another construction season is here,

722
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:28,673
and we cannot afford more lost opportunity.

723
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:34,275
And that was the petition.

724
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:50,201
So now, I would like to submit the body of correspondence from me to the mayor's office, which I consider public, to be included in the city council official records.

725
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:51,741
Thank you very much.

726
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:53,562
Here, take this with you, sir.

727
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:04,535
Yeah, which I consider public to be included in the city council official records, hopefully part of this meeting records.

728
00:56:05,656 --> 00:56:11,339
I know there's a lot of paper over there, but computers have a lot of storage these days, so it's no big deal.

729
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:22,747
To be included in city council official records so the general public may have access to this information regarding city of Medford engineering and construction policy.

730
00:56:24,018 --> 00:56:31,542
I hope this information will help Medford residents and I get real and deliberate answers from the mayor's office regarding these issues.

731
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:40,326
I am here to petition for a meeting with the mayor to discuss her construction implementation plans for this summer.

732
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:51,071
So in summary, the engineering department stated last summer they did not have the budget to do water main replacement,

733
00:56:51,598 --> 00:57:02,685
on Gurley, Dwyer, or Evans Street, which I was pushing for, because they need to be reconstructed, and you can't reconstruct them unless the water main has been fixed first.

734
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:05,286
Otherwise, you ruin your paving job.

735
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:16,453
So the MWRA site indicates they have $4 million available for this water work for Medford.

736
00:57:17,472 --> 00:57:28,400
The engineering department stated they were not interested in pursuing I&I sewer work while Medford had $3 million in the MWRA account at 75% grant.

737
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:38,787
We are applying for $400,000 of state funds for sidewalk repair.

738
00:57:41,669 --> 00:57:45,052
With limited resources to implement this program,

739
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,351
Why hasn't construction started yet?

740
00:57:49,551 --> 00:57:52,753
Our season is flying by and it appears we are not prepared.

741
00:57:52,773 --> 00:58:08,600
And so my offer to the mayor, in the correspondence you'll see I have numerous offers and suggestions to the mayor trying to push all of this infrastructure work.

742
00:58:09,621 --> 00:58:16,584
My offer to the mayor outlines what I think is a creative way for the engineering department to get needed help paid for by state,

743
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,186
and not city tax revenue.

744
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:21,347
It's included in the package.

745
00:58:21,987 --> 00:58:25,989
This is a freebie and a windfall for the city, and I still can't get a response.

746
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:44,998
These are some of my observations and concerns, which are critical, especially when the engineering department and DPW say they are not interested in speaking to me, and the mayor hasn't released these budgets yet anyway.

747
00:58:45,198 --> 00:58:45,898
Could this be true?

748
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:49,408
So let me read that again, because it confused me.

749
00:58:49,668 --> 00:58:51,089
Sir, you have one minute left.

750
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:51,689
All right.

751
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:59,711
I encourage everyone who cares to read the backup material I have provided to the City Council.

752
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:04,873
I hope you members of the City Council also take the initiative to read the material.

753
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:08,675
It will provide an insight into how decisions are made at City Hall.

754
00:59:09,635 --> 00:59:15,657
General public, please feel free to contact me with questions, concerns, or ideas.

755
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:26,287
My information, my contact information is on the documentation I have submitted and hopefully the general public will be able to see that.

756
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:36,151
Once again, I'm here to petition for a meeting with the mayor to discuss her construction implementation plans for this summer.

757
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:40,394
Thanks again for the opportunity to speak before city council.

758
00:59:41,694 --> 00:59:42,875
Sincerely, Eric.

759
00:59:44,736 --> 00:59:45,456
Thank you, Mr. Reed.

760
00:59:45,975 --> 00:59:47,956
May I chair recognizes Madam Vice President.

761
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:48,796
Thank you.

762
00:59:48,856 --> 00:59:53,357
Eric, if you don't mind, through the chair, you said you worked for the city of Medford?

763
00:59:53,777 --> 00:59:56,878
I worked as a temp last summer for five months.

764
00:59:58,278 --> 01:00:00,819
And what was your, what title position did you hold?

765
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:01,739
Engineer.

766
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:02,499
Oh.

767
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,641
And we accomplished quite a bit last summer.

768
01:00:08,701 --> 01:00:10,581
I started off doing the pothole repairs.

769
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:13,442
We went off, moved on to sidewalks.

770
01:00:14,831 --> 01:00:18,254
I did a lot of the running around, all the measuring to get all these streets done.

771
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:32,128
I measured all of those streets up, got them ready for paving, and I did the drainage work over there at Boston Ave and Arlington and Forest Street.

772
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:38,013
So I got quite a chunk done, and then I was let go.

773
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:48,706
And if you look at all the proposals I actually applied, you know, I offered to help engineering, and I had an outline to get all this street work done.

774
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:51,969
And I was constantly told that they're not interested in doing it.

775
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:53,470
So here I am.

776
01:00:54,030 --> 01:01:10,162
I still, it doesn't seem reasonable to me that that would be the answer, an appropriate answer from City Hall, that we have all this money, we have streets falling apart like Evans, and we're told that we're not

777
01:01:10,988 --> 01:01:21,172
They're not interested in doing that work, that they don't have the budget when MWRA website clearly indicates that we have plenty of money there to do the work.

778
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:28,035
And when you had mentioned the $3 to $4 million with the 75% grant for sewer and then $4 million for water, so that's about $7 million.

779
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,306
in the MWRA that we could be applying for?

780
01:01:34,326 --> 01:01:34,807
Is that what you mean?

781
01:01:34,867 --> 01:01:36,429
Absolutely, yes.

782
01:01:36,689 --> 01:01:45,982
I asked these questions of the mayor's office, and when I didn't get any response, I went on Google, and it all came right up.

783
01:01:47,421 --> 01:01:50,022
And these are the 0% loans or full grants?

784
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:51,423
Well, they vary.

785
01:01:51,463 --> 01:01:56,985
I mean, I don't know what the conditions are on the water, but it's very generous terms, obviously.

786
01:01:57,265 --> 01:02:00,146
But I know on the I&I, it's 75% grant.

787
01:02:00,186 --> 01:02:00,966
You can't beat that.

788
01:02:03,327 --> 01:02:04,488
No, I thank you for your hard work.

789
01:02:04,528 --> 01:02:08,229
I know probably Councilman Maxwell will talk about the inflow infiltration.

790
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:11,750
I know we have some serious work that needs to be done in Medford.

791
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:16,012
And we did grill the city engineer last budget

792
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:27,447
Well, you know, I was, I was working on removing, uh, I and I three cash basins from, uh, a sewer line on, uh, what's that street called?

793
01:02:27,507 --> 01:02:28,467
Right next to golden.

794
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:30,268
I forgot the name of the street.

795
01:02:30,328 --> 01:02:33,850
It's by, uh, McCarthy storage, Alexander or Frederick.

796
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,852
Uh, anyway, it doesn't matter.

797
01:02:37,872 --> 01:02:39,472
It's the street down there full.

798
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,134
No, it's right next to golden.

799
01:02:43,354 --> 01:02:44,855
It's between Harvard and golden.

800
01:02:45,606 --> 01:02:46,226
I forget the name.

801
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:50,708
It's the, so anyway, we're working on that.

802
01:02:50,848 --> 01:02:52,649
And even that was stopped.

803
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:55,010
There's a whole bunch of stuff we could have had.

804
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,590
I don't know.

805
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,871
I don't want to talk too much.

806
01:02:56,951 --> 01:03:10,277
I don't want to take up too much of your time, but these are issues which I would hope people consider seriously because as you can see, they're starting to impact Medford residents in a public safety manner.

807
01:03:10,597 --> 01:03:11,017
Thank you.

808
01:03:11,477 --> 01:03:11,837
Thank you.

809
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,518
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

810
01:03:13,905 --> 01:03:14,546
Thank you, Mr. President.

811
01:03:14,706 --> 01:03:18,509
Mr. President, if we could, um, forward this paper to the city engineer.

812
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:24,333
On the motion for Councilor Caviello to forward the paper to the city engineer for commentary.

813
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,195
On that motion, Councilor Marks.

814
01:03:26,995 --> 01:03:31,159
And also, uh, to discuss an implementation plan with the mayor.

815
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,700
Thank you, Mr. President.

816
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:36,082
Uh, and thank you, Mr. Reed, for your presentation.

817
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:36,783
Um,

818
01:03:37,528 --> 01:03:53,941
I'd like to hear a little more about what your thoughts are or reasoning why, if there's funding available from the MWRA, what is the biggest hurdle in this city to not moving forward on some of these projects that are so much needed in this community?

819
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:55,962
You know, I've got to be honest with you.

820
01:03:56,943 --> 01:03:58,324
I'm trying to get answers to that.

821
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:01,627
I can't get any reasonable answers, but from my perspective,

822
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:04,806
We had Gurley Dwyer and Evans Street.

823
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:05,726
I was pushing.

824
01:04:05,766 --> 01:04:06,386
They were slated.

825
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,087
All the documentation was on my computer, okay?

826
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,307
We would have pushed them out.

827
01:04:12,187 --> 01:04:13,128
I was into budgets.

828
01:04:13,188 --> 01:04:14,088
I was into working.

829
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:18,549
And so I don't know why that happened.

830
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:20,329
I really have no idea.

831
01:04:20,349 --> 01:04:21,870
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

832
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,410
Is it a lack of manpower?

833
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,371
Is it a lack of leadership?

834
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:27,271
Well, right now, clearly there's a lack.

835
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:28,371
I mean, it has to be something.

836
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:30,332
You were in the department for five months.

837
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:32,192
You must have some indication why.

838
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:33,333
There's no communication.

839
01:04:33,353 --> 01:04:34,414
No communication.

840
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:36,436
I went out and did everything on my own initiative.

841
01:04:36,476 --> 01:04:45,183
I worked very well with Mark Shea, who is very good with field work and on the construction side.

842
01:04:47,045 --> 01:04:48,806
I think we got a lot done.

843
01:04:50,207 --> 01:04:55,752
But as far as policy goes, I have no idea what the thought process is.

844
01:04:56,432 --> 01:04:57,834
I'm trying to figure that out myself.

845
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:11,395
You know, I was shocked to find that the money was sitting there in such large sums recently after being told last summer that we didn't have budget to do a mountain of work that I was proposing.

846
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:21,857
And if you read the documentation carefully, hopefully you'll be able to scan it and put it online, you'll see that there just

847
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,282
leaves big questions, not good questions, very big questions.

848
01:05:27,702 --> 01:05:38,188
So ultimately, in the engineer's office, who would be responsible for making sure that Medford takes advantage of these particular loans and grants from the MWRA?

849
01:05:38,849 --> 01:05:46,393
Well, as an engineer, from my perspective, it's the responsibility of the engineering department to track

850
01:05:46,934 --> 01:05:54,917
the condition of Medford infrastructure, and make prioritized repairs, prepare the plans, prepare the design.

851
01:05:55,177 --> 01:05:55,878
Who in particular?

852
01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:58,278
It would have to be the leadership of the department.

853
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,540
So the chief engineer would be responsible?

854
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:07,802
Well, technically, well, in any department, the leader obviously would define the mission.

855
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:11,544
I'm just going to caution that we not move to impugn anyone.

856
01:06:11,584 --> 01:06:12,504
Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

857
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:14,009
Thank you.

858
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:17,453
Well, you've made a lot of accusations, sir.

859
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:21,859
So, you know, I don't think it's fair to... Budgets are budgets.

860
01:06:21,919 --> 01:06:23,100
I'm not accusing anybody.

861
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:32,111
No, you're not accusing, but when I'm asking the questions on where has there been a lack of communication and where is the process failed,

862
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:37,284
I mean, I think those are legit questions, and you were there for five months, and that's why I'm asking these questions.

863
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:40,625
Who would know best than someone that worked in the department?

864
01:06:41,485 --> 01:06:53,810
And if there is funding available, and we were told on many occasions, because as you mentioned, Mr. Reed, that many of these grants and programs that are run by the MWRA are lengthy in nature.

865
01:06:54,510 --> 01:07:00,332
And if you don't take advantage in one year, you can actually take advantage the following year on projects.

866
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:02,822
as long as you have a plan in place.

867
01:07:03,123 --> 01:07:23,307
So I've been told in the past that the city of Method has exhausted all the revenue or funds, I should say, available from the MWRA and even the zero interest free loans that are, I think, outside of what you've discussed regarding what's available.

868
01:07:23,787 --> 01:07:29,428
So I'm very concerned that if there is funding that the city is not taking advantage

869
01:07:29,781 --> 01:07:33,603
This council has talked ad nauseam about INI.

870
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,665
I think we're at about 50% inflow and infiltration.

871
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:47,431
It's costing the rate payers that pay water and sewer in this community millions of dollars to pay for inflow and infiltration and treat it as raw sewage.

872
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:52,414
The leak detection program is another issue that we've had in this community.

873
01:07:52,514 --> 01:07:54,815
And so I'm very concerned.

874
01:07:55,135 --> 01:07:56,456
I agree with Councilor Caviello.

875
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:58,477
I think this paper should be forwarded to

876
01:07:58,924 --> 01:08:00,425
the city engineer for response.

877
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:08,831
Um, and also if need be that, uh, the mayor get involved, uh, to find out, uh, why we're not moving forward on projects.

878
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:17,597
Uh, if, if that is the case that Evans street, uh, you were working on a project on Evans street for the water main back some time ago, you're right.

879
01:08:17,637 --> 01:08:23,281
It wouldn't make any sense for this council to approve the repaving of Evans street if the water main wasn't done.

880
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:24,902
So that's the first I'm hearing.

881
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:38,902
Well, this is why I was trying to push so hard, because recognizing that it takes a year to get good settlement, you know, like your problem, the gas company, we don't want our water mains to do the same thing, have trench settlement.

882
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:45,143
So the idea is to get the water main done the year prior and then move in next year and do the roadway repair.

883
01:08:45,304 --> 01:08:49,104
You know, you've got to remind the gas company they've got to jump on Evans Street too.

884
01:08:51,485 --> 01:08:53,105
And that's how normally it's done, but now we're

885
01:08:54,615 --> 01:08:56,196
and everything's pushed out another year.

886
01:08:56,256 --> 01:08:58,996
Water main wasn't done last year, so now what does that mean?

887
01:08:59,036 --> 01:09:02,197
They gotta wait another year for the roadway to get done?

888
01:09:03,718 --> 01:09:04,438
That's where we're at.

889
01:09:04,718 --> 01:09:05,918
That's basically where we're at.

890
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:06,639
Thank you.

891
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:08,159
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

892
01:09:08,559 --> 01:09:13,761
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, that this paper be forwarded to the city engineer.

893
01:09:15,341 --> 01:09:16,181
Madam Vice President.

894
01:09:16,201 --> 01:09:16,401
Thank you.

895
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:21,823
Just as an amendment, if we could get a response also from the mayor's office with regards to that package.

896
01:09:22,293 --> 01:09:26,274
And if we can be scanned the documents, I know we can go to the city clerk and get them.

897
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:37,637
But if the council could be scanned, um, what you had given us so that we can review it at our own leisure at home, the entire packet was sent to us in our weekend packets on Friday.

898
01:09:40,478 --> 01:09:40,858
Thank you.

899
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:41,198
Thank you.

900
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:48,400
On that emotion of a amendment by vice-president long occur, sir, please state your name and address for the record.

901
01:09:49,003 --> 01:09:50,004
Thank you, Mr. President.

902
01:09:50,304 --> 01:09:52,326
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

903
01:09:54,047 --> 01:10:01,333
Just to address some of the things that were talked about here, I don't think Mr. Reid was coming up here to try to be accusatory.

904
01:10:01,813 --> 01:10:11,681
I just think he was asking for accountability and transparency on issues that have been going on in the city of Medford for years, if not decades.

905
01:10:12,281 --> 01:10:17,325
When I ran for this body in 2013, my main issue was the water pipes.

906
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:22,367
You're asking the citizens of Medford to pay for the rainwater in the snow melt.

907
01:10:23,107 --> 01:10:32,295
You add that to the meals tax, the sales tax, the property tax, which is about to have a surcharge put on it, and we want answers as to why things are not being done.

908
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:38,680
The Honorable Mike Marks asks, well, where do you think that the lack of communication came?

909
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,885
Well, you heard my neighbor and friend earlier tonight say four recent

910
01:10:45,878 --> 01:10:51,759
additions to C-Click Fix were taken down today as resolved, and obviously they're not.

911
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:53,280
Those pictures I took were yesterday.

912
01:10:53,780 --> 01:11:03,602
This gentleman is talking about a state allocation of $4 million that we could be using on top of what is in the excess of the water account now.

913
01:11:03,942 --> 01:11:08,103
It's like $7 million or something like that was the last report I heard.

914
01:11:08,523 --> 01:11:10,104
Now we're talking about $10 or $11 million.

915
01:11:12,453 --> 01:11:16,034
It doesn't need to be discussed or pushed forward anymore.

916
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:21,137
It's not just Devon Street, it's also Pinkard Street around the corner from me.

917
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:37,847
In working on several campaigns that I've worked on and ballot initiatives, walking around the city through the Heights, through South Medford, it's literally the whole city, with some streets being at an emergency condition, with matters of public safety.

918
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:47,300
we're asking questions about all the tax dollars that we pay and the fees that we pay, the parking meters, people paying after six o'clock.

919
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,502
I mean, where is all this money going?

920
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:56,207
I think it's not being done because it looks great sitting in the accounts.

921
01:11:56,267 --> 01:12:06,175
And then Medford elected public servants can go around and say, well, Moody's just upgraded our credit rating to AAA.

922
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:08,017
And yeah, that's great.

923
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:22,687
on paper, but when you look through and walk through the city and you're wondering why communications are going ignored from people who work for the city, and you ask a question, it's like, where's the problems and where's the miscommunications?

924
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:23,668
It's right there.

925
01:12:23,908 --> 01:12:32,812
And we're just asking for the work to be done that has been years in dire need of it happening.

926
01:12:33,913 --> 01:12:35,254
You got the budget next month.

927
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:37,775
I hope a lot of people will come down.

928
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:53,905
and ask questions and hold you folks accountable and transparent to the citizens that are paying for all of this, that are not getting anything back when Dr. Stirello talked about the police department deficiencies.

929
01:12:54,685 --> 01:13:01,792
I hope people will come tomorrow night to the town hall that the chief will have at the police station.

930
01:13:02,388 --> 01:13:03,368
and ask questions there.

931
01:13:03,768 --> 01:13:11,630
But I know you sigh, and I'm talking, and I'm taking too much time, President De La Russo, but these are very important things.

932
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:12,870
It's a matter of public safety.

933
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:19,091
It's a matter of work not getting done with all of the money sitting there when petitions are being ignored for months.

934
01:13:20,931 --> 01:13:29,453
I'm sorry, but it's really at the brink, and this body really needs to come together and do something to light a fire under this.

935
01:13:29,533 --> 01:13:30,453
Thank you, Mr. President.

936
01:13:35,273 --> 01:13:38,674
All those in favor.

937
01:13:39,234 --> 01:13:43,935
Yes, I just want to emphasize that it's not budgets, it's really implementation.

938
01:13:44,355 --> 01:13:45,696
We need implementation.

939
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:56,038
Because we can talk about budgets till we're blue in the face, but until people actually get together and figure out how we're going to get this done and come up with a real plan, it's just talk.

940
01:13:58,359 --> 01:13:59,699
On that motion, all those in favor?

941
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:00,780
All those opposed?

942
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:23,878
Reports of committee 16-5 24 committee of the whole report from May 25th 2016 on municipal aggregation We of the whole met last week Wednesday at 6 o'clock and the council office to hear a presentation on municipal electrical aggregation from the office of

943
01:14:27,021 --> 01:14:31,003
The environment, I think they call themselves the Office of Sustainability now.

944
01:14:32,084 --> 01:14:35,446
The purpose was to review and discuss the paper on municipal aggregation.

945
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:41,830
There was an authorization plan presented to us, a rather steep schedule.

946
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:46,452
There was a presentation to us on what is municipal aggregation.

947
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:53,917
Homeowners would be able to choose which electric company they want, National Grid or Good Energy or others.

948
01:14:54,483 --> 01:14:57,045
There will be a public hearing for people to sign up to.

949
01:14:57,065 --> 01:15:02,269
There was a request to check other cities and towns to see how they may have dropped out.

950
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:08,334
And upon the motion of Councilor Caviello, the paper was reported out of the committee, and that motion passed.

951
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:22,725
We are expecting in the coming weeks a presentation before us from the Office of Energy Environment on this matter, but you had presented to you

952
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:37,116
a rather detailed explanation of the process, and I know Alicia Hunt is available to all of you to answer any of your questions you might have on the matter.

953
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:50,224
On the motion of Councilor Kerrio to receive and place on file, all those in favor?

954
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:51,224
All those opposed?

955
01:15:51,244 --> 01:15:51,865
Motion carries.

956
01:15:53,122 --> 01:16:00,466
Uh, papers in the hands of the clerk by the, uh, request to council Cavill to, uh, take papers in the hand of the clerk under suspension.

957
01:16:00,506 --> 01:16:13,633
All those in favor, all those opposed offered by president Della Russo be resolved that the Medford city council offered sincere condolences to the family of the Reverend Francis Garrity on his recent passing father Garrity served at St.

958
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:14,434
Raphael parish.

959
01:16:14,954 --> 01:16:15,874
He was pastor of St.

960
01:16:15,914 --> 01:16:20,757
Francis of Assisi parish and also served for many years of the as chaplain

961
01:16:21,232 --> 01:16:22,893
of Medford Police Department.

962
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,834
And I might add, he's a fellow alumnus of St.

963
01:16:25,874 --> 01:16:26,635
Anselm College.

964
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:33,858
So if you would rise and join me in a moment of silence for this good priest and good former citizen of Medford.

965
01:16:43,623 --> 01:16:49,807
Offered by Councilor Caviello, it will be resolved that the Medford City Council discuss Republic Park ticketing

966
01:16:51,154 --> 01:16:59,376
of Gaston Street, the first day after Memorial Day, starting at 6 p.m.

967
01:16:59,436 --> 01:17:01,876
Councilor Caviello, 6 a.m., I'm sorry.

968
01:17:01,896 --> 01:17:02,816
Thank you, Mr. President.

969
01:17:03,597 --> 01:17:11,658
This morning, my day started actually early with emails from a resident about cars being ticketed 6 a.m.

970
01:17:11,758 --> 01:17:13,198
on Gaston Street.

971
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:20,660
And I made some phone calls around, and I was informed that there were signs up there saying that

972
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:26,488
Permit parking is because of the pawns, rights pawns.

973
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:33,333
Permit parking is from Memorial Day to Labor Day, which is fine.

974
01:17:33,353 --> 01:17:42,159
But I mean, they had to wait the first thing in the morning at 6 AM to start hitting these people with tickets without giving them any notice.

975
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:50,865
I mean, it's kind of been a lax thing over the years, but I would have think that the people could have at least given a few days to get the permits.

976
01:17:51,493 --> 01:17:54,755
rather than start ticketing, Mr. President, at 6 a.m.

977
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:55,215
In the morning.

978
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,437
I mean, you know, talk about taking the low-hanging fruit.

979
01:17:59,938 --> 01:18:00,419
Very sad.

980
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:05,582
It's very sad, and I would think we need some type of vaccination.

981
01:18:05,622 --> 01:18:09,144
These people need maybe a little bit of time to go out and get the permit.

982
01:18:09,945 --> 01:18:19,051
You know, just, you know, say one day after the holiday, it's kind of, you know, I understand there is a sign there, but, you know, I think a little leeway would have been nice.

983
01:18:21,684 --> 01:18:21,984
Thank you.

984
01:18:22,004 --> 01:18:25,087
I think counsel Carviello hit the nail on the head.

985
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,348
I too got the e-mails.

986
01:18:26,388 --> 01:18:33,134
A lot of upset people who went out to work, said they were going to get the permit, you know, this week, and they have a ticket on their car.

987
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:35,476
It had to have come 6, 630 in the morning.

988
01:18:35,496 --> 01:18:41,821
I just feel like some warning should have been given or at least, you know, a couple days leeway for them to obtain the permit.

989
01:18:42,682 --> 01:18:49,247
I think the way it's worked in the past years is they've had a week or two to get their permit before the city jumped on it.

990
01:18:50,835 --> 01:19:03,346
low way on how to collect revenue, where there is obviously other violations that aren't enforced at all, such as parking on some of our sidewalks in the city that really should have the attention.

991
01:19:03,926 --> 01:19:07,529
And we don't give the attention to those types of violations.

992
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:08,710
So it is unfortunate.

993
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:11,633
It felt terrible for the person, although there is signs up there.

994
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:26,524
And I hope that while the city solicitor and the mayor are looking into the issues with regards to the sale of Republic, that some of these things are addressed and discussed.

995
01:19:26,644 --> 01:19:34,167
And we make improvements through the whole system, obviously not the one or two little things that have been improved upon so far.

996
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:36,488
But we really need some serious improvement.

997
01:19:36,508 --> 01:19:40,250
Mr. President, I would hope that the mayor's office would look into this matter.

998
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,624
and hopefully make a recommendation to our republic to give these people a little bit of liberty in getting a permit.

999
01:19:48,024 --> 01:19:50,546
On the motion, I'll caveat that these people be given a break.

1000
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:51,466
Councilor Knight.

1001
01:19:51,947 --> 01:19:57,730
Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to request that the traffic commission waive the tickets for all residents who purchase a permit.

1002
01:19:58,771 --> 01:20:01,533
Same thing, but at least we can make official action of the traffic commission.

1003
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:03,854
As amended by Councilor Knight.

1004
01:20:04,194 --> 01:20:04,955
Councilor Marks.

1005
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:06,876
Thank you, Mr. President.

1006
01:20:06,896 --> 01:20:08,617
I think what we're seeing now is that

1007
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:17,614
When you looked at the last financial report, it's clear to me that Republic is not taking in the money they expected.

1008
01:20:18,475 --> 01:20:26,179
And these are the type of things we're seeing now throughout the community, is that they're generating revenue any way they can.

1009
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,540
And you're absolutely right.

1010
01:20:29,261 --> 01:20:35,424
You know, when you outsource a program and lose local control, this is what happens.

1011
01:20:35,904 --> 01:20:37,265
This is exactly what happens.

1012
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:48,785
Because if this was done in-house, like the original recommendation, we would have total control over what happens with the program, when the ticketing takes place, and how aggressive you're going to be.

1013
01:20:49,446 --> 01:20:53,889
We were always told by Mae McGlynn, this program is not a revenue generator.

1014
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:58,712
It's just to provide parking enforcement and public safety in the community.

1015
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:05,071
And, you know, you bet your bottom dollar that when you hire an outside company, that's not their train of thought.

1016
01:21:05,691 --> 01:21:09,313
Their train of thought is how much money and where can we maximize our money.

1017
01:21:09,894 --> 01:21:11,634
And so that's what we're seeing right now.

1018
01:21:12,275 --> 01:21:13,235
This is no secret.

1019
01:21:13,996 --> 01:21:15,356
You know, we knew this was going to happen.

1020
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:22,980
And when revenue starts to drop, we're going to find more and more angles that Republic is going to use to generate money.

1021
01:21:23,361 --> 01:21:25,081
So this is just the tip of the iceberg.

1022
01:21:25,702 --> 01:21:27,983
You know, it'd be nice if I agree with Councilor

1023
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:35,569
Councilor Caviello, Councilor Longo, and Councilor Knight's recommendation about asking that they receive their money back.

1024
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:39,250
However, I think we should take it one step further.

1025
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:50,573
And we heard from the mayor tonight that seniors are gonna be allowed to pay $25 up front for a senior pass per year.

1026
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:57,435
And the seniors I've spoken with are still waiting for the free parking for seniors.

1027
01:21:57,878 --> 01:22:04,143
that they were promised back some seven or eight months ago that seniors wouldn't have to pay for parking in this community.

1028
01:22:04,624 --> 01:22:11,009
So I'm a little disappointed in the negotiations that have taken place between the administration and Republic.

1029
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:25,661
And I think what we're seeing right now is a company running rampant in this community and really not caring what the administration has to say or what the administration wants to do about improving

1030
01:22:27,146 --> 01:22:28,846
the traffic enforcement in this city.

1031
01:22:28,886 --> 01:22:36,328
So I think, Mr. President, that, you know, Councilor Caviello, I think you called for a meeting with Republic.

1032
01:22:37,449 --> 01:22:39,209
I'm not sure why we can't meet with them.

1033
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:40,689
Maybe because we don't sign the contract.

1034
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:42,250
We can't meet with Republic.

1035
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:53,453
Is there a reason, Mr. President, why we can't meet with Republic?

1036
01:22:53,513 --> 01:22:53,713
Right.

1037
01:22:53,993 --> 01:22:55,313
I think it's only appropriate now.

1038
01:22:55,732 --> 01:22:57,413
We're the ones fielding the phone calls.

1039
01:22:57,693 --> 01:23:02,994
We're the ones getting the emails from angry residents that are concerned why they're getting ticketed and tagged.

1040
01:23:03,874 --> 01:23:07,956
So, I think a meeting immediately, Mr. President, is appropriate.

1041
01:23:08,696 --> 01:23:09,096
Thank you.

1042
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:12,577
Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

1043
01:23:12,977 --> 01:23:15,458
Welcome, and please state your unanimous address for the record.

1044
01:23:15,918 --> 01:23:16,958
Thank you, Mr. President.

1045
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:19,319
Rob Capucci again, 71 Evans Street.

1046
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:21,540
There's another issue going on at Republic.

1047
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,581
I'm not sure or not if it's supposed to.

1048
01:23:24,661 --> 01:23:25,401
I believe it is.

1049
01:23:25,885 --> 01:23:28,467
But these machines are supposed to shut down at 6 o'clock.

1050
01:23:28,847 --> 01:23:29,307
They're not.

1051
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:42,317
In the last month and a half, just walking through the city, I told a good dozen people, just tonight, I went to the store before coming here, and at 6.40, there was a young lady starting to feed money into the meter.

1052
01:23:42,657 --> 01:23:44,679
And I said, no, you don't have to pay right now.

1053
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:45,799
It's 6 o'clock.

1054
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,081
And she said, well, I didn't know that.

1055
01:23:48,121 --> 01:23:51,423
And I said, well, it's on the parking sign, but it's written very small.

1056
01:23:51,744 --> 01:23:55,046
She said, well, it would have been a little bit more helpful if it was actually on the meter.

1057
01:23:55,428 --> 01:23:57,989
itself, that it closes at 6 o'clock.

1058
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,591
The machines lock at 6 o'clock.

1059
01:24:01,651 --> 01:24:04,432
You cannot put any more money in.

1060
01:24:04,912 --> 01:24:05,792
I've tried it myself.

1061
01:24:07,173 --> 01:24:08,894
At 6 o'clock, they will not take any money.

1062
01:24:09,914 --> 01:24:10,314
They lock.

1063
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:12,415
Are you absolutely sure of that?

1064
01:24:12,475 --> 01:24:14,056
Because I've seen people feed

1065
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:26,765
If there's a way to request receipts and to look at that, because, I mean, you're putting in your personal information.

1066
01:24:27,065 --> 01:24:41,628
If people are paying after 6 o'clock, and, I mean, as Councillor Marks alluded to, they're trying to generate revenues, I wouldn't be surprised a bit if some of these machines are taking money after 6 o'clock, just my opinion.

1067
01:24:41,928 --> 01:24:44,829
But I would look into their receipts, see if they are or not.

1068
01:24:46,029 --> 01:24:46,309
Thank you.

1069
01:24:55,138 --> 01:24:56,739
All those opposed, motion carries.

1070
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:05,786
Offered by Councilor Caviello, it will be resolved that the Memphis City Council request an update from National Grid on the work being done on 4th Street.

1071
01:25:06,347 --> 01:25:10,570
Steel plates have been on Riverside Avenue and 4th Street for an extended period of time.

1072
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:11,411
Councilor Caviello.

1073
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:12,311
Thank you, Mr. President.

1074
01:25:12,331 --> 01:25:23,300
Mr. President, I received a phone call from a neighbor today on 4th Street wanting an update from the Fellows Way down to Riverside Avenue with National Grid.

1075
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:29,554
Those plates have been in the ground for some time, and there's several locations of where those plates are.

1076
01:25:29,694 --> 01:25:35,995
There's like three or four on 4th Street, and there's also some at Riverside Avenue in front of Budweiser.

1077
01:25:36,855 --> 01:25:43,136
If we can get a report from National Grid on the status of the project and when it's going to be completed, we'd appreciate it, Mr. President.

1078
01:25:43,536 --> 01:25:45,697
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

1079
01:25:46,337 --> 01:25:47,117
All those opposed?

1080
01:25:48,497 --> 01:25:49,317
Motion carries.

1081
01:25:50,998 --> 01:25:52,558
Motion to suspend offered by

1082
01:25:53,706 --> 01:26:11,143
Councilor Knight on today being the day of retirement of the President Emeritus of the Medford City Council, Robert A. Mayarco, Jr., who today retired after a 42-year career with Wells Fargo Securities.

1083
01:26:11,844 --> 01:26:15,448
Councilor Knight, the reason for your request for suspension of the rules.

1084
01:26:16,868 --> 01:26:18,629
Congratulations to Mr. Mayorca.

1085
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:20,729
It wasn't for that, you really threw me off there for a second.

1086
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:25,911
Mr. President, I'd like to take paper 16-491, a $500,000 appropriation to replace sidewalks and stumps throughout the city.

1087
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:28,392
That is 16-491, $500,000 to replace sidewalks and stumps throughout the city.

1088
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:33,714
Councilor Knight, the paper is now before us.

1089
01:26:33,734 --> 01:26:34,094
We have with us,

1090
01:26:44,122 --> 01:27:04,661
gave us quite detailed testimony, the acting commissioner of public works, Mr. Brian Kerins, was with us in our meeting with the mayor today, at which we discussed many of the aspects of this, as well as we've discussed so many of them earlier this evening, which I'm sure will be repeated again.

1091
01:27:05,142 --> 01:27:07,124
But Mr. Kerins was going to bring to us

1092
01:27:07,831 --> 01:27:12,092
some reports tonight, so he's going to hand those to the messenger so that we can have those.

1093
01:27:12,752 --> 01:27:27,035
Just to remind the councilors, of which they are also very well aware, but the public might not be, that because this paper was tabled, all the amendments that were on it were killed by parliamentary procedure.

1094
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:33,316
And so therefore, nothing was reported out, nor were there any formal requests made to department heads.

1095
01:27:33,756 --> 01:27:37,557
But in his hyper-efficiency, Mr. Keran's

1096
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:44,884
Our acting superintendent has complied with our requests in a desire to serve the public very well.

1097
01:27:47,605 --> 01:27:48,646
Is there a motion on the floor?

1098
01:27:50,387 --> 01:27:53,668
Mr. President, I for one was satisfied at the last presentation.

1099
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,769
I feel as though our sidewalks need to be repaired.

1100
01:27:55,829 --> 01:27:58,711
I feel as though a $500,000 appropriation is a good place to start.

1101
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:00,552
I don't think it's a good place to finish, Mr. President.

1102
01:28:01,113 --> 01:28:06,875
But with that being said, I think there were certain individual councilors here that had more concern than I did as to whether or not this was a worthwhile appropriation.

1103
01:28:07,536 --> 01:28:07,956
Very good.

1104
01:28:20,401 --> 01:28:25,323
We have being given to us now a stump inventory, looks like by

1105
01:28:26,205 --> 01:28:32,208
neighborhood, very detailed, and we have outstanding requests for sidewalk work.

1106
01:28:32,988 --> 01:28:38,051
Again, quite detailed here, quite detailed.

1107
01:28:44,874 --> 01:28:50,757
Madam Vice President, and if we could get an extra copy of that be placed in the record with the clerk's office.

1108
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:56,601
If I could just ask a question, because it does look very detailed.

1109
01:28:57,561 --> 01:29:02,943
So just going off the first one, the stumps, this is every stump on the list?

1110
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:04,123
As of today.

1111
01:29:04,903 --> 01:29:05,463
As of today.

1112
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:07,964
So total stumps, 192?

1113
01:29:08,404 --> 01:29:12,905
That's 192 reported stumps in the city.

1114
01:29:12,945 --> 01:29:13,485
That's correct.

1115
01:29:14,586 --> 01:29:19,167
And when we discussed it in committee this evening at 6 o'clock,

1116
01:29:20,077 --> 01:29:26,042
I think you said it would be about $100,000 to $125,000 to remove all 192 stumps.

1117
01:29:26,743 --> 01:29:29,485
That would be approximate, depending on the size.

1118
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:41,976
And then if you could just explain what you printed out for the actual sidewalks to us.

1119
01:29:42,997 --> 01:29:46,140
On the sidewalks, Madam Vice President, is a breakdown on

1120
01:29:47,059 --> 01:29:52,740
the date that the original call or request came into public works.

1121
01:29:54,621 --> 01:30:15,426
It's broken down by ward and precinct, the name of the individual making the request, the location, telephone number if they chose to give it to us, and a description as far as what they feel had to be done in front of their either business or residence.

1122
01:30:19,526 --> 01:30:22,910
And break that down, how many are in this?

1123
01:30:25,272 --> 01:30:29,137
Okay, all together, it was a little over 600 between both lists combined.

1124
01:30:35,633 --> 01:30:38,075
over 600 sidewalks that need to be replaced?

1125
01:30:38,415 --> 01:30:47,843
Yes, because on the stump inventory, Madam Vice President, that would also include replacing the sidewalks once they're removed as well.

1126
01:30:48,303 --> 01:30:58,671
So there'll be at least, with the stumps, 192 sidewalk panels replaced, because we do plan on getting rid of all 192 stumps?

1127
01:30:58,691 --> 01:30:58,971
That's correct.

1128
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,422
The place in the panel was also included in your estimate of the 100 to 125?

1129
01:31:06,643 --> 01:31:07,303
Yes.

1130
01:31:07,763 --> 01:31:10,265
So that brings this list down to about 400 panels?

1131
01:31:10,805 --> 01:31:11,386
That's correct.

1132
01:31:15,288 --> 01:31:23,974
Some of them you'll see, Madam Vice President, could be asphalt, but there isn't as many asphalt requests as there are concrete.

1133
01:31:26,736 --> 01:31:31,519
And with the 500,000, we'll do all the stumps in those panels, and then about how many

1134
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,541
I guess that's where my issue lies.

1135
01:31:34,601 --> 01:31:37,503
We won't know how many of the 400 on this list will be done.

1136
01:31:38,023 --> 01:31:39,104
You have two things here.

1137
01:31:39,224 --> 01:31:47,489
One, of course, we're already well into the season, so as far as how the actual bid prices come in, that's number one.

1138
01:31:47,967 --> 01:31:55,051
But then also, too, you only have four months left this year as far as where you can actually do concrete work.

1139
01:31:56,031 --> 01:32:01,034
You know, once you leave the month of October, there's a lot of risk involved.

1140
01:32:01,094 --> 01:32:05,576
So we'd have to cease operations and then pick up in April when there'd be a break in weather.

1141
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:15,642
And do you have a directive of where

1142
01:32:16,832 --> 01:32:18,513
where exactly you'd start on the list?

1143
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:22,175
Are you going to start from the top of this list, or are we going to just kind of?

1144
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:23,036
OK.

1145
01:32:23,776 --> 01:32:29,760
Each ward and precinct has locations that go back several years.

1146
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:39,245
Those areas would be done first, the ones that are two or three or four years old, to try to clean them up.

1147
01:32:39,946 --> 01:32:42,067
And then we'd have them, again,

1148
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:56,959
if we could have two crews out there, one solely dedicated to the tree stump list and the other just dedicated to the residential of the business list and just go from ward to different wards and precinct one by one.

1149
01:33:04,104 --> 01:33:05,805
And the farthest we go back here is 2000 and

1150
01:33:10,848 --> 01:33:17,272
There's several in the Madam Vice Chair that are 2014, I know.

1151
01:33:17,772 --> 01:33:19,333
And I think there's a couple 2013.

1152
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:36,222
My concerns would be the older ones get done obviously first and the ones that are obviously in the most disrepair get done first.

1153
01:33:37,163 --> 01:33:53,516
My main concerns initially when we talked about this for an hour last week is just that I don't want to dedicate $500,000 and then only have done, because you did say if there's many panels on one street, and even if they're not reported, we're going to do the whole street.

1154
01:33:53,976 --> 01:34:05,565
My concern is I don't want to spend this $500,000 on a named 10 streets and not get the list done, especially the people that have been complaining for years or that have terrible sidewalks.

1155
01:34:06,169 --> 01:34:06,949
That is my concern.

1156
01:34:07,029 --> 01:34:09,070
I can understand that, Madam Vice President.

1157
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:12,531
Each location will be assessed.

1158
01:34:13,631 --> 01:34:19,413
Those that are obviously the most deplorable condition and the oldest would be addressed first.

1159
01:34:20,133 --> 01:34:30,377
And then as we get further into the contract, there may have to be some readjustments depending on need and location, getting most serious public safety threats done first.

1160
01:34:31,937 --> 01:34:33,918
If we can make that part of the paper,

1161
01:34:35,733 --> 01:34:39,915
condition on the vote that we do the oldest and the ones that are in most disrepair first.

1162
01:34:39,935 --> 01:34:45,338
Obviously, if the council could be updated after the fourth four months of what has been done.

1163
01:34:45,618 --> 01:34:45,999
Certainly.

1164
01:34:46,099 --> 01:34:47,719
So if we could have some clarity.

1165
01:34:47,779 --> 01:35:02,227
So we're going to have an amendment that the streets, the sidewalks be done, that the oldest and most outstanding be given priority and that the council be receive frequent updates

1166
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:05,605
as to the project's progress.

1167
01:35:06,365 --> 01:35:09,026
Did we understand that correctly, Madam Vice President?

1168
01:35:09,586 --> 01:35:10,106
That would be great.

1169
01:35:10,486 --> 01:35:10,806
Thank you.

1170
01:35:12,327 --> 01:35:15,888
Chair recognizes Councilor Falcone.

1171
01:35:17,168 --> 01:35:31,272
Actually, I think Vice President Longo already mentioned it, but if you could just have a, when you've paved your last sidewalk and pulled your last stump out for the season, if you could just have a report like this just with an update.

1172
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:40,725
just so we can see what was accomplished with the $500,000, you know, however much money is being appropriated here.

1173
01:35:40,785 --> 01:35:44,186
So it'd be nice just to kind of see actually how much we're getting done.

1174
01:35:45,107 --> 01:35:45,627
Absolutely.

1175
01:35:45,767 --> 01:35:46,687
Thank you very much.

1176
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:48,828
Councilor Knight.

1177
01:35:49,388 --> 01:35:57,271
Mr. President, I'd also like to request a copy of the RFP as well as the contract with the selected bidder when that becomes available to us.

1178
01:35:58,331 --> 01:35:59,272
But I move for approval.

1179
01:36:01,351 --> 01:36:05,092
amended by Councilor Knight, a request to the copy of the RFP.

1180
01:36:05,612 --> 01:36:07,032
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1181
01:36:08,473 --> 01:36:09,333
Thank you, Mr. President.

1182
01:36:10,373 --> 01:36:12,093
Brian, I appreciate the list.

1183
01:36:12,793 --> 01:36:17,815
This is more thorough than we had two weeks before us, two weeks ago.

1184
01:36:18,555 --> 01:36:29,237
My question to you, Brian, I don't know if it was asked two weeks ago, but how do we rate when you get a call or an email from a resident, how do we rate the sidewalk?

1185
01:36:30,215 --> 01:36:36,439
Do we have a key of conditions that we rate it and then give it a numerical number?

1186
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,240
How do we go about this?

1187
01:36:40,221 --> 01:36:44,683
Well, first off, all right, is it a public safety hazard?

1188
01:36:45,184 --> 01:36:47,625
Which would be, we'll say, like a tree trip.

1189
01:36:47,665 --> 01:36:49,846
We have several panels that potentially are buckled.

1190
01:36:49,866 --> 01:36:51,808
All right, that's a public safety hazard.

1191
01:36:52,128 --> 01:36:55,510
So that's, you know, top priority one, all right?

1192
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:58,031
Then you've got priority one, two, and three.

1193
01:36:58,171 --> 01:36:59,332
Priority two would be,

1194
01:36:59,769 --> 01:37:04,670
A sidewalk that has some pieces of asphalt, potentially concrete, that are missing.

1195
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:13,192
And then priority three would be cosmetic, something like a hairline crack in a panel or two in front of their home.

1196
01:37:13,992 --> 01:37:20,014
Or potentially a little dip in the asphalt that may be in front of the home, depending on what they have.

1197
01:37:21,514 --> 01:37:25,015
So on this particular outstanding request list that you gave us,

1198
01:37:26,678 --> 01:37:32,659
Is there a reason why they're not listed as priority one, priority two, priority three?

1199
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:38,400
The reason for that is because the inspection of these different requests has just begun.

1200
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:44,841
Up to this point, it's been strictly just an intake into our system because of funding sources.

1201
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:45,961
Right.

1202
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:55,303
So we don't even know from this current list what might be a minor repair, you know, a hairline fracture.

1203
01:37:56,244 --> 01:38:04,208
in the cement or something that requires, you know, a panel being raised because of a tree root.

1204
01:38:04,768 --> 01:38:07,489
So we don't know the extent of what's on this list.

1205
01:38:08,209 --> 01:38:15,272
As far as the accuracy of the tree stump contract, that's accurate as far as the tree stump one.

1206
01:38:15,552 --> 01:38:20,635
As far as the actual one with just the residents or the businesses on it,

1207
01:38:21,815 --> 01:38:26,337
No, but from past experience, most are usually accurate.

1208
01:38:26,717 --> 01:38:33,219
In some cases, you realize that maybe their next door neighbor has the same problem, and that was never reported.

1209
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:34,800
Right, right.

1210
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:40,862
I guess what I'm getting at is I don't think anyone behind this reeling is opposed to doing sidewalks over.

1211
01:38:41,362 --> 01:38:50,005
But I could just state from previous experience, it was back in 2012 when I believe it was Jack Buckley was the DPW commissioner.

1212
01:38:50,644 --> 01:38:57,508
that he came before us, he asked for the exact amount, 500,000, for sidewalk repairs.

1213
01:38:58,269 --> 01:39:13,658
He didn't present any supporting documentation at the time, and the council asked that he go back and provide a thorough list of what work needs to be done, where the locations are, the age of the request, and he did that back in 2012.

1214
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:16,660
And I have a copy of it in front of me.

1215
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:19,051
And, uh, it's color coded.

1216
01:39:19,811 --> 01:39:33,419
And let me just state that, uh, he provides us a key and I'm not sure why it would change from one DPW director to the next DPW director, unless you come up with a much better way of tracking.

1217
01:39:33,899 --> 01:39:42,024
Then I can see why you changed the reporting, but I could just tell you from the two reports that I received, uh, the one back in 2012, uh, clearly delineates.

1218
01:39:45,971 --> 01:39:53,434
what has minor repair, what has poor, what they consider poor, and major.

1219
01:39:54,814 --> 01:39:58,796
And to me, that gives you at least an indication what you need to go after.

1220
01:39:59,596 --> 01:40:02,217
On your list, there's no indication.

1221
01:40:03,358 --> 01:40:10,440
I mean, you yourself just said we really didn't have the manpower to go out and do a thorough review of each of these sidewalks.

1222
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:11,901
This is just a report.

1223
01:40:12,641 --> 01:40:14,842
So anyone can call and say my sidewalk is awful.

1224
01:40:15,435 --> 01:40:18,538
Okay, with your name, address, ma'am, and they go on the list.

1225
01:40:19,519 --> 01:40:25,403
So, you know, I still don't understand what we're going to accomplish on this list.

1226
01:40:26,704 --> 01:40:31,048
Are we going to be replacing sidewalks that have a hairline fracture?

1227
01:40:31,809 --> 01:40:34,771
I mean, is that what the intention is of this $500,000?

1228
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:35,912
No, absolutely not.

1229
01:40:36,292 --> 01:40:43,358
Okay, it's strictly, you know, public safety has its, they have the number one priority now.

1230
01:40:43,703 --> 01:40:50,307
So, Brian, I don't want to cut you off, but what do we, because I've been hearing this year after year after year, what do we tell residents when they call up?

1231
01:40:51,548 --> 01:40:54,250
And they say, okay, I have a concern with my sidewalk.

1232
01:40:54,630 --> 01:41:00,414
Doesn't it make sense to go out to the sidewalk, investigate it, then get back to the resident and say, ma'am, you know what?

1233
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:04,216
We noticed you do have, you can't eat off your sidewalk.

1234
01:41:04,256 --> 01:41:09,500
There is a hairline fracture, but in the list of priorities, you're not at the top priority.

1235
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:12,081
Your sidewalk probably won't be done for several years.

1236
01:41:13,798 --> 01:41:19,739
people led to believe this sidewalk is going to be done that may have a hailing fracture, and it never gets done.

1237
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:22,460
You know what I'm saying?

1238
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,400
There's no accounting.

1239
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:32,262
I realize what you're saying, but you also got to realize in 2012 and also in 2016, there's a significant change in staffing.

1240
01:41:33,502 --> 01:41:39,643
The engineering division back then had two field inspectors, an assistant city engineer,

1241
01:41:40,221 --> 01:41:44,163
a permit supervisor, and the city chief engineer.

1242
01:41:45,004 --> 01:41:49,407
Today, there is no inspectors, okay, up to this point.

1243
01:41:49,427 --> 01:41:50,607
What happened with the inspectors?

1244
01:41:50,667 --> 01:41:53,349
Okay, that was before my time council.

1245
01:41:53,429 --> 01:41:54,029
They retired?

1246
01:41:54,049 --> 01:41:54,930
They let go?

1247
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:55,410
You don't know?

1248
01:41:55,530 --> 01:42:01,654
Okay, I believe one passed away, but beyond that, I cannot explain.

1249
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:02,855
I cannot explain.

1250
01:42:03,275 --> 01:42:03,775
I wasn't here.

1251
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:09,739
You know, Mr. President, I honestly, I'm tossed between approving this

1252
01:42:10,306 --> 01:42:11,166
and not approving it.

1253
01:42:12,087 --> 01:42:19,068
And I just don't understand how we can go based on this list that really doesn't prioritize sidewalks.

1254
01:42:20,889 --> 01:42:21,809
I don't know how you do it.

1255
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:32,472
And I don't know how in good faith I could tell a resident that may be on this list that you may or may not get your sidewalk done depending on what.

1256
01:42:32,532 --> 01:42:33,933
I can't tell them depending on what.

1257
01:42:34,453 --> 01:42:34,913
I don't know.

1258
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:37,791
I mean, I really don't understand.

1259
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:44,454
This list that I'm not trying to compare you with Mr. Buckley, but this list of the past that we asked for, I don't know if you've seen this.

1260
01:42:45,514 --> 01:42:47,115
It's DPW outstanding request.

1261
01:42:47,535 --> 01:42:51,096
This was July 31st, 2009 to February 7th, 2012.

1262
01:42:52,297 --> 01:42:58,079
But there is a key on this that really describes the nature of the sidewalk.

1263
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:03,822
And I can better understand what's gonna be done based on this color code.

1264
01:43:05,038 --> 01:43:06,219
And to me it's very helpful.

1265
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:09,702
I don't know if you can, that would mean you'd have to review all these sidewalks.

1266
01:43:10,002 --> 01:43:11,043
One by one council.

1267
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:11,683
That's correct.

1268
01:43:13,565 --> 01:43:15,646
What do we do, Mr. President for future reference?

1269
01:43:15,686 --> 01:43:21,531
Do we ask that a sidewalk be reviewed ahead of time before we get a list of sidewalks that need replacing?

1270
01:43:22,331 --> 01:43:23,532
I mean, to me that makes sense.

1271
01:43:24,473 --> 01:43:28,636
You know, don't present me with a list if it's not a list of sidewalks that are going to be replaced.

1272
01:43:29,963 --> 01:43:31,284
You know, have a separate list.

1273
01:43:31,724 --> 01:43:35,046
Have three lists out there, but have one that we're going to get through.

1274
01:43:35,066 --> 01:43:38,187
You know, this — I don't know what's going to be done on this list.

1275
01:43:40,248 --> 01:43:43,910
You know, this — you know, I don't know what to do, Mr. President.

1276
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:47,452
I don't feel I have all the information in front of me with this list.

1277
01:43:48,632 --> 01:43:53,475
I don't feel comfortable just allocating $500,000 and say, spend it as need be.

1278
01:43:54,255 --> 01:43:55,896
You know, we're the fiscal watchdogs.

1279
01:43:55,916 --> 01:43:57,056
I don't feel comfortable with that.

1280
01:43:58,806 --> 01:44:01,328
I'm going to wait to see what some of my colleagues have to say.

1281
01:44:01,348 --> 01:44:09,434
But based on the list we presented tonight, I don't think I have adequate information to go forward and approve a half a million dollars.

1282
01:44:11,656 --> 01:44:12,956
Vice President Lugo-Kern.

1283
01:44:13,037 --> 01:44:14,458
Thank you, President Dillard.

1284
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:24,805
So I think that was my concern two weeks ago when I asked for it, you know, because that is a lot of hours, a lot of manpower that we don't have to evaluate each and every sidewalk.

1285
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:26,987
But I did say, give us a list of

1286
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:38,815
you know, what are the first 10 to 100 sidewalks we will be replacing, so then we have a better idea of at least what streets we can tell people you're going to and that those sidewalks are going to be replaced.

1287
01:44:39,475 --> 01:44:47,279
So, if the 500 is approved, we go out for an RFP, and we stabilize the money, how would you begin?

1288
01:44:47,659 --> 01:44:48,719
Where would you start?

1289
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:49,480
With the stumps?

1290
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,380
Okay.

1291
01:44:51,141 --> 01:44:54,262
Well, depending on, you know, the successful bidder.

1292
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:59,123
If he can supply us with two crews, I would go in two directions.

1293
01:44:59,884 --> 01:45:03,387
One would be stumps and, you know, stump and sidewalk combined.

1294
01:45:04,207 --> 01:45:06,689
Second avenue would be sidewalks only.

1295
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:20,040
I mean, I would be comfortable tonight voting for the 192 stump removals, and I think we have a cost estimate of 100 to 150 on the higher end.

1296
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,682
I completely believe that this list is

1297
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:30,294
is good enough and we can tell everybody on the stump list that their stump's going to be removed and their sidewalk panel is going to be replaced.

1298
01:45:30,594 --> 01:45:34,316
And I think that's a good starting point, especially where we're taking it out of free cash.

1299
01:45:34,356 --> 01:45:37,177
We're not going out to bond on this specific project.

1300
01:45:37,657 --> 01:45:46,500
But I have the concern, too, and I think that's where I was coming from two weeks ago.

1301
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:47,580
I think this is definitely

1302
01:45:48,436 --> 01:45:55,238
a good start, and we definitely have every stump that's on this list in front of us, but I, too, we get calls every day.

1303
01:45:55,418 --> 01:45:58,098
You know, I was told my sidewalk's on the list in 2015.

1304
01:45:58,339 --> 01:46:00,759
Is it going to be done?

1305
01:46:00,799 --> 01:46:03,900
I heard you were talking about 500,000, and I can't, we can't really tell them.

1306
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:14,863
I told one person specifically that we've requested a list of, you know, the top 100 that will definitely be done, but I, you know, we still can't answer that question, and I do appreciate the full list,

1307
01:46:18,264 --> 01:46:32,654
I guess I'm kind of torn as well, but I think that we can, I would, myself would move approval for knowing that the 192 stumps will be removed, definitely need to be removed, and I think that's something we should try to move on tonight, at least.

1308
01:46:35,135 --> 01:46:36,036
Councilor Caviello.

1309
01:46:36,536 --> 01:46:37,097
Thank you, Mr. President.

1310
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:43,141
Mr. President, I think, you know, first and foremost, I think we need to get this project off the ground and started.

1311
01:46:43,441 --> 01:46:47,804
If we're going to sit here for another two weeks arguing who's going to get this in first,

1312
01:46:48,502 --> 01:46:50,943
The end of the season is going to be done, and we won't have any sidewalks then.

1313
01:46:51,823 --> 01:46:59,585
I mean, Mr. Cairns has only been on the job a couple of months, and Mr. Buckley did a great report there.

1314
01:46:59,645 --> 01:47:05,546
And if we give Mr. Cairns some time, he can come up with a rating system.

1315
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:13,888
But if we're going to sit here another week and let another week go by, another week go by, these contractors are going to get booked up, and we're not going to get anybody, and we're not going to get anything fixed, Mr. President.

1316
01:47:18,075 --> 01:47:20,638
on motion for approval by Councillor Knight.

1317
01:47:21,719 --> 01:47:23,300
Roll call vote has been requested.

1318
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,141
Councillor Matz.

1319
01:47:24,621 --> 01:47:32,809
I think Councillor Lungo-Curran brought up a great suggestion about the 192 tree stumps which include panels, sidewalk panels.

1320
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:34,671
So I think that's a great suggestion.

1321
01:47:35,151 --> 01:47:36,973
I would also ask my fellow colleagues that

1322
01:47:37,405 --> 01:47:50,473
You know, if we do move approval on this, that we send a message or at least request from here on in that every sidewalk be reviewed and then graded, Mr. President.

1323
01:47:50,834 --> 01:47:56,077
So in the future, it might not happen now, but in the future, we have a report that we can look at.

1324
01:47:56,097 --> 01:47:58,659
You know, it's easy to say, let's just move forward.

1325
01:47:59,219 --> 01:47:59,819
But guess what?

1326
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,902
We're accountable to the residents of this community and the taxpayers.

1327
01:48:04,802 --> 01:48:05,943
And that's taxpayer money.

1328
01:48:05,963 --> 01:48:07,204
That's a half a million dollars.

1329
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:15,989
and taxpayer money, and from a business perspective, we should be able to look at it and say, here's a half a million, this is what we're getting.

1330
01:48:16,069 --> 01:48:17,329
This is not rocket science.

1331
01:48:17,849 --> 01:48:18,869
It's not rocket science.

1332
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:23,810
And not one person behind this reel can tell me, this is what we're getting.

1333
01:48:24,371 --> 01:48:25,231
Not one person.

1334
01:48:25,671 --> 01:48:32,092
So I don't think this is, you know, something that we should be.

1335
01:48:32,512 --> 01:48:33,032
Thank you.

1336
01:48:33,192 --> 01:48:33,553
Thank you.

1337
01:48:34,353 --> 01:48:35,433
I don't think it's something that

1338
01:48:36,297 --> 01:48:38,079
We're asking that's out of the ordinary.

1339
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:41,101
I don't think, you know, it puts a strain on the department.

1340
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:55,892
If Mr. Kearns, which I believe tells me that staffing's low, then that needs to be addressed because next time we're going to be faced with the same list of sidewalks that need to be done, and we're not going to know what needs to be done, Mr. President.

1341
01:48:56,572 --> 01:48:57,853
Where does it stop?

1342
01:48:57,873 --> 01:48:59,875
The buck stops here with this council.

1343
01:49:00,475 --> 01:49:01,716
So, yeah, it's easy to approve.

1344
01:49:01,736 --> 01:49:03,878
I mean, you can put a paper, I'll approve everything.

1345
01:49:04,378 --> 01:49:08,240
But it's our job to be the gatekeepers, Mr. President.

1346
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,921
That's what our role is, not just to approve.

1347
01:49:11,241 --> 01:49:13,142
You can get seven monkeys to approve.

1348
01:49:14,322 --> 01:49:21,686
Our job is to be the gatekeepers and make sure that we're operating like you'd operate any other Fortune 500 company.

1349
01:49:22,006 --> 01:49:24,807
And that's what we should be operating the city like, Mr. President.

1350
01:49:24,847 --> 01:49:33,351
So if we put a contingent on this particular proposal, whether it's Council Longo's, which I agree, but that the next reporting

1351
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:48,852
that the city, they'll have to hire someone if they don't have someone to manage it, the city, when they get a call for a sidewalk, that the sidewalk be immediately looked at and graded, Mr. President, like was done in previous years.

1352
01:49:49,753 --> 01:49:51,754
That's all I'm asking.

1353
01:49:52,095 --> 01:49:59,380
It would be an amendment to this paper, Mr. President, because without it, I can't support any more work done, Mr. President.

1354
01:50:07,936 --> 01:50:10,237
Did Lungo have an amendment on that too?

1355
01:50:10,498 --> 01:50:15,121
Did you have an amendment?

1356
01:50:15,641 --> 01:50:16,061
Did you?

1357
01:50:17,342 --> 01:50:17,842
Previously?

1358
01:50:17,862 --> 01:50:17,902
No?

1359
01:50:21,004 --> 01:50:29,389
I was just going to add to those comments that I think that's something that hopefully is being done now with C-Click Fix.

1360
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:32,451
That it is being evaluated by our DPW.

1361
01:50:32,511 --> 01:50:35,153
That would bring, you know, obviously a couple in per week.

1362
01:50:35,695 --> 01:50:37,997
evaluated and a rating system is started.

1363
01:50:38,017 --> 01:50:40,959
I don't know if that's happening, but that's something that should be happening.

1364
01:50:41,019 --> 01:50:41,800
They're not evaluating.

1365
01:50:43,061 --> 01:50:44,102
They're just placed on the list.

1366
01:50:44,122 --> 01:50:44,682
They're just placed.

1367
01:50:44,702 --> 01:50:47,204
So you, you put in a C-Click fix, you get on the sideline list.

1368
01:50:47,705 --> 01:50:49,526
They're not, that would be my recommendation.

1369
01:50:49,546 --> 01:50:51,808
Well, that's the whole, that's the whole point I brought up.

1370
01:50:52,068 --> 01:50:52,269
Yeah.

1371
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:54,771
I mean, all right.

1372
01:50:54,951 --> 01:51:01,216
So we have a motion for approval as amended by vice president Longo Curran and council marks.

1373
01:51:01,256 --> 01:51:03,598
I think there's a couple citizens behind you,

1374
01:51:04,299 --> 01:51:09,183
Commissioner who would like to speak, so we gladly welcome them and their input tonight.

1375
01:51:09,584 --> 01:51:10,084
Good evening.

1376
01:51:10,184 --> 01:51:12,126
Please state your name and address for the record.

1377
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:13,030
Hi.

1378
01:51:13,631 --> 01:51:14,211
Excuse me.

1379
01:51:14,632 --> 01:51:16,453
Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

1380
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:23,600
I don't know much about construction other than accessibility codes, but I can do math.

1381
01:51:25,021 --> 01:51:26,302
And I've been doing some of it.

1382
01:51:26,742 --> 01:51:36,331
And the issue is that you're not, under the current system, from what I can tell, and people can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, you're not actually going to get the information you want.

1383
01:51:37,332 --> 01:51:39,414
Because you're never going to be able to do

1384
01:51:40,294 --> 01:52:00,715
If nobody is assessing things ahead of time, you're never going to be able to get an accurate report of what kind of money it's going to cost to fix things, because when they get out there, from what I heard, both at the Committee of the Whole meeting and here, they're going to get there, and if they find out that the neighbor or the whole block or whatever also needs fixing,

1385
01:52:01,195 --> 01:52:03,317
then they're going to have to do that too, which is legit, right?

1386
01:52:03,337 --> 01:52:04,718
You don't want to have to go back there again.

1387
01:52:05,338 --> 01:52:10,062
But what that means is that you never have an accurate count of how much money you're going to be spending.

1388
01:52:11,423 --> 01:52:18,669
And not only is it not rated, but you don't necessarily know what's abutting it that also needs fixing.

1389
01:52:19,049 --> 01:52:23,292
So even if you had that all rated, you still wouldn't have the numbers you want.

1390
01:52:23,693 --> 01:52:29,117
And it wouldn't really be doable until they get out there, unless they do like a full report on everyone, which sounds kind of

1391
01:52:30,088 --> 01:52:32,789
like it's difficult to do under the current circumstances.

1392
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:34,850
I'm not saying that that's a good thing.

1393
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:43,913
I'm saying that under—you're never going to have—like, that number that you want isn't available.

1394
01:52:44,514 --> 01:52:46,714
That's a broken system.

1395
01:52:47,895 --> 01:52:52,116
But I guess the question is, is the perfect going to be the enemy of the good here?

1396
01:52:52,417 --> 01:52:55,158
You absolutely should know how people's money is being spent.

1397
01:52:56,689 --> 01:53:00,351
a serious hole in the system that you can't have that number.

1398
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:18,500
But I don't know what two weeks is going to buy you in terms of getting that number, because they're not going to go out in two weeks probably to every site and say, all right, well, this guy, he has a giant hole down through the entire planet right here, and next door, that person's got a hairline crack.

1399
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,841
They're not going to do that in two weeks.

1400
01:53:21,931 --> 01:53:22,372
I don't know.

1401
01:53:22,512 --> 01:53:23,933
Is there some kind of compromise?

1402
01:53:24,113 --> 01:53:26,356
Is there—but the math just isn't there.

1403
01:53:26,736 --> 01:53:36,547
I mean, for sure it's going to be more than 500,000, but it could be a lot more than 500,000 when you factor in the stumps, which you don't know how much they said in the Committee—you said in the Committee of the Whole.

1404
01:53:37,829 --> 01:53:38,049
Sorry.

1405
01:53:39,467 --> 01:53:51,411
Through the chair, who is also at the Committee of the Whole meeting, you know that they said that, you know, they don't know until they get to the stump, like how rooted it is in their, the stumps vary.

1406
01:53:51,451 --> 01:53:55,933
They do, you know, they have previous experience, and so they estimate it based on that.

1407
01:53:56,473 --> 01:54:07,557
But just the way it's set up right now, like, that takes some of the money out of the sidewalks, except for the stuff that's used to patch up the sidewalk where the stump used to be.

1408
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:13,443
But I don't think there's a thing that's going to give you the number that's going to make you comfortable voting for this.

1409
01:54:13,943 --> 01:54:17,666
So I guess what you have to decide then is, what do you do about that?

1410
01:54:17,886 --> 01:54:19,447
And what are you willing to do in the meantime?

1411
01:54:20,027 --> 01:54:20,948
But the math's not there.

1412
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:26,031
Like, $500,000 is not going to cover that much, but it's going to get a start on it.

1413
01:54:26,231 --> 01:54:27,852
So that's what you have to work with.

1414
01:54:29,033 --> 01:54:29,433
Thank you.

1415
01:54:31,275 --> 01:54:35,297
Mr. Castanetti, please state your name and address for the record.

1416
01:54:35,337 --> 01:54:35,697
Welcome.

1417
01:54:36,258 --> 01:54:36,558
Thank you.

1418
01:54:37,089 --> 01:54:41,852
conference president, uh, Andrew Castaneda, Cushman street method mass.

1419
01:54:44,474 --> 01:55:02,047
Um, just as a concerned citizen, taxpayer, et cetera, and for other taxpayers, uh, my concern with the old adage or saying is, uh, it ain't broke, don't fix it, but if it's broke, what you should fix it, obviously, especially on the side of safety concerns.

1420
01:55:03,148 --> 01:55:05,149
Um, my concern is the 600,

1421
01:55:07,378 --> 01:55:12,701
or 400 sidewalk panels, thereabouts, and 192 stumps.

1422
01:55:13,441 --> 01:55:16,623
I'm not sure if it's 400 locations or 600 locations.

1423
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:34,712
However, my concern is since they're on a list, so they made the grade, so to speak, as a problem, this $500,000 should hopefully be enough to take care of every single location.

1424
01:55:35,942 --> 01:55:45,427
and not start jumping down other addresses on the same street because, I mean, $400,000, you couldn't even do Clippership Drive.

1425
01:55:45,907 --> 01:55:48,128
That would eat the whole business of $400,000.

1426
01:55:49,409 --> 01:55:56,252
So if they just say, well, my sidewalk is busted too, five doors down, well, did you at least call it in?

1427
01:55:57,753 --> 01:55:59,194
Chances are it was not called in.

1428
01:55:59,254 --> 01:56:05,417
So they made the grade, but they must be in bad, bad shape and a safety issue.

1429
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:11,262
Through the chair, I'd like to ask Mr. Brian Curran a question.

1430
01:56:12,702 --> 01:56:18,364
On average, I'd like to know, first of all, one question is how many locations?

1431
01:56:18,444 --> 01:56:20,545
Is it 400 or 600 locations?

1432
01:56:22,126 --> 01:56:23,506
And then I have a follow-up question.

1433
01:56:23,986 --> 01:56:25,127
Okay, that'd be 600 combined.

1434
01:56:25,227 --> 01:56:25,607
Okay.

1435
01:56:26,647 --> 01:56:33,610
And at the Committee of the Whole meeting with the Mayor, you had mentioned, I believe, it costs $25 per panel.

1436
01:56:35,814 --> 01:56:50,543
for the concrete aggregated self material and $28 labor, which equals approximately, you believe, $53 average per panel, depending on how the contract comes in.

1437
01:56:54,866 --> 01:57:01,810
A panel, I presume, is four feet by six feet, if that, not even.

1438
01:57:02,231 --> 01:57:02,571
Thank you.

1439
01:57:04,815 --> 01:57:22,364
So my final question to you would be, hopefully my final question is, on average, if you could just ballpark 600 locations on average per location, some might be yay big, some might be a lot bigger.

1440
01:57:23,084 --> 01:57:27,506
Can you give me an average per location what the cost might be, please?

1441
01:57:32,943 --> 01:57:41,689
It's pretty hard to say, depending on the location, you could be one panel, two panels, maybe four and a driveway apron may be involved.

1442
01:57:42,090 --> 01:57:44,071
Each location would have to be examined.

1443
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:48,734
It's a case by case basis to come up with the actual final number.

1444
01:57:51,236 --> 01:57:51,696
Thank you.

1445
01:57:51,716 --> 01:57:52,517
So what's unknown.

1446
01:57:52,597 --> 01:57:59,902
So if we get $500,000 from the hard earned taxpayers money from the free cash that the city is holding,

1447
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:10,525
If it's $1,000 a shot, I'm presuming that's going to cover 500 problem areas out of the 600 that's on the list.

1448
01:58:11,785 --> 01:58:12,846
I'm just guesstimating this.

1449
01:58:15,967 --> 01:58:23,831
However, council marks are eluded to past histories about this sidewalk repair business with tree stumps.

1450
01:58:24,992 --> 01:58:26,833
And I'm not sure if he was accurate,

1451
01:58:27,376 --> 01:58:28,997
but the numbers didn't make much sense.

1452
01:58:29,117 --> 01:58:37,243
One million, then another million, that's two million, and the list of 400 or 600, and they never totally got completed.

1453
01:58:37,323 --> 01:58:40,866
So you're talking like 10, 20, $30,000 per shot.

1454
01:58:41,647 --> 01:58:42,287
I don't understand.

1455
01:58:42,307 --> 01:58:45,049
Hopefully this law will work out.

1456
01:58:45,169 --> 01:58:46,130
Thank you if you're listening.

1457
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:47,511
Thank you very much.

1458
01:58:51,634 --> 01:58:55,477
Any other citizens want to speak on this matter before we close off public participation?

1459
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:58,631
Welcome, please state your name and address for the record.

1460
01:58:59,231 --> 01:59:00,211
Thank you, Mr. President.

1461
01:59:00,251 --> 01:59:02,212
Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1462
01:59:05,593 --> 01:59:10,635
I know you've already had the discussion about Evans Street and you've taken action on that.

1463
01:59:11,835 --> 01:59:20,538
But it looks like now you're, it's like piecemealing something when, you know, stepping outside of the box and look it in.

1464
01:59:21,078 --> 01:59:25,660
I think what a lot of people in Medford see is, like Mr. Reed spoke of before,

1465
01:59:26,259 --> 01:59:37,244
You have allocation of funds on the MWRA for, I believe you talked about sidewalks or something like $3 million, which 75% of which would be grants.

1466
01:59:38,164 --> 01:59:41,785
We see in the free cash account, something like six or $7 million.

1467
01:59:45,507 --> 01:59:55,411
What we don't understand as citizens paying all these taxes is how come it can't be that this commissioner's office can't be staffed?

1468
01:59:56,027 --> 02:00:10,701
with the right amount of people to survey the city, make the proper assessments, hire the people that we need, and get the job done when there's all this money that's at your fingertips to be used.

1469
02:00:10,902 --> 02:00:14,505
We're talking about $500,000 that we don't even know what it's going to be used for.

1470
02:00:14,826 --> 02:00:15,486
We're talking about

1471
02:00:17,225 --> 02:00:26,330
complaints and registers made to SeeClickFix that are taken down and closed and resolved when they're obviously not.

1472
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:38,457
It's just a hard thing to wrap your mind around, seeing almost tens of millions of dollars, when an understaffed department that doesn't even have the manpower to go out there and assess what needs to be fixed.

1473
02:00:41,299 --> 02:00:43,399
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but it has to be said.

1474
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:45,720
Leadership has to come in.

1475
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:47,720
It has to be accountable and transparent.

1476
02:00:48,261 --> 02:00:58,823
It has to look at what we've got in order to fund the resources to get these jobs done that are years past due.

1477
02:01:00,023 --> 02:01:03,744
It's something to consider when you look at the budget next month.

1478
02:01:04,624 --> 02:01:06,745
I would like to say this, though.

1479
02:01:08,385 --> 02:01:18,368
The parks project that has gone on, because a lot of hits and a lot of criticism has been made, I've got to give kudos to.

1480
02:01:18,708 --> 02:01:22,549
You've got to also reward what's good as being done.

1481
02:01:22,589 --> 02:01:28,130
And Morrison Parks, our new basketball court and a few of the other parks, excellent job.

1482
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:29,051
Excellent job.

1483
02:01:29,271 --> 02:01:30,671
Thank you, Mr. President.

1484
02:01:30,691 --> 02:01:31,431
Mr. Scarpelli.

1485
02:01:31,771 --> 02:01:33,212
If I can, Mr. President, thank you.

1486
02:01:33,232 --> 02:01:37,713
You know, it's insightful when you listen to the history

1487
02:01:38,255 --> 02:01:40,856
and what's gone on in the past here and as we move forward.

1488
02:01:42,797 --> 02:01:46,319
I did my own investigation and you see what other communities are doing.

1489
02:01:46,899 --> 02:01:52,642
And for this situation, I think we're in an unfortunate situation for the fact that this is what we have.

1490
02:01:54,543 --> 02:02:06,209
Not to say you look at it lightly, but you look at different communities and different communities have cement crews in place already that when there is a concern, the concern is dealt with

1491
02:02:07,287 --> 02:02:19,491
as a case-to-case basis, not something saved up to 600 pieces that unfortunately isn't, you know, something that happened just this week, but over the years.

1492
02:02:20,511 --> 02:02:27,533
So we have identified locations, and you see the concerns in some of the comment sections.

1493
02:02:28,133 --> 02:02:36,176
In some of the comment sections, you know, it says National Grid did X, Y, and Z. And, you know, I have concerns with that too.

1494
02:02:36,721 --> 02:02:46,444
But at the same time, constituents that I've talked to that have these concerns are living with sidewalks that are dangerous.

1495
02:02:46,804 --> 02:02:54,667
And stalling it now, I think it would be harmful to those constituents.

1496
02:02:54,707 --> 02:03:02,009
But at the same time, it's something that we have to look at as a committee, looking at the budget and going forward.

1497
02:03:02,029 --> 02:03:06,471
Because a lot of these concerns are made because of

1498
02:03:08,873 --> 02:03:14,576
systematic negligence in a sense that we had some faults and we need to correct them.

1499
02:03:15,376 --> 02:03:23,680
So, um, you know, I, I'd have to, I'd have to vote and move on with, with this project.

1500
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:26,642
So, um, thank you, Mr. President.

1501
02:03:26,882 --> 02:03:27,762
Thank you, counselor.

1502
02:03:28,123 --> 02:03:32,825
So on the motion for approval by council on night as seconded by councilor Scott Pelly,

1503
02:03:34,176 --> 02:03:37,157
as amended by Councilors Lungelkorn and Mox.

1504
02:03:37,337 --> 02:03:38,878
Councilor Caviello, finally.

1505
02:03:39,918 --> 02:03:40,678
Thank you, Mr. President.

1506
02:03:40,879 --> 02:03:43,019
You know, Councilor Scott Pelli has made a point.

1507
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:48,001
You know, other cities have crews in place to do these things around the house.

1508
02:03:49,982 --> 02:03:53,603
Maintenance has been the Achilles heel of the city for many years.

1509
02:03:54,564 --> 02:03:58,685
And, you know, every year it grows and we pay for it.

1510
02:03:59,205 --> 02:04:02,527
Now, I mean, you can see right now, I mean, 600 sidewalks.

1511
02:04:06,129 --> 02:04:07,470
These sidewalks didn't break yesterday.

1512
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:12,452
It's been long overdue and we made a small dent in it a couple of years ago.

1513
02:04:12,872 --> 02:04:15,893
But again, sidewalks just keep coming and coming and coming.

1514
02:04:16,374 --> 02:04:17,254
I mean, we're an old city.

1515
02:04:23,357 --> 02:04:26,098
I'd ask that the amendments be read back and a roll call vote be taken, Mr. President.

1516
02:04:26,258 --> 02:04:28,039
Yes, we're prepared for that.

1517
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:31,481
We're going to have a final amendment,

1518
02:04:35,277 --> 02:04:35,957
Councilor Mox.

1519
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:42,361
Mr. President, a little while ago, I mentioned that I was going to ask that Evans Street be put on this for a complete repaving.

1520
02:04:42,942 --> 02:04:54,068
And then we heard from the gentleman that worked in the engineer's office saying that there's probably a need for a major water main and gas main on Evans Street.

1521
02:04:54,628 --> 02:04:59,251
So at this point, it doesn't make sense to ask for a major repaving.

1522
02:04:59,571 --> 02:05:03,774
But I would ask, Mr. President, that the city administration, as a CPAPA,

1523
02:05:05,377 --> 02:05:12,279
look into whether or not a complete water main and gas main needs to be replaced on Evans.

1524
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:15,921
And if so, that that work be done immediately.

1525
02:05:16,401 --> 02:05:21,602
And then we can discuss the repaving of the street, which will probably be part of that work anyways.

1526
02:05:21,903 --> 02:05:25,384
So we have a main paper, uh, that's been amended.

1527
02:05:25,544 --> 02:05:28,605
So a B paper then would be separate.

1528
02:05:29,325 --> 02:05:29,825
Okay.

1529
02:05:29,865 --> 02:05:30,205
That's fine.

1530
02:05:30,225 --> 02:05:30,545
Thank you.

1531
02:05:31,005 --> 02:05:32,566
And the amendments were that, uh,

1532
02:05:33,355 --> 02:05:39,836
Uh, we, so we've just, uh, heard stated by council marks, the B paper, which we'll take the vote on first.

1533
02:05:40,636 --> 02:06:01,100
And then the main paper, which was the $500,000 allotment from free cash as requested, uh, by the mayor two weeks ago, um, in council on May 17th was amended first by vice president Lungo Kern, that we get an update, frequent updates on the progress of the project and that preference be given

1534
02:06:01,613 --> 02:06:05,897
to the most outstanding or oldest sidewalks on the list.

1535
02:06:06,437 --> 02:06:07,558
Councilor Mox.

1536
02:06:08,619 --> 02:06:09,620
And most dangerous.

1537
02:06:10,241 --> 02:06:11,622
Yes, most dangerous.

1538
02:06:12,303 --> 02:06:19,789
And Councilor Mox had an amendment on there, which is escaping my mind, and Madam Clerk is going to share it with me in a second.

1539
02:06:20,530 --> 02:06:22,492
Sidewalks be assessed.

1540
02:06:23,722 --> 02:06:27,484
sidewalks be assessed once they're reported.

1541
02:06:27,904 --> 02:06:29,705
And rated for future reference.

1542
02:06:29,745 --> 02:06:32,105
For future reference, once they are reported.

1543
02:06:32,986 --> 02:06:38,268
So, Madam Clerk, on the B paper offered by Councilor Marks, would you please call the roll?

1544
02:06:38,348 --> 02:06:40,589
That is regarding Evans Street and the water main.

1545
02:06:40,629 --> 02:06:50,913
Evans Street, and for an assessment on water, gas, and other utility replacements which need to be facilitated prior to a resurfacing of the thoroughfare.

1546
02:06:52,815 --> 02:06:54,216
Madam clerk, please call the roll.

1547
02:06:54,236 --> 02:06:54,497
Yes.

1548
02:06:54,517 --> 02:07:05,166
With the vote of seven, the affirmative, none, then the negative B paper passes now onto the main paper.

1549
02:07:11,607 --> 02:07:12,948
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1550
02:07:12,988 --> 02:07:13,768
Councilor Calvelli?

1551
02:07:14,549 --> 02:07:14,949
Calvelli?

1552
02:07:15,569 --> 02:07:15,769
Yes.

1553
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:17,190
Councilor Falco?

1554
02:07:17,510 --> 02:07:17,690
Yes.

1555
02:07:17,790 --> 02:07:18,391
Councilor Knight?

1556
02:07:18,531 --> 02:07:18,931
Yes.

1557
02:07:18,991 --> 02:07:20,072
Vice President Lindelof-Burns?

1558
02:07:20,092 --> 02:07:20,252
Yes.

1559
02:07:20,812 --> 02:07:21,472
Councilor Mox?

1560
02:07:21,572 --> 02:07:21,953
Yes.

1561
02:07:21,973 --> 02:07:22,933
Councilor Scarpelli?

1562
02:07:23,333 --> 02:07:23,633
Yes.

1563
02:07:23,714 --> 02:07:24,474
Councilor Tolson?

1564
02:07:24,554 --> 02:07:24,934
Yes.

1565
02:07:25,014 --> 02:07:29,076
With a vote of 70 affirmative, none in the negative, the main paper passes.

1566
02:07:29,176 --> 02:07:30,337
Thank you all very much.

1567
02:07:30,817 --> 02:07:35,700
And the records of the meeting of May 28th, 2016 will pass to Councilor Falco.

1568
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:39,222
Mr. Councilor, how indeed did you find those records?

1569
02:07:39,529 --> 02:07:40,470
Thank you, Mr. President.

1570
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:43,653
I reviewed the records, found them to be in order, and move approval.

1571
02:07:44,113 --> 02:07:46,195
All in the motion for approval by Councilor Falco.

1572
02:07:46,235 --> 02:07:47,015
All those in favor?

1573
02:07:47,416 --> 02:07:48,156
All those opposed?

1574
02:07:48,176 --> 02:07:51,039
Motion for approval is on the motion of Councilor Knight for adjournment.

1575
02:07:51,079 --> 02:07:51,740
All those in favor?

1576
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:52,300
All those opposed?
