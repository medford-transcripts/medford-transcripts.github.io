1
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:36,474
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually have a book again.

2
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:47,937
[SPEAKER_07]: This is bizarre because of the light.

3
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:48,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

4
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

5
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Present.

00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:00,452

00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:00,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Here.

8
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:01,933
[SPEAKER_22]: Mrs. McDone.

9
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:02,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Here.

11
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:05,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Present.

00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,916
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Russo.

13
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:07,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Present.

14
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:10,779
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor Burke.

15
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

16
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,841
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mrs. Ruggiero.

17
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,562
[SPEAKER_22]: Present.

18
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:16,563
[SPEAKER_15]: 7 present, none absent.

19
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,084
[SPEAKER_15]: All please rise and salute our flag.

20
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:31,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:32,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

22
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:37,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Item two, item one, approval of minutes of September 17, 2018.

23
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:38,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

24
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:39,706
[SPEAKER_15]: I was present.

25
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:43,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

26
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:47,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Amend the records to show that Mr. Russo was present.

27
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:47,250
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

28
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:52,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval as amended?

29
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:53,476
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Ms.

30
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Van Kloof, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

31
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:55,917
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

32
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:56,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

33
00:04:56,437 --> 00:04:57,457
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

34
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:58,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

35
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:01,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

36
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:02,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

37
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Always help with something, right?

38
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:09,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ms.

39
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:10,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Patterson.

40
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:12,203
[SPEAKER_04]: On page 2 of 10,

41
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It says about a quarter of the way down.

42
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Game time, $3,771.26 for operation and maintenance of contracted building.

43
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:31,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't know what game time was.

44
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,082
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the Columbus tube slide replacement.

45
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:35,882
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

46
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:36,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense then.

47
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:39,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering what games we were doing.

48
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it installed and all set?

49
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:41,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

50
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:42,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

51
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:43,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids are sliding.

52
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:44,849
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

53
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your work on that.

54
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:50,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo, have you tried it?

55
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve.

56
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,599
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion for approval by Mr. Benedetto.

57
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:54,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero?

58
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

59
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:01,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I have an update, because I'd rather not be the general public.

60
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:04,765
[SPEAKER_08]: The slide that's on this is one soldier.

61
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:07,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to mention the treasurer's report in one week.

62
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be coming up very shortly.

63
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:13,830
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, game time, who's going to do the installation?

64
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,292
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not doing the insulation, but the Parks Department's doing the insulation.

65
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And currently there is some trouble with the screws.

66
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:25,637
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not lining up with the other piece of the slide.

67
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:36,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So John McLaughlin put a call in to Travis Barnes, who works at Game Time, and he's been out of town since September 17th.

68
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:43,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're waiting for him to come back to town so we can come and take a look at the piece that was ordered

69
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:47,455
[SPEAKER_08]: to find out why it's not fitting up with the original piece that was there.

70
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:48,656
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

71
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:49,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

72
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So apologies for the clarification on that.

73
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,719
[SPEAKER_02]: The material had been received.

74
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

75
00:06:55,401 --> 00:07:00,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Could Mr. McLaughlin let us know when that's completed?

76
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:00,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

77
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:01,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

78
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:03,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion for approval?

79
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Giro.

80
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:03,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question.

81
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:04,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick one.

82
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Just on occasion one.

83
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:06,369
Sure.

84
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:13,775
[SPEAKER_05]: We're planning to produce a section for science instruction and science textbooks.

85
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:13,935
Correct.

86
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:27,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the science department needs regarding a textbook, we try to categorize that in that particular line versus general instruction.

87
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:27,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

88
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:29,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

89
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:32,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

90
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:33,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion for approval?

91
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:36,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval by Ms.

92
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustone, seconded by Ms.

93
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:38,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

94
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:38,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, please.

95
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:42,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

96
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:43,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto?

97
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:43,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

98
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:43,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. Gretchen?

99
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:44,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. Gretchen?

100
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:44,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

101
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. McNeil?

102
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:47,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

103
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:48,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. McNeil?

104
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:49,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

105
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Burke?

106
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:51,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

107
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:53,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

108
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:54,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

109
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Approval of payrolls.

110
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:56,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Burke.

111
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:58,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

112
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I know last year, and I forget the dates.

113
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just asking for someone to remind me.

114
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:06,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we do a complete audit.

115
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:11,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And when would we get that audit, as well as how often we're going to

116
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,487
[SPEAKER_04]: see the actual payrolls.

117
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:18,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was biannually, but I didn't remember if it was like November or if it was January.

118
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:20,409
[SPEAKER_15]: The audit is in process right now.

119
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:20,869
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

120
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,269
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can attest to that.

121
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:23,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Patterson?

122
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:34,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of payroll, we would be providing just an update of the new hires and any resignations and things of that sort.

123
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:41,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is just a listing for reference in terms of providing payroll.

124
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:52,264
[SPEAKER_02]: bi-week and bi-weekly, we did not interpret that to continue in that fashion, just because of the volume and the amount of documentation that's involved with that.

125
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had agreed, like, biannually we would get a complete payroll.

126
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And just so we know, because we're voting on payroll twice a year, I think that's what we voted on during last year, last spring.

127
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,369
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my understanding.

128
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:08,729
[SPEAKER_04]: In January, it's fine.

129
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:10,463
[SPEAKER_04]: if that works in your schedule.

130
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:11,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, certainly.

131
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,984
[SPEAKER_15]: At end of year or... Only through December and through June.

132
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then... Right, because we still have... I think that's what we decided on.

133
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:19,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to make sure I had the dates correct.

134
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:30,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't remember if it was November or January that we had stated, but I know we had voted, because I think we were talking quarterly, and then we thought that was too cumbersome for your department, so we moved it to biannually.

135
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll remember and go with January.

136
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can do that.

137
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, you know, the end of May, early June, because the end of the year is so crazy, if that works for you.

138
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:51,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can certainly look at that for January, just as a reminder for the committee that we still have many contracts that are not completed and approved for this fiscal year.

139
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:55,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So there continues to be adjustments as those come through.

140
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have the teachers and paras right now.

141
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:04,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, those are items that would be forthcoming and not reflective in the budget and or payroll at this point.

142
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:05,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

143
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:05,631
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

144
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:06,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

145
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:06,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

146
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:10,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion for approval of the payrolls by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

147
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:11,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz?

148
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:11,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, please.

149
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:11,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo?

150
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:11,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

151
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:11,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

152
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:12,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz?

153
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:12,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

154
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:12,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo?

155
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:12,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

156
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:12,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

157
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:13,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz?

158
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:13,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

159
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo?

160
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:16,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

161
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:16,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

162
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:16,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz?

163
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:17,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

164
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:24,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo?

165
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:25,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

166
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,838
[SPEAKER_15]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

167
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:27,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

168
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Report of Secretary, Ms.

169
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:30,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Kritz.

170
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:33,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have a report I'm writing now.

171
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:39,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to hand it out to everybody, and I'm just going to have to read somebody's original report.

172
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:47,313
[SPEAKER_08]: My report ties into the report that Jonathan read from first reading, so I'm going to read that one.

173
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:55,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So over the summer, I had made a promise last whole year, at the end of the year, to go out to every elementary school in the Valley of Indianapolis diagram and do a full report.

174
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's exactly what I did over the summer.

175
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:03,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I walked around the playgrounds and we put all this together about what we need to be done with the playgrounds.

176
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,662
[SPEAKER_08]: What everybody mentioned, and I mentioned that to the parents is that playground service is definitely part of the capital repair.

177
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:19,985
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just something that I wanted to mention here that we need to think about for future budgets for the other elementary schools, except for the public schools.

178
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:37,220
[SPEAKER_08]: So, on July 2nd, I met with the principal, and at their school, the next year he founds a very good, the landscaper's on contract, so the slugs in the community are very well-fed.

179
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,046
[SPEAKER_08]: On July 5th, I met with someone who treated two parents of all their slugs in the shelter system.

180
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:54,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things we talked about are replacing the broken section of the tube slide, feeding the puff squash, more squids, freeing both worms, adding mulch, etc.

181
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:56,790
to the jerk of your diggings.

182
00:11:57,227 --> 00:12:01,830
[SPEAKER_08]: the other piece that was delivered, which was talked about on the slide.

183
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,612
[SPEAKER_08]: It was delivered on September 11th.

184
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:07,014
[SPEAKER_08]: It's currently sitting in the playground outlet of Columbus Elementary.

185
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:10,196
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there is a problem with it connecting to the other original piece.

186
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:18,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So John will often text me, contact me back and forth and relay more information to the audience that we're still reading.

187
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we have enough data, I'll update everybody.

188
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:22,965
[SPEAKER_08]: On July 9th, we had the P.T.

189
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Parrot Show at Rodriguez.

190
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,248
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a similar discussion about

191
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:31,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a shout out to Mr. Potters, the music teacher.

192
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:37,578
[SPEAKER_08]: He volunteers his time and takes care of the garden, the flowers, the flowers, the bushes.

193
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:39,319
[SPEAKER_08]: It just looks beautiful.

194
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,340
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's so very pretty in the summer.

195
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,561
[SPEAKER_08]: You can imagine in July.

196
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:47,744
[SPEAKER_08]: On July 16th, I met with the two parents and a friend named Karen Turney.

197
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:54,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things they discussed was a gorgeous live session in one of their pre-K

198
00:12:55,126 --> 00:13:04,305
[SPEAKER_08]: playground area, adding sand blocks, freshly cut signs, and landscaping and mulching.

199
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:08,343
[SPEAKER_08]: What I do is I run some pictures in a few clubs.

200
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I look at before and afters.

201
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:14,306
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very nice to look at and see the dramatic differences.

202
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:28,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make John Gawthorne, I want to make Deanna Depney, Christine Patterson, Angel Guino, Juan Russo, Michelle Sesol, Michelle Rodriguez, Jenna Graham, Kara Church, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, Iria Burke, Leo Walter,

203
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:36,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing I wanted to do was, I wanted to just kind of build a kind of follow-up.

204
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:45,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been giving this stuff to the principals and I just wanted to go in and volunteer and be a vote to the volunteer partners.

205
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:51,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So I began doing that and I kind of made it up to the schools and then continued to schedule some of the kids.

206
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:58,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I wanted to just mention that I was at the American High School of Higher Information last week.

207
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,664
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a great turnout.

208
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:06,627
[SPEAKER_08]: While I was there, I stopped in to see my recent teachers of the high school in the location design.

209
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:10,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to share a very nice project that the students are working on in plasmatology.

210
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:18,090
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the teachers was there, and she, Lauren Skierada, and she showed me one of the projects they're working on.

211
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,431
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called the Airbook project.

212
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:25,640
[SPEAKER_08]: The students can pick any of them, choose a picture to recreate the style of the past on the practice desk.

213
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:33,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just came out wonderful, and it's something that the students really like doing, and it's just a lot of fun.

214
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:44,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And another thing I wanted to mention was if you're ever interested in having your hair or nails done, please, you know, feel free to contact Mr. Graves for an appointment.

215
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,591
[SPEAKER_08]: They can get you to an appointment at 781-393-2139 at any time.

216
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:51,991
[SPEAKER_08]: The kids really like working on customers.

217
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,932
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you ever, you know, want to get your hair done, you know, feel free to reach out.

218
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have my team from the VTO teaching organization online forum.

219
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:11,053
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been emailing Molly Lattin, Allison Roseberry, Jenny Graham, Paul Roseau, and Dr. Maurice.

220
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,874
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now, what we know, the forum can be added to the website very easily.

221
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:22,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, you still need to transfer the membership from Jenny Graham to a point person at public schools.

222
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:24,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're still working on that.

223
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:25,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Karen mentioned that last week.

224
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:29,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And still no new update yet, but we're still working on it.

225
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So as soon as we have another update, I'll let you know.

226
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:40,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And last week, I did hand out an ALF scholarship application for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders.

227
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:48,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I handed out a form to all schools, but one is left to be deteriorated to one of the schools.

228
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:52,784
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did have a question being, do we need to approve that at the school committee?

229
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:06,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

230
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:10,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

231
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:10,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz.

232
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:15,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

233
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:15,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Vandeclude?

234
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,389
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

235
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,589
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

236
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:18,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion granted.

237
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Report of committees?

238
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,130
[SPEAKER_15]: None?

239
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:22,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero?

240
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,069
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, suspension of the rules.

241
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:31,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have a number of big reports coming tonight, and a member of the community would like to speak on an event at the Chevalier Theatre.

242
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:36,583
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd like to invite Ken Krause up to the podium to speak on an important event that's transpiring next week.

243
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:45,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street, Medford, and also representing the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium.

244
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a member of the board of directors.

245
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:56,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to let the committee know about an event that's coming up, and also the public, anybody who might be watching that cares about Medford education.

246
00:16:56,935 --> 00:17:05,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a talk by Bill Cummings, who is the founder of Cummings Properties and the Cummings Foundation.

247
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,821
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take place at Chevalier Theater on Wednesday, October 10th at 7 o'clock.

248
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:23,586
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who may not know, Mr. Cummings is one of the most successful commercial real estate business people in the country and also one of the top philanthropists in the country.

249
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:31,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's very proud of pointing out that his entire formal education took place in Medford.

250
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:34,350
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew up in Medford and attended the

251
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:47,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Curtis School and Swan School for Elementary School, Roberts Junior High School, and Medford High School, graduating in 1954, and ultimately went to Tufts University, graduated in 1958.

252
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:57,621
[SPEAKER_01]: His story now is part of a book that he's written, and it's called Starting Small and Making It Big, An Entrepreneur's Journey to a Billion-Dollar Philanthropist.

253
00:17:58,281 --> 00:17:59,923
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of the talk is to

254
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:08,547
[SPEAKER_01]: dovetail with a program this fall called Arts Across Medford, and the theme of Arts Across Medford is roots.

255
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:20,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And conveniently enough, Bill is going to talk a lot about his Medford roots, growing up in Medford in a modest working class home, going through the Medford schools, and what you can

256
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,982
[SPEAKER_01]: aspire to and what you can become when you apply yourself.

257
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:31,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, if you look in the yearbook, Bill was not one of the superstar students in his class.

258
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:38,727
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't the valedictorian, he wasn't voted most likely to succeed or most ambitious or industrious or anything like that.

259
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:44,930
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a member of the Projector Club, he was a member of the Science Club, and he was a member of the French Club.

260
00:18:45,478 --> 00:19:02,514
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if he had an opportunity, he would have been a member of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, which, by the way, is a program through his Cummings Foundation that he gave $100,000 last year to keep that program going.

261
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:07,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that just kind of exemplifies the type of person he is.

262
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:18,660
[SPEAKER_01]: is a great example for people currently in the schools to look up to and hear him talk about his story of growing up in Medford and becoming what he's become.

263
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he's taken the giving pledge.

264
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a billionaire with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, he's giving away all of his money.

265
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:28,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, he's given money to the CCR.

266
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:37,804
[SPEAKER_01]: We at the Friends of Chevalier have been a recipient of two grants, specifically for the Medford Boys and Girls Club, which is in the lower level of the Chevalier Theater Complex.

267
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:58,321
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2014, he gave a $100,000 grant to allow the club to hire an education coordinator, and that person has been able to strengthen the relationship between the club and the school so they can continue helping students with homework and things like that after school directly related to their studies.

268
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:05,729
[SPEAKER_01]: grant that was awarded this year is a 10-year grant for the club to establish a literacy program.

269
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:13,554
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the areas that they felt there was a strong need for was to have more opportunities to focus on literacy at the club, more reading materials, more reading programs.

270
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:15,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just launched this fall.

271
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:18,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could talk about the guy all night.

272
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for letting me talk as long as I have.

273
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:26,922
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just hope anybody who sees Bill as a great example of what

274
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,717
[SPEAKER_01]: people in our schools can aspire to.

275
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And what our schools can help people achieve.

276
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,599
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take the time to come to the event on Wednesday, October 10th at Chevalier Theatre.

277
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:38,219
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.

278
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,519
[SPEAKER_01]: General admissions just come.

279
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll be inspired to hear Bill talk.

280
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually the moderator for the night.

281
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:50,582
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be former mayor and school committee chairman Michael McGlynn.

282
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be talking about

283
00:20:52,823 --> 00:20:54,343
[SPEAKER_01]: all the good things about Medford and the school.

284
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:56,424
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for letting me share that information.

285
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Ken.

286
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:05,287
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, I think you would be proud at the CCSR meeting this afternoon, they were handing out flyers for Mr. Cummings' event.

287
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,748
[SPEAKER_15]: And he has been a very giving man to this community.

288
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:14,090
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully people will go out and go to the event and listen to his story, which is quite fascinating.

289
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

290
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Item 1, report on new MCAS accountability system.

291
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:32,972
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to just make a few comments just about things that were happening in Medford as well this week, or the past two weeks I should say.

292
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:42,537
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to inform the school community that I had the opportunity of conducting four math learning walks at all of our elementary schools.

293
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:47,780
[SPEAKER_12]: The walks consisted of 10 to 12 people participating.

294
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:53,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanted to recognize all of those who supported us in gathering baseline data.

295
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:59,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Ellie O'Leary and Grace Vasili, who are our new math coaches, elementary math coaches.

296
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:02,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Fiza Khan, who's our math coordinator.

297
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, our director of curriculum.

298
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Diane Caldwell, our associate superintendent.

299
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:16,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Lisa Evangelista, who's our public relations representative, who was also documenting our work.

300
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:38,594
[SPEAKER_12]: We had principals Suzanne Galussi, her assistant principal, Shannon Demos, principal Kathy Kaye at the Columbus, Kirk Johnson at the Roberts with his assistant principal, Andy O'Brien, Diane Garino at the McGlynn Elementary, and Doreen Andrews, her assistant principal.

301
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:45,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Our Lesley partners who also participated were Dr. Patricia Cren de Galarse,

302
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:49,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Sue Cusack and Christina Jash, and myself.

303
00:22:50,340 --> 00:23:00,646
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a wonderful time of learning and observing and gathering baseline data, mathematics data, and specifically we were looking at core actions.

304
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:14,755
[SPEAKER_12]: We observed approximately 48 classrooms, and the things that we were looking for were evidence-based responses in mathematics, productive struggle, students being challenged,

305
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:29,803
[SPEAKER_12]: evidence of academic discourse, that students were using appropriate academic vocabulary and not saying things such as the thingy, but using the actual academic vocabulary of the course that was being taught.

306
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:44,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Access for all, what kind of accommodations or enhancements were being used, whether it was technology for all learners, and feedback, were students being given feedback during these instructional lessons that we were observing.

307
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:57,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So at our next school committee, I will present a more kind of robust report on the actual findings, but I wanted to just recognize that those were some of the things that were happening since we last met over the past two weeks.

308
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:16,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I also just wanted to update the community that last week we did have an isolated medical incident that occurred at the high school and that, yes, Mayor Burke and the whole school committee was notified and that all official protocols were followed.

309
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:20,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I also would like to report on our middle school.

310
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,038
[SPEAKER_12]: We had the opportunity to begin getting baseline data at both the McGlynn and the Andrews.

311
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,914
[SPEAKER_12]: and looking at practices and getting ready to go deeply and look at instruction.

312
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:37,280
[SPEAKER_12]: I did have the opportunity to spend some time at the Andrews.

313
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,942
[SPEAKER_12]: I was in a math classroom, Ms.

314
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:46,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Forty and Mr., where am I going right now, social studies class.

315
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:48,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. DeWaldi.

316
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Mr. DeWaldi.

317
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:51,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Science.

318
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:54,413
[SPEAKER_12]: About protons and neutrons and electrons.

319
00:24:55,014 --> 00:25:01,098
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just wonderful to hear the academic vocabulary and the work was really cognitively demanding.

320
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:06,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And I asked the students, you know, in the math class, was it difficult?

321
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:07,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it hard?

322
00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:10,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And they raised their hands feeling like, you know,

323
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:18,139
[SPEAKER_12]: they were understanding what was being taught, and the teacher was able to say, you know, after one day, they were remembering what they had taught in the past.

324
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,201
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was just very, very encouraging, and I look forward to doing much more of that.

325
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:40,712
[SPEAKER_12]: I also had the pleasure of attending a breakfast in Lowell with our DA, Marion Ryan, where she invited school superintendents, fire chiefs, and police chiefs for all of Middlesex County, and we met, and she really talked about

326
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:50,993
[SPEAKER_12]: the opioid crisis and how it is affecting our communities and how we can work together to educate all our constituents.

327
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:52,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was very informative.

328
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:58,855
[SPEAKER_12]: And lastly, I'd just like to recognize our media tech students at the vocational school.

329
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:02,176
[SPEAKER_12]: They scheduled an interview with me.

330
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:05,297
[SPEAKER_12]: They interviewed me at the media center.

331
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:09,758
[SPEAKER_12]: And the students not only conducted the interview, but they also were

332
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,054
[SPEAKER_12]: handling the cameras and the teleprompters behind the scenes.

333
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:16,075
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was really a coordinated event.

334
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:24,940
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you want additional information or look at that video of that, you can find it on our blog.

335
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,802
[SPEAKER_12]: For those of you who are interested, mpsadvantage.education.

336
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:34,786
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm really excited and I want to continue to just share the bright things that are happening in Medford Public Schools.

337
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Wonderful, thank you so much.

338
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:37,107
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome for that.

339
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:56,846
[SPEAKER_12]: And without much further ado, I want to thank Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, our Director of Curriculum, and our Headmaster, Paul DeLeva, who are going to share the updates on our new accountability system from the state, talking about the changes and what it means, what

340
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:00,393
[SPEAKER_12]: what does our MCAS data look like and what does it mean?

341
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:01,194
[SPEAKER_12]: So please.

342
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:03,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

343
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:10,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So good evening, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, Mayor Burke, and members of the Medford School Committee.

344
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight, Mr. DeLeva and I are going to provide you with an overview of the new accountability system.

345
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It is different from the old system.

346
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:22,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fairly complex and it's

347
00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:25,484
[SPEAKER_03]: in its nature.

348
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go through.

349
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:30,046
[SPEAKER_03]: In your packets, you have information.

350
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,847
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the PowerPoint slide that we're going to go through.

351
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:37,889
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also, I think, maybe a nine-page packet that accompanies it.

352
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:42,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, we're going to proceed through it.

353
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that you can see this.

354
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:47,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there way to dim the lights?

355
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:51,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Might make it a little bit easier to see.

356
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:54,939
[SPEAKER_19]: This is really good.

357
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,480
[SPEAKER_19]: It's better than when I'm teaching my students.

358
00:27:59,341 --> 00:27:59,621
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

359
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want you to know that this PowerPoint is lengthy, as I mentioned.

360
00:28:05,442 --> 00:28:12,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go through it quickly, balancing, giving you the information with not taking too much time to go through it.

361
00:28:12,764 --> 00:28:13,024
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

362
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:14,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start with the system highlights.

363
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:27,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So this system is meant to give the population, the citizens, the students, the schools, a lot of information beyond what the old accountability system offered.

364
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:31,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So it measures much more than test scores.

365
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes into student opportunities as well.

366
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:39,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It's both normative and criterion referenced in its nature.

367
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:53,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you that are not sure what those mean at home and here, it measures test results against different populations, different populations of students in different schools within the state.

368
00:28:53,588 --> 00:29:00,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also measures students' achievement against set targets and set criteria.

369
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:07,335
[SPEAKER_03]: It focuses on raising the performance of raising the lowest student performance.

370
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:15,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you'll see a little bit later, the performance of the whole school is balanced with the students of the lowest group.

371
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:17,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see a 50-50 split there.

372
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.

373
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:25,625
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a discontinuation of the old accountability rating system or assistance levels of 1 through 5.

374
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:30,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to see numbers with this new system.

375
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:42,334
[SPEAKER_03]: But rather, this system really looks at categories which measure a school's progress in offering student support in what they need.

376
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,037
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so moving on to the timeline and the process.

377
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:55,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can go back to December of 2015 when the federal government passed the ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act.

378
00:29:55,804 --> 00:30:00,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been almost three years since that act was enacted.

379
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:07,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And since that time, the state government, all 50 states, had to provide the federal government with a plan for how they're

380
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:12,436
[SPEAKER_03]: own state would be consistent with the goals set forth in the federal plan.

381
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:22,041
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's fast forward to June of 2018 after feedback from stakeholders was attained and the state came up with a plan.

382
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:25,583
[SPEAKER_03]: The Board of Education in late June approved it.

383
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:28,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are in September 2018, actually October 2018,

384
00:30:32,072 --> 00:30:34,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have our accountability ratings.

385
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:46,858
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it's been a long process, but our system is kind of a mesh between what the federal government wanted and how the state adapted to it and really, I think, strengthened it.

386
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So the required accountability indicators.

387
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:59,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're going to see is that there are a lot of different indicators embedded in this system, more so than what we had under the previous system.

388
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:14,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So the federal ESSA, I'm going to call it, Every Student Succeeds Act, requires that achievement is based on the annual assessments, our MCAS, and English language arts, math, and science.

389
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:20,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a measure of student growth or progress for the elementary and the middle schools.

390
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:33,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes graduation rates for high schools, progress in achieving English proficiency for our EL learners, and at least one measure of school quality or student success.

391
00:31:33,764 --> 00:31:39,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So as the federal government presented it, these were the baseline things that they wanted to see.

392
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:41,910
[SPEAKER_03]: So Massachusetts took ESSA.

393
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,532
[SPEAKER_03]: and added more to it, which we're going to see.

394
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:52,794
[SPEAKER_19]: So just to go over some of the indicators that were identified by the state.

395
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:57,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Achievement being one of them, that's something that we've always had in place originally.

396
00:31:58,157 --> 00:32:00,198
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll talk a little bit about how they're weighed out.

397
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,779
[SPEAKER_19]: Student growth was also part of an original indicator.

398
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:04,900
[SPEAKER_19]: What is new is

399
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:17,492
[SPEAKER_19]: English language proficiency was not something that was considered in accountability, but now the state would like to see our progress made with language proficiency.

400
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:25,376
[SPEAKER_19]: We do this by our access scores, so before our access scores were never really considered for accountability, they are now.

401
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:35,102
[SPEAKER_19]: As well as this wonderful chronic absenteeism, which has, and again, this is for grades elementary through middle school, by the way,

402
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:40,747
[SPEAKER_19]: The chronic absenteeism is students missing 10% or more of their days in membership, and that's key.

403
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:43,209
[SPEAKER_19]: Membership of when they start.

404
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:56,155
[SPEAKER_19]: But they also said if you're within a month, let's say you come in in June, and the student doesn't show up any of those days, the state's not gonna count that against us because the membership hasn't been that great.

405
00:32:56,655 --> 00:33:03,178
[SPEAKER_19]: But if a student starts midway through the year, it's 10% of when they start from when the school year ends.

406
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:10,684
[SPEAKER_19]: That being said, if you look at the high school, we have a little bit more indicators than we had before.

407
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:15,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, same with English language arts and finding growth.

408
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:22,228
[SPEAKER_19]: This has always been in here, the cohort rate of graduation, as well as the annual dropout rate.

409
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:25,750
[SPEAKER_19]: But once again, English proficiency is now part of it.

410
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:34,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Also chronic absenteeism, but this is also something new and that is talking about advanced placement coursework.

411
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:43,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically the comparison is the amount of students that are enrolled in advanced placement compared to the amount of students succeeding in advanced placement.

412
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,104
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are all new indicators that are now part there.

413
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:53,328
[SPEAKER_19]: So one thing that I have to kind of stress, I know we talked about it last year,

414
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,503
[SPEAKER_19]: When we were going over MCAS data, it's important that we talk a little bit about it this year.

415
00:33:57,904 --> 00:34:00,106
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the first year now where we have two points.

416
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:07,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Last year, from elementary to middle school, we had our first baseline point.

417
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we have our second point.

418
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,718
[SPEAKER_19]: So now we're comparing 2017 to 2018.

419
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:16,461
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't have that before because we did multiple different assessments.

420
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:18,303
[SPEAKER_19]: I can go into about one year we did PARCC.

421
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,613
[SPEAKER_19]: One year we tried the next generation MCAS.

422
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we're finally streamlining to get more data.

423
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:31,601
[SPEAKER_19]: So one thing I'd like everybody to think of is now is where we're following everything.

424
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:41,789
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't go back to, and it's in the previous slide, but we can't go back to maybe five or six years ago, because now we're going to compare different fruits, basically.

425
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,671
[SPEAKER_19]: They're all fruits, but watermelon to oranges.

426
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:46,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we have oranges to oranges.

427
00:34:46,392 --> 00:34:47,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you repeat?

428
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:51,267
[SPEAKER_19]: So 2017 was our baseline data.

429
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:53,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Which was a different test.

430
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it had different components.

431
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:59,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Different components, but they set us, they set criteria.

432
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:02,037
[SPEAKER_19]: The state determined criteria for us.

433
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:08,562
[SPEAKER_19]: So we were getting things in the summer, basically, looking to see how did we determine your chronic absenteeism targets?

434
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,005
[SPEAKER_19]: How did we determine your achievement targets?

435
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,160
[SPEAKER_19]: All that stuff.

436
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Every school has a different set of achievement targets.

437
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:18,242
[SPEAKER_19]: So nothing is static in the same.

438
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:21,143
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's go back to the Andrews, because that's where I previously was.

439
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:28,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, with the data that was presented to them, the state decided, OK, your target is to get to this number here.

440
00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:31,866
[SPEAKER_19]: And then a different school will have a different number to get to.

441
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:36,527
[SPEAKER_19]: So it comes down to that norm reference as well.

442
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:45,601
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically, again, using average scaled scores on the next generation MCAS.

443
00:35:48,202 --> 00:35:52,923
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing that we have to say, it's important that our data is updated as best as it possibly can be.

444
00:35:53,723 --> 00:35:59,024
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing that we noted that chronic absenteeism is something that's new and that's hit us before.

445
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,885
[SPEAKER_19]: So from a high school perspective, you have to weigh out

446
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:08,933
[SPEAKER_19]: the chronic absenteeism versus the dropout rate in some cases, because you could get hit with both.

447
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:18,299
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you don't have your data organized by that October 1st deadline, let's say there's a student that's unenrolled that we missed, we own that student all the way through.

448
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:20,000
[SPEAKER_19]: So it could be affecting us through.

449
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:25,885
[SPEAKER_19]: So one thing we've been trying to do is definitely try to clean up the data as much as we possibly can.

450
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:28,386
[SPEAKER_19]: And then if you see this SCS,

451
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:35,360
[SPEAKER_19]: the students that are coded into AP classes that they're noted that they're part of that cohort.

452
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,421
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the weights.

453
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:41,662
[SPEAKER_19]: Like a big pie, right?

454
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:43,562
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in fall, let's talk about apple pies.

455
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:45,523
[SPEAKER_19]: I love apple pies, okay?

456
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,243
[SPEAKER_19]: It's fall time.

457
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,924
[SPEAKER_19]: The pie is 100% on both sides, correct?

458
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:56,646
[SPEAKER_19]: So therefore we have one big piece of pie, one big pie on one side and the other side, which is different now

459
00:36:57,223 --> 00:37:00,164
[SPEAKER_19]: which wasn't there before, is this English language proficiency.

460
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:07,947
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have English language learners enrolled in your school, then 60, 20, 10, 10, you get to 100.

461
00:37:09,308 --> 00:37:13,330
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't have English language learners enrolled in your school, you're now at 67.5, 22.5, 10.

462
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:26,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Both equal 100, but the key is now the achievement percentage is greater now for that school that does not have an L in their school.

463
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:28,968
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, so let's go back a couple years.

464
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:33,851
[SPEAKER_19]: People would always say, well, the Andrews never had any L's, so that affected the accountability.

465
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:39,654
[SPEAKER_19]: So the state has now said, OK, there's definitely districts out there or schools out there that don't have L's.

466
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:46,018
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically what they're saying is, we're going to weight your achievement higher so that you equal 100% as if you did.

467
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:46,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, sir.

468
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:47,059
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have two questions.

469
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,862
[SPEAKER_19]: One, the first is about accountability, isn't it?

470
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:54,323
[SPEAKER_14]: So how is this weighted?

471
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,346
[SPEAKER_19]: So same deal of what I said with the achievement.

472
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:08,088
[SPEAKER_19]: They gave us a chronic asthma team number to hit.

473
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:09,708
[SPEAKER_19]: So they looked at your attendance in 2017.

474
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,831
[SPEAKER_19]: this number you want to go lower, you don't want this number to go higher.

475
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:24,334
[SPEAKER_19]: So they looked at that number, basically, and they said, okay, this is the target you need to hit, that lower number, and not show growth.

476
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:28,875
[SPEAKER_19]: So how do you re-engage students that are constantly absent?

477
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:30,275
[SPEAKER_19]: What are we doing as schools?

478
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:32,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

479
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:45,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, so I'm glad you brought that up because I didn't mention it initially.

480
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:47,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Growth has now changed.

481
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:51,696
[SPEAKER_19]: We used to take the median number of the cohort that they were in.

482
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:54,057
[SPEAKER_19]: I never understood that for years.

483
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:58,939
[SPEAKER_19]: Never made sense to me, but there are people above my pay grade that do that.

484
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:02,460
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically, I never understood why we did that.

485
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,042
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think now the state has realized, no, we need to take the average.

486
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:08,843
[SPEAKER_19]: So now it's the mean of the cohort.

487
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,734
[SPEAKER_19]: So now we're using the mean value for that, which in a group.

488
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't.

489
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:56,037
[SPEAKER_19]: An absence is still considered an absence, whether it's excused, medical, they have not determined how that is going to work.

490
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,678
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're counting that number.

491
00:39:57,698 --> 00:40:05,202
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that's where I agree with you that we should be focusing on certain scenarios that are affecting students.

492
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,924
[SPEAKER_19]: They're asking us to kind of figure out how do we re-engage.

493
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:12,986
[SPEAKER_19]: So for example, when a student is on home instruction,

494
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:25,138
[SPEAKER_19]: That student is technically present, but we have to code it correctly to make sure that they're marked under home instruction so that they're getting the present marking, even though they're taken out.

495
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:34,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, home instruction, this is medical-based instruction that's going to average more than 14 days within the school.

496
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:40,670
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more on us to make sure that our data is coded correctly in some cases.

497
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:46,292
[SPEAKER_19]: In some cases, we have students that are out on extended medical, but that doesn't factor in.

498
00:40:46,312 --> 00:40:48,213
[SPEAKER_19]: They still say that that's considered an absence.

499
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:59,797
[SPEAKER_09]: If a student fails to graduate on time for that same reason, so perhaps they're having some crisis

500
00:41:13,475 --> 00:41:24,706
[SPEAKER_19]: Not exactly, but what I would suggest with that, you know, we gather a team together and we start looking exactly what we can do to support that student academically.

501
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:30,291
[SPEAKER_19]: I think one thing that I do like about chronic absenteeism is that when it came out,

502
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:34,907
[SPEAKER_19]: We were able to filter out and say, OK, these are our top students.

503
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:38,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's come up with a plan of how we're going to re-engage them.

504
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:39,749
[SPEAKER_19]: How are we going to get them back in?

505
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:44,771
[SPEAKER_19]: How are we going to make sure that they're getting their academic stuff done?

506
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,752
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a new target that never existed before.

507
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:54,995
[SPEAKER_19]: So it kind of hit some of us pretty hard on our accountability that we weren't quite sure of how it was going to go.

508
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:57,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

509
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if it really is impossible, the school doesn't think it's going to be successful.

510
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,480
[SPEAKER_11]: It's never going to do what that initial student says they're going to do, right?

511
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:11,862
Instead, you're going to go out to the office, you're going to go out to the system, you're going to go out to the people who are going to be teaching you in general.

512
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:15,803
Those situations are there, and you're going to be able to find support, and it is nice to know that you're going to be successful.

513
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:40,913
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was a good thing for us to identify right off the get-go when we saw that it was an issue at the high school, for example.

514
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:47,650
[SPEAKER_19]: It was something that we all met, my building leadership team, we sat down and we started analyzing.

515
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,711
[SPEAKER_19]: The students, you know, what are we going to do when they hit five?

516
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:54,313
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's not just, okay, they get an automated phone call.

517
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:59,896
[SPEAKER_19]: They actually need a personalized phone call to find out what's going on and try to, you know, be on top of it.

518
00:43:00,516 --> 00:43:07,659
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's the goal for us this year is to be on top of it and see where things are, you know, where people are struggling and all that, you know.

519
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:15,543
[SPEAKER_19]: that were judged on the dropout stuff as well as the chronic absenteeism because it is a double-edged sword.

520
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:23,791
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes some students unfortunately feel like the best laid out plans aren't working for them.

521
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:27,134
[SPEAKER_19]: But that doesn't mean that we can't get creative and try to figure some things out.

522
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:30,638
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's something I want to keep focusing on this year as we go through the year.

523
00:43:33,682 --> 00:43:37,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, we don't want this to be very long for you.

524
00:43:38,826 --> 00:43:39,827
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not our goal tonight.

525
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:49,955
[SPEAKER_19]: So just to see that the high school weights too are different, and because obviously they have more indicators that are there, so their achievement is more at 40%.

526
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:53,877
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something to consider when you're also looking at MCAS scores.

527
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:57,280
[SPEAKER_19]: You're looking at achievement based on 60% from three through eight.

528
00:43:57,695 --> 00:44:01,458
[SPEAKER_19]: but you're looking at achievement being at 40% through the high school.

529
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:06,501
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, the high school has more things that they have to complete on their indicators.

530
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:10,063
[SPEAKER_19]: I do like this indicator a lot when it was explained to me.

531
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:21,471
[SPEAKER_19]: I think having students, and I think if you look at our accountability data based on what was there, having students that were participating in AP courses and doing very well in AP courses

532
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:23,313
[SPEAKER_19]: was something that we did very well in.

533
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:27,354
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something to take back as a note to get that 10%.

534
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:30,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, this is a lot.

535
00:44:30,215 --> 00:44:34,535
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to try to see if I can go through some stuff so you don't get stuck here.

536
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:42,597
[SPEAKER_19]: So all right, based on points, these are things that basically weigh in on how things are set up.

537
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:48,838
[SPEAKER_19]: So for example, if you hit exceeded target, you get a four, met three exactly all the way down.

538
00:44:49,858 --> 00:45:05,448
[SPEAKER_19]: That being said, if you look here at a middle school or an elementary school, so for example, if they get a three and you get a total points of here, as you go down and you take your average, you get 63.5.

539
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:12,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, right down the middle, now they're looking at the lowest performing students.

540
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:18,417
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, the state is tracking more kids than they've ever tracked before.

541
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,005
[SPEAKER_19]: All the data that we put into school brains is being translated out through the state.

542
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:35,292
[SPEAKER_19]: So therefore, they're selecting our lowest performing based on some criteria that's there, which is probably achievement as well as growth, possibly chronic absenteeism.

543
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:37,953
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're saying, OK, there's your lowest performance forms.

544
00:45:38,494 --> 00:45:41,495
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to see you get, oh, no.

545
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:42,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, I did it.

546
00:45:42,996 --> 00:45:43,296
[SPEAKER_19]: I got it.

547
00:45:45,518 --> 00:45:46,778
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have ruined the whole thing.

548
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:54,396
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically, they're comparing the two percentage to come to a general percentage here.

549
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:54,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah?

550
00:45:55,296 --> 00:46:00,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they compared to the lowest performing students?

551
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:00,699
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

552
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:00,819
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

553
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:01,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Half.

554
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:01,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Half.

555
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're just looking at the upper... They're looking at all students.

556
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:05,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Nope.

557
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:10,124
[SPEAKER_19]: They're comparing all students to their lowest performing students.

558
00:46:12,185 --> 00:46:16,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Of the two values that are here to come up with a criterion target percentile.

559
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,033
[SPEAKER_19]: No, don't peek.

560
00:46:19,573 --> 00:46:21,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the answer to your question is yes.

561
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:26,655
[SPEAKER_12]: All students is everyone including... Right, oh, I see what you're saying, yeah.

562
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:31,757
[SPEAKER_12]: All students count for 50% of the score.

563
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:38,219
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the students that are our lowest performance are counted a second time, and they are 50.

564
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:38,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

565
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:39,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

566
00:46:45,014 --> 00:46:52,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I got overzealous and took over some of Bernadette's slides.

567
00:47:11,055 --> 00:47:15,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We've spent a lot of time talking about this and going over it and watching videos.

568
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:18,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And each time it's becoming more clear to us.

569
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,142
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's fairly complicated.

570
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:25,144
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

571
00:47:25,164 --> 00:47:26,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went to the high school.

572
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:28,586
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got out of order a little bit.

573
00:47:28,886 --> 00:47:29,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go back to?

574
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:32,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

575
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:33,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Comparisons.

576
00:47:34,048 --> 00:47:34,268
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

577
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:37,710
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going back to the norm referencing.

578
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of jumped ahead to the criterion.

579
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:41,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the norm reference.

580
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:43,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are the different schools going to be measured against each other?

581
00:47:45,173 --> 00:47:57,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this past year there were some schools doing the legacy MCAS and some doing the next generation MCAS, the Department of Ed has had to put schools into different

582
00:47:59,661 --> 00:48:00,462
[SPEAKER_03]: different cohorts.

583
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:00,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

584
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:07,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year they're separated by grade level, type of school, the type of test.

585
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:13,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be much easier next year to do the norm referencing on this.

586
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:14,896
[SPEAKER_03]: This year was a little bit difficult.

587
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:22,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is new, so we're in uncharted territory.

588
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:33,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, I think Paul went over the criterion reference component and the measures on a zero to four scale, and then he was going into the charts.

589
00:48:35,669 --> 00:48:37,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't do the high school chart.

590
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:45,072
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so the high school chart is similar to the non-high school chart that came before.

591
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:50,935
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, what you see here is the advanced coursework completion.

592
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:59,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look under high school completion total and then EL progress below chronic absenteeism, you're going to see that high schools are being given credit

593
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: for advanced coursework completion.

594
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:19,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to look at the students who are enrolled in AP classes, IB classes, we don't have IB classes, or any other advanced course that the Department of Education deems advanced, which could be some honors classes.

595
00:49:19,186 --> 00:49:20,627
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't been specific with that.

596
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:23,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will get credit for that.

597
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:39,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, they're going to get this information not by us submitting a list of who's taking courses, but by them going right into the system through our SIF, our interoperability framework, and getting that information from our student information management system.

598
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:42,748
[SPEAKER_03]: and it gets put up right to the Department of Vet.

599
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have access to every single course that every single student is taking.

600
00:49:50,271 --> 00:49:57,194
[SPEAKER_03]: The four year graduation cohort rate is also added for the high school criterion reference calculation.

601
00:49:58,937 --> 00:50:06,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I understand it, in years past, districts were, schools were penalized for a five-year graduation rate.

602
00:50:07,802 --> 00:50:11,805
[SPEAKER_03]: So my understanding is that it's no longer a penalty.

603
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an acknowledgment that some students will have an extended engagement rate.

604
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:25,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that is a good thing, because in the past, we were, districts were penalized for going beyond the four-year graduation rate.

605
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:41,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to continue on what she's saying here, if you look at the weight, so if each one comes out to 100 over here, on the lowest performing, there was no EL student at this point, so their weight was different.

606
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:43,166
[SPEAKER_19]: But it still equals out to 100%.

607
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,183
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is just an example?

608
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:51,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, this is an example just so you put together.

609
00:50:52,244 --> 00:50:53,685
[SPEAKER_15]: To try and help us understand it.

610
00:50:53,865 --> 00:50:53,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

611
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:55,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'm just curious about that.

612
00:50:55,245 --> 00:51:01,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we counting the lowest performing students that take these classes?

613
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:01,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that seems...

614
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:06,500
[SPEAKER_19]: They're part of the, it's part of the indicator.

615
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:12,945
[SPEAKER_19]: But see, they're not, but if you look here, they're not, they're not recognizing there, so.

616
00:51:16,848 --> 00:51:32,200
[SPEAKER_19]: So the understanding is, and the way I understand the lowest performing is, we want to get less students in the lower performance category and move them into the, no, you're not going to get everyone, but the state is trying to say, don't forget about these guys, basically.

617
00:51:37,715 --> 00:51:43,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally understand what you're saying.

618
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:43,616
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

619
00:51:43,877 --> 00:51:44,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

620
00:51:55,657 --> 00:52:01,720
[SPEAKER_15]: To me I always thought it was a certain number of apples inside Yeah, it's it's weighted as 50% of

621
00:52:24,595 --> 00:52:27,296
[SPEAKER_19]: but it's not 50% of the class.

622
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:37,502
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I honestly, like I looked at my list, there's like a quarter.

623
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:39,363
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not half the grade.

624
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:40,943
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not half the grade.

625
00:52:41,044 --> 00:52:42,404
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's being weighted half.

626
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:43,725
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

627
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,846
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to, it's being weighted half.

628
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:47,207
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not half the grade.

629
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:48,768
[SPEAKER_19]: It's being weighted half.

630
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:50,829
[SPEAKER_19]: So third, let's say it's 30 kids.

631
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:57,701
[SPEAKER_19]: those 30 kids that are in the lowest performing are being weighted half against all still students.

632
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:57,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

633
00:52:58,721 --> 00:52:58,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

634
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:03,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

635
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:03,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

636
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:04,844
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I understand.

637
00:53:05,244 --> 00:53:06,165
[SPEAKER_19]: It's new for all of us.

638
00:53:08,826 --> 00:53:11,067
[SPEAKER_19]: So each school has a different amount of apples.

639
00:53:12,227 --> 00:53:15,569
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, I can't tell you what, whose apples are what.

640
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:21,277
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, some have Cortland, some have Macintosh, and they might have more Macintosh than Cortland, but... Very good.

641
00:53:21,297 --> 00:53:21,797
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying, I'm trying.

642
00:53:21,817 --> 00:53:21,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

643
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:22,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Van der Kloot.

644
00:53:22,237 --> 00:53:35,723
[SPEAKER_19]: So, on the places where kids are encouraged to do EBS work, either that has a fixed placement, either in the back of the bar or in the back of the parade, are we all welcome to that meeting?

645
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:43,706
Does that suggest that we should limit some programming to

646
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:54,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically the school system will go with either advanced placement or the IB.

647
00:53:55,296 --> 00:53:58,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually they don't go with both.

648
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the charter schools, not all, but many do IB.

649
00:54:07,992 --> 00:54:09,233
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not necessarily.

650
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:10,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily.

651
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:14,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think the Advanced Placement Program is a solid program.

652
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:28,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I think where we need to look are those honors classes that we feel are rigorous and find out what the criteria is for the Department of Ed to count them as the rigorous advanced courses.

653
00:54:28,784 --> 00:54:34,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't they determine a kid's success on scoring?

654
00:54:44,271 --> 00:54:45,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So this says completion.

655
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an area for me to look into more.

656
00:54:48,656 --> 00:54:52,360
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't say a certain level of, you know, if they got a 3, 4, or 5 on the AP test.

657
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:56,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a great question.

658
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:58,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it says completion.

659
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:04,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll follow up to find out does that require any pass, I assume, would be a completion.

660
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:06,596
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll follow up with that.

661
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:12,941
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't want to go through it, but again, the weighted total of that is 10%.

662
00:55:13,481 --> 00:55:19,866
[SPEAKER_19]: So it is, even though it's an important percentage, it is a small percentage on our whole calendar.

663
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:24,673
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no worries.

664
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:37,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Each school receives, as a matter of fact, they're making the new list now.

665
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:42,830
[SPEAKER_19]: So we got lists over the summer as schools, as principals.

666
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:51,594
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're already identifying students that are on the lowest performing end and we're trying to come up with plans, you know, to ensure success.

667
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:55,516
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, for me as a principal, what I like about it is

668
00:55:56,824 --> 00:56:00,285
[SPEAKER_19]: instead of me disseminating the data to figure that out, the state's doing it for me.

669
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:12,049
[SPEAKER_19]: So now I can look at what the state is giving me and say, OK, these are the kids we've got to target, we've got to figure out what we need to do to make them in showing achievement and growth and everything of that nature.

670
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:14,670
[SPEAKER_19]: And each school then got their own.

671
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,531
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can only see what's at the high school right now.

672
00:56:18,651 --> 00:56:23,973
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, my accountability shifted when I became headmaster, so I'm still sort of

673
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,224
[SPEAKER_19]: deciphering it, being in a new school.

674
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:41,289
[SPEAKER_19]: So then I'll bring up response and intervention again.

675
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:47,730
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one of the key things that I think where you are trying to find what every student needs.

676
00:56:49,411 --> 00:57:04,274
[SPEAKER_19]: So where I look at students that may be on our low performing stuff, I think that if we do our interventions and do what we normally do, we can re-grasp those kids while instruction is still going on throughout the day.

677
00:57:05,615 --> 00:57:07,555
[SPEAKER_19]: So that you're not losing that because I think

678
00:57:08,272 --> 00:57:17,836
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, part of differentiated learning is that you're getting your high guys excited and you're finding the gap to meet the modem so everybody gets what they need.

679
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:20,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Good?

680
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:25,519
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

681
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:29,801
[SPEAKER_19]: So, talking about categories... Thank you.

682
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:31,021
[SPEAKER_19]: I knew you were going to do that for me.

683
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:31,982
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate it.

684
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:32,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

685
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,831
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I knew that was going to happen, too, because I was doing that fast.

686
00:57:38,152 --> 00:57:38,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all set.

687
00:57:38,472 --> 00:57:38,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

688
00:57:39,272 --> 00:57:39,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

689
00:57:42,113 --> 00:57:42,433
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

690
00:57:42,894 --> 00:57:48,016
[SPEAKER_19]: So as we said before, you used to be used to seeing level one, level two.

691
00:57:48,476 --> 00:57:49,877
[SPEAKER_19]: We all strive to be level one.

692
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:51,297
[SPEAKER_19]: We were happy when we were level two.

693
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:56,700
[SPEAKER_19]: We were scared when we were level three, because we knew the state was going to start intervening a little bit.

694
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,700
[SPEAKER_19]: So one thing to note is that

695
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:07,622
[SPEAKER_19]: basically 90% of our schools could be categorized based on their own performance against the targets that were given to us.

696
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:10,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Most schools will have 50% or higher.

697
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:15,945
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you looked at our accountability reports, which are public now, we are in that range.

698
00:58:17,265 --> 00:58:21,587
[SPEAKER_19]: So they also want to commend students for being schools of recognition.

699
00:58:22,687 --> 00:58:27,749
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you look here, this is where we fall right now.

700
00:58:29,725 --> 00:58:33,946
[SPEAKER_19]: which again is 85% of all schools in the state of Massachusetts.

701
00:58:34,046 --> 00:58:39,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're in the partially, so as a district, we're in the partially meeting targets.

702
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:40,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

703
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:51,892
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if you look here, this note is very important, because in 2018, these were performance against two categories, but in 2019, we're going to have more data, right?

704
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:55,193
[SPEAKER_19]: So therefore, they'll have it against three as well.

705
00:58:57,712 --> 00:59:01,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Under this system, schools are categorized and districts are categorized.

706
00:59:11,556 --> 00:59:29,910
[SPEAKER_03]: So those schools that previously were in levels four and five, which is not Medford, but just so you know, the commissioner is going to be putting them in the either underperforming or chronically underperforming categories.

707
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hope we're not even going to go anywhere near that place.

708
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:40,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Schools ending in grade three will only be classified on their criterion reference component only, because there is no

709
00:59:41,298 --> 00:59:46,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's no growth component to that because there's no test prior to grade 3.

710
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:56,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Schools with no tested grades will be classified as having insufficient data, and schools with low assessment participation, that's below 95 percent,

711
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,411
[SPEAKER_03]: will be classified as needing focused or targeted support.

712
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a very serious thing.

713
01:00:04,651 --> 01:00:12,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not want to get anywhere near 95% or below 95% because that puts us in a completely different category.

714
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:13,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So we aren't of that.

715
01:00:13,713 --> 01:00:15,213
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

716
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:16,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes.

717
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:37,933
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, from the perspective of parents and their mother too, they can get passed, which is magnified, I think.

718
01:00:37,953 --> 01:00:43,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's a really well-planned state.

719
01:00:44,335 --> 01:00:57,721
[SPEAKER_10]: The conversation came up about this, and, you know, if you get into this category, which unfortunately there wasn't any in this category, it was stated and very clear that what it means to be in this category is not what you're studying.

720
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,381
[SPEAKER_10]: in this kind of state of the margin for school.

721
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:06,324
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing great, which are 92%.

722
01:01:07,025 --> 01:01:09,787
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not resources here to pay for the school.

723
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:27,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a school is below 95%, they're going to be classified as needing focused, targeted support.

724
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:32,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So can we go back a slide to the chart, the categorization of schools?

725
01:01:32,424 --> 01:01:37,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look over on the right-hand side, where it says focused, targeted support, that's 15%.

726
01:01:37,646 --> 01:01:38,906
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a low 15%.

727
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:42,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a good place to be.

728
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:46,729
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the old system, once you got

729
01:01:53,063 --> 01:02:04,476
and we don't really care about it.

730
01:02:07,711 --> 01:02:08,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

731
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:12,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the change is that this is less punitive.

732
01:02:12,853 --> 01:02:15,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It is more support-oriented.

733
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:19,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, I mean, that came all the way from ESSA, all the way down to the state.

734
01:02:20,396 --> 01:02:22,297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the approach that they wanted to take.

735
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Less punitive in nature.

736
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:27,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is in sync with what you're saying.

737
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:45,951
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the other reason why participation became a focus was because, again, we did park, we did next generation.

738
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:49,435
[SPEAKER_19]: There was nothing for us to compare for achievement.

739
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:53,761
[SPEAKER_19]: There was nothing for us to compare to growth because, again, there were different fruits

740
01:02:54,742 --> 01:02:59,785
[SPEAKER_19]: going through, and then finally we decided, okay, now we finally have the same kind of fruits.

741
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:01,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we can look at things differently.

742
01:03:01,206 --> 01:03:09,391
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think when they're saying they're weighing more on the participation, I think that was mostly for this year because they had nothing else.

743
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:14,514
[SPEAKER_19]: If you even look at our accountability from last year, it says participation, no status.

744
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:18,416
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's something to be considered.

745
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:20,303
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's talk about the districts.

746
01:03:20,603 --> 01:03:22,805
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we've kept you longer than you probably want to listen to us.

747
01:03:22,885 --> 01:03:26,187
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll try to keep moving along as best we can.

748
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:37,074
[SPEAKER_19]: So the one thing that we now need to think about with districts is it is no longer what used to happen was if one school went into level three, then we all were in level three.

749
01:03:37,574 --> 01:03:40,436
[SPEAKER_19]: It is now, think of the district as one big school.

750
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:46,360
[SPEAKER_19]: So it takes all the ratings that we have and it comes out with its own rating on its own.

751
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,141
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's no more,

752
01:03:47,554 --> 01:03:51,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you're not making it, so the whole district is not making it.

753
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:52,396
[SPEAKER_19]: That I liked.

754
01:03:52,476 --> 01:03:53,456
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought that was a good idea.

755
01:03:54,596 --> 01:04:01,499
[SPEAKER_19]: So from now on, the whole district has its own percentage for everybody that's throughout the year.

756
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,500
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're just focusing on students from every grade level.

757
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:10,422
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, the districts fall into the meeting targets and the parcel of meeting targets.

758
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:13,023
[SPEAKER_19]: If you look before, I'm going to go back a couple of slides.

759
01:04:14,102 --> 01:04:16,462
[SPEAKER_19]: This was something that's not in there for the district.

760
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:20,263
[SPEAKER_19]: They are identifying individual schools more.

761
01:04:20,303 --> 01:04:23,484
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is really a school-focused accountability.

762
01:04:23,524 --> 01:04:25,944
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that's what I want to kind of drive home here.

763
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:29,425
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can have schools of recognition.

764
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:31,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, again, we all strive to get there.

765
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,267
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that you or me?

766
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:39,227
[SPEAKER_03]: That was you.

767
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:39,647
[SPEAKER_19]: That's me.

768
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:40,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

769
01:04:40,587 --> 01:04:42,008
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm losing track of where we are.

770
01:04:44,449 --> 01:05:02,834
[SPEAKER_19]: So with some of the data that has come out, noticing that 74% are designated of not requiring assistance or intervention, 14% is requiring assistance or intervention, and 12% basically insufficient data.

771
01:05:02,954 --> 01:05:05,735
[SPEAKER_19]: And the numbers just change when it comes to districts.

772
01:05:05,775 --> 01:05:10,796
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's just comparing accountability classification versus district accountability.

773
01:05:11,645 --> 01:05:15,447
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and this one, the accountability categories for schools.

774
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:20,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So within the state, 31 are categorized as meeting targets.

775
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:24,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So within Medford, the Brooks Elementary School fits in that category.

776
01:05:25,712 --> 01:05:28,574
[SPEAKER_03]: 53% are categorized as partially meeting targets.

777
01:05:28,974 --> 01:05:31,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be the district and all other schools in Medford.

778
01:05:33,056 --> 01:05:38,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not have any schools in either of the two other categories.

779
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:51,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Statewide, 51 schools received a school of recognition label for high achievement, high growth, or exceeding targets.

780
01:05:51,857 --> 01:05:59,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Going on to the next slide here, it talks a little bit about the schools who needed more comprehensive support.

781
01:06:00,282 --> 01:06:02,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we're not in that category.

782
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going quickly here because it doesn't apply to us.

783
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:08,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to the next slide,

784
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:22,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I never looked at it that way.

785
01:06:23,342 --> 01:06:25,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

786
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:27,885
[SPEAKER_19]: I usually did it by district to be honest with you.

787
01:06:31,227 --> 01:06:33,709
[SPEAKER_19]: I will tell you that the number varies though with the

788
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:41,453
[SPEAKER_19]: If there's a charter school that's counted in as well as, I mean, just look at what we did with the merger.

789
01:06:41,533 --> 01:06:42,733
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it's all one schools.

790
01:06:48,816 --> 01:06:49,936
[SPEAKER_19]: A little bit more, I would say.

791
01:06:50,096 --> 01:06:51,557
[SPEAKER_19]: I would think, but yeah.

792
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,841
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure we can figure it out.

793
01:06:54,121 --> 01:07:02,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess what, 131 schools were among the lowest 10%, so that would give you some idea of the 13 years.

794
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I really look it up then?

795
01:07:04,828 --> 01:07:05,228
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

796
01:07:05,248 --> 01:07:05,428
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

797
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:06,609
[SPEAKER_19]: You got zero over and you're good.

798
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:09,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that is it.

799
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:13,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's see, I forget what we were here.

800
01:07:14,254 --> 01:07:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: We went over that.

801
01:07:17,376 --> 01:07:20,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Target percentage slide here.

802
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:22,458
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we can...

803
01:07:26,154 --> 01:07:33,839
[SPEAKER_03]: The categories, some districts declined, some in which there were no change, some improved, some met target, some exceeded target.

804
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:38,461
[SPEAKER_03]: There are points that correspond with each one of those categories.

805
01:07:39,282 --> 01:07:41,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have the target percentage.

806
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:47,506
[SPEAKER_03]: 68% of schools received a target percentage of 50 or higher, indicating that the school is improving.

807
01:07:47,786 --> 01:07:51,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So 50 is kind of the number that you want to show improvement.

808
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:56,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just give you the numbers for what we have for Medford.

809
01:07:57,071 --> 01:07:58,351
[SPEAKER_03]: The district overall was 56%.

810
01:07:58,832 --> 01:08:04,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, 50 or higher is indicating that the school is improving.

811
01:08:04,774 --> 01:08:05,314
[SPEAKER_03]: The Brooks was 81%.

812
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:05,654
[SPEAKER_03]: The Columbus, 62%.

813
01:08:05,774 --> 01:08:06,494
[SPEAKER_03]: The McGlynn Elementary, 62%.

814
01:08:06,554 --> 01:08:07,175
[SPEAKER_03]: The McGlynn Middle, 42%.

815
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:07,795
[SPEAKER_03]: The Andrews, 50%.

816
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:08,355
[SPEAKER_03]: The Roberts, 72%.

817
01:08:08,995 --> 01:08:09,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And Medford High School, 53%.

818
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So I realize those are not on your slide.

819
01:08:24,422 --> 01:08:30,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are numbers that we looked up on the accountability reports specifically for the district.

820
01:08:31,367 --> 01:08:34,149
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you were keeping track of those numbers.

821
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:41,074
[SPEAKER_03]: The district and all of the schools, except for the McGlynn Middle, were 50% or higher.

822
01:08:41,214 --> 01:08:42,094
[SPEAKER_03]: McGlynn Middle was 42%.

823
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:51,340
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, then this next slide, accountability, data, do's and don'ts.

824
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:56,043
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're not supposed to compare 2,000 accountability data to historical data.

825
01:08:56,643 --> 01:09:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: In our minds, oftentimes, that's hard to do because we'd like, naturally, to see that there are trends in these growth.

826
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:09,572
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not supposed to equate the 2,000 accountability categories with historical accountability, as I just said.

827
01:09:13,363 --> 01:09:16,445
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to last Thursday.

828
01:09:16,985 --> 01:09:19,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's public, so it's okay for us to talk about it now.

829
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:41,800
[SPEAKER_03]: We are supposed to use preliminary results for internal planning purposes, and I will tell you that we did use that extensively through the summer, with the RTI classes, in particular in the middle school level and the high school level, and making sure that those students who did not achieve good scores were put into the classes that would be a benefit to them.

830
01:09:43,794 --> 01:09:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We are supposed to review the accountability resources.

831
01:09:46,856 --> 01:09:49,419
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of them, this PowerPoint.

832
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:57,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are supposed to ask questions, which we have been, and we've been taking a note of your questions as well.

833
01:10:11,585 --> 01:10:16,710
It would be nice for me if we had a sense of we're going to be hitting 53%.

834
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:22,796
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know that because we hit a 53% in January and October and November.

835
01:10:23,336 --> 01:10:27,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's probably the direction we're going.

836
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,384
[SPEAKER_10]: In disability information, is there a sense of what's expected?

837
01:10:31,504 --> 01:10:35,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Or are we going to get one, basically, in a year, one data point?

838
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:51,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're looking for a formative assessment, I think, of our accountability.

839
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:51,945
2018.

840
01:10:57,509 --> 01:11:04,395
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, I think with the criteria that we're listing, there's some we can hit right away, and there's some

841
01:11:05,467 --> 01:11:07,788
[SPEAKER_19]: You may know when the MCAS starts for three through eight.

842
01:11:07,808 --> 01:11:09,949
[SPEAKER_19]: We're talking April, May.

843
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,471
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you're talking about scoring.

844
01:11:12,511 --> 01:11:19,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the upside of doing it online is there's a quicker turnaround with getting that data, the preliminary data to schools.

845
01:11:20,415 --> 01:11:24,417
[SPEAKER_19]: But until that's more streamlined, I don't know if we're going to hit.

846
01:11:24,517 --> 01:11:31,680
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, unfortunately, the percentage of achievement and growth is like the big piece of the pie, right?

847
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,742
[SPEAKER_19]: So where we can hit the little pieces of the pie

848
01:11:36,061 --> 01:11:37,322
[SPEAKER_19]: and hit little things like that.

849
01:11:37,342 --> 01:11:41,145
[SPEAKER_19]: The big piece is we can't hit until we get the most.

850
01:11:42,586 --> 01:11:42,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

851
01:11:45,107 --> 01:11:45,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

852
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:47,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

853
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:48,509
[SPEAKER_15]: It's tiny.

854
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:49,830
[SPEAKER_19]: It's tiny.

855
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:49,830
10%.

856
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:50,611
[SPEAKER_19]: Tiny.

857
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:53,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Tiny slice.

858
01:12:00,877 --> 01:12:04,740
[SPEAKER_19]: So the way I also look at this is we do district-based things as well.

859
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:13,597
[SPEAKER_19]: We do screeners, we do things of that nature so that we can identify students on our own as a district prior to taking the MCAS.

860
01:12:13,617 --> 01:12:23,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I don't think, and I don't mean this to sound in a different way, but I don't think that we're trying to teach the test, we're trying to teach the standards and show proficiency based on that.

861
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:33,888
[SPEAKER_19]: But if we have our own internal assessments, I know elementaries do Fountas and Pinnell, Dibbles, things of that nature, and like we talked about the Anderson and McGlynn are now using Study Island.

862
01:12:34,594 --> 01:12:36,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are data points that we use.

863
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:41,977
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, I don't use just the MCAS for one student as the whole pie for the student.

864
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:49,000
[SPEAKER_19]: There's little pieces that we try to figure out a profile and try to determine what we can do to help that student succeed.

865
01:12:56,383 --> 01:12:58,844
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you can, but you get it in a later fashion.

866
01:12:59,884 --> 01:13:01,125
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think one thing that we

867
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:06,993
[SPEAKER_19]: We are trying to work with school brains, which is good, is identifying those key points.

868
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:18,680
[SPEAKER_19]: So for example, an English language learner that comes into the district, we want to see what their English proficiency is, what their MCAT score is, what their grades are, and see what we need to target with them.

869
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,760
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're getting there.

870
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:25,804
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't think we're there just yet, because we have to make sure we're putting the right pieces in the right place for the puzzle.

871
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:32,124
[SPEAKER_15]: So for students that come from another community, do we ever see their data at the old community?

872
01:13:32,604 --> 01:13:36,946
[SPEAKER_19]: So we do with their CUME file that comes with them.

873
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:42,768
[SPEAKER_19]: I think in some cases, remember October 1st, we technically don't own them.

874
01:13:43,249 --> 01:13:46,650
[SPEAKER_19]: So if they came in after October 1st, the sending district is getting

875
01:13:47,868 --> 01:13:53,650
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that they're getting the scores, we're getting the scores too, but the accountability gets affected to the sending district.

876
01:13:53,750 --> 01:14:08,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, but if we're getting a student that was in the lower category from another district, comes to Medford, we want them to succeed, we should know that they... That they were... Yeah, and I think that's stuff that our guidance Councilors tend to try to reach out to and find out.

877
01:14:08,696 --> 01:14:13,638
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, nobody comes with a direct folder until we actually get it and see it.

878
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:17,041
[SPEAKER_15]: So the state's not sending the information back down to us?

879
01:14:17,121 --> 01:14:19,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that I know of.

880
01:14:19,843 --> 01:14:21,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me say that again.

881
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:25,188
[SPEAKER_19]: You can do a claimed student file.

882
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:30,127
[SPEAKER_19]: just how well that is is a different story.

883
01:14:30,227 --> 01:14:31,548
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, you can.

884
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:34,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go in and we can look at the MCAS history of the students.

885
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:40,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a student enters Medford in grade 10, we can go back and look.

886
01:14:40,877 --> 01:14:43,319
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were in three different districts, we pull up that history.

887
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:45,421
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see what they got for each one of those years.

888
01:14:45,802 --> 01:14:48,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, we go right on to Edwin, and we have access to that.

889
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,378
[SPEAKER_15]: And just a second follow-up.

890
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:53,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Our fifth grade is entering the middle school.

891
01:14:54,139 --> 01:14:56,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Their data is being looked at at the middle school system for support.

892
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

893
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:57,681
[SPEAKER_10]: VanderKloof?

894
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:58,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't find it right now.

895
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:00,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what I read the report on.

896
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:08,124
[SPEAKER_09]: But I saw something about, particularly to college-graduate students, which is education.

897
01:15:09,164 --> 01:15:13,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seemed like there was some

898
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:23,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So that may have been not in the PowerPoint, but in the guidance packet.

899
01:15:23,089 --> 01:15:26,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a nine-page packet that came through.

900
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:30,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, I can't really speak to it right now.

901
01:15:32,054 --> 01:15:36,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can reference back that we have access to their MCAS scores.

902
01:15:36,836 --> 01:15:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go back and take a look at that.

903
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:44,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. Russo.

904
01:15:44,482 --> 01:15:46,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mr. Russo.

905
01:15:48,046 --> 01:15:56,674
[SPEAKER_03]: An EL student, a transient.

906
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:23,640
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a date by which, as Paul mentioned, if they enter after October 1st, then they belong in the accountability of the previous district.

907
01:16:27,692 --> 01:16:28,433
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll look into that.

908
01:16:28,893 --> 01:16:31,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero?

909
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:55,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we can identify.

910
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,401
[SPEAKER_19]: We can do an item analysis.

911
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:00,182
[SPEAKER_19]: We can do a standard comparison.

912
01:17:00,623 --> 01:17:06,586
[SPEAKER_19]: We can look at what the students or the Andrews are doing compared to the two kids in the state with a certain question, things of that nature.

913
01:17:06,606 --> 01:17:08,407
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I don't know if perhaps it's going to be an issue.

914
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:16,331
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think I'm going to do a peer review.

915
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:21,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I just get more granular touch, a sense of where we're going wrong and where we're

916
01:17:22,969 --> 01:17:39,247
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we were trying to prep you for tomorrow night in our own way so that you kind of understood Yeah, I think we can hit that a little bit more hard, you know in a different combination conversation in the subcommittee

917
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is very extensive.

918
01:17:44,544 --> 01:17:48,405
[SPEAKER_03]: The curriculum directors do work that with their staff members.

919
01:17:48,505 --> 01:17:51,366
[SPEAKER_03]: In the recent past, I don't remember reporting that.

920
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:54,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just hold you to that, but if that's something you want.

921
01:17:54,747 --> 01:17:58,968
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that is routinely done by the curriculum directors on the system.

922
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:02,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say, for example, let's say area is a problem that we keep coming across as an issue.

923
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:06,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps it's the curriculum that's in trouble.

924
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:10,631
So that would be very much our domain.

925
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:23,271
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

926
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:23,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Vandekloot.

927
01:18:24,452 --> 01:18:25,352
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually found it.

928
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:31,614
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on the fourth page of the summary of the next generation district in school, this one.

929
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:40,517
[SPEAKER_16]: And it says, in an effort to control for student trends, DESE intends to measure the performance of each district.

930
01:18:40,557 --> 01:18:48,660
[SPEAKER_16]: But the last line is, however, results for the lowest performing students group will include only those students who have been enrolled in the same school

931
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:50,370
[SPEAKER_16]: for two consecutive years.

932
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:52,911
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is an improvement.

933
01:18:52,931 --> 01:18:53,772
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is a good thing?

934
01:18:53,832 --> 01:18:55,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, for the lowest performance.

935
01:18:56,072 --> 01:19:02,275
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was something that I know that was very concerning to districts

936
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:13,185
[SPEAKER_16]: in the urban group whose students moved frequently between, say, Somerville, Chelsea, Medford, Everett.

937
01:19:13,845 --> 01:19:23,571
[SPEAKER_16]: And so there was a group of school committee members spearheaded by Mary Jo Rossetti of Somerville, who's now a city council person, who had worked so diligently on that.

938
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:26,392
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is probably their attempt to address it.

939
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:28,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

940
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:31,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

941
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:34,028
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved by Mr. Aguirre, seconded by Ms.

942
01:19:34,068 --> 01:19:34,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz.

943
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:34,909
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

944
01:19:35,309 --> 01:19:35,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

945
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:35,969
[SPEAKER_15]: All opposed?

946
01:19:35,989 --> 01:19:36,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

947
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:38,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

948
01:19:39,152 --> 01:19:41,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Report on before and after school programs.

949
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:51,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I would like to ask Megan Fidler-Carey, our new before and after school program coordinator, to come forward and present the updates.

950
01:19:51,743 --> 01:19:56,887
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you've been very busy these past few weeks, months I should say, going back to the summer.

951
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Superintendent.

952
01:19:59,332 --> 01:20:02,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the Medford before and after school program has a new leader.

953
01:20:03,577 --> 01:20:13,248
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, Shelly Gross retired and she ran the after school program and I handed over the reins for the before school program to Megan Fidler-Carey.

954
01:20:13,817 --> 01:20:18,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Megan was a Medford resident, so just so you know, she has roots with us.

955
01:20:19,624 --> 01:20:24,549
[SPEAKER_05]: She has a master's degree from the University of Massachusetts in Boston and is an Ed.D.

956
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:27,733
[SPEAKER_05]: candidate at the Leadership in Urban Schools.

957
01:20:28,213 --> 01:20:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Her leadership skills include working in a district-wide extended day

958
01:20:32,715 --> 01:20:43,482
[SPEAKER_05]: after-school program fostering partnerships and relationships in the building community, exploring creative ways to make opportunities equitable, and meeting the needs of all students.

959
01:20:44,103 --> 01:20:47,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, she has worked in communications and marketing.

960
01:20:47,765 --> 01:20:51,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Megan believes that all students should be held to high expectations.

961
01:20:51,988 --> 01:21:00,494
[SPEAKER_05]: She was the district-level director for partnerships and after-school programs in Revere prior to coming to Medford Public Schools.

962
01:21:01,413 --> 01:21:08,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I consider myself very fortunate, and I think MedFed is very fortunate, to have Megan as a leader in our before and after school program.

963
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:19,390
[SPEAKER_05]: She has worked tirelessly this summer and has shown that the health, education, and safety of our students is paramount to running successful before and after school programs.

964
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:21,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to introduce you to Megan.

965
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, welcome.

966
01:21:24,951 --> 01:21:25,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, how are you?

967
01:21:26,211 --> 01:21:26,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Good, thank you.

968
01:21:27,852 --> 01:21:34,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Brinson and Mayor Burke and school committee for giving me this opportunity to meet you all, to speak with you all.

969
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:35,814
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope it's the first of many times.

970
01:21:36,594 --> 01:21:43,056
[SPEAKER_18]: To report out on the highlights and updates of the after school program and before school program, as well as some of our challenges that we face.

971
01:21:44,176 --> 01:21:50,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I think this is a great opportunity to ask for your support in all that we do and to help you

972
01:21:50,938 --> 01:21:54,259
[SPEAKER_18]: communicate what we're doing to the parents that you work with all the time.

973
01:21:54,900 --> 01:22:03,983
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll give, as my report, the background on the after school program as I give it when I'm interviewing candidates to work in our program.

974
01:22:05,544 --> 01:22:17,268
[SPEAKER_18]: The Medford before and after school program are in-district programs, meaning that everybody that works in the program are employees of the district and not my own business where I go back to my office and do my run and then come back.

975
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:19,929
[SPEAKER_18]: So the benefits of that are,

976
01:22:20,548 --> 01:22:26,835
[SPEAKER_18]: increased communication between the school, the classroom teachers and administrators, and the before and after school staff.

977
01:22:27,195 --> 01:22:34,303
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's paramount, as you know, for sharing information about students and what's going on in their day and how we can help them.

978
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:45,003
[SPEAKER_18]: We provide homework help, we provide social-emotional learning opportunities, and we ask that the kids have fun.

979
01:22:45,183 --> 01:22:48,286
[SPEAKER_18]: We make sure they have fun in a really safe, semi-structured way.

980
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:52,971
[SPEAKER_18]: So I gave a report, so I don't want to read it word for word.

981
01:22:53,091 --> 01:22:54,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully you've had a chance to read it.

982
01:22:54,232 --> 01:22:56,494
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's anything you have questions about, I'm happy to go over it.

983
01:22:59,144 --> 01:23:03,066
[SPEAKER_18]: school program and the after school program have increased 30% in the last two years.

984
01:23:03,426 --> 01:23:05,247
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's really exciting news.

985
01:23:05,427 --> 01:23:07,348
[SPEAKER_18]: That tells us that the need is there.

986
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:13,491
[SPEAKER_18]: That tells us that Medford families are coming, our families are moving to Medford and that we're growing.

987
01:23:13,711 --> 01:23:20,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I can't take credit for any of that growth because as we just said, I'm brand new and I've been just diligently working.

988
01:23:20,574 --> 01:23:27,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually wouldn't have taken all these families in because I would have waited till we were more fully staffed.

989
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,543
[SPEAKER_18]: So my position was new.

990
01:23:30,563 --> 01:23:37,248
[SPEAKER_18]: We were looking for a site coordinator at one of our schools and lots and lots of group leaders and assistant group leaders.

991
01:23:37,508 --> 01:23:41,251
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've described in this report what all of those different positions do.

992
01:23:42,352 --> 01:23:46,136
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's really important that we have qualified people to do these jobs.

993
01:23:46,256 --> 01:23:52,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Because one of the things that I make very clear when I'm hiring people and when I'm talking to parents is that it's not babysitting.

994
01:23:53,001 --> 01:23:56,204
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not there only to make sure the students

995
01:23:57,045 --> 01:23:57,485
[SPEAKER_18]: are safe.

996
01:23:57,845 --> 01:23:59,806
[SPEAKER_18]: We're definitely there to make sure they're safe.

997
01:23:59,866 --> 01:24:01,007
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not our only purpose.

998
01:24:01,347 --> 01:24:18,953
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're looking for qualified people who will take this position seriously, who will look at these students as potential high-achieving students, and who will be able to help them with homework, who will speak academic language, who can be professional in front of students as role models and when talking to parents when reporting out on their children.

999
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:22,492
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working really hard.

1000
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:25,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, I'm working full time on hiring.

1001
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:32,119
[SPEAKER_18]: But I really want to impress upon everybody that hiring is creating job descriptions that attract the right people.

1002
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:38,324
[SPEAKER_18]: It's recruiting and posting in all of the places that I can think of that you guys can think of to spread the word.

1003
01:24:38,925 --> 01:24:41,246
[SPEAKER_18]: It's then interviewing and setting up all those interviews.

1004
01:24:41,266 --> 01:24:48,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, even before the interviewing is vetting and making sure that the people are qualified and really come from where they say they do.

1005
01:24:49,132 --> 01:24:59,178
[SPEAKER_18]: And then going through the hiring process, which I feel like I have to say thank you to the business and payroll office, because we're sending them so many people, and it's probably a tax on their system.

1006
01:25:00,378 --> 01:25:01,099
[SPEAKER_18]: And then training.

1007
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,962
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not just a matter of writing down a name, filling out a paper, and then boom, I've checked that box.

1008
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:13,446
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a much longer process, which I take pride in, and I want it to be that, because that's what's best for our students.

1009
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:15,451
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where we are.

1010
01:25:15,471 --> 01:25:16,192
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working on that.

1011
01:25:16,452 --> 01:25:19,915
[SPEAKER_18]: I was really excited when I said, okay, I have to update this report.

1012
01:25:19,975 --> 01:25:21,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are we now with our hiring?

1013
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:28,562
[SPEAKER_18]: And we got to five group leaders, 15 assistant group leaders, and seven high school students, who they're the greatest, by the way.

1014
01:25:28,843 --> 01:25:31,365
[SPEAKER_18]: I really like that we have that opportunity and that works out.

1015
01:25:31,903 --> 01:25:36,646
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was a little hopeful when I pushed print on this report to say that we'd made an offer to a site coordinator.

1016
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:39,168
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't made the offer, but we have narrowed it down.

1017
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:44,112
[SPEAKER_18]: So I will hopefully have an offer made to a site coordinator for the Columbus School by the end of this week.

1018
01:25:46,954 --> 01:25:50,476
[SPEAKER_18]: So a couple of other things that I want to make sure you know.

1019
01:25:52,643 --> 01:25:57,026
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working really hard to, like I said, we're always wanting to improve it and expand it.

1020
01:25:57,146 --> 01:26:00,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are our two focuses, right, foci right now.

1021
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:09,154
[SPEAKER_18]: The improvement is really making it a quality program for students, not only getting their homework done, or if not done, then we let the parents know that it wasn't done.

1022
01:26:09,254 --> 01:26:14,658
[SPEAKER_18]: So we signed some homework contracts for some parents that want to do it with them, but also trying to make it meaningful for the students.

1023
01:26:14,998 --> 01:26:20,502
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of the exciting things that's happening at the McGlynn School, for example, is we've got walking field trips.

1024
01:26:20,797 --> 01:26:31,810
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're taking the kids, because we have lots of resources right there, we're taking them out of the school building, with permission from their parents, to go learn some independence, to learn how to go to the grocery store.

1025
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:40,620
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to start working on taking the bus some places, so that these fifth grade students, who are soon going to be middle schoolers and don't have an after school program,

1026
01:26:42,687 --> 01:26:42,867
[SPEAKER_18]: yet.

1027
01:26:43,227 --> 01:26:44,847
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, actually, I'm not biting that off.

1028
01:26:44,907 --> 01:26:48,048
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not biting that off.

1029
01:26:48,228 --> 01:26:52,349
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have some experience in how to get some real world experience about how to get around.

1030
01:26:52,409 --> 01:26:54,849
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the direction we'd like to be going in.

1031
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:57,790
[SPEAKER_18]: But of course, we need qualified, thoughtful staff to get there.

1032
01:26:58,150 --> 01:26:59,330
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're working on that.

1033
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:01,671
[SPEAKER_18]: So as Ms.

1034
01:27:01,691 --> 01:27:03,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Caldwell said, thank you very much for the introduction.

1035
01:27:03,531 --> 01:27:04,191
[SPEAKER_18]: That was fantastic.

1036
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:08,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I knew my thing.

1037
01:27:08,252 --> 01:27:11,553
[SPEAKER_18]: Do I just lost my place?

1038
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:12,473
[SPEAKER_18]: I lost my place on that one.

1039
01:27:13,005 --> 01:27:19,449
[SPEAKER_18]: where field trips, yeah, we're doing it all.

1040
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:34,098
[SPEAKER_18]: Qualified staff, so yeah, I'm really, oh, she said that the purpose is about the students and that my role is creating this atmosphere for the students, but I also actually see my role in the after school to create the atmosphere for the staff.

1041
01:27:34,858 --> 01:27:41,022
[SPEAKER_18]: My job is to set the expectations for the staff of what we want to be and make sure they have everything they need from me to get there.

1042
01:27:41,449 --> 01:27:53,437
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want them to feel safe and secure in their positions and feel professionalized and given opportunities for professional development, given opportunities to try out these fantastic ideas like teaching the fifth grade kids independence.

1043
01:27:53,758 --> 01:27:56,780
[SPEAKER_18]: So my goal also I see is about staff development.

1044
01:28:00,622 --> 01:28:07,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, the staff are unlicensed and they're non-career teachers, so it's really

1045
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:13,014
[SPEAKER_18]: a challenge and important to find and interview the right people for the after-school program.

1046
01:28:13,174 --> 01:28:14,895
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to leave it up to some questions.

1047
01:28:14,975 --> 01:28:16,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I ask you just one quick question?

1048
01:28:16,656 --> 01:28:16,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1049
01:28:17,496 --> 01:28:23,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see the enrollment numbers for specifically the after-school program, and there's quite a disparity with the numbers that are at different schools.

1050
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:27,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that based on interest from the school population?

1051
01:28:28,462 --> 01:28:28,802
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.

1052
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:29,242
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.

1053
01:28:29,302 --> 01:28:32,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we do have wait lists at all schools.

1054
01:28:32,844 --> 01:28:36,767
[SPEAKER_18]: The wait lists are pretty, you can see over there, they're pretty comparable.

1055
01:28:36,867 --> 01:28:37,567
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not like,

1056
01:28:37,991 --> 01:28:40,832
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a huge interest at Columbus, but we just can't staff.

1057
01:28:42,232 --> 01:28:47,273
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a huge interest at Columbus that we just can't staff, but it's not as great as at the Brooks, for example.

1058
01:28:47,773 --> 01:28:49,113
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is smaller.

1059
01:28:49,933 --> 01:28:52,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing to note that you can't see.

1060
01:28:52,974 --> 01:28:53,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Proportionately, though, it isn't.

1061
01:28:54,294 --> 01:28:54,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Say that?

1062
01:28:54,975 --> 01:28:57,675
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the same number at the Brooks and the Columbus.

1063
01:28:58,035 --> 01:28:58,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, at the Brooks.

1064
01:28:59,055 --> 01:29:00,276
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, the wait list is, right.

1065
01:29:00,336 --> 01:29:03,016
[SPEAKER_18]: But if the interest was the same,

1066
01:29:07,618 --> 01:29:13,002
[SPEAKER_18]: see how there are 168 people at the Brooks, then there would be a wait list of 168 at the Columbus.

1067
01:29:13,383 --> 01:29:25,291
[SPEAKER_18]: But the thing that doesn't show up in this data that I really want to point out but would take a lot of data analysis to look at is keeping in mind that some kids are five days and some kids are as few as two.

1068
01:29:26,847 --> 01:29:32,811
[SPEAKER_18]: These are all of the students, and it doesn't designate how many are two days versus five days.

1069
01:29:33,211 --> 01:29:40,637
[SPEAKER_18]: So the numbers have actually gone up a lot more, because there are a lot more five-day students now than there were two years ago.

1070
01:29:41,397 --> 01:29:48,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Two years ago, I think there were parents that were signing up for just a couple days to keep kids, not necessarily as much out.

1071
01:29:52,725 --> 01:29:54,847
[SPEAKER_18]: There's an even greater need, and they're signing up for five days.

1072
01:29:57,317 --> 01:29:57,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1073
01:29:57,617 --> 01:29:58,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto?

1074
01:29:58,337 --> 01:29:58,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1075
01:29:59,098 --> 01:29:59,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Megan.

1076
01:30:00,338 --> 01:30:01,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Megan and I have been neighbors.

1077
01:30:03,139 --> 01:30:05,260
[SPEAKER_04]: When she lived in Medford, she was on my street.

1078
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And her daughter actually went to the Columbus School.

1079
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:11,322
[SPEAKER_18]: And was in the after school program.

1080
01:30:11,562 --> 01:30:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1081
01:30:12,202 --> 01:30:26,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was thrilled to have Megan receive this position, because as soon as I heard it, I knew that we were in for really quality instruction to our staff, who could then give it to our students.

1082
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:53,166
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm very excited as you grow in the position and you are able to fully staff your positions that we can grow the program and then we can talk about meeting all different subgroups and needs of all of our students and we can grow it in that manner as well to make sure that we're doing that and I've spoken to the superintendent about future that.

1083
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:56,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, staffing is the priority

1084
01:30:56,587 --> 01:31:03,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing is priority is customer service to our parents and our children.

1085
01:31:04,273 --> 01:31:13,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I did speak with someone from the Columbus School who said that they're not on the wait list because when they approached about after school, it was like, oh, there's no way.

1086
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:15,703
[SPEAKER_04]: The list is already so long.

1087
01:31:16,503 --> 01:31:20,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Sent that parent an email saying, here's some other resources in town, good luck.

1088
01:31:21,547 --> 01:31:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And they weren't added to the list.

1089
01:31:22,988 --> 01:31:24,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've spoke to you directly about it.

1090
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:26,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you're making effective change in that.

1091
01:31:27,431 --> 01:31:33,334
[SPEAKER_04]: But that parent, as of right now, as of today, when I checked with them, said that they were still not on the wait list.

1092
01:31:33,475 --> 01:31:35,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if someone added them since then.

1093
01:31:35,856 --> 01:31:39,859
[SPEAKER_04]: But there may be other parents out there that aren't on the wait list.

1094
01:31:39,899 --> 01:31:42,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how to go back and address that.

1095
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,103
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just need to make sure that every family with need

1096
01:31:52,303 --> 01:31:55,804
[SPEAKER_04]: given the chance for us to meet that need.

1097
01:31:56,365 --> 01:32:18,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's so important because we have working parents and single families and parents with family members with medical needs or all of the above that really look to us to help them to be able to afford to work in order to take care of their children.

1098
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:22,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is really, really out, and I call it out of school time.

1099
01:32:22,624 --> 01:32:37,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we don't call it that as a community, but I'd like to, at some point, sit down with the committee and talk about out of school time and how we care for students and how we manage them during school breaks and during summers and to include everyone.

1100
01:32:38,629 --> 01:32:40,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So I look at it as the biggest thing.

1101
01:32:40,449 --> 01:32:47,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that you're gonna look into that at all schools, not just the Columbus, and to make sure that the wait list is

1102
01:32:48,418 --> 01:32:52,760
[SPEAKER_04]: accurate and really fill the gaps where the biggest needs are.

1103
01:32:53,561 --> 01:33:05,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because there are more students at one school doesn't mean that the students at the less populated schools don't have greater needs as well.

1104
01:33:06,267 --> 01:33:08,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are a few of my concerns.

1105
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:09,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you're staffing.

1106
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:13,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you're working really hard to recruit people.

1107
01:33:15,368 --> 01:33:21,914
[SPEAKER_04]: When the Boys and Girls Club in Somerville closed, I was hoping that we could get some of those staff members and bring them over to ours.

1108
01:33:22,155 --> 01:33:23,116
[SPEAKER_04]: That was such a great find.

1109
01:33:23,136 --> 01:33:24,717
[SPEAKER_15]: We let them know, actually.

1110
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:30,903
[SPEAKER_15]: We did forward the job descriptions and the links, so we tried to recruit them to come over to your program.

1111
01:33:31,103 --> 01:33:36,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody in the community hears, we are hiring Medford 2 to 6 for our after school program.

1112
01:33:38,311 --> 01:33:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think that there are some opportunities that we could put forward, like providing free CPR and maybe free fingerprinting, just to fill the roles.

1113
01:33:47,973 --> 01:33:58,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that as a district, we don't usually do that, but the people in these positions are such part-time, that might encourage people if we're waiving those upfront costs.

1114
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to make a motion or to ask the superintendent if we could look into doing that at this time, to waive CPR in first aid,

1115
01:34:08,359 --> 01:34:12,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in fingerprinting costs, so that way we can entice more people to join the staff.

1116
01:34:13,242 --> 01:34:20,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at the low rate of pay, it's probably a week or two of someone's salary that they're working.

1117
01:34:21,887 --> 01:34:26,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I don't know if fingerprinting is either $35 or $65 last time I checked.

1118
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:29,431
[SPEAKER_17]: It's $35 because they're unlicensed.

1119
01:34:29,731 --> 01:34:29,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1120
01:34:30,051 --> 01:34:31,492
[SPEAKER_17]: And then CPR costs.

1121
01:34:32,628 --> 01:34:33,569
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know that off the top of my head.

1122
01:34:33,589 --> 01:34:39,433
[SPEAKER_15]: If we had a group, we could certainly arrange with Armstrong, but we would need a group of people to train together.

1123
01:34:39,453 --> 01:34:41,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're working on that with Armstrong, yeah.

1124
01:34:41,754 --> 01:35:00,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to make a motion at this point as to providing CPR at no cost and finger-pringing costs be provided for these before and after school programming people so we can make sure our staffing needs and our children's care is met.

1125
01:35:02,764 --> 01:35:03,384
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion?

1126
01:35:03,504 --> 01:35:05,165
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a second on the motion.

1127
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:09,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Could we ask, first, for how much that would cost?

1128
01:35:10,348 --> 01:35:14,090
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, then, is it retroactive for the people who just paid already?

1129
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:20,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So before I vote on that, I would just be more comfortable if we were to bring it back next week.

1130
01:35:20,693 --> 01:35:24,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm asking Christine if she could just comment.

1131
01:35:25,576 --> 01:35:30,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so the fee for unlicensed staff members is $35 per person.

1132
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:49,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But please be mindful that if we waive that requirement, meaning you're reimbursing, because we cannot pay for that expense up front, if you reimburse one group of employees, you will have the request to reimburse others in the same type of category.

1133
01:35:50,367 --> 01:35:59,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So that includes a number of employees throughout the district that would be a cost impact that we had not planned for for this fiscal year.

1134
01:35:59,689 --> 01:36:01,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a condition of employment.

1135
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:08,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's required of any employee, whether they are licensed or not, to be employed with the district.

1136
01:36:08,815 --> 01:36:11,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's any school district in the Commonwealth at this point.

1137
01:36:12,217 --> 01:36:16,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you amend it to CPF, to investigate if we could offer CPF funding?

1138
01:36:17,421 --> 01:36:17,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1139
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:21,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

1140
01:36:23,366 --> 01:36:27,589
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a question about, I'm just worried about if we,

1141
01:36:28,314 --> 01:36:32,397
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to reimburse someone for their, oh, are we taking that off?

1142
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:33,398
[SPEAKER_06]: We took it off the table.

1143
01:36:33,578 --> 01:36:34,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

1144
01:36:34,659 --> 01:36:40,623
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just strictly CPR, and that's if you have enough, we could arrange for training and licensing.

1145
01:36:41,543 --> 01:36:41,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Burke.

1146
01:36:42,484 --> 01:36:42,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1147
01:36:42,644 --> 01:36:43,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

1148
01:36:44,085 --> 01:36:51,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Megan, could you just give us a review of at least ballpark, because I know it differs a little bit, but what is the tuition?

1149
01:36:51,731 --> 01:36:52,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Tuition, yes.

1150
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:54,192
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually brought exactly the tuition.

1151
01:36:54,873 --> 01:36:57,595
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, you can sign up for anywhere from two to five days.

1152
01:36:58,321 --> 01:37:01,083
[SPEAKER_18]: So for two days, it's $196 a month.

1153
01:37:02,384 --> 01:37:04,665
[SPEAKER_18]: For three days, it's $290 a month.

1154
01:37:06,026 --> 01:37:08,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Four days is $352 a month.

1155
01:37:09,789 --> 01:37:11,070
[SPEAKER_18]: And five days is $408.

1156
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:11,070
$408.

1157
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:18,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And whenever a family registers, they pay a $50 registration fee.

1158
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:21,837
[SPEAKER_18]: And if they have multiple kids?

1159
01:37:22,078 --> 01:37:24,780
[SPEAKER_18]: There's an 8% discount on the second child.

1160
01:37:29,076 --> 01:37:30,857
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's just still the 8%.

1161
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:34,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you all set, Ms.

1162
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:35,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanderkleu?

1163
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, thank you.

1164
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:36,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1165
01:37:36,361 --> 01:37:36,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Stone.

1166
01:37:37,741 --> 01:37:38,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for coming.

1167
01:37:39,022 --> 01:37:43,025
[SPEAKER_21]: To help you recruit, what is the hourly rate for the different positions?

1168
01:37:43,045 --> 01:37:46,847
[SPEAKER_18]: The hourly rate, it depends on experience and position.

1169
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:51,590
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's from the assistant group leaders are starting at $14 an hour.

1170
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:56,933
[SPEAKER_18]: And the group leaders who come with experience, or else they wouldn't be in the group leader position,

1171
01:37:57,383 --> 01:37:58,504
[SPEAKER_18]: are starting at 17.

1172
01:37:58,744 --> 01:37:59,504
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1173
01:38:00,404 --> 01:38:00,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1174
01:38:00,905 --> 01:38:01,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1175
01:38:01,185 --> 01:38:02,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1176
01:38:03,606 --> 01:38:03,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Oshiro.

1177
01:38:03,866 --> 01:38:06,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we making a profit on this program right now?

1178
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:08,188
[SPEAKER_18]: My understanding is that we are.

1179
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:11,430
[SPEAKER_18]: This is definitely, I should have included that, a self-sustaining program.

1180
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:26,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's saying all the, I mean, for the watchers and listeners, so all of the tuitions that come in, all the tuitions pay for staff, supplies, any professional developments that we can find, supplies, supplies, supplies, first aid kits,

1181
01:38:27,177 --> 01:38:31,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there reimbursement for children of special needs?

1182
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:34,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a financial waiver for students of special needs?

1183
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:39,680
[SPEAKER_18]: We accept vouchers from Child Care Circuit, which is a state voucher system.

1184
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:45,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, my understanding is that there's a big wait list in the voucher world, too.

1185
01:38:45,701 --> 01:38:47,882
[SPEAKER_18]: But we definitely have a lot of families on voucher.

1186
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:55,444
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also offer- And CDBG money, Community Development Block Grant, $10,000 grant that goes towards assisting.

1187
01:38:55,745 --> 01:39:02,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, so we've given out 15 scholarships to 15 families this year with the CDBG money that we got.

1188
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:09,496
[SPEAKER_14]: So the full $10,000 has been- Is the need higher than the number of students that we've provided for or around that figure?

1189
01:39:09,676 --> 01:39:10,397
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hard to say.

1190
01:39:10,517 --> 01:39:17,543
[SPEAKER_18]: Families call and ask for it, and we ask for financial proof that they're in need.

1191
01:39:18,525 --> 01:39:21,987
[SPEAKER_18]: So as you know, in Medford, there are some families that don't want to show proof.

1192
01:39:22,047 --> 01:39:23,327
[SPEAKER_18]: And I understand that.

1193
01:39:24,168 --> 01:39:27,289
[SPEAKER_18]: And we can't give those families the scholarships.

1194
01:39:27,749 --> 01:39:32,091
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, I would say yes, there is a greater need than we can provide for.

1195
01:39:32,111 --> 01:39:34,592
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really hard to quantify what that looks like, though.

1196
01:39:34,872 --> 01:39:35,472
[SPEAKER_18]: How much more?

1197
01:39:35,673 --> 01:39:39,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Did more people apply for the scholarship than received it?

1198
01:39:40,795 --> 01:39:43,976
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, yes, because people are continuing to call and ask for it now.

1199
01:39:44,176 --> 01:39:46,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So they can't formally apply for the scholarship because it's too late.

1200
01:39:46,917 --> 01:39:48,018
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all been distributed.

1201
01:39:49,227 --> 01:39:49,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1202
01:39:49,927 --> 01:39:52,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Patterson, may I ask you a question about financing?

1203
01:39:52,148 --> 01:39:59,190
[SPEAKER_14]: How much would it cost for us to maybe provide a waiver for 15 more students to increase the number to 30?

1204
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:00,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Another 10,000.

1205
01:40:01,591 --> 01:40:02,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that be the waiver needed?

1206
01:40:03,892 --> 01:40:15,835
[SPEAKER_18]: The one thing that we need to be cautious about is because receiving vouchers from the state, I don't know if this is what you're going to answer, but when you receive vouchers from the state, you can't charge more than your lowest paying student is paying.

1207
01:40:16,155 --> 01:40:18,136
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we have too many, if we have

1208
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:31,078
[SPEAKER_18]: too big of an opportunity for scholarships, then voucher will sort of say, well, we don't need to provide, I mean, I'm not speaking for voucher, but they don't need to provide as much because we've got such a robust scholarship program.

1209
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:39,723
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'd have to be very careful with what our lowest paying student looks like outside of our scholarship program.

1210
01:40:41,104 --> 01:40:43,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it possible you could crunch those numbers for us as a report?

1211
01:40:44,821 --> 01:40:53,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not certain as to how we would go about identifying that, because again, it's based on the need for the number of days.

1212
01:40:53,883 --> 01:40:59,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So $10,000 could go very differently based on what the need is per family.

1213
01:40:59,644 --> 01:41:09,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little difficult to assess that in terms of what that would look like for what an additional $10,000 could cover.

1214
01:41:09,526 --> 01:41:13,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's say, for example, we found $10,000 under the rug here at City Hall.

1215
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:20,364
[SPEAKER_14]: and you reapplied that money, would we lose money from the state if we, let's say, provided a scholarship for 30 other students?

1216
01:41:20,624 --> 01:41:21,025
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1217
01:41:21,105 --> 01:41:24,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm making a note to myself to find out how that works.

1218
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:27,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion.

1219
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:27,590
[SPEAKER_15]: It was 15 students.

1220
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:28,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1221
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:29,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Counted by the 10 originally.

1222
01:41:29,812 --> 01:41:35,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to make a motion for us to ask for a report to see if you could report back to us what that number would be, because if

1223
01:41:36,377 --> 01:41:40,980
[SPEAKER_14]: If there is a need greater, I mean, I know many parents that are struggling in the city of Medford.

1224
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the parents work two jobs each.

1225
01:41:43,502 --> 01:41:47,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this program might be a huge boon for them and their family.

1226
01:41:47,504 --> 01:41:53,348
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be interesting for me to know what it would take for us to make 15 more slots available.

1227
01:41:53,928 --> 01:41:55,569
[SPEAKER_14]: If, you know, someone provides all the information.

1228
01:41:55,649 --> 01:42:00,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Five day a week student, if it's 400 a month, roughly, ten months, $1,000.

1229
01:42:02,692 --> 01:42:07,754
[SPEAKER_15]: So you could only be hitting two kids, two and a half, if you had five days a week.

1230
01:42:07,814 --> 01:42:09,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, and the staff is still the problem.

1231
01:42:09,655 --> 01:42:14,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, obviously there's hurdles, but I would just like you to look into that for us if possible.

1232
01:42:14,277 --> 01:42:15,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, staff should be the priority at this point.

1233
01:42:17,223 --> 01:42:17,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

1234
01:42:18,264 --> 01:42:24,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so aside from the staff though, the wait list is also space related, correct?

1235
01:42:25,849 --> 01:42:30,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but I'll take on the space challenge.

1236
01:42:30,653 --> 01:42:31,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1237
01:42:31,393 --> 01:42:32,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm happy to do that.

1238
01:42:33,214 --> 01:42:34,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Space is always an issue in schools.

1239
01:42:35,376 --> 01:42:45,563
[SPEAKER_18]: It's shared space, but I see that's another part of my role is to be the partnership liaison with the after school programs and the district, I mean in the individual schools.

1240
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:58,235
[SPEAKER_18]: So to work closely with the administration and closely with the teachers to make sure that we understand that these, I want to be careful in how I say this, but that the classrooms belong to the students.

1241
01:42:59,115 --> 01:43:04,237
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been a teacher, so I know that those classrooms, they work really hard on making them perfect for their students.

1242
01:43:04,497 --> 01:43:10,920
[SPEAKER_18]: And they deserve to walk in the next day to the room exactly as they left it in preparation for the class that they have planned.

1243
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,061
[SPEAKER_18]: But the rooms belong to the students.

1244
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:14,902
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the after school needs to use it,

1245
01:43:16,547 --> 01:43:19,229
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to take on that challenge to figure out how to make that work.

1246
01:43:19,469 --> 01:43:21,110
[SPEAKER_18]: So to expand space in that way.

1247
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:27,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess my question then was that the wait list is a staffing only issue.

1248
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:28,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, 100% a staffing only issue.

1249
01:43:29,156 --> 01:43:35,600
[SPEAKER_18]: So while I'm proud of those numbers of all the staff that I listed, only a few of them are five days a week.

1250
01:43:36,061 --> 01:43:38,583
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have the same puzzle making with staff.

1251
01:43:38,883 --> 01:43:42,005
[SPEAKER_18]: That doesn't mean I've got 30 new staff five days a week.

1252
01:43:42,085 --> 01:43:44,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of them are two days a week, one of them's one day a week.

1253
01:43:45,817 --> 01:43:49,218
[SPEAKER_18]: is an excellent one day a week person, so we took her to make it work.

1254
01:43:49,778 --> 01:43:55,739
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's definitely about being creative, thinking about how many students come on how many days.

1255
01:43:55,819 --> 01:44:03,081
[SPEAKER_18]: But I mean, with your permission and your support, I feel like we should be overstaffing for several reasons.

1256
01:44:03,461 --> 01:44:11,223
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, the ratios by the state are usually, we're licensed exempt, so we don't have to follow these, but they stick to one to 13.

1257
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:19,356
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you think about it, we're very different than a during-the-day classroom, where one teacher can stand in front of 25 students.

1258
01:44:19,696 --> 01:44:23,937
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's if something goes wrong, there are a bunch of other adults in the building that they can call upon to help.

1259
01:44:24,378 --> 01:44:34,461
[SPEAKER_18]: In the after-school world, if you're one in front of 25, you don't have custodians and assistant principals and all of these other people in the building that you can call upon if you need help.

1260
01:44:34,521 --> 01:44:36,382
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have to have smaller ratios.

1261
01:44:36,962 --> 01:44:37,883
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to keep it at 1 to 10.

1262
01:44:39,042 --> 01:44:43,745
[SPEAKER_18]: and even less if possible because we all know that one student that requires an adult.

1263
01:44:43,825 --> 01:44:45,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we, again, we're a self-sustaining program.

1264
01:44:45,986 --> 01:45:04,017
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't afford to be hiring one-on-one for the after-school program, but we can hire creatively when we have a student that's a little more challenging who might be a runner or who might be, you know, an instigator so that we can have more concentrated staff in the room with that student.

1265
01:45:05,043 --> 01:45:06,683
[SPEAKER_18]: The hiring is definitely the problem.

1266
01:45:06,844 --> 01:45:08,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Plus we have to keep in mind attrition.

1267
01:45:08,804 --> 01:45:14,686
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, in the nature of the staffing for this, is people who are in school to become classroom teachers.

1268
01:45:14,886 --> 01:45:18,927
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I always say to them is this is a fantastic interview for the Medford Public Schools.

1269
01:45:18,967 --> 01:45:24,649
[SPEAKER_18]: You should start here because everybody's gonna come look at the after school program for when a classroom position opens up.

1270
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:26,649
[SPEAKER_18]: But that means I lose a staff member.

1271
01:45:27,149 --> 01:45:29,710
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also great staff for retired teachers.

1272
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:32,911
[SPEAKER_18]: And they come and they're not quite ready to leave the schools,

1273
01:45:33,512 --> 01:45:35,252
[SPEAKER_18]: They can come do this for a while, but then guess what?

1274
01:45:35,272 --> 01:45:37,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Then they finally are saying, okay, now it's time to really, really retire.

1275
01:45:37,933 --> 01:45:43,474
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have to... That's why you saw in my report that I want to do a strategic plan.

1276
01:45:43,494 --> 01:45:52,816
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to work with all of you and specifically sit down with you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, to sit down and think about how we can get creative about the long-term strategy for this, as I know a couple of key people are.

1277
01:45:53,796 --> 01:45:54,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1278
01:45:55,317 --> 01:46:00,938
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion on the floor that we look into funding the CPR component for new hires.

1279
01:46:02,518 --> 01:46:03,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by Mr. Giro.

1280
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:04,760
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

1281
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1282
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:05,981
[SPEAKER_15]: All opposed?

1283
01:46:06,221 --> 01:46:06,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1284
01:46:07,141 --> 01:46:07,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1285
01:46:07,762 --> 01:46:08,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1286
01:46:08,542 --> 01:46:08,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1287
01:46:09,043 --> 01:46:09,523
[SPEAKER_15]: And good luck.

1288
01:46:10,083 --> 01:46:12,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1289
01:46:12,925 --> 01:46:13,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept.

1290
01:46:13,926 --> 01:46:14,547
[SPEAKER_15]: By Mr. Russo.

1291
01:46:14,587 --> 01:46:15,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by Ms.

1292
01:46:15,107 --> 01:46:15,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanden Heuvel.

1293
01:46:15,587 --> 01:46:16,248
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

1294
01:46:16,268 --> 01:46:16,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1295
01:46:16,888 --> 01:46:17,589
[SPEAKER_15]: All opposed?

1296
01:46:17,969 --> 01:46:18,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1297
01:46:20,271 --> 01:46:23,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Report on new superintendent induction program.

1298
01:46:24,153 --> 01:46:25,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, how are you?

1299
01:46:25,274 --> 01:46:26,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, Mayor Burke.

1300
01:46:26,135 --> 01:46:26,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to see you.

1301
01:46:26,775 --> 01:46:30,718
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very excited to present Dr. Connor Behr, who is my

1302
01:46:31,705 --> 01:46:33,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm NISP coach.

1303
01:46:34,426 --> 01:46:37,007
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in the new superintendent induction program.

1304
01:46:37,307 --> 01:46:40,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dr. Baird, I'm going to just pass the baton on to you.

1305
01:46:41,609 --> 01:46:46,211
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a little bit of information from your superintendent about the program in your packet, I know.

1306
01:46:46,231 --> 01:46:56,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the great privilege of coaching your superintendent and two other new superintendents of the 40 new superintendents in Massachusetts this year.

1307
01:46:56,876 --> 01:46:59,597
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our largest cohort of superintendents

1308
01:47:00,385 --> 01:47:06,687
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ninth cohort, the ninth year of the program, and this is our largest cohort.

1309
01:47:08,147 --> 01:47:14,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to say a couple of things about the program and then respond to questions that you might have.

1310
01:47:14,909 --> 01:47:23,731
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a program that's a partnership between the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents.

1311
01:47:24,248 --> 01:47:29,412
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the support of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees as well.

1312
01:47:30,693 --> 01:47:34,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a partnership between superintendents and school committees.

1313
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:39,800
[SPEAKER_00]: School committees typically support the participation of the superintendents.

1314
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:42,261
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, it's a three-year program.

1315
01:47:42,602 --> 01:47:53,610
[SPEAKER_00]: The first year is focused very much on supporting the superintendent to really, instead of hitting the ground leading or running,

1316
01:47:54,643 --> 01:48:21,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it's hitting the ground learning and to really make sure that amidst managing all that a new superintendent manages in a district, that the superintendents stay in a learning mode of really trying to understand what she is inheriting, what the culture is, what the accomplishments are, what the strengths, what the areas of growth need to be, really spend time digging into all kinds of data

1317
01:48:21,794 --> 01:48:25,937
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand the school district that she is now leading.

1318
01:48:26,797 --> 01:48:32,901
[SPEAKER_00]: That part of the entry process typically takes somewhere between five and six months.

1319
01:48:33,402 --> 01:48:43,388
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere around January, February, the new superintendents typically will present a report to the school committee, a very public report about her findings.

1320
01:48:44,089 --> 01:48:46,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And we support the superintendents in that process.

1321
01:48:48,451 --> 01:48:50,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the findings are in place,

1322
01:48:51,815 --> 01:48:53,495
[SPEAKER_00]: vetted with the community.

1323
01:48:55,376 --> 01:49:18,420
[SPEAKER_00]: We support the superintendents to turn those findings into a robust strategy for district improvement in which the superintendent involves the school committee, really builds the leadership team of principals and central office folks, reaches out to stakeholders around the community, and develops and proposes a strategy for you folks in hopes that you will embrace it.

1324
01:49:19,114 --> 01:49:26,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it becomes the district strategy that is developed and ultimately implemented by what we call the governance team for a district.

1325
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:30,479
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the school committee and the superintendent and her staff.

1326
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:41,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first year has a real focus on learning, making sense of the findings, and then turning those findings into a robust strategy for improvement.

1327
01:49:42,144 --> 01:49:47,667
[SPEAKER_00]: The second two years of the program are really focused on supporting effective implementation of that strategy.

1328
01:49:48,788 --> 01:49:57,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program is about building strong relationships with the union, the school committee, the leadership team, the teachers in general.

1329
01:49:58,598 --> 01:50:10,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important thing we do, and it's actually a really easy job for me to do with Dr. Edouard-Vincent, is to focus, is to help the superintendent stay focused on teaching and learning.

1330
01:50:11,413 --> 01:50:14,894
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the only thing that's going to make a big difference for kids in schools.

1331
01:50:15,534 --> 01:50:18,816
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are lots of things that pull superintendents away from that focus.

1332
01:50:19,556 --> 01:50:27,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of our job is to help superintendents figure out how to maintain that focus amidst all the other work that superintendents do.

1333
01:50:28,279 --> 01:50:31,220
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop there and invite questions.

1334
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:40,663
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say, because I didn't read this portion of my report for the listening audience, that Dr. Carla Baer,

1335
01:50:41,503 --> 01:50:43,564
[SPEAKER_12]: is serving as my one-to-one NSUP coach.

1336
01:50:44,265 --> 01:50:47,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Bayer is the former deputy commissioner at DESE.

1337
01:50:48,147 --> 01:50:59,515
[SPEAKER_12]: She also served as superintendent of schools in Massachusetts for nearly 20 years, including, most recently, eight years in Lowell, and before that, nine years in Wellesley.

1338
01:51:00,596 --> 01:51:07,100
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to put that down so they know your context and your broad experiences.

1339
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:11,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am so grateful to be the beneficiary of having you as my coach.

1340
01:51:13,573 --> 01:51:15,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Dr. Baer.

1341
01:51:15,655 --> 01:51:20,398
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had the opportunity to meet a couple times already, so it's delightful to have you here.

1342
01:51:21,038 --> 01:51:24,240
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a question, which seems appropriate to ask you.

1343
01:51:24,861 --> 01:51:33,046
[SPEAKER_16]: As part of the school committee's responsibilities at some point, it's our responsibility to assess our superintendent on a yearly basis.

1344
01:51:33,426 --> 01:51:38,870
[SPEAKER_16]: But here we have a new superintendent who's only getting her feet wet and doing a tremendous job so far.

1345
01:51:40,391 --> 01:51:48,956
[SPEAKER_16]: One of those things, if I remember from the past, of course, is that the superintendent develops goals, measurable goals with the school committee.

1346
01:51:49,516 --> 01:52:03,304
[SPEAKER_16]: At which point with a new superintendent should we begin to think about that process so that we are doing our due diligence in terms of giving her feedback that is responsible and coordinated?

1347
01:52:03,324 --> 01:52:05,525
[SPEAKER_16]: It's perfect timing for that question.

1348
01:52:06,161 --> 01:52:09,966
[SPEAKER_00]: The program involves eight content days during the year.

1349
01:52:10,026 --> 01:52:13,431
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already had a day in July, a day in August.

1350
01:52:13,831 --> 01:52:15,273
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another day Wednesday.

1351
01:52:15,874 --> 01:52:17,936
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the agenda topics is

1352
01:52:18,754 --> 01:52:23,335
[SPEAKER_00]: is preparing the superintendents for the proposing goals to their school committees.

1353
01:52:23,375 --> 01:52:34,237
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suspect by the next meeting, you will be in a position to have a conversation with your superintendent about the goals against which she will be assessed this year.

1354
01:52:34,877 --> 01:52:35,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1355
01:52:35,397 --> 01:52:35,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1356
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:36,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1357
01:52:37,538 --> 01:52:38,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto?

1358
01:52:38,878 --> 01:52:39,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1359
01:52:39,658 --> 01:52:41,239
[SPEAKER_04]: That was partially my question.

1360
01:52:41,259 --> 01:52:45,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you did, with the new superintendent.

1361
01:52:46,059 --> 01:52:48,480
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say the superintendent

1362
01:52:49,838 --> 01:53:01,140
[SPEAKER_04]: presented to us recently her overview and what her plan is going to be and I was extremely impressed with it.

1363
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:18,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad that this is offered to new superintendents because without it they would be calling old superintendents and trying to piece work things and I think this is a really step-by-step process for them and

1364
01:53:19,136 --> 01:53:24,841
[SPEAKER_04]: making the focus back on to the children in the curriculum in MCAF schools.

1365
01:53:25,141 --> 01:53:28,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much what we're here to do.

1366
01:53:28,744 --> 01:53:34,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that I've given her some phone calls myself that probably have distracted her from that focus.

1367
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:40,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these reminders are good for me as a school committee member as well.

1368
01:53:41,435 --> 01:53:43,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look forward to see what her goals are.

1369
01:53:43,736 --> 01:53:47,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they'll be substantial.

1370
01:53:48,411 --> 01:53:56,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want them to be realistic and attainable and hope that it's a successful beginning.

1371
01:53:56,833 --> 01:54:02,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited for what our community has in store with Dr. Edward.

1372
01:54:03,894 --> 01:54:04,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

1373
01:54:05,914 --> 01:54:15,596
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the goals of the program is that at the end of three years, the superintendents have a really strong cohort group of peers who have learned together,

1374
01:54:16,181 --> 01:54:35,357
[SPEAKER_00]: who have really developed the capacity to speak really honestly with each other, look to each other for support and help, and so that the superintendents, again, are together focused on driving improvement in teaching and learning in their districts and have a support network to help them.

1375
01:54:36,138 --> 01:54:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: As school committee members ourselves, I work in education, so there are some superintendents that I do call and ask

1376
01:54:44,767 --> 01:55:03,280
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, policy procedures and how different areas and what they expect from their school committee members when they're coming forward to make sure that I'm in line, as well as with other school committee members who have no problem telling me when I'm in or out of line.

1377
01:55:05,982 --> 01:55:13,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's helpful to us as well to have that feedback and to have that collaboration and to see it

1378
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:17,670
[SPEAKER_04]: in this format is really, really helpful.

1379
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:22,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who came up with the idea, but it's great.

1380
01:55:22,531 --> 01:55:40,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than floundering on their own and not making effective change the minute they come in, or not assessing things, and knowing where the strengths and the weaknesses of the current district are is extremely beneficial, not only to the superintendent, but all the way down to every student.

1381
01:55:40,818 --> 01:55:44,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's worth every penny from what I've seen so far.

1382
01:55:45,261 --> 01:55:52,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to what's presented to us over the next year or three, depending on how long we're all here.

1383
01:55:52,164 --> 01:55:54,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1384
01:55:54,186 --> 01:55:58,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Beer, thank you so much for coaching our wonderful superintendent.

1385
01:55:58,208 --> 01:55:58,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1386
01:55:58,528 --> 01:55:58,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1387
01:55:58,948 --> 01:56:00,689
[SPEAKER_15]: But can I just ask you just one quick question?

1388
01:56:00,709 --> 01:56:00,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

1389
01:56:00,909 --> 01:56:02,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I know every community is unique.

1390
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:04,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Every superintendent is unique in what they bring to the table.

1391
01:56:05,192 --> 01:56:09,674
[SPEAKER_15]: But do you end up finding similarities with the issues that they may come to you on?

1392
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:38,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all the superintendents in the program spend a lot of energy thinking through the process of what are they learning during entry, what does that report of entry findings really say that enables people in the community and the school committee to know that they've been heard.

1393
01:56:40,361 --> 01:56:41,782
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a challenging piece of work.

1394
01:56:41,802 --> 01:56:47,886
[SPEAKER_00]: In December, January, and February, they'll all be talking about that, of how to do that.

1395
01:56:47,966 --> 01:57:02,334
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the translation of those findings into a really promising strategy for improvement is a very challenging process, because you really have to say no to as many things as you say yes to.

1396
01:57:02,915 --> 01:57:08,658
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a strategy that really stands a chance of making a real difference in the lives of kids and families.

1397
01:57:09,291 --> 01:57:10,532
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that is focused.

1398
01:57:11,792 --> 01:57:17,516
[SPEAKER_00]: It does a smaller number of things really well instead of trying to do a whole lot of things superficially.

1399
01:57:18,256 --> 01:57:31,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So that process is a challenging one for the superintendent to lead that conversation, for the school committee to coalesce around it and own it so then it's really owned by the superintendent and the school committee.

1400
01:57:32,144 --> 01:57:35,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that becomes the focus of your joint work moving forward.

1401
01:57:36,267 --> 01:57:38,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are common challenges.

1402
01:57:39,488 --> 01:57:43,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're asking, no one has enough money.

1403
01:57:44,972 --> 01:57:49,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has challenging children in every community.

1404
01:57:50,476 --> 01:57:55,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's struggling with trying to maintain civility in public discourse.

1405
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:01,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the challenges that many of them talk about.

1406
01:58:01,944 --> 01:58:02,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1407
01:58:03,224 --> 01:58:03,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Oshiro.

1408
01:58:05,178 --> 01:58:06,858
[SPEAKER_14]: have a little bet going here.

1409
01:58:07,078 --> 01:58:10,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you tell us which one of the school committee members she's complained about the most?

1410
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:17,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it Paul?

1411
01:58:17,401 --> 01:58:17,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1412
01:58:17,981 --> 01:58:22,102
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened to the coaching school series?

1413
01:58:22,662 --> 01:58:24,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for being here tonight.

1414
01:58:24,383 --> 01:58:25,563
[SPEAKER_15]: We look forward to seeing you again.

1415
01:58:25,583 --> 01:58:34,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I should say that you will see me again because part of the coaching involves the coaches observing the superintendent with their leadership team

1416
01:58:34,766 --> 01:58:38,170
[SPEAKER_00]: at school committee meetings and on school visits.

1417
01:58:38,931 --> 01:58:52,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So the coaching is not just sitting in the office and having a conversation with the superintendents, really seeing the superintendent in action so that the coaching can be grounded in the reality of how the superintendent does her work.

1418
01:58:52,465 --> 01:58:52,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful.

1419
01:58:53,366 --> 01:58:53,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1420
01:58:55,222 --> 01:58:58,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive this report and place it on file?

1421
01:58:58,583 --> 01:58:59,164
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved by Ms.

1422
01:58:59,184 --> 01:59:00,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1423
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,445
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

1424
01:59:01,605 --> 01:59:01,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1425
01:59:02,045 --> 01:59:02,525
[SPEAKER_15]: All opposed?

1426
01:59:02,585 --> 01:59:03,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1427
01:59:03,766 --> 01:59:07,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Report on rollout of the FOSS next generation program.

1428
01:59:08,147 --> 01:59:13,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'd like to ask Mr. Rocco Sieri to come forward and update us on FOSS.

1429
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:14,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1430
01:59:16,452 --> 01:59:22,415
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Dr. Marisa Edward-Munson, Mayor Burke, and school committee members.

1431
01:59:23,475 --> 01:59:35,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Before you have a report of this year's pilot and potentially next year's rollout for FOSS, there should also be a cost estimate of the program.

1432
01:59:35,901 --> 01:59:38,862
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe it was given to you just this afternoon.

1433
01:59:39,463 --> 01:59:40,963
[SPEAKER_20]: It's essentially hot off the press.

1434
01:59:41,764 --> 01:59:43,925
[SPEAKER_20]: As quickly as I could get it done, given

1435
01:59:45,483 --> 01:59:50,967
[SPEAKER_20]: the request and when the company was prepared to put this together.

1436
01:59:54,130 --> 02:00:08,441
[SPEAKER_20]: So this year, we've got 27 additional teachers that are working with the original eight from last year at the Brooks and piloting FOSS units at our schools.

1437
02:00:10,402 --> 02:00:13,445
[SPEAKER_20]: The names and the grades in the schools are included in the report.

1438
02:00:16,094 --> 02:00:24,378
[SPEAKER_20]: We also learned quite a bit from last year, because we did pilot McGraw-Hill and had training in that particular program.

1439
02:00:26,199 --> 02:00:32,222
[SPEAKER_20]: The teachers, as I reported last year, didn't feel that that program was correct for our students.

1440
02:00:33,043 --> 02:00:37,885
[SPEAKER_20]: And within the survey that I administered to them,

1441
02:00:38,430 --> 02:00:41,091
[SPEAKER_20]: They spoke to a program that was much more hands-on.

1442
02:00:41,571 --> 02:00:44,952
[SPEAKER_20]: They wanted to see more science in the program itself.

1443
02:00:45,212 --> 02:00:55,895
[SPEAKER_20]: And so FOSS is ultimately a robust science-based program that has many, many years of research behind it and provides

1444
02:00:57,697 --> 02:01:06,603
[SPEAKER_20]: a real large number of resources that we can use as a district to be able to comprehensively teach science K-5.

1445
02:01:07,183 --> 02:01:14,628
[SPEAKER_20]: So this year, as I said, we're really piloting, we're trying to vet how to best roll out

1446
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:31,567
[SPEAKER_20]: a training program for the teachers and also what it's like for these teachers to be able to implement it with the schedule constraints, if you want to call them that, in our school system.

1447
02:01:32,548 --> 02:01:38,650
[SPEAKER_20]: And in addition to that, the kids will be able to experience something that is more hands-on than they've had before.

1448
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:59,764
[SPEAKER_20]: from a program perspective and hopefully in years down the road, this will have some serious impact on MCAS scores, but also excitement about science and putting us on a path toward making students really enjoy and be prepared for what comes in our future.

1449
02:02:00,825 --> 02:02:02,505
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that,

1450
02:02:04,290 --> 02:02:06,532
[SPEAKER_20]: The training began last Wednesday.

1451
02:02:06,552 --> 02:02:12,816
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to continue on the 17th and then on the 24th of this month.

1452
02:02:13,237 --> 02:02:14,818
[SPEAKER_20]: That will cover one through five.

1453
02:02:15,598 --> 02:02:18,120
[SPEAKER_20]: Each grade level gets their own training.

1454
02:02:19,541 --> 02:02:24,065
[SPEAKER_20]: And it looks at the particular unit they'll be using in class with the students.

1455
02:02:24,105 --> 02:02:30,670
[SPEAKER_20]: They model two lessons within it and then overview all the resources that are available.

1456
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:32,351
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I'll be in

1457
02:02:33,332 --> 02:02:42,043
[SPEAKER_20]: to observe and help, really just to help teachers realize this sort of activity-based lesson planning.

1458
02:02:44,495 --> 02:02:46,857
[SPEAKER_20]: and implementation of the lessons.

1459
02:02:47,237 --> 02:02:48,618
[SPEAKER_20]: These are our early adopters.

1460
02:02:48,718 --> 02:02:50,719
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the teachers that are excited.

1461
02:02:52,321 --> 02:03:02,828
[SPEAKER_20]: They're very motivated to teach science, so it's sort of the best group to work with in terms of getting this rolled out in the most effective way possible.

1462
02:03:03,508 --> 02:03:06,771
[SPEAKER_20]: And we really want to make sure that they find some success with the program.

1463
02:03:08,372 --> 02:03:10,013
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to roll out two units.

1464
02:03:10,153 --> 02:03:11,074
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is the first.

1465
02:03:11,734 --> 02:03:21,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Each unit takes three to four months to teach, so it's a very big program, and it includes many, many hands-on activities all the way through that are sequenced.

1466
02:03:23,504 --> 02:03:33,272
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the second unit will start training somewhere a little beyond halfway in the implementation of the first unit, so the whole cycle will begin again.

1467
02:03:35,067 --> 02:03:45,100
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's where we are with our current pilot, and now you have some costs associated with if we were to adopt this program.

1468
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:48,965
[SPEAKER_20]: We find that it's successful, we want to go ahead and adopt the program.

1469
02:03:49,878 --> 02:03:51,039
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see the cost.

1470
02:03:51,079 --> 02:03:51,839
[SPEAKER_20]: There are two sheets.

1471
02:03:51,999 --> 02:03:53,700
[SPEAKER_20]: One says Delta Education.

1472
02:03:53,740 --> 02:04:01,524
[SPEAKER_20]: This is an itemized list, a bit complicated to follow because it does go through some of the parts of the kit that are included.

1473
02:04:02,524 --> 02:04:16,572
[SPEAKER_20]: What we've done is we've excluded any type of kit that we already have in possession from each of the grade levels and then bundled some of the three units per grade level.

1474
02:04:16,612 --> 02:04:19,333
[SPEAKER_20]: So you see something that is really large, for example,

1475
02:04:19,890 --> 02:04:28,599
[SPEAKER_20]: If you looked at the kindergarten, grade K, all next level generation, it says requires SRB.

1476
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:29,840
[SPEAKER_20]: That means that it's bundled.

1477
02:04:30,301 --> 02:04:36,227
[SPEAKER_20]: And that happens in each of the grade levels for a certain class.

1478
02:04:37,186 --> 02:04:42,391
[SPEAKER_20]: units because in some of those grade levels, some teachers will not have any yet.

1479
02:04:42,712 --> 02:04:44,994
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we want to provide them with all the kits at once.

1480
02:04:45,054 --> 02:04:49,799
[SPEAKER_20]: It comes at a slightly reduced cost compared to buying them separately.

1481
02:04:50,459 --> 02:04:59,008
[SPEAKER_20]: So this would be every kit, three units, all the components, everything you need to teach for every teacher at the district level.

1482
02:05:00,972 --> 02:05:05,596
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the second sheet is just a clearer breakdown of what the cost is.

1483
02:05:06,336 --> 02:05:15,844
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's laid out for five years so that you know that there are consumable costs or live animal costs year to year with this particular program.

1484
02:05:16,224 --> 02:05:17,525
[SPEAKER_20]: In the first year, they're included.

1485
02:05:17,626 --> 02:05:22,329
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we were to look at the live animals for 2019, 2020, those are included.

1486
02:05:22,349 --> 02:05:23,170
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't have to worry.

1487
02:05:23,210 --> 02:05:24,011
[SPEAKER_20]: But then the years after.

1488
02:05:27,114 --> 02:05:31,491
[SPEAKER_20]: we have to include a budget for them to ensure that those are purchased year-to-year.

1489
02:05:34,362 --> 02:05:40,123
[SPEAKER_20]: There are things like crawfish and worms and daphnia.

1490
02:05:40,403 --> 02:05:44,204
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a ton of different types of animals, some fish.

1491
02:05:45,524 --> 02:06:01,167
[SPEAKER_20]: Some, I've been told, there's a cohort of directors that work with foss, and they're starting to maintain these organisms a little bit over time, because a crawfish will survive forever, essentially.

1492
02:06:01,187 --> 02:06:03,867
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know how long a crawfish will live, but a pretty long time.

1493
02:06:04,629 --> 02:06:08,570
[SPEAKER_20]: So they just, yeah.

1494
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:11,411
[SPEAKER_20]: So they live a quite, they live a really long time.

1495
02:06:11,471 --> 02:06:15,912
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we could, we could purchase them one year and then be okay for quite a few.

1496
02:06:16,092 --> 02:06:19,333
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know, maybe guppies don't last as long, you know.

1497
02:06:24,794 --> 02:06:25,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1498
02:06:25,234 --> 02:06:31,796
[SPEAKER_20]: So, so, you know, we, we've been discussing it, you know, science directors that do have their own kind of personality around this stuff.

1499
02:06:33,512 --> 02:06:36,153
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll discuss it and find the best mechanism possible.

1500
02:06:36,493 --> 02:06:46,377
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is FOSS's estimate of what it costs to maintain a viable program with a live organism.

1501
02:06:46,397 --> 02:06:47,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo, question?

1502
02:06:48,058 --> 02:06:48,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1503
02:06:49,758 --> 02:06:50,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, by the way.

1504
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:52,719
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great information.

1505
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:57,901
[SPEAKER_06]: When I had met with you, we had discussed this issue

1506
02:07:00,665 --> 02:07:23,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of the modality of teaching this, whether it would be like a dedicated science teacher for each grade, which would affect scheduling and the movement of students quite a bit, but would have a different impact on budgeting, because it'd be one set that you buy and it sits in the classroom, versus every teacher needing a set.

1507
02:07:25,777 --> 02:07:29,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this estimate based on the every teacher is getting one set?

1508
02:07:29,458 --> 02:07:29,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1509
02:07:29,858 --> 02:07:31,799
[SPEAKER_20]: This is based on a classroom set.

1510
02:07:32,279 --> 02:07:37,300
[SPEAKER_20]: So every classroom, it assumes that every classroom would have all of these.

1511
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:47,623
[SPEAKER_20]: These numbers can be adjusted for classrooms or grade levels in which there is a specific teacher teaching science, and then we could consolidate a kit.

1512
02:07:49,202 --> 02:07:52,363
[SPEAKER_20]: But we also have to kind of consider that there are other classrooms.

1513
02:07:52,503 --> 02:07:56,543
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, you may have special education classrooms that will need the kit.

1514
02:07:56,603 --> 02:08:08,985
[SPEAKER_20]: So don't, you know, even though it may have like an entire grade level grouping in there, we want to make sure that it includes all the classrooms that are taught at a particular grade level for that particular subject area.

1515
02:08:10,146 --> 02:08:11,986
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the calculation that we'll do.

1516
02:08:12,286 --> 02:08:13,786
[SPEAKER_20]: We're really, really close on this.

1517
02:08:14,606 --> 02:08:18,327
[SPEAKER_20]: It may vary from one grade to another, but essentially this is a,

1518
02:08:19,407 --> 02:08:21,287
[SPEAKER_20]: a pretty accurate picture of the cost.

1519
02:08:21,768 --> 02:08:23,108
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1520
02:08:23,128 --> 02:08:23,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

1521
02:08:23,828 --> 02:08:24,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1522
02:08:24,588 --> 02:08:33,090
[SPEAKER_04]: My question, you kind of led into it, how does this program differentiate for students with special needs and our EL population?

1523
02:08:33,570 --> 02:08:39,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And are any of these teachers that are attending or doing these trainings

1524
02:08:41,045 --> 02:08:45,007
[SPEAKER_04]: piloting the program EL or special education teachers?

1525
02:08:45,067 --> 02:08:45,907
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a couple.

1526
02:08:46,448 --> 02:08:52,530
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't identify them, but there is one at the Roberts who is an EL teacher, and she's going to be participating in it.

1527
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:54,111
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe she's in fourth grade.

1528
02:08:55,252 --> 02:08:59,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Last year, we had the same thing happen for the McGraw-Hill.

1529
02:09:01,095 --> 02:09:04,676
[SPEAKER_20]: So wherever we can, we can pull for those particular things.

1530
02:09:05,036 --> 02:09:06,117
[SPEAKER_20]: At the lower grade levels,

1531
02:09:07,308 --> 02:09:11,929
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't believe that students are pulled for science as early on.

1532
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:18,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Even at the upper grades, kids are mostly integrated into that particular subject area.

1533
02:09:19,751 --> 02:09:26,913
[SPEAKER_20]: One interesting fact that I did learn at the last training is that FOSS stands for Full Option Science Program.

1534
02:09:27,594 --> 02:09:31,315
[SPEAKER_20]: It was originally designed for individuals who were visually impaired.

1535
02:09:33,147 --> 02:09:47,434
[SPEAKER_20]: from the inception of the program, it was designed to be for students with disabilities and the hands-on nature of it was really, is like the defining characteristic of the program.

1536
02:09:48,395 --> 02:09:54,398
[SPEAKER_20]: For ELs in particular, you could think of it as a language supporting program because

1537
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:59,914
[SPEAKER_20]: the phenomena that you investigate, the models that you use, are not named initially.

1538
02:10:01,195 --> 02:10:10,463
[SPEAKER_20]: You work from concrete models and then build the vocabulary around it and then build language and learning and writing around that as well.

1539
02:10:10,623 --> 02:10:14,266
[SPEAKER_20]: So the program is extremely well designed.

1540
02:10:16,065 --> 02:10:38,822
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think there's one that's better designed for science learning and it is continually researched and also refined and then brought back into classrooms, tested, brought back into a sort of like a laboratory to refine the product and then tested again.

1541
02:10:41,124 --> 02:10:46,930
[SPEAKER_20]: There's nothing like it, really, in terms of the time that they've put in to put this program together.

1542
02:10:47,350 --> 02:11:00,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And the timeline for purchasing would be, at one point during this year, would we have to make the decision to pull the trigger and get all the supplies in for the beginning of next year?

1543
02:11:01,225 --> 02:11:03,507
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, that would be the plan.

1544
02:11:04,728 --> 02:11:09,371
[SPEAKER_20]: I would love to have the teachers try it before we make a decision.

1545
02:11:10,332 --> 02:11:15,256
[SPEAKER_20]: We can put ourselves on an accelerated track toward that.

1546
02:11:15,316 --> 02:11:18,338
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd have to talk to the vendor if we really wanted to do that.

1547
02:11:19,419 --> 02:11:24,804
[SPEAKER_20]: But there could be possibilities of making it a little faster so that training could occur.

1548
02:11:25,893 --> 02:11:30,536
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, somewhere in this year for some of our teachers that may need it.

1549
02:11:31,076 --> 02:11:33,537
[SPEAKER_20]: But we'll have to investigate that.

1550
02:11:35,478 --> 02:11:36,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll raise the September.

1551
02:11:37,319 --> 02:11:47,625
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, if we could do training May or June, so that way when our teachers come back in September, we're not trying to teach them at the beginning of the school year.

1552
02:11:47,645 --> 02:11:49,466
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already come in prepared and ready to go.

1553
02:11:49,486 --> 02:11:51,327
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure we're going to go forward with it, though.

1554
02:11:51,786 --> 02:11:51,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1555
02:11:52,266 --> 02:11:57,469
[SPEAKER_20]: The first thing is to make sure you go forward, and then the second thing is to decide on a timeline.

1556
02:11:58,409 --> 02:11:58,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1557
02:11:58,529 --> 02:11:58,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Mastone.

1558
02:11:59,350 --> 02:11:59,590
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1559
02:11:59,670 --> 02:12:02,991
[SPEAKER_21]: So last year we piloted McGraw-Hill and FOSS.

1560
02:12:03,251 --> 02:12:03,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

1561
02:12:03,432 --> 02:12:07,774
[SPEAKER_21]: I heard back that all the teachers thought McGraw-Hill was not a good program.

1562
02:12:07,814 --> 02:12:08,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

1563
02:12:08,214 --> 02:12:09,554
[SPEAKER_21]: That left us with only FOSS.

1564
02:12:10,115 --> 02:12:17,198
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm not sure why we still are discussing, if we are doing it, shouldn't we just make a motion to buy it

1565
02:12:17,585 --> 02:12:20,849
[SPEAKER_21]: and get the training on the calendar for teachers so they're ready in September.

1566
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:26,256
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we've been having a science conversation for two and a half years now, for the two and a half years I've been on.

1567
02:12:26,777 --> 02:12:30,521
[SPEAKER_21]: So to delay it again, I'm losing my patience with science.

1568
02:12:31,322 --> 02:12:33,425
[SPEAKER_21]: And the MCAS test will show it tomorrow night.

1569
02:12:35,247 --> 02:12:35,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Sear?

1570
02:12:37,771 --> 02:12:41,272
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a decision that the body has to decide on.

1571
02:12:42,333 --> 02:12:44,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm comfortable with this program.

1572
02:12:46,615 --> 02:12:54,500
[SPEAKER_20]: I continue to read the documentation that they have, the lesson plans that they have.

1573
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,141
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a really strong program.

1574
02:13:02,219 --> 02:13:07,625
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean I was shocked to go to my parent-teacher meeting and to hear that my fourth grader was doing McGraw-Hill.

1575
02:13:08,005 --> 02:13:13,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I thought last year we decided everyone was going to do Foss because everyone had said McGraw-Hill was terrible.

1576
02:13:13,892 --> 02:13:17,456
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm sorry if I seem impatient.

1577
02:13:18,598 --> 02:13:24,262
[SPEAKER_21]: But it seems like Floss was the one that all the teachers said was worth investing in.

1578
02:13:24,282 --> 02:13:29,607
[SPEAKER_20]: There were eight teachers at the Brooks that invested in it, that liked the program.

1579
02:13:31,048 --> 02:13:33,690
[SPEAKER_20]: We then held a sort of like

1580
02:13:34,594 --> 02:13:42,299
[SPEAKER_20]: come together after school for teachers at the Brooks, for other teachers to come in and investigate what they were doing, to hear from them.

1581
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:51,185
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we thought that the pilot was the best move for us, just in terms of getting this to go from step one to step two.

1582
02:13:52,526 --> 02:13:57,189
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think, for the most part, it's going to work correctly.

1583
02:13:58,991 --> 02:14:02,013
[SPEAKER_20]: If we want to spread it more,

1584
02:14:03,455 --> 02:14:04,495
[SPEAKER_20]: We can do that as well.

1585
02:14:04,735 --> 02:14:22,081
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just the timeline has to, you know, we're still talking like it's gonna accelerate us maybe three to four months, you know, that little extra before the summer and then into next year, but it can be something that can, you can decide.

1586
02:14:22,101 --> 02:14:23,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

1587
02:14:24,501 --> 02:14:25,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

1588
02:14:29,747 --> 02:14:32,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you very much for bringing forward this information to us.

1589
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:34,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really excited about this program.

1590
02:14:34,872 --> 02:14:38,616
[SPEAKER_14]: What I would like to do, if possible, would be nice to actually see some of the kits.

1591
02:14:39,077 --> 02:14:41,539
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could actually bring them in, or we can go to you.

1592
02:14:41,559 --> 02:14:44,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I need a station wagon to bring that stuff.

1593
02:14:46,138 --> 02:14:47,678
[SPEAKER_20]: I can, we can go to the, I'll go to the school.

1594
02:14:48,099 --> 02:14:57,981
[SPEAKER_20]: We actually have a couple of trainings and I don't, I don't see why the trainings wouldn't be a place where one would mind having individuals come.

1595
02:14:58,501 --> 02:15:02,963
[SPEAKER_20]: The next training is October 17th at the Columbus Elementary School.

1596
02:15:03,063 --> 02:15:07,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Grade four will be trained and then on the 24th we're going to be at the Roberts Elementary School and we'll have three

1597
02:15:08,441 --> 02:15:15,665
[SPEAKER_20]: three trainers there for each grade level, so that would be an interesting place to see the kits, because it really is a lot of stuff.

1598
02:15:17,026 --> 02:15:31,695
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'd really like to see is, let's say we're doing crawfish week, I don't know, for example, it'd be great if we could line up field trips and activities that follow along that theme, whether it's go to the aquarium or the crawfish factory, whatever.

1599
02:15:33,530 --> 02:15:34,091
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be nice.

1600
02:15:34,812 --> 02:15:36,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Does the FOSS program go along a calendar?

1601
02:15:36,834 --> 02:15:40,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Like in October we do worms or whatever?

1602
02:15:40,838 --> 02:15:43,441
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can arrange that, but it definitely goes by unit.

1603
02:15:43,501 --> 02:15:45,503
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can't mix and match the units.

1604
02:15:46,244 --> 02:15:48,186
[SPEAKER_20]: It's continuous.

1605
02:15:48,206 --> 02:15:51,971
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we decide earth science happens in a particular part of the year, then

1606
02:15:52,677 --> 02:15:54,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody should be doing art science at that time period.

1607
02:15:55,858 --> 02:16:04,181
[SPEAKER_20]: Life science is generally reserved for the springtime because it's very hard to get the organisms, very hard to keep them alive at any other time.

1608
02:16:04,281 --> 02:16:12,945
[SPEAKER_20]: So springtime is really the live organism side of FOSS and that is probably the ideal time.

1609
02:16:13,665 --> 02:16:19,350
[SPEAKER_20]: to think about field trips, although you just got to make sure that you don't interact with MCAS season.

1610
02:16:20,290 --> 02:16:22,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, of course.

1611
02:16:22,132 --> 02:16:22,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1612
02:16:22,212 --> 02:16:22,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Vandekloot.

1613
02:16:23,293 --> 02:16:25,455
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand my colleagues, Ms.

1614
02:16:25,475 --> 02:16:31,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Mustone's urgency about this, and I'm just curious whether there's a different way to think about it.

1615
02:16:31,259 --> 02:16:39,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we, and you know, I certainly understand the budgeting for this year and next year and whatever, but is there any way that we could

1616
02:16:40,348 --> 02:17:04,634
[SPEAKER_16]: accelerate our adoption by bringing in in the springtime some more teachers and we could classroom units because you know if I had a student in the fourth grade in the school who was in a classroom who wasn't getting it knowing that my friend student friends child was I'd be really upset and so that well I understand you know piloting and whatever there's there seems like an inequity in

1617
02:17:05,224 --> 02:17:07,348
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying to balance those two needs.

1618
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:10,514
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's something.

1619
02:17:10,635 --> 02:17:15,985
[SPEAKER_16]: And sometimes we've worked, if you would, publishers or companies

1620
02:17:16,525 --> 02:17:26,009
[SPEAKER_16]: to even though we might take something earlier, the payment might still be thrown into the next year, especially because they understand our budgeting too.

1621
02:17:26,749 --> 02:17:36,412
[SPEAKER_16]: So if there was a way that we could accelerate the adoption in the spring and perhaps bring in more teachers by starting with the spring units, I think that's what would be ideal.

1622
02:17:36,933 --> 02:17:37,253
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1623
02:17:37,973 --> 02:17:43,855
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll bring that back to the vendor to see what they say and provide that kind of training.

1624
02:17:47,123 --> 02:17:52,207
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of, you know, I do truly fully support the FOSS program.

1625
02:17:52,227 --> 02:17:53,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very familiar with it.

1626
02:17:54,689 --> 02:17:59,032
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see, the price tag is very costly.

1627
02:17:59,512 --> 02:18:13,343
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just wondering in terms of our current budget for this year to accelerate the adoption to January or halfway point, are we talking about half the cost?

1628
02:18:13,843 --> 02:18:17,784
[SPEAKER_12]: because what's unique about it is that you are working with live organisms.

1629
02:18:18,324 --> 02:18:30,467
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think there's a real way to get a discount on that portion of the science, that hands-on portion.

1630
02:18:30,907 --> 02:18:41,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I myself am willing to do the legwork with collaborating with the teachers union and seeing if we could have more people get trained

1631
02:18:42,413 --> 02:19:00,057
[SPEAKER_12]: But in terms of actually looking at that price tag to do the entire district at this point, and I don't think it was budgeted for this year, that's over $100,000 that we'd be talking about.

1632
02:19:00,077 --> 02:19:06,758
[SPEAKER_16]: I clearly was thinking about it, Superintendent, in terms of having a discussion of seeing if we could.

1633
02:19:07,018 --> 02:19:09,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've done it before, I mean, over years ago.

1634
02:19:10,732 --> 02:19:15,955
[SPEAKER_16]: We took sort of early receivership of materials and then it was thrown into the next year's budget.

1635
02:19:16,255 --> 02:19:25,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, it all depends on the company's willingness to take, you know, to work that out with us or not, but just throw it on the table.

1636
02:19:25,821 --> 02:19:36,107
[SPEAKER_12]: So I like the idea, but the thing with FOSS is because they're consumable, if we get it early this year, we would still need to repurchase again next year because

1637
02:19:36,938 --> 02:19:38,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the organisms do die.

1638
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:52,929
[SPEAKER_20]: So it may not be ideal to begin in the spring with a life science unit because of the extra cost of the live organisms.

1639
02:19:53,590 --> 02:19:57,973
[SPEAKER_20]: But one of the other two types, we can do that.

1640
02:19:57,993 --> 02:19:58,934
[SPEAKER_15]: We can do that.

1641
02:19:58,954 --> 02:19:59,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1642
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:06,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

1643
02:20:07,441 --> 02:20:07,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1644
02:20:07,982 --> 02:20:21,316
[SPEAKER_06]: On page three, four, whatever it is, four, there's year one, year two, and there's kits to be shipped, and there's the $126,000 for year one, $126,000 for year two.

1645
02:20:27,537 --> 02:20:38,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that just that the payment is split, or are we actually only going live with half, are we only implementing it half of the classrooms one year and then doing the other half the following year?

1646
02:20:39,321 --> 02:20:53,385
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's the, if you look at the bottom of the spreadsheet, the PO is a full PO, but one half of the payment is due on July 1st of year one.

1647
02:20:54,064 --> 02:20:56,826
[SPEAKER_20]: and one half is due on year two, so that's what you're seeing.

1648
02:20:57,226 --> 02:21:05,672
[SPEAKER_20]: The incorporation of the additional $10,000 is because of the live organisms that are due for that second year.

1649
02:21:05,992 --> 02:21:07,133
[SPEAKER_20]: The first year they're included.

1650
02:21:07,393 --> 02:21:07,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1651
02:21:08,914 --> 02:21:09,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto?

1652
02:21:09,975 --> 02:21:10,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1653
02:21:11,095 --> 02:21:22,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke, can we make a motion to give the superintendent leeway to enter into negotiations with this company to purchase this and start training

1654
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:29,996
[SPEAKER_04]: teachers in April so that they're ready to begin with the materials for September 1.

1655
02:21:30,396 --> 02:21:36,741
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we just said that they would speak to the department and administration to figure it out.

1656
02:21:36,781 --> 02:21:40,044
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to do a lot more due diligence on this.

1657
02:21:40,204 --> 02:21:48,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if we don't do any kits, we can make a contract and have the training start so our teachers, even without the manipulatives,

1658
02:21:48,783 --> 02:22:02,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Like any training that they would come in and do in September, if we bought it in July 1st or early through the summer, if we could get that done before the teachers leave, then we're all setting up and running and we're not doing that training piece.

1659
02:22:02,566 --> 02:22:06,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we need to negotiate with the purchase of this.

1660
02:22:06,087 --> 02:22:12,248
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to push hard if they want to sell us the $250,000 program.

1661
02:22:12,828 --> 02:22:15,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we want our training done by June 15th.

1662
02:22:16,323 --> 02:22:20,626
[SPEAKER_04]: so that way we're not doing it over the summer or in September.

1663
02:22:22,067 --> 02:22:41,300
[SPEAKER_12]: I will definitely be willing to negotiate with the company and we need to negotiate with the teachers union as well because I don't know the total number of hours that are required for full training of the FOSS and the total number of hours that we have left over for the remaining of the year.

1664
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:43,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1665
02:22:43,562 --> 02:22:43,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1666
02:22:46,253 --> 02:22:47,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, are there any other questions?

1667
02:22:47,334 --> 02:22:48,014
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all set?

1668
02:22:48,034 --> 02:22:52,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to receive this paper and place it on file?

1669
02:22:52,618 --> 02:22:53,119
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved.

1670
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:54,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Mr. Russo.

1671
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:54,940
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

1672
02:22:55,641 --> 02:22:56,161
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll oppose.

1673
02:22:56,741 --> 02:22:57,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1674
02:22:57,402 --> 02:22:57,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1675
02:22:57,862 --> 02:22:58,783
[SPEAKER_20]: Have a good night.

1676
02:22:59,724 --> 02:23:00,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1677
02:23:00,404 --> 02:23:03,207
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a report in that folder on updated enrollment numbers.

1678
02:23:03,227 --> 02:23:05,228
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if there were any questions.

1679
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:07,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Our associate superintendent, Ms.

1680
02:23:07,690 --> 02:23:10,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Caldwell, is going to report on our enrollment numbers.

1681
02:23:11,784 --> 02:23:19,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So about three or four weeks ago, I gave you our attendance numbers, and now we're moving towards our enrollment numbers.

1682
02:23:19,996 --> 02:23:24,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Attached, you can find them from Medford Public Schools at all grade levels.

1683
02:23:24,888 --> 02:23:35,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Michelle Bissell and Curtis Tudin have unenrolled those students no longer attending Medford Public Schools and enrolled new students that have moved into our district.

1684
02:23:36,395 --> 02:23:43,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the first couple of weeks of school, we have a lot of children on our rolls who never really show up for school.

1685
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:45,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wait about two or three weeks.

1686
02:23:46,041 --> 02:23:53,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And when those students no longer, when we know they're not coming, we unenroll those students, which is important for MCAS purposes as well.

1687
02:23:55,331 --> 02:24:00,054
[SPEAKER_05]: The total enrollment on September 6th was 4,087 students.

1688
02:24:00,734 --> 02:24:03,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And September 26th, it's 4,218.

1689
02:24:04,657 --> 02:24:10,860
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a lot of EL students that continue to come to Medford, which is a wonderful thing.

1690
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:16,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've also enrolled our pre-K and some other students as well.

1691
02:24:16,764 --> 02:24:20,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just thought I'd give you a comparison chart of enrollment numbers.

1692
02:24:21,026 --> 02:24:22,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1693
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:24,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1694
02:24:24,741 --> 02:24:36,126
[SPEAKER_16]: This, of course, better indicates the difference between the McGlynn and the Andrews, which is 24 students apart, still close enough.

1695
02:24:36,627 --> 02:24:49,493
[SPEAKER_16]: But I did want to report that this weekend I ran into a parent and student, and student as well, who was currently attending sixth grade at the McGlynn.

1696
02:24:50,347 --> 02:25:01,016
[SPEAKER_16]: And the parent related to me that they had not been successful in their lottery choice and that she had been put at the McGlynn.

1697
02:25:01,937 --> 02:25:07,802
[SPEAKER_16]: And the parent told me she had been very upset at the time and now they couldn't be happier.

1698
02:25:07,822 --> 02:25:11,625
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it was such a heartening story to hear.

1699
02:25:12,325 --> 02:25:21,330
[SPEAKER_16]: and the student was just beaming and repeatedly told me how much she likes being at the McGlynn.

1700
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:29,974
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to hear that, and we're hearing more and more stories in that vein because the McGlynn teachers are very good teachers.

1701
02:25:30,114 --> 02:25:31,935
[SPEAKER_16]: She mentioned that multiple times, by the way.

1702
02:25:32,055 --> 02:25:32,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1703
02:25:32,835 --> 02:25:38,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the leadership at the McGlynn Middle School now has continued to be great, so we're very happy to hear those stories.

1704
02:25:38,678 --> 02:25:38,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1705
02:25:39,883 --> 02:25:40,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1706
02:25:40,683 --> 02:25:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Bernadetto?

1707
02:25:41,984 --> 02:25:50,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know how many homeschooled students we have in the district and how we check on those students?

1708
02:25:50,806 --> 02:25:51,906
[SPEAKER_05]: How many homeless students?

1709
02:25:52,006 --> 02:25:52,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Homeschooled.

1710
02:25:52,766 --> 02:25:53,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Homeschooled.

1711
02:25:54,027 --> 02:25:54,647
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.

1712
02:25:55,447 --> 02:25:56,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Bernadette, do you know how many homeschooled?

1713
02:25:59,228 --> 02:26:01,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Bernadette is in charge of the homeschooling.

1714
02:26:03,689 --> 02:26:04,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of my new duties.

1715
02:26:07,494 --> 02:26:10,757
[SPEAKER_03]: deputy superintendent Beverly Nelson's job to do homeschool.

1716
02:26:11,237 --> 02:26:14,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been going through, I've been reviewing the plans of parents.

1717
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:24,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So parents are required to report their plan, identify the students, their plan, their background, and then I send a letter back.

1718
02:26:24,787 --> 02:26:26,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get the numbers for you.

1719
02:26:26,108 --> 02:26:27,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have them tabulated right now.

1720
02:26:27,770 --> 02:26:35,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still finishing up with getting those approval letters out, but I'm happy to get that number for you.

1721
02:26:35,516 --> 02:26:36,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1722
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

1723
02:26:37,565 --> 02:26:37,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1724
02:26:38,586 --> 02:26:39,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to receive?

1725
02:26:40,026 --> 02:26:40,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1726
02:26:40,187 --> 02:26:40,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Mustone?

1727
02:26:41,547 --> 02:26:42,308
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ms.

1728
02:26:42,348 --> 02:26:42,708
[SPEAKER_21]: Colwell.

1729
02:26:42,868 --> 02:26:52,394
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm trying to look at the enrollment chart for the elementary and the day of attendance for the elementary.

1730
02:26:52,514 --> 02:26:53,734
[SPEAKER_21]: So the day of attendance was 9-6.

1731
02:26:53,855 --> 02:26:55,495
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1732
02:26:55,596 --> 02:27:02,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you looking at the... So it just has one top says elementary attendance, 9-6-18, and one has

1733
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,961
[SPEAKER_21]: elementary enrollment, 9, 26, 18.

1734
02:27:08,743 --> 02:27:13,146
[SPEAKER_21]: So enrollment is the ones that are registered in Parent Information Center.

1735
02:27:13,546 --> 02:27:15,728
[SPEAKER_21]: The attendance is just from School Brains that day.

1736
02:27:16,469 --> 02:27:20,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's just the number of students that walked through the door that day.

1737
02:27:20,632 --> 02:27:20,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1738
02:27:21,032 --> 02:27:29,579
[SPEAKER_21]: So the only thing that struck me was for the day of attendance, the Brooks had three absent out of 544.

1739
02:27:29,639 --> 02:27:30,800
[SPEAKER_21]: The Columbus had 11 absent out of 406.

1740
02:27:35,025 --> 02:27:41,068
[SPEAKER_21]: The McGlynn had 20 absent out of 478, and the Roberts had 9 absent out of 563.

1741
02:27:41,188 --> 02:27:51,452
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't do the percentage yet, but just after hearing that report about chronic absenteeism, the 20 at the McGlynn did strike me to have 20 absent in one day.

1742
02:27:52,032 --> 02:28:00,556
[SPEAKER_21]: So is that something that is noted on school brains when a school has a higher percentage of absenteeism one day as opposed to another?

1743
02:28:01,744 --> 02:28:03,906
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is noted in school brains.

1744
02:28:04,147 --> 02:28:18,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that now that we've become much more aware because of MCAS, we are watching those students, making sure that if these 20 students are out, are they living elsewhere or are they moving back to a country?

1745
02:28:18,762 --> 02:28:21,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, we're taking time to take a look at that.

1746
02:28:21,445 --> 02:28:22,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1747
02:28:22,386 --> 02:28:23,206
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

1748
02:28:23,287 --> 02:28:24,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, Mayor Burke.

1749
02:28:25,197 --> 02:28:25,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

1750
02:28:25,977 --> 02:28:26,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1751
02:28:26,437 --> 02:28:32,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, point of clarification, a student can move to another school district without withdrawing from a district.

1752
02:28:33,459 --> 02:28:41,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And until they're gone 10 days, you can't withdraw them so that September 6 was probably prior to us being open for 10 days.

1753
02:28:42,121 --> 02:28:46,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were students listed as absent that actually are going elsewhere.

1754
02:28:47,023 --> 02:28:49,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how we look at it.

1755
02:28:49,563 --> 02:28:51,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why there's an October 1 deadline.

1756
02:28:52,427 --> 02:29:04,978
[SPEAKER_04]: the reporting students to DESC, it gives you that first at least month for the district to work out its enrollment numbers before you report them, and then you're financially responsible for those ones from that point on.

1757
02:29:04,998 --> 02:29:05,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is what Ms.

1758
02:29:05,579 --> 02:29:09,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Cobble said at the beginning, that you've cleaned up the records.

1759
02:29:09,522 --> 02:29:11,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, at this point, yes.

1760
02:29:11,644 --> 02:29:12,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1761
02:29:12,665 --> 02:29:12,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

1762
02:29:15,898 --> 02:29:22,960
[SPEAKER_06]: The pre-K and the K are added into these numbers on the totals, but those kids, I mean, they don't count.

1763
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:25,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't count for pre-K.

1764
02:29:25,221 --> 02:29:26,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Kindergarten counts.

1765
02:29:26,741 --> 02:29:30,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Kindergarten doesn't count for absences in the DESE reports.

1766
02:29:30,863 --> 02:29:34,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one through five, wasn't it?

1767
02:29:34,884 --> 02:29:37,185
[SPEAKER_05]: For reporting, but for our purposes, we count.

1768
02:29:37,225 --> 02:29:37,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

1769
02:29:37,805 --> 02:29:41,466
[SPEAKER_06]: But our scores are not based off of kindergarten attendance.

1770
02:29:42,606 --> 02:29:43,307
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they're not.

1771
02:29:43,447 --> 02:29:43,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1772
02:29:45,326 --> 02:29:52,068
[SPEAKER_06]: The absenteeism, I mean, isn't impacted by those kids for any school.

1773
02:29:53,269 --> 02:29:55,649
[SPEAKER_06]: The kindergartners, they can come and go as they want.

1774
02:29:56,169 --> 02:29:58,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they should come to school every day.

1775
02:29:58,930 --> 02:30:00,711
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like that, Mr. Russo.

1776
02:30:00,811 --> 02:30:05,673
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I mean, but our report card does not.

1777
02:30:05,713 --> 02:30:06,893
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of numbers, yes.

1778
02:30:07,561 --> 02:30:09,903
[SPEAKER_06]: does not have any concern for kindergarteners.

1779
02:30:10,704 --> 02:30:11,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1780
02:30:11,144 --> 02:30:11,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1781
02:30:11,444 --> 02:30:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1782
02:30:12,425 --> 02:30:14,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file?

1783
02:30:14,967 --> 02:30:16,509
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved, Mr. Aguero.

1784
02:30:16,529 --> 02:30:17,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Ms.

1785
02:30:17,109 --> 02:30:17,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanden Heuvel.

1786
02:30:17,610 --> 02:30:18,210
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

1787
02:30:18,891 --> 02:30:19,491
[SPEAKER_15]: All opposed?

1788
02:30:19,551 --> 02:30:20,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1789
02:30:22,734 --> 02:30:25,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Recommendation to approve and accept the Campbell gift agreement.

1790
02:30:26,997 --> 02:30:29,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Assistant Superintendent Ms.

1791
02:30:29,199 --> 02:30:29,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Patterson.

1792
02:30:30,268 --> 02:30:30,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

1793
02:30:30,769 --> 02:30:31,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1794
02:30:31,269 --> 02:30:40,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am pleased to present the recommendation for action to accept the gift agreement with the Campbell Partnership.

1795
02:30:41,761 --> 02:30:51,212
[SPEAKER_02]: The Crystal Campbell Foundation Memorial Fund has offered a partnership with MPS and the CCSR through our liaison, Richard Trotta.

1796
02:30:51,888 --> 02:31:01,853
[SPEAKER_02]: The agreement offers funding on a perpetual basis to fund programs and projects whose purpose is to develop the responsible global citizens and positive contributors to society.

1797
02:31:02,633 --> 02:31:15,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So the intent was to collaborate with the schools for exceptional student-run programs that further spread Crystal's enthusiasm and fostering community spirit and involvement, which encompasses and embodies the CCSR.

1798
02:31:15,779 --> 02:31:20,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Trotter will be the facilitator to provide guidance on projects and school-based staff

1799
02:31:20,795 --> 02:31:25,196
[SPEAKER_02]: and provide regular reports to the Foundation regarding the programs conducted with the funding.

1800
02:31:26,377 --> 02:31:29,937
[SPEAKER_02]: The total donation earmarked is $125,000.

1801
02:31:30,758 --> 02:31:39,780
[SPEAKER_02]: The initial grant disbursement was identified for $12,000 to be utilized over two fiscal years, the current FY19 and FY20.

1802
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:46,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The remaining portion of said grant will be under the Citywide Endowment Board for Investing and providing subsequent allocations

1803
02:31:47,353 --> 02:31:48,433
[SPEAKER_02]: from interest earnings.

1804
02:31:49,194 --> 02:31:53,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So the attached was the circulated gift agreement for your review.

1805
02:31:54,355 --> 02:31:56,075
[SPEAKER_02]: The signatures have been received.

1806
02:31:56,616 --> 02:32:04,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And the action that we are requesting and recommend is to accept this generous gift agreement from the Crystal Campbell Foundation.

1807
02:32:05,178 --> 02:32:08,179
[SPEAKER_15]: First off, I just want to thank you for all the work you've done on this agreement.

1808
02:32:08,779 --> 02:32:14,901
[SPEAKER_15]: We're indebted to the family and friends of Crystal that have been raising funds for the last five years.

1809
02:32:16,058 --> 02:32:27,123
[SPEAKER_15]: They are so thrilled with the CCSR program and the projects that the students are doing that they're really taken by it and they wanted to be a partner in this program.

1810
02:32:27,203 --> 02:32:36,967
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're forever grateful for them investing back in Crystal's memory so that we see her legacy go on and on indefinitely.

1811
02:32:37,445 --> 02:32:43,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Our Commissioner of Trust Funds will receive the net proceeds after the disbursement for this year and next.

1812
02:32:44,147 --> 02:32:48,389
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have a Commissioner of Trust Funds at the city level, and they will be overseeing the investments.

1813
02:32:48,789 --> 02:32:50,050
[SPEAKER_15]: They have professional guidance.

1814
02:32:50,630 --> 02:32:52,551
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they do an annual report as well.

1815
02:32:52,591 --> 02:32:54,891
[SPEAKER_15]: We do this similarly with the cemetery funds.

1816
02:32:55,712 --> 02:33:01,114
[SPEAKER_15]: So in January of each year, we get a report that shows the interest that was earned on the perpetual care account.

1817
02:33:01,554 --> 02:33:04,435
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that, in turn, goes back into the cemetery for work

1818
02:33:05,091 --> 02:33:08,213
[SPEAKER_15]: to be done there and that's similar how this will be set up.

1819
02:33:08,793 --> 02:33:08,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1820
02:33:08,933 --> 02:33:09,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Van der Kloot.

1821
02:33:10,154 --> 02:33:22,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have a letter sent out on behalf of the school committee with our deepest thanks for this gift agreement and I mean it's just fantastic so if you would express our thanks.

1822
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:23,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1823
02:33:25,441 --> 02:33:28,162
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion to accept seconded by Ms.

1824
02:33:28,182 --> 02:33:28,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Mostone.

1825
02:33:28,663 --> 02:33:29,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote please.

1826
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:39,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1827
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:41,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1828
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:43,261
[SPEAKER_15]: And the vote is 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1829
02:33:43,281 --> 02:33:44,081
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

1830
02:33:44,201 --> 02:33:44,721
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you, Ms.

1831
02:33:44,741 --> 02:33:45,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Patterson.

1832
02:33:45,581 --> 02:33:45,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1833
02:33:46,202 --> 02:33:46,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

1834
02:33:46,622 --> 02:33:46,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Patterson.

1835
02:33:49,222 --> 02:33:51,143
[SPEAKER_15]: New business, school committee resolution.

1836
02:33:51,163 --> 02:34:05,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved, Mayor Stephanie Eugenie Burke and members of the Medford School Committee, along with the superintendent of schools, Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent, expresses their deepest sympathies to the family of former school committee member and United States Navy veteran, George D. White, Jr., who passed away on September 17, 2018.

1837
02:34:05,946 --> 02:34:07,346
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could just, from the board,

1838
02:34:09,964 --> 02:34:10,985
[SPEAKER_15]: from the rostrum here.

1839
02:34:11,365 --> 02:34:17,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I was lucky enough to see George just a few weeks before this, and right up until the end.

1840
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:24,876
[SPEAKER_15]: He was spirited, in great conversation, and just, he was a joy to be around, and I always look forward to meeting up with him.

1841
02:34:24,997 --> 02:34:30,801
[SPEAKER_15]: So, he will be lost, and he had an impact on me, and I'm sure many as well, so we will miss him dearly.

1842
02:34:31,562 --> 02:34:31,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1843
02:34:31,742 --> 02:34:32,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

1844
02:34:32,403 --> 02:34:37,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Burke, I just also want to add that while I never was a school committee member contemporary of his,

1845
02:34:39,325 --> 02:34:51,873
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the privilege and honor of serving with him on the building the future committee and George was a very active and fun and you know we had during that period of time we had more meetings than you can count.

1846
02:34:52,554 --> 02:35:03,079
[SPEAKER_16]: And we sat and we deliberated on so many different things from both large to the small, to the minute, to the color of the tiles and the paint and et cetera.

1847
02:35:03,419 --> 02:35:06,861
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway, George was so much fun and such an active member of that group.

1848
02:35:07,561 --> 02:35:10,963
[SPEAKER_16]: I will long remember him and feel very grateful to have known him.

1849
02:35:12,244 --> 02:35:20,408
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd also recommend that in the future we consider naming something in his name because he was such a stalwart at the public school.

1850
02:35:22,168 --> 02:35:27,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Josephine Bellato.

1851
02:35:28,393 --> 02:35:28,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1852
02:35:28,574 --> 02:35:34,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Bellato was a Medford Public Schools graduate and a former Lincoln Junior High School French teacher and guidance Councilor.

1853
02:35:35,219 --> 02:35:39,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Also under suspension, we have condolences to the family of Betsy Carmen.

1854
02:35:39,503 --> 02:35:45,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Betsy was a professional in Medford Public Schools and Special Education Department until her retirement this past June.

1855
02:35:46,869 --> 02:35:50,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, her son is the chair of our Board of Appeals in the city of Medford.

1856
02:35:51,119 --> 02:35:52,922
[SPEAKER_15]: and also in the passing of Paul Jodeci.

1857
02:35:52,962 --> 02:35:58,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul enjoyed a long career in the medical public schools, in the classroom administration and coaching tennis and freshman hockey.

1858
02:35:58,130 --> 02:36:02,656
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could all please rise and take a moment of silence in the passing of these wonderful individuals.

1859
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:16,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

1860
02:36:17,170 --> 02:36:17,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1861
02:36:18,611 --> 02:36:22,251
[SPEAKER_04]: On our reports, it's usually under number 11.

1862
02:36:22,792 --> 02:36:24,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It says requested reports.

1863
02:36:26,072 --> 02:36:32,794
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few items I'd like added to that list for our next meeting, just so we all don't forget a few items.

1864
02:36:32,834 --> 02:36:34,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they got lost on the back sheet.

1865
02:36:34,394 --> 02:36:34,795
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1866
02:36:34,815 --> 02:36:35,775
[SPEAKER_15]: It's right on the back page.

1867
02:36:36,195 --> 02:36:36,515
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1868
02:36:36,835 --> 02:36:44,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So my list would be PTO Friends of Registration Form updates.

1869
02:36:45,372 --> 02:36:55,296
[SPEAKER_04]: when that's going to be posted and who in the district's going to be responsible for upkeep of that information.

1870
02:36:56,076 --> 02:37:14,263
[SPEAKER_04]: The security report, an update on Lena DiGentimaso's plaque and ribbon-cutting disabilities awareness program that we talked about previously, just like

1871
02:37:15,376 --> 02:37:21,298
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe the subcommittee needs to meet first on this with the special education programming.

1872
02:37:22,178 --> 02:37:29,880
[SPEAKER_04]: We were gonna check with Leslie to see if they had any programming that they could offer us as far as disability awareness.

1873
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:30,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about that.

1874
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:32,721
[SPEAKER_15]: What is the report that you're asking for?

1875
02:37:32,761 --> 02:37:35,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Just an update from the superintendent, I'm sorry.

1876
02:37:37,922 --> 02:37:41,223
[SPEAKER_04]: If Leslie offers the disability awareness program, sorry.

1877
02:37:43,565 --> 02:37:44,865
[SPEAKER_04]: It's late at night.

1878
02:37:45,726 --> 02:38:02,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So also an update from the payroll in January, just to keep it on the report, that it's requested January payroll update and an audit update as those items are completed.

1879
02:38:02,892 --> 02:38:11,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And the homeschool numbers that Bernadette Riccadeli offered to provide us.

1880
02:38:13,643 --> 02:38:30,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the audit ends the January just as reminders like a like a tickler file so we don't forget in January they're supposed to report this these two reports so that way we as a committee don't lose track because we do so many things.

1881
02:38:31,128 --> 02:38:34,350
[SPEAKER_15]: They show up on the back of our schedule here.

1882
02:38:34,850 --> 02:38:37,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And they usually write the date it was requested.

1883
02:38:37,371 --> 02:38:39,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can see how long it's been on the list.

1884
02:38:39,992 --> 02:38:43,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And every once in a while, we look at it and say, hey, we should maybe loop back to that.

1885
02:38:43,674 --> 02:38:48,757
[SPEAKER_15]: We also want to thank Jasper Sue for being in attendance tonight from Medford High School.

1886
02:38:48,917 --> 02:38:50,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you, Jasper, for sitting through the meeting.

1887
02:38:50,998 --> 02:38:54,180
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a motion to adjourn this meeting.
