00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:05,723
Hey, Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:08,945
Today's episode includes an interview with Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

3
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:13,608
This interview is full of information about the mayor's current work and upcoming plans for the city.

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,450
I hope you enjoy the interview.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:23,916
All right, thank you so much for joining me this morning.

6
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:28,219
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and your role here.

7
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:29,380
Sure.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,803
I'm Brianna Lungo-Kern, Mayor of Medford, and I use the pronouns she and her.

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,572
Great, thank you so much.

10
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:40,014
And congratulations on winning your next term, your current term.

11
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:51,222
I was hoping to chat with you a little bit today about kind of any reflections you have on the election and stuff that you're sort of looking forward to, your kind of priorities for this term.

12
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:57,226
Yeah, no, I think with the election, I'm glad it's behind us.

13
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:00,628
It was a tough six months, but I

14
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,361
really excited to work with the school committee and the city council that was elected.

15
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:16,025
And we have so much work to do, but I feel like we have two good groups along with all of our great employees that really can get a lot of work done.

16
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:16,785
So I'm excited.

17
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:17,846
Awesome.

18
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:18,726
Great.

19
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:18,986
Yeah.

20
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:22,608
And what are some of the things that you're sort of your priorities for this, this term?

21
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:27,930
There's there's so many things we're working on, but I'll, I'll just name a few.

22
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,031
I mean, I'm excited to collaborate with the council on

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,713
the zoning reform, which hopefully will be passed in the next month or two.

24
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:44,039
We also sent the city council a housing production plan that the city worked on along with volunteers and employees within our community.

25
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:55,366
And I'm excited to work with the city council to start implementing some of those initiatives so that we can work on our, obviously our housing crisis, our food crisis.

26
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:57,007
We have a,

27
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:03,565
Great news is yesterday we posted for a diversity, equity, and inclusion director.

28
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:12,511
So we hope to have somebody on board helping with that within the next 30 to 45 days, which is really exciting.

29
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:19,535
This new council recently approved the CAF for the human resource director.

30
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:23,037
So we're able to move forward and now hire a diversity director.

31
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:27,260
It's just very exciting steps that we know

32
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,568
works for several, several months.

33
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:50,856
We have some hiring we've been doing on the police and the fire side, we are restructuring our Department of Public Works, and we made some changes there, but we have a wonderful acting director and Tim McGivern who worked very well, especially in the last snowstorm and is really trying to

34
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:55,985
implement planning and organization and management goals for the department.

35
00:02:56,065 --> 00:03:03,790
So those amazing employees that work hard every day just have structure and we can get even more done than we ever have before.

36
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:14,197
We have our parking director who is completely in the weeds because we, the contract with Park Medford ended on January 6th.

37
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,405
So like I said, in my inauguration speech, we're asking for patience while we just work through the next month.

38
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:41,543
We have about nine or 10 individuals who are hired in that department and currently getting trained, currently out assessing and documenting our private ways and our streets and getting ready to start a warning system, which we wanna do first, which will probably take place in the next, start taking place in the next couple of weeks.

39
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:52,414
So those are a few of the many climate change we're working to implement our climate adaptation and action plan.

40
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:57,899
We are working on trying to get some movement in Medford Square, we're going to be.

41
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:17,944
Applying for a grant to do a design on the waterfront in the square, and then at the same time also trying to start drafting an RFI on Memphis square lots to get some mixed use development within in the square so our economic development directors working hard on those two initiatives.

42
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:23,439
Yeah, I don't know if you have any questions, but I can probably keep going.

43
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,819
Yeah, no, that's a lot.

44
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:31,180
So I do have one question about one of the first things you mentioned, the diversity, equity, inclusion, and the human resources director.

45
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,581
Is that where that situation where they were combined initially as one role, and did you split them?

46
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:46,423
And I've been hearing from some of the other city councilors about the budget for that position and sort of shifting the priority there a little bit.

47
00:04:47,897 --> 00:05:04,560
Yeah, it was always when I first came in I we did not have a human resource department so I just asked Mr Osborne who my transition team thought was fully capable of just working on both those roles, and it was always our plan to hire.

48
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:08,504
human resource director and a diversity director.

49
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:23,595
When we had to cut a million dollars from the budget, he stayed in those two roles, always knowing that once we recovered from what we were going through, we would be hiring a human resource director and a diversity and inclusion director.

50
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,417
And the council wanted those budgets split, which we did.

51
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:31,440
We did that in June fiscal year 22 for the fiscal year 22 budget.

52
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:51,161
budgets are completely split, and this was always our goal to hire, you know, both, both directors and we're finally at, at the point where human resource directors jobs been capped, and we can just thankfully move forward with a human resource department, and then separately diversity and inclusion.

53
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,980
Um, director is what has been posted now.

54
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,680
So awesome.

55
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:56,900
Yep.

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,600
Great.

57
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:57,860
Cool.

58
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,741
And, um, I did notice the skating rink is up at car park.

59
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:03,661
And so those are some exciting stuff with the parks.

60
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:09,662
It's, uh, um, I mean, that seems like really good timing this year, right before it's getting really cold.

61
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:16,664
Um, so also from, for some cold weather, we didn't put them up last year because of COVID.

62
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:18,724
And then the year before we put the rinks up.

63
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:25,363
But we never had the three, never the whole winter, never had three straight days for enough for it to freeze.

64
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:27,505
So here's a crossed.

65
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,728
Cause I drove by to car park and my son's like, what is that?

66
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:31,969
I'm like, that's a hockey rink.

67
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,531
We just needed to, so I can take you.

68
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:36,893
We're excited.

69
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,996
So just need a few cold days and hopefully get that up and running.

70
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:45,101
And then we also hired a director, you know, a manager of the rink.

71
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,584
La Conte rink and Hormel Stadium.

72
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:51,025
So our goal is to try to go as close to year round as possible.

73
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,566
And we're going to kind of pilot it this year.

74
00:06:53,586 --> 00:07:02,990
And I know the cost of utilities is expensive, but if we can keep that operational almost year round, maybe just a one month shut down, that's our goal.

75
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,352
So that we can enjoy it year round for birthdays and parties, reskate and rent it for an hour.

76
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:13,483
clinics, all types of different things.

77
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,184
REC is really involved.

78
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:18,527
That position falls under our REC director, so it's exciting.

79
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:29,855
We have some beautiful art murals that were just designed by artist Jamie Chan that we'll be publicizing soon, that hopefully will be painted at La Conte in April.

80
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:30,984
Nice.

81
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:31,965
Cool.

82
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,547
And what about school committee?

83
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:43,192
I know it probably you're the last two years have been pretty full up with things addressing COVID, but anything that you're particularly excited about for the school committee?

84
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:45,034
Yes.

85
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:51,318
The school committee is a group of hard workers, and we have a lot of things we're working on.

86
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:58,943
But for me, my goal is to really try to get a diverse vision committee implemented within the next

87
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:14,676
two, three months to start our vision for the new high school or completely rehabbed or type of high school we need to put serious time and energy into updating that facility or completely

88
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:22,336
fingers crossed getting an MSBA loan so that we can give our students a facility that they can be proud of.

89
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,217
And that is my main goal right now.

90
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:31,100
So I have a meeting with our superintendent next week and I know the school committee's on board to really get that off the ground.

91
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:43,027
That was the committee that sort of had formed and then you kind of be like disbanded to sort of hope that there would be a more, it would become a more diverse group.

92
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:44,108
Right.

93
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:44,588
Okay.

94
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:53,704
Right, yeah, we implemented it with the applications that came before us prior to my being mayor.

95
00:08:53,744 --> 00:09:03,592
So we disbanded it and we really, then COVID, we've been so entrenched in trying to get our students and staff back safely and all the testing we've been doing.

96
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:10,337
And the nurses, obviously, we have a lot on their plate now, but we need to, whether it's COVID or not, we need to

97
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:12,283
work to get that implemented.

98
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:14,424
And that's a goal for the next several months.

99
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:15,384
Awesome.

100
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:25,969
Um, I did want to ask about the, the ways that like school committee, or you were thinking about some of the stuff we heard about kind of before the winter break around some incidents of violence in the school.

101
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,572
And so students, um, you know, sort of acting out violently towards each other.

102
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:37,055
Yeah, I, I, um, that's been a,

103
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:48,444
definitely a topic of conversation and something that I know that the superintendent and the administrative staff, as well as the school committee, have really taken a good look at.

104
00:09:48,464 --> 00:10:00,128
A lot had to do with trying to hear from students, hear from staff, and I know the administration did a good job bringing people together and doing what they could.

105
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:08,558
it was very concerning the amount of violence that was happening at one of our elementary schools and our high school.

106
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:30,833
And some of the activity that was going on on our buses, whether it was COVID and mental health and social media, some of this TikTok and challenge type activity is just so concerning.

107
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:42,345
for students from across the country to be throwing these challenges out and for our students to be taking hold of them was something we had to get a handle on.

108
00:10:42,365 --> 00:11:00,260
So I was involved behind the scenes, you know, just making sure that we were doing the right things, you know, should have cell phones in school, you know, make sure we're listening and doing whatever we can to make sure everybody's, our administrative staff, principals, vice principals are on the same page.

109
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:02,649
because what happened is not okay.

110
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:06,912
And we just have to, it's something we have to continue to work on.

111
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:24,885
So it was exciting to have our first behavioral health committee meeting at the police station with, it's a committee of at least 11 social workers and psychologists and the police chiefs, the veterans director, Penny from prevention and outreach.

112
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:43,453
And Pat Brady, who's a local psychologist, really our focus needs to be on mental health and how we can help our students because they're not only dealing with their own stress, they're dealing with their family stress and what they're going through at home and what their parents are going through or grandparents.

113
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:49,799
And we need to do all we can to help each and every student, you know,

114
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:54,064
be on the right path, make sure everybody's safe and feel safe.

115
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:56,665
So there's a lot of work that still needs to be done.

116
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:59,387
And I thank that committee for the role they're taking.

117
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,769
I thank the admin for continuing.

118
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:07,432
I don't wanna just have been reactive based on what happened that month.

119
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:09,354
We just need to continue to work at it.

120
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:19,040
And I know Avery Hines is working her butt off trying to make sure every student has what they need to be successful and to feel safe.

121
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:30,561
And I know that Pat Brady, even from the city, she's willing, she's reached out to Avery and they're collaborating on having mental health, you know, sessions to help our students.

122
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:43,387
So just to have the community and the staff and everybody working together, it's a work in progress, but I feel confident we can get there and make sure, you know, everybody's on a better path than they were in December.

123
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:52,228
Yeah, it was certainly shocking and and I think it's hard to, you know, I think the way that kids engage with like social media is.

124
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:58,195
I think it's just like changing so rapidly that it's hard to sort of keep up with what they're seeing and exposed to.

125
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:08,261
And like, I think that sometimes there's this approach of like almost like abstinence, like, well, we won't, we won't let them use it, but that there's like, there has to be some middle ground of like, how do they use it responsibly?

126
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,022
How are they talking about what they're seeing?

127
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:22,050
And I wonder if there's like any opportunity or if it's already happening to sort of include that in like a health curriculum or some sort of like the way in which like when I was in high school, we talked about like drug use that maybe there's some like,

128
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:28,975
overlap with like social media use or, and the mental health aspect of that.

129
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:31,156
Absolutely.

130
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:37,261
I, I'm not sure if it's in the health curriculum, but I'm almost positive that the students do have, you know, seminars.

131
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:44,787
I know my daughter is at the McGlynn Middle School and Nick Tucci, you know, is very on top of these issues.

132
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,087
So

133
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:53,278
We just want to make sure it's uniform across the board, and I know they're working hard, all the administrators, to do all they can.

134
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:57,319
But yes, education for the students, it's a must.

135
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,640
Sure, yeah.

136
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:13,997
I mean, it does feel like with the transition back to school with COVID that there has been like a much more of an emphasis on mental health as a necessity, but I think it's encouraging to see that that's being responded to so well.

137
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:26,746
So for you, anything that you want to talk about that like constituents, like voters could get involved in or anything that you want to hear from residents for, you know, sort of support in your second term?

138
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:41,516
I, I think it's important for, you know, everybody in the community to get involved, whether, and everybody has different time constraints, but there's open positions in some of our boards and commissions.

139
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:45,439
There's a number of positions that will be open in the spring as well.

140
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:55,765
But if that's too much of a commitment, you know, we have our comprehensive master plan where you can do on your own, you know, you can take a look on our city website on your own time.

141
00:14:56,365 --> 00:15:04,551
and kind of just outline things you think should change or where you think different types of zoning should fit or more green space.

142
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,973
So that's just like a couple minutes on the computer.

143
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:10,015
I just think it's good to get involved.

144
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:15,419
If you see a survey come out, you know, I know we did a parking survey and we've done a composting survey.

145
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:19,962
We've had 900 to a thousand people responding to those surveys.

146
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:25,146
So the simple things like that, staying involved, staying active, reading the Medford patch,

147
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,140
you know, knowing what's going on in your community, I think it's important.

148
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:35,423
You know, when the community conversations are going to come up and just get involved.

149
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:42,386
I said it at the end of my inauguration speech, like get involved and learn and grow with me in 2022.

150
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:48,068
We all have growing to do and me included.

151
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:53,290
And if we're going to try to start offering trainings for not only staff, but our residents,

152
00:15:54,808 --> 00:16:03,593
jump on a call and get involved, you know, always learn and grow and be more accepting and understanding and inclusive.

153
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:05,114
That's our main goal.

154
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:13,459
And my goal is, I know it's ambitious, but to not only offer staff those supports, but our residents too.

155
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:19,563
No, no, I just, we're all more alike than we know.

156
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:20,704
And I, I think we're,

157
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:25,507
If we could just show that somehow, it would be a better place.

158
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,548
Sure.

159
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:33,652
Yeah, I appreciate that stance of sort of like open to growth and including the community in that growth and understanding.

160
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:39,255
Are there any specific things that you want to mention about that sort of those goals of inclusivity?

161
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:45,459
Yeah, actually, we just we did a press release this week and we're forming two

162
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:55,654
task force type planning committees, we really want to have a multicultural events, sometime, you know, sometime in 22.

163
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:13,730
we want people involved, not only just to volunteer, but to tell us like, what's the, about, you know, a number of different cultures and how best to reach out to everybody and really form a committee so that we can be as inclusive as possible and do it the right way.

164
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,552
And then we also want to have a pride event in June.

165
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:23,655
So we are asking people if they wanna be involved in that, the more the merrier to help us plan that.

166
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:35,160
So there is a one page form that you can just grab on our boards and commission web web page and fill that out say you're interested and we're going to be forming the pride.

167
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,423
committee, you know, within the next couple month or two and then the multicultural event i'm assuming would be after that.

168
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:43,551
Great.

169
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:48,278
I can definitely link that in our show notes so people can maybe access it a little easier there too.

170
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:56,789
I know we posted it on social media, but I can also send you the press release as well.

171
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,992
It explains the trainings that my staff

172
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,796
are going to take on cultural awareness.

173
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:12,519
And then at the end, just asking people to get involved in the events, but anything we have, you know, when we do our next holiday celebration, we, we want people involved.

174
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,299
We want to do it right.

175
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:22,022
You know, our goal is to be inclusive and we got it wrong this year on a, on a point, but we, that was, that was a mistake.

176
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:22,942
And we, we want to.

177
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:26,619
have everybody involved that wants to be involved and just do it the right way.

178
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:32,390
Because our goal is to be more inclusive and get the community together, all together.

179
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,488
Yeah, thank you for mentioning that.

180
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:40,992
It sounds like you're sort of reflecting on some of the things that you and your staff have took away from that incident and how you can kind of learn.

181
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:51,578
And I think some of the feedback that I was hearing was like how to take away, what you can take away from that experience to sort of create like a plan moving forward.

182
00:18:51,618 --> 00:19:00,144
So like being, like you're saying, like learning what you can do more proactively rather than having to be reactive when there's like mistakes like that.

183
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:01,164
That sounds great.

184
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:02,225
Thanks.

185
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,241
We learned, but we'll be better for it, and more inclusive for it.

186
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:12,342
And we've built great relationships just even since the incident.

187
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:18,183
And it's very hopeful, and I'm excited to have the partnerships now that we formed.

188
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:19,203
Great.

189
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:20,324
Awesome.

190
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,384
Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today before we wrap up?

191
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:28,856
No, I can't think of anything.

192
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,917
I mean, I'm sure I missed a ton of what we're doing.

193
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:32,897
You know, I didn't even talk.

194
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:42,242
The rec department is getting ready for their winter and spring and summer catalog that will hit in a week or two.

195
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:43,422
They're working hard on that.

196
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:46,804
There's just so many great things going on.

197
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,204
Catch a game if you can.

198
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,865
I know it's COVID, but I just went to the

199
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,944
girls varsity hockey game and then stayed for some of the boys varsity hockey games.

200
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:58,208
So that was, people think, you know, they can't go out at all, but it was very safe.

201
00:19:58,268 --> 00:19:59,610
Everybody was socially distanced.

202
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,575
So take a look at the link and catch a game, you know, just be part of the community.

203
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:10,903
And yeah, so many other great things going on, but I appreciate the time and you letting me explain, you know, some of it.

204
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:11,803
Yeah.

205
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:21,889
And also, um, I know the last time we talked was, uh, in the fall, but we did get a chance to go to the girls on the run race, um, that you all were organizing and that was an awesome experience.

206
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,211
So, um, thanks for doing that.

207
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:28,813
And, uh, yeah, that's, um, this is also our first summer of having to figure out summer camp.

208
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:32,035
So that's something that I, the rec department seems like it'll be helpful with too.

209
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:33,116
Um, yeah.

210
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:33,556
Yeah.

211
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:34,977
That's great programming.

212
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:40,180
And my six acres has a camp and then my, my children went to the Medford

213
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,008
summer fun camp, um, up at the Columbus.

214
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:43,769
They loved it.

215
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,829
They're already asking if they can go again.

216
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:48,690
They talk about their counselors nonstop.

217
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,790
So, um, there's a lot of great opportunities out there.

218
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,810
Absolutely.

219
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:58,551
We have, um, the girls in the run is hopefully going to be in Medford again in June.

220
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,792
So we're excited about that.

221
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:03,532
And then we also have a big race plans.

222
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,873
Um, I'll let you be one of the first to know, hopefully sometime in

223
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:15,393
September we're working with Dave McGovery, who organizes the Boston marathon to do, you know, just a really big race weekend here in Medford.

224
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:16,213
So we're excited.

225
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,034
Cool.

226
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:17,654
