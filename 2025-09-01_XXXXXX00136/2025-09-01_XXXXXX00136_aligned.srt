00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:43,647
Thanks so much for joining me tonight.

10
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:47,890
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:49,031
Sure.

12
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:50,232
Thank you so much for having me.

13
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:52,813
Liz Mullane, she, her.

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:01:00,599
I am a nonprofit development professional who's been in the nonprofit world for

15
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:10,079
I currently work at Northeastern University, where I am an assistant vice president for advancement.

16
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,486
And in that role, I manage and oversee 6 different units that cover kind of a variety of different areas.

17
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:28,183
With our families, I work with individuals who want to leave Northeastern in their estate plans and I do fundraising for our athletic athletics and our libraries.

18
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:32,709
So, a lot of different programmatic support across the university.

19
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,633
I've been in this role for about two years, but I've been involved with Northeastern since about 2020.

20
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:45,577
I was hired as an adjunct faculty member in their graduate nonprofit management program.

21
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:53,342
So a lot of my time is spent working with adult learners and basically sharing with them how to build out

22
00:01:53,792 --> 00:02:00,957
a nonprofit from the financial, legal, and strategic planning side of it.

23
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:03,559
I have been in Medford since 2018.

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,744
I live here with my husband, and we have two rescue dogs.

25
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:14,727
We were fostering throughout the pandemic.

26
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:24,991
We ended up finding out about a bonded pair of older dogs that the adopter had dropped out.

27
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:30,373
And my husband's a big Bruins fan and they had lost that day.

28
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:31,394
He was very vulnerable.

29
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:37,217
So we decided to bring the foster, the bonded pair up with us.

30
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:44,600
And we were not able to find another family that wanted to adopt an older two dogs.

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,361
So we have them.

32
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,604
So they're lovely additions to our home.

33
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:58,157
And I have been involved with the Medford Democratic City Committee and that's kind of how I first started getting a little bit more engaged within Medford.

34
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:03,144
And I've been involved as a member, since about when I moved here.

35
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:10,564
and have served as the chair for Ward 2 for the Medford Democratic City Committee for the past couple of years.

36
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:20,247
And in that role, trying to get people more aware of and more locally politically engaged here in the democratic process.

37
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:28,349
And now I'm trying to turn some of that information and some of that experience into running for city council.

38
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,091
Oh, excellent.

39
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:35,316
I learned a lot about you there.

40
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,620
So we are going to talk like more about your campaign for City Council.

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:48,009
Before we do that, I'm just going to ask you the question that I ask everybody on the podcast, which is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

42
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,090
And what do you like to eat there?

43
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,070
Sure.

44
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,374
Um, so this actually is a tough one.

45
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,976
There are a lot of great places.

46
00:03:55,977 --> 00:04:00,623
But I would say there's a restaurant right across the right around the corner from us called nappies.

47
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:20,949
Um, I don't know if people have been, but, um, I took my husband there in one of our first dates and there is nothing more amusing than the fear of someone realizing there is no menu and you have to listen to the servers go through every single type of pasta and sauce and meat combination.

48
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:26,491
Um, I will say it was so humorous, uh, to witness this firsthand.

49
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,312
And his answer was spaghetti and meatballs.

50
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:31,735
Which he still gets, even though he's been there several times.

51
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:37,720
I would say mine is Penny Vodka with chicken from there.

52
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,381
I've never done that piece.

53
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:47,748
I'm so intrigued by it, but also I feel like I've heard their Cash Only, which I wasn't planning ahead that well.

54
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,189
So yeah, I gotta try it though.

55
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:49,789
Keep hearing it.

56
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,710
Yeah, it's really good.

57
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,611
And it is funny.

58
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,072
You are like, you gotta listen.

59
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,649
Yeah, I'll have to add that to my bucket list.

60
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,530
Well, thank you.

61
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,832
So yeah, you know, you mentioned that you're running for city council.

62
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:10,638
So I'm wondering if you could share a little bit more about what helped you decide to run, kind of what motivated that choice for you?

63
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,520
Sure.

64
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,861
So, as I mentioned, I've been here since 2018.

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,682
I've been a renter.

66
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,627
until that point, but bought here in Medford.

67
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:30,650
And so I'm really seeing a lot of things happen over the past couple of years really started to kind of push me to want to get more involved, especially within the city council.

68
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:39,491
I'm seeing, certainly seeing a lot of the things happening on our pedestrian walkways that we had nearby.

69
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:41,632
I live right here on the Fells Way.

70
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:41,692
So

71
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,551
I'm constantly seeing people getting near accidents or accidents here.

72
00:05:47,571 --> 00:06:01,535
Our streets, I'm someone that I think I may have now officially popped all tires on Grant Street coming up because of the roads and conditions.

73
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:07,317
And really, as I was starting to think about how to get more engaged

74
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:14,819
as the world has been going nationally, I really wanted to make sure I can make an impact here locally.

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:25,707
So all of these things kind of helped to push me to really start wanting to get more involved and to really take a positive action forward for Medford.

76
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:37,455
And hopefully after I go through some of my experience and some of the things I think I can bring to the city council will kind of help kind of demonstrate where I think I might have

77
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:43,330
the skill sets to really move Medford and continue to move Medford in a positive direction.

78
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:58,638
Yeah, and you mentioned in your intro that you've been kind of a non-profit management space for a while, and I feel like that non-profit management seems in line with what someone as a political leader in Medford would need.

79
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:12,675
You know, I think what we've been through a lot in terms of budgets and talking about budgets and talking about revenue, and I think we're in this position as a city where we could move in a really positive direction with that and good leadership will be helpful.

80
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:23,025
But I guess I'm wondering, yeah, what your priorities would be, sort of what you're seeing right now, maybe any critiques you have, and then what you would hope to bring in terms of change.

81
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:24,067
Sure.

82
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:33,109
I got my start in fundraising working at Emily's List, which raises money for pro-choice Democratic women running for Congress.

83
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:44,631
And in that role, I really started understanding how important fundraising was in order to move the needle on a lot of these different revenue generating initiatives.

84
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:50,052
And it kind of stuck with me ever since I've seen what that impact could look like.

85
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:50,332
So

86
00:07:50,952 --> 00:08:05,787
Since then, I've worked at organizations where I've really used a lot of my budgeting, strategic management, and understanding of how to find revenue streams for each of these different nonprofits that I've worked with.

87
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:12,133
So I started working at the Advertising Council, which some people might recognize as Smokey Bear.

88
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:27,020
but essentially working within the advertising and media to help push the needle around campaigns for public service and really trying to drive people on how to get more involved and engaged.

89
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:33,063
In that capacity, I learned how to write foundation and corporate grants.

90
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:37,586
I've done capital funds and endowment funds around education,

91
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:39,672
around mental health.

92
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:53,975
I helped to create a facility within the BILH system for one of their hospitals around behavioral health, especially for our youth and being able to provide the right services that they would need.

93
00:08:55,555 --> 00:09:03,317
And I've also worked and managed a research campaign for the Alzheimer's Association.

94
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:07,538
So again, working within medical research and treatments and advancement

95
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:15,582
And during all of this I served as a consultant for nonprofits, and I was going in and out of different nonprofits and seen.

96
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,643
where there could be improvements around how they're budgeting, how they're running their finances, what that looked like.

97
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:29,006
And I realized at that point in time, I didn't really have a lot of that training to provide more of that support.

98
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:35,629
So I ended up going back to school to get my MBA at Texas A&M.

99
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:42,673
And when I was there, that's actually where I started working on federal and government grants.

100
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:53,891
And I was working within Texas to help provide mobile medical support for low income and rural communities and learning what it meant to write federal government grants.

101
00:09:54,592 --> 00:10:09,643
So throughout my career, I've kind of worked in a variety of different ways in which you can drive revenue and felt like, you know, seeing some of the things that were happening within the budget and with what Medford's trying to do,

102
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:18,982
thought that I could utilize some of those skill sets in order to really help improve some of these areas within Medford.

103
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:23,643
So that was kind of how my background kind of pieces came to it.

104
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:38,407
And, you know, when I was looking at some of the budgeting pieces of it, you know, knowing that at Northeastern and within another university, I've worked within the library systems in terms of

105
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:44,132
building out revenue and generating support for technology for programs.

106
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:53,740
I know we've got an amazing library here, but I know they're, they also need more staff support and more support around the incredible programming they do.

107
00:10:55,005 --> 00:11:07,849
I'd love to be involved and engaged in doing those types of services, certainly around mental health and providing more mental health services and counselors in Medford to be able to stabilize and deescalate in situations.

108
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,370
I think that's critically important.

109
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,432
So those were some of the areas where I felt like I have direct

110
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:27,981
past professional experience within how to kind of work and serve in some of those industries that would be helpful within Medford and kind of moving the needle on some of these different programs.

111
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:34,443
Yeah, that's a really big scope of things that you've had, sort of had your hands in.

112
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:42,325
That's, I'm hearing just like a lot of, I'm hearing that addressing a lot of different sort of things that Medford is lacking.

113
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:45,948
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

114
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:58,276
I wonder if there's any particular parts of that that you're kind of most passionate about or that you see as like, you know, moving Medford into being a more kind of equitable city.

115
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,017
Sure, absolutely.

116
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:08,723
I mean, you know, as I mentioned, some of the reasons why I got involved, I also wanted to think of what are some of the things that I could bring to the table?

117
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,545
What are some of the things that I could help to do?

118
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:22,295
when we're talking about pedestrian safety, looking to do an audit across the city with hopefully organizations like Walk Massachusetts that has done this in other areas.

119
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:30,962
So not just what I'm seeing because of where I live, but even different neighbors that I've spoken to, there's a variety of different places where we could address that.

120
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:36,107
I think that we should look at that holistically instead of kind of piecemeal in different areas.

121
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:43,694
Um, you know, I've, I've also, as I mentioned, have the two dogs and no backyard.

122
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:50,380
So I am a huge proponent of green space, more open walkable areas.

123
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:57,887
I know Medford is going to be starting their new strategic plan for 2026 around open space and recreational needs.

124
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:58,828
And that's something that

125
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:04,340
I want to advocate and be a part of to help make sure some of those initiatives still move forward.

126
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:13,888
One of the areas that I think I've been very impressed with is the Affordable Housing Trust.

127
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:20,134
And certainly, trying to provide affordable housing is going to come in a variety of different ways.

128
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,857
I don't think there's one specific thing that'll get it all done.

129
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:41,004
but what I really appreciate about the Affordable Housing Trust is that it's a first step in a way to move the needle and to be able to identify how we can find new funds in order to make it more affordable to live within Medford.

130
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:49,407
Certainly, I know that they receive grant funding, but there are other different ways to drive revenue into the Affordable Housing Trust that I think

131
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,369
could dig a little bit deeper into as well.

132
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:58,214
I also think about bringing in more small businesses into Medford.

133
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:11,805
You know, I've had conversations with some small business owners about how difficult the process is to navigate and there's a lot of roadblocks and how can we streamline that process and incentivize it to make it a more

134
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,125
an easier place for small businesses to engage with us.

135
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:27,677
I think there's a lot of opportunity and we just have to figure out ways in which we can make it more feasible for more businesses to be able to do that.

136
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,383
And certainly, you know, someone as I work in higher ed,

137
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:48,501
I work with families, I teach, making sure that we're making our education a priority and supportive of Medford Public Schools and being the partner with the school committee as well to ensure that a lot of their initiatives and the things that they're seeing

138
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:54,241
to help drive improvements for our students is important for the entire community.

139
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:59,447
So, I think it's something that we all need to be behind and be supportive of.

140
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,212
So, these are all just a couple of different areas that.

141
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:33,626
I'm passionate about, that I think with my experience, you know, having more of an understanding behind working within kind of complex, larger institutions, understanding some of the nuances around the budgetary process for some of these different larger departments and what that looks like, and really being able to help identify ways to encourage growth, I believe are things that could be helpful in this role on the City Council.

142
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:34,968
Yeah.

143
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:41,996
And so, you know, I think one of the things we haven't talked about yet is that you're running with as part of our revolution.

144
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:53,949
And, you know, I'm hearing in working in the spaces that you've worked where there's, you know, a huge bureaucracy, probably lots of different opinions you're managing, like, you know, probably

145
00:15:54,509 --> 00:16:00,470
lots of different types of folks and trying to get everything done, which I think does translate well to the role of a city councilor.

146
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:11,553
I'm wondering though, like, you know, I think it's not a secret that there's a group of folks in Medford that won't vote for people because of their affiliation with Our Revolution.

147
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:22,516
And so I guess I'm wondering, like, what you would say to those people about how you would represent them, even if they're not sort of on board with that platform?

148
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:23,596
Sure.

149
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:37,776
So I think for me, what I have really come to see with OR and the work that they've done is my connection to the progressive issues that they represent and they stand for.

150
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:51,182
And I think if you really do look at those different areas, I think many of us want, I would hope, better school systems for our students, that they would want to have

151
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:57,880
Recycling, composting, greener spaces, open spaces.

152
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:09,255
If there's one thing I have learned, I've learned how to negotiate and to work with people that have a variety of different ideas and opinions.

153
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:21,760
And I think I think that's an area where I've been able to excel within my career to be able to navigate some of those difficult conversations and to be able to, you know, be able to express.

154
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,502
These are the issues that I'm really pushing for and really wanting to see change.

155
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:35,256
within Medford, and I think our revolution has done a really great job moving the needle on a lot of these things.

156
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:48,363
And I also think that, you know, they're all individual people as well that come at it in a different perspective, and I think are all working in the same direction, which is trying to make the city better.

157
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:50,764
But having, you know,

158
00:17:51,646 --> 00:18:07,675
working with a large group of people and having to navigate those kinds of conversations, I feel confident that I'll be able to continue pushing through on these areas that I see need improvement within Medford and to try to bring people to the table.

159
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:18,861
I think, you know, what I've been seeing and hearing as I've talking with people on the streets is just being able to listen and being an open ear and having a conversation.

160
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,362
And maybe we won't always

161
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:36,785
agree on everything, but I want to be here to get a better understanding of where people are coming from, and to be able to see how best to navigate some of those difficult conversations with them if we may not be on the same page.

162
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:44,972
But I do think it's important to listen to everyone and to provide a space and an opportunity for them to share some of their ideas and thoughts as well.

163
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:46,555
Thank you.

164
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:54,160
Yes, I'm wondering if there are any topics that we haven't covered or anything that you were hoping we would talk about tonight.

165
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:00,824
No, I just, you know, I'm excited about the opportunity.

166
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:09,070
I'm really looking forward to continuing to meet with people and having these conversations and door knocking.

167
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,891
I have to say the people have been lovely.

168
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:18,723
And have been sharing, you know, some of the things that are their concerns and sometimes they're in line and sometimes they're things that.

169
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:31,803
haven't heard about before, which is great to take note of and to try to follow back up and see, you know, where myself or where the city council can be helpful in trying to help answer some of those questions.

170
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:48,291
So I guess I would just say, you know, I hope as I meet more people that they feel willing and able to approach me and have these conversations and to talk through some of these different areas, because I think at the end of the day, we're all here trying to

171
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:50,248
make a better place.

172
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:58,010
And I think that if we can do that together, we can really see some great movement and change in Medford as well.

173
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,671
Oh, thanks, Liz.

174
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:01,211
And how can people get in touch with you?

175
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,211
Or how can they get more information about your campaign?

176
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:04,432
Sure.

177
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:10,173
So my website is Liz, number four, Medford.

178
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:18,155
And my email address is the same Liz for Medford at gmail.com, the same Instagram and Facebook handles.

179
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:22,288
Um, I try to update it as much as I can, but I'm not great at it.

180
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:27,150
Uh, so please email me if I haven't gotten back or if you haven't seen anything posted in a while.

181
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,392
Um, but yeah, I'd love to hear from people and, um, help in any way that I can.

182
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:34,933
Well, thanks Liz.

183
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:39,094
