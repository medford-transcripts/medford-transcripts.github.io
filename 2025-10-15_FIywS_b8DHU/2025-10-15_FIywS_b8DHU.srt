00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:38,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:40,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I am John Petrello.

3
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:49,586
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:59,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest today is Michelle Corrado, who is the owner artisan of the Medford Soap Company,

5
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:04,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Michelle, and thank you for joining us today.

6
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:10,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to know up front, I am a big fan of your soap.

7
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a customer, and my favorite is lemongrass.

8
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:16,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want everyone to know that before we even get started.

9
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:18,286
[SPEAKER_01]: But welcome to the show.

10
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:19,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, John.

11
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:22,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate and appreciate the opportunity for the conversation.

12
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you.

13
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get right into it, Michelle.

14
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:33,014
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I guess, can you just give us, give our audience a little background about yourself?

15
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:33,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

16
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:38,596
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to tell people, you know, I'm born, bred and never left Medford.

17
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:44,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was actually born at Lawrence Memorial Hospital many years ago and graduated Medford High School, class of 86.

18
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:51,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept it super local and even got my bachelor's at Tufts University in biology.

19
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:54,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did go to Mass College of Pharmacy in Boston.

20
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:56,082
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a pharmacist by trade.

21
00:01:56,808 --> 00:02:00,409
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a practicing pharmacist for over 30 years now.

22
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,712
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm married, been married for a long time.

23
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:12,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Something years, almost 30 years.

24
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:20,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have two grown sons, as well as a stepson and some grandbabies through that stepson.

25
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,738
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the Reader's Digest version of me.

26
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:26,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

27
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:27,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

28
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:29,726
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

29
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:35,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question is, you know, what got you started in the soap business?

30
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:40,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, how did Method Soap Company come about?

31
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:41,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

32
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:50,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people assume that it was a COVID thing because a lot of people got into like soap making and sourdough bread during the pandemic.

33
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,495
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it was just after that.

34
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:57,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So my youngest is, you know, what they call a COVID kid.

35
00:02:57,476 --> 00:03:00,817
[SPEAKER_00]: He graduated high school in 2020.

36
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:10,120
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a virtual, you know, it was essentially a nonexistent graduation and then spent his freshman year in college at home and then was able to launch.

37
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:15,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So after he launched, I really, you know, I'm fortunate that I get to work.

38
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:19,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I still work full time in pharmacy administration, but I work remote.

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So very fortunate for that.

40
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:33,434
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, at 4, 435 o'clock, my commute 30 seconds down the hall, then, you know, I was spending, you know, like three hours a night on Candy Crush.

41
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:36,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, I can't do this for the next 30 years.

42
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:39,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of fell down a TikTok rabbit hole one day.

43
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:43,478
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you linger a little too long on any video, then your feed is full of it.

44
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:46,979
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just lingered a little too long, I guess, on a soap making video.

45
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in December of 2022.

46
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,879
[SPEAKER_00]: And in January of 2023, I filed my business papers with the city of Medford.

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

48
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,640
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.

49
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it came about.

50
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting story.

51
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:03,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

52
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:05,042
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

53
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:09,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get yourself started, Method Soap Company.

54
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:12,403
[SPEAKER_01]: What were your biggest challenges?

55
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:17,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And what challenges does your business still face

56
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:20,986
[SPEAKER_01]: and do you see overcoming?

57
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:22,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

58
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:25,269
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the biggest challenges is probably me.

59
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:36,018
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very type A Leo, and I'm a very just like, go for it, let's do it, let's see what happens, and just course correct where we need to.

60
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:42,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to jump in with both feet, which is great, like that's where my adrenaline rush is, but that's, you know,

61
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:47,764
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can burn out or, you know, have to find a little bit more balance.

62
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:56,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say that kind of tongue in cheek, but, you know, my business, I don't think could have grown as quickly if I kind of wasn't that type of personality.

63
00:04:56,507 --> 00:05:02,348
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run, do distance running and train for that.

64
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:10,110
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that has been very helpful because for any runner, like, yes, there's the physicality, which I do not have.

65
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,991
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a naturally gifted runner.

66
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:23,141
[SPEAKER_00]: but really it's the mental training that you need with distance running to keep your body just going for that many hours when it doesn't want to, when it's in pain, when it's hungry.

67
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:26,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that mentality has really helped me.

68
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:33,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I work full time during the day and then I have to grow my business at night when I'm tired, when I'm cranky, when I'm hungry.

69
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:40,835
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one of kind of the challenges that any small business owner has often,

70
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:42,553
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a company of one.

71
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:57,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you are the creator, the label designer, the printer, the shipper, the receiver, the accountant, the lawyer, you know, you have to wear all those hats while you're trying to grow a business.

72
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:07,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's just kind of like a natural challenge of small business that I certainly, you know, have gone through in terms of like external factors for small business.

73
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:09,668
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just really hard, right?

74
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,389
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really,

75
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:28,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably got into this in the worst time in terms of the economy and the political environment and just, you know, what people are dealing with in terms of finances and really, you know, prioritizing what they need to prioritize what they spend money on.

76
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:34,844
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figure if I can make it through this period, that's probably good.

77
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:47,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say one more external factor I'd throw in there, you know, there's no shade on my city, but it's really hard to establish a small business in Medford right now, if you wanted to do like a brick and mortar location.

78
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:56,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Spaces essentially non-existent and what is existing is extremely expensive and I think

79
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:07,927
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some of our city is frustrated now because you see, you know, large corporate banks and driving schools and things like that filling up retail space because it's just really hard to get into.

80
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:08,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

81
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:09,448
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is.

82
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:11,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was a great answer, by the way.

83
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:14,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Honest answer.

84
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:16,714
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice.

85
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:17,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.

86
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:35,924
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, if someone was looking to open a local small business, after hearing you, they know it's going to be a little tough, but is there any advice, I mean, seriously, like advice that you could offer people?

87
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:42,448
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people out there that they would love to, but there's a lot of challenges.

88
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:45,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's doable, right?

89
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you just have to have the right expectations.

90
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:53,682
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, what I like to tell people is you need to figure out what this is for you.

91
00:07:54,382 --> 00:08:01,025
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, I am, you know, I'm getting a little burned out of, of pharmacy and healthcare.

92
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:02,886
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a tough field to be in.

93
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in it for a long time.

94
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:10,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a lot of positive contributions, but I'm just at that point in my life of, you know, so what else?

95
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:21,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this is creating, you know, as I'm thinking of exiting pharmacy and entering another business phase, I need to, the math needs to math, right?

96
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,120
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it is for me.

97
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:33,422
[SPEAKER_00]: For some other people, it's to help their kids through college or to be able to afford that, you know, extraordinary vacation once a year, or it's to help, you know,

98
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:35,983
[SPEAKER_00]: bridge a gap in bills.

99
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:41,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you need to know what your goal is and then set it from there, because otherwise you could set yourself up for failure.

100
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that happens.

101
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it happens.

102
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:46,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.

103
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:56,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, finding a community, you know, so there's lots of resources on social media and the web, like, I think you need to do your homework.

104
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to find out what you're getting into.

105
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I have done a little bit more homework?

106
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:02,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, but again, that's just, that's not me.

107
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,848
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's getting figured out.

108
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,230
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody is really passionate about something, then I say dip your toe in.

109
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,092
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of kind of no risk, low risk entry points that I think a small business can have.

110
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:20,713
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, the Medford Farmer's Market has been a great proving ground.

111
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,733
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 Good Vibes, another Medford-based business, has been an extraordinary partner for me.

112
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:33,798
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a ton of artisans that they work with, and they have several different locations.

113
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,401
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different craft fairs that people can enter.

114
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:40,063
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's fine, you know, just experiment.

115
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:44,686
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've said to some other, you know, other small businesses have reached out to me and kind of had the same question.

116
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:45,507
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, just try it.

117
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see what the reaction is.

118
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:48,670
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the customers are looking for.

119
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,492
[SPEAKER_00]: See how people react to your products and go from there.

120
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:55,045
[SPEAKER_01]: You've really done a tremendous job, I can say that.

121
00:09:55,386 --> 00:10:00,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're a hard worker, because every time I go somewhere, you're there somewhere.

122
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there.

123
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, you are.

124
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:07,655
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like wherever you go, you're going to find Method Soap.

125
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of like a three-part question.

126
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:17,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you probably answered a little bit with the last question.

127
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But what have you been doing?

128
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:26,819
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, once you get to a certain point in a business, what do you do to remain successful?

129
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a point you reach and, you know?

130
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:33,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I don't think I've reached that yet.

131
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:40,214
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't, I mean, I think I'm successful for the goals that I've set for myself for like year one and year two, right?

132
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel as though I'm on a good trajectory.

133
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to be very resilient.

134
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,653
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you have to be business minded.

135
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:56,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do find for some of, again, I think this gets back to making sure you're aligned with your own goals.

136
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,113
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to replace an income, then you need to work your business like you're replacing an income.

137
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,895
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to know what your expenses are.

138
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,016
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know what your profit margins are.

139
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:15,360
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know how much Venmo is taking from you versus PayPal versus the credit card company.

140
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,922
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to close your books at the end of the month.

141
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:21,804
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have a tax account.

142
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:26,306
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to operate like a business if that's what you want to do.

143
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:30,719
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I kind of lost track of what the question was.

144
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,420
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you answered it.

145
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,741
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do to remain?

146
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,282
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to a certain point.

147
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:37,383
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be resilient and pivot, right?

148
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:48,571
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something's not working, even if you're like, there have been things, and you can ask the folks that kind of work alongside me, there have been some products that I thought were like, oh my god, people are going to eat this up.

149
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:49,692
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so cool.

150
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:51,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sold like one or two.

151
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to take it out of my line.

152
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:54,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And it killed me.

153
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:55,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, are you kidding me?

154
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:56,977
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so cool.

155
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:01,489
[SPEAKER_00]: but if it's not what people want, then it's not what people want.

156
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,429
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to be able to pivot.

157
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:04,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

158
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,210
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand.

159
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

160
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:17,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, a lot of, and that's a great answer because a lot of people, I know people that have gone into business, the sales were way better than they could ever imagine.

161
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:22,775
[SPEAKER_01]: However, after a year or two, they're not making any money.

162
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:24,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, you know,

163
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:30,281
[SPEAKER_01]: The money's rolling in, but between everything else, so it's difficult.

164
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,382
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be careful.

165
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:40,811
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you believe sets you apart, I mean, from your competition?

166
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you consider your competition?

167
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:44,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.

168
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:56,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people, and it's laughable, I know, but I tell people my competition is like Bath and Body Works, Yankee Candle, kind of like those big corporations.

169
00:12:56,337 --> 00:13:03,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consider my competition to be the fellow soap vendor that's four tenths down for me.

170
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:12,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, if you are making, so I make a lot of products, but if we just go back to my starting point, which was soap,

171
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:20,089
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are making truly natural soap, which means you're making from scratch, you are mixing oil and lye and making soap,

172
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:22,093
[SPEAKER_00]: That is soap.

173
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:25,835
[SPEAKER_00]: What is on the market really are detergents.

174
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:31,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I spend a lot of time just like educating folks of what the difference is.

175
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Your question, like why should I buy your soap?

176
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,982
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my soap is $7 a bar.

177
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,704
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be $7 a bar.

178
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:49,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you look at the price that has happened in the world marketplace on olive oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter, shea butter, like these are butters and oils.

179
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:59,651
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not the detergent chemicals that you can manufacture in a plant, you know, at drum size and just poured in on pennies on the pound.

180
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:03,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And once people, once you go through that with them,

181
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:08,665
[SPEAKER_00]: and they realize it and you get them to try it and they feel the difference.

182
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,306
[SPEAKER_00]: They see there's no soap scum in their tub anymore.

183
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:13,867
[SPEAKER_00]: They see their skin isn't flaking off anymore.

184
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:15,687
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's the difference.

185
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:20,689
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's my competition is just to like going back to natural.

186
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,190
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very eco-conscious.

187
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,271
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very low waste, reuse, reduce, recycle.

188
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:39,226
[SPEAKER_00]: We're vegan based so you know that resonates with some people and so for the people that that resonates with and is important to them, I think, though, those are my people.

189
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I, I'm one of those people because

190
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:49,235
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't even remember the first time I bought your salt, but once I bought it, I was hooked because you're right.

191
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you just said about it is true.

192
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:54,876
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing product.

193
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,677
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I feel anyhow.

194
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:57,277
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is.

195
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, there is no flaking.

196
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,839
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing left in the tub or the whatever.

197
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,279
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wow.

198
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:05,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you use it,

199
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,822
[SPEAKER_01]: you really see, you know, the difference and it's worth it.

200
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:19,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I know what sets you apart and, you know, it'd be nice to let the audience know what sets you apart.

201
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:29,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, once again, your main competition then, it's not, I mean, it's basically the Bed Bath and Body, those types of operations.

202
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:38,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because again, you know, and again, I don't mean to throw shade on corporations, like they have to make a dollar and they, you know, they have very loyal followings.

203
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:45,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there are people who are addicted to their sense and products and, you know, everybody has to find what works for them.

204
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:49,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just encourage people to read.

205
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,347
[SPEAKER_00]: We really just have to read a label.

206
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:59,130
[SPEAKER_00]: If you compare, you know, a label of my body butter versus a more commercial one or my soap versus a commercial one.

207
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:04,323
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you understand what's in there, you know what's in there.

208
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's for me where it's at.

209
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:12,664
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think most of Medford by now knows, you know, I'm a breast cancer survivor.

210
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:28,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you go through that type of journey too, you're always, you know, everybody thinks they're healthy, they're doing natural things, but when you go through something like that, you've got a little bit more eye to, all right, what can I do to reduce kind of my chemical exposure or,

211
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,781
[SPEAKER_00]: clean my body from the inside and the outside as much as I can, too.

212
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:37,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of my story, too.

213
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:39,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great story.

214
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:45,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, I have to ask you this.

215
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:59,347
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go back and change anything, building the business, if you had to start over, is there anything that you'd do differently?

216
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:03,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back, tough question.

217
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's a hard question, right?

218
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would be like a question you could ask in life, right?

219
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:14,203
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's anything you could change in your 20s, would you do it differently?

220
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:22,666
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so hard to answer because everything that happens to us or that is defined by the universe puts you on the path you're supposed to be, right?

221
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:27,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So had I not started the way I had, I might not be where I am now.

222
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,169
[SPEAKER_00]: If I kind of take a,

223
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:31,927
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a comfort zone.

224
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:42,329
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great if I could have just walked into this beautiful, like 5,000 square foot space that had manufacturing capability and a storefront and all that, right?

225
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:52,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just kind of walked in, but I literally started in my kitchen and then like stole a quarter of the basement, then stole a third of the basement, then stole half of the basement, then refinished half the basement.

226
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:55,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, so like you're constantly rejiggering.

227
00:17:56,512 --> 00:18:00,493
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's just, I think that's true of a lot of small businesses.

228
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:07,334
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see in the forums that I'm in and everything, like people are starting in the spaces and with the means that they have at the time.

229
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:11,215
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as business grows, then they kind of grow that.

230
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:12,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

231
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:17,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So you answered a bunch of questions that I have for you, but that's great.

232
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:23,778
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to ask, you did answer it somewhat, you know,

233
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:34,017
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that makes your product, you know, different from similar products?

234
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:39,981
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people go in a store, there's, you know, 20 bars of soap, and there's method soap.

235
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:41,122
[SPEAKER_01]: What separates you?

236
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:48,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you're looking like on the shelf, like if it's a, just a cold, like, let me compare these three soaps on the shelf.

237
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:55,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I think again, I go back to my ingredient list that it's clean, it's vegans focused.

238
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,202
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are low waste in our packaging.

239
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,864
[SPEAKER_00]: We reuse everything.

240
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,146
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give back to our community.

241
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:09,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a fundraising program and, you know, we do several different fundraisers throughout the year and all that kind of stuff.

242
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:10,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

243
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:22,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're if it was a more kind of warm environment where I'm there, right, I'm presenting my product, something that I often counsel other

244
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:33,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Versioning small business owners is kind of like what you point to like why should they if there are four of you whatever it is you're making and whatever is side by side.

245
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:41,613
[SPEAKER_00]: If this for you similar businesses next to each other, why should they buy from you and a lot of times it's the person.

246
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:44,323
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a connection, right?

247
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:52,047
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make a connection with the company's purpose, with the owner or the artisan, and want to support them.

248
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they have to have great products.

249
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:59,732
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna buy crappy products just because they like you, or they might buy it once, but they're not gonna come back.

250
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:10,198
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you also have to be part of the community, whatever that means, whether it's the community of the farmer's market, the community of the town, the community of the soap makers,

251
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:20,923
[SPEAKER_00]: community of fellow artisans, you have to be someone who can run in those circles.

252
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:22,664
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not for everybody either.

253
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:26,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people get into small business because they're extremely introverted.

254
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:29,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I call myself an extroverted introvert, right?

255
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:39,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So while my comfort zone may be to be in my basement making soap, I also love going out to markets and talking with people and talking about my products.

256
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:43,709
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think those connections help as well.

257
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,210
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.

258
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

259
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to ask, what are your top sellers?

260
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:55,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And aside from seals, what makes them a top seller?

261
00:20:58,564 --> 00:20:58,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

262
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:04,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, obviously all my products have to do with colors and smells and textures.

263
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:11,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really finding kind of at least those big bucket niches where people are now.

264
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:23,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it through shade on like Yankee Candle and Bath and Body Works before, but they've actually, you know, institutionalized some scent profiles, you know, that people like and that they kind of gravitate towards.

265
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:30,793
[SPEAKER_00]: So my top selling soap is something people make fun of me for the name, but it's called Man O' Man.

266
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:37,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a really nice cologne soap scent that both men and women like.

267
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:41,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been the top selling soap since we opened the store.

268
00:21:42,604 --> 00:21:43,525
[SPEAKER_00]: almost three years ago.

269
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:50,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So soap is my staple, but we've got a few dozen other products off of that.

270
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:54,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, this season, whipped body butter is a big seller for us.

271
00:21:55,396 --> 00:22:00,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have a lot of people who are looking to reduce their plastic footprint.

272
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:07,546
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of solid forms, like we have solid shampoo bars, solid conditioner, solid dish soap.

273
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:12,485
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got like natural deodorants.

274
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:14,507
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a men's line.

275
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:21,515
[SPEAKER_00]: We just started wickless candles, which are really nice because you don't have to worry about the flame or whatever.

276
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:22,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to

277
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:26,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I will only do things that fit with our mission.

278
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:30,269
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people have asked me for like liquid hand soap, and I won't do it.

279
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,131
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly water and mostly plastic.

280
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:36,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, a bar of soap is better and lasts longer.

281
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:41,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do things that align with our mission that our customers are also looking for.

282
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:46,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do, I have to say, your soap does last longer.

283
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:49,136
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it really does.

284
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:49,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.

285
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:50,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It lasts longer.

286
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:53,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for sure it lasts longer.

287
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:57,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I did try that, uh, that brand you just mentioned.

288
00:22:59,169 --> 00:22:59,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.

289
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.

290
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it a lot, but lemongrass is always going to be there.

291
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:07,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all right.

292
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:12,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you mentioned all these different flavors, aromas, scents.

293
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I'm curious, how do you choose?

294
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:19,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, you know, you're making your soap.

295
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:20,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's gotta be,

296
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:29,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to know, how do you come up with like... I get that question a lot, especially if you come to a farmer's market.

297
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:36,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about, probably about five dozen different scents and designs of soaps.

298
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what somebody says, like, how do you choose?

299
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:44,564
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just really as the creative muse hits me.

300
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:49,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people all the time that this is the creative outlet that I didn't even know I needed.

301
00:23:50,678 --> 00:24:03,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really it starts with a sense that I think, you know, may resonate with people or resonates with me and I try it or it's sense that people have asked for or sent profiles.

302
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really just take it from there.

303
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:09,353
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's kind of groupings, right?

304
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:14,457
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the food sense, there's the floral sense, there's the cologne sense.

305
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:20,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to not overwhelm people with too many choices, but they are the ones who are asking for all the choices.

306
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:22,122
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just have fun.

307
00:24:22,222 --> 00:24:25,704
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it comes down to, you know, like Rose.

308
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:27,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose was a top seller.

309
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:30,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It was neck and neck with Man O' Man when I opened the store.

310
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:32,989
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I sold a Rose bar, right?

311
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,270
[SPEAKER_00]: So some things have their seasons.

312
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lemongrass was a blockbuster.

313
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:50,673
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like the past six months kind of petered off and now it's picking up again right so I fall if something falls off then as much as I liked it or loved it like it gets shelved and maybe I'll try to bring it out again in a year or something but

314
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:54,596
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really what the demand, I follow what the demand is.

315
00:24:54,616 --> 00:25:00,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, if you're ever gonna start making lemongrass, you're gonna let me know ahead of time, right?

316
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

317
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to stock up, that's all I'm saying, because it is, it's really good.

318
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:10,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I hope your lemongrass sales go up.

319
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:12,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's safer now.

320
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:13,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it really is.

321
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,820
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite.

322
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:26,944
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I mean, so, you know, here's a question I probably shouldn't ask, but I just, I wanna mention this.

323
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:43,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sense, I mean, you know, I know you base it on, you know, customers, you try different sense, you have some that work great, some are so-so, but have you ever had some that just don't make it?

324
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:45,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

325
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:48,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have one I thought was pretty cool.

326
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it Kiwi Grove.

327
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,451
[SPEAKER_00]: It really smelled like fresh kiwis.

328
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot give those bars away.

329
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:54,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

330
00:25:54,953 --> 00:26:06,438
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that, you know, so I tell people what's still so like, maybe it's not your favorite, you know, like I'll discount them or I'll throw them in as free, you know, I'll run promotions where it will be, you know, buy so much, you get a free bar of soap.

331
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:14,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a couple, I've been very fortunate that I think that one and maybe one other one have been real stinkers for me.

332
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,141
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's out of, like I said, nearly 100 different offerings that I've had.

333
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:23,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say all in all, I've got a pretty good track record.

334
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:24,942
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is.

335
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:25,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.

336
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:30,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just like something like, when you mentioned Kiwi, to me, I would probably buy that.

337
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:32,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to be honest.

338
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know you had that flavor.

339
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to keep up with all of them.

340
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:38,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

341
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:39,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it is.

342
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:40,147
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

343
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:41,428
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

344
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

345
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know,

346
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,122
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very, very interesting listening to you.

347
00:26:51,543 --> 00:27:06,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, I've been waiting for a while to get you on the show because it's just, it's really interesting how things go on and, you know, how you started Medford Soap, how you got to where you go.

348
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:09,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is gonna be the last question.

349
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've covered just about everything.

350
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:33,155
[SPEAKER_01]: um so you know to me this is the last it's probably the most important uh question for you and that is how do people buy your products um you know where is it available and how do people order sure so my website is www.medfordsoap.com so that's available 24 7 365

351
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:39,420
[SPEAKER_00]: has a pretty good search function and we do rewards.

352
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you order online, you earn points that you can use for discounts off your purchases or free shipping.

353
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:52,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We do offer free, I'm sorry, flat rate shipping at $6.95 or free shipping for $75 and over.

354
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:53,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do do free pickup.

355
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:03,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will bring it like if you're going, well, tomorrow's the last Medford farmers market.

356
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure when this will air.

357
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:07,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday, October 16th is the last farmers market.

358
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:11,828
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, can bring products to farmers markets.

359
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,652
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow me on social media, I am most active on Facebook.

360
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:18,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I always post where I'm going to pop up.

361
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:21,126
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, John, I pop up to different places.

362
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere, yeah.

363
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:29,332
[SPEAKER_00]: So, because part of the fun is coming and shopping, you know, and smelling it and trying them in person.

364
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:36,577
[SPEAKER_00]: The 4 Good Vibes location on Main Street in South Medford, I have a selection of my products there as well.

365
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:39,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, in South Medford, okay.

366
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:39,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, so.

367
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:41,323
[SPEAKER_00]: always have it there.

368
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:55,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should have given a shout out to, I do want to give a little plug too to the Medford Chamber of Commerce because they are doing a lot of work to try to assist what, you know, I kind of fall into the micro business category.

369
00:28:56,825 --> 00:28:58,607
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a member of the chamber.

370
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:01,370
[SPEAKER_00]: They do offer a discounted first year.

371
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:08,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the fee, the annual fee can seem like a little steep to the small businesses who don't have a lot of disposable income.

372
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:15,043
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, again, that's a way, especially for the first year where it's discounted, you need to make connections within the city.

373
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great way to do it.

374
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:21,349
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to participate in Oktoberfest, which I think, again, is another great way to showcase

375
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:24,239
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as all of the other great events that they have.

376
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:32,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to mention that, like you said, advice for other small businesses in Minford, I think that would be a great one too.

377
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:33,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Good advice.

378
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:36,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We plan on having them in a future show.

379
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have the Rotary Club coming up.

380
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:45,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're going to be doing a lot of that type shows in the very near future.

381
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:49,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to thank you again, Michelle.

382
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:52,556
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's been a pleasure to have you on.

383
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:54,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Very informative show.

384
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And congratulations.

385
00:29:57,578 --> 00:30:00,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we wish you, you're a hard worker.

386
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:02,039
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a great product.

387
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're going to have continued success.

388
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for being on the show.

389
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:08,442
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I really appreciate, John.

390
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:09,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity.

391
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:15,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity to use this forum as a way to thank the community as well.

392
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:21,811
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the hardest things to a small business is coming up with the name of the business.

393
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:27,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought long and hard about it and was thinking about names that resonated with me.

394
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:33,763
[SPEAKER_00]: and knew that one of the pieces of the mission of the company I knew was to give back to the community.

395
00:30:34,203 --> 00:30:39,664
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how I landed on Medford Soap Company, because I wanted the community to sense some pride from it as well.

396
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:48,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So just want to thank the community that has really come out in spades to help us have a great launch, and I hope we have many more years of success.

397
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.

398
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:49,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will.

399
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:51,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, congratulations.

400
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:52,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

401
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:53,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

402
00:30:53,507 --> 00:30:54,767
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thanks, Michelle.

403
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:57,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's that time again.
