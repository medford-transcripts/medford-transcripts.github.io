00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:39,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Madam President.

47
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:41,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, council members.

48
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:43,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to do so.

49
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank, before I begin, the city clerk,

50
00:03:49,787 --> 00:04:03,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia Hunt and Amanda Centrilla for providing logistical support and helping me to parse through the city council minutes that reviewed community development board recommendations.

51
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:08,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to be sure that I understood and got those recommendations correctly embedded into the zoning.

52
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,445
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm glad to say that CDB staff gave me the green light last week

53
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:19,847
[SPEAKER_12]: and I was happy to turn it in a day or two early.

54
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:29,234
[SPEAKER_12]: What we've done is essentially gone through the two minutes of the city council at which the CDB recommendations were considered.

55
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:33,777
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that there were something on the order of 74 recommendations.

56
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:37,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Some were very simple typographical pickups that we corrected.

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Others were a bit more complex, but those have now all been included.

58
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,219
[SPEAKER_12]: in the ordinance.

59
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I made a track change version of the ordinance so that you could see the changes as they were embedded.

60
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I also provided a clean version of the ordinance.

61
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:55,426
[SPEAKER_12]: There were also changes made to the use table.

62
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,749
[SPEAKER_12]: There is both a tracked version of the use table and a clean version of the use table.

63
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:05,993
[SPEAKER_12]: The dimensional table only had two changes, so there's no tracked version, there is a clean version.

64
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,314
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are the three documents that you have.

65
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Attorney Brabrowski.

66
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:18,357
[SPEAKER_15]: As this is a hearing, we will open the hearing for those in favor of the paper.

67
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone who would like to speak who is in favor of the paper, either online or in the chambers?

68
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:29,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I can use the raise hand function.

69
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, I can also scan through.

70
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

71
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Lisa Honda, if you'd like to speak.

72
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,482
[SPEAKER_20]: President, councilors, we just wanted to thank you for all the hard work on this recodification.

73
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:01,304
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a lot of effort that went into it by the council.

74
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:02,705
[SPEAKER_20]: We were very pleased to see it.

75
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:09,868
[SPEAKER_20]: We do believe that this new version of the zoning will be easier to work with and easier to understand.

76
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:14,010
[SPEAKER_20]: We just wanted to voice our support for the changes that the council has seen

77
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,689
[SPEAKER_20]: fit to put forward with this motion.

78
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:17,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

79
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:18,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

80
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

81
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing and hearing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

82
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this paper, either on Zoom or in the chambers?

83
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,907
[SPEAKER_15]: One moment.

84
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,861
[SPEAKER_15]: raise their virtual hand or just flag me down on video.

85
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing and hearing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

86
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Any discussion from the council?

87
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President.

88
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:00,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

89
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:05,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very grateful that we finally got to this point.

90
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:11,529
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that I recall taking up, I believe, in my second term as a member of the council.

91
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:21,796
[SPEAKER_07]: This evening, there's someone that's not a member of this body anymore who deserves credit for getting us this far, and that's John Falco.

92
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:26,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, John really made joining a priority during his time as the president.

93
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:33,979
[SPEAKER_07]: John worked very hard in bringing us to where we are to help us secure Mr. Bobrowski and his leadership.

94
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:35,498
[SPEAKER_07]: to get us to this point.

95
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:46,026
[SPEAKER_07]: We've met probably for close to 60 hours as a body on this topic over the course of 24 months to get us to where we are today.

96
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,848
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a very open and deliberate process.

97
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been very transparent.

98
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:56,535
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been, I believe, nine draft documents that have circulated among the council that have all been vetted through public meetings.

99
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,276
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had the

100
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:03,844
[SPEAKER_07]: duly required public hearing with Community Development Board.

101
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Notices have been posted.

102
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:17,472
[SPEAKER_07]: The Community Development Board had an opportunity to vet this motion as well, and they came back with a series of over 70 recommendations that the council took up in a meeting, went through each and every one of them, addressed each and every one of them, and we finally came up with this document right here, Madam President.

103
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,213
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a document I'm very proud of.

104
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:27,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this body should be very proud of this document, and in this young stage in our term, this work product that we're putting out so far is something that's great.

105
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:31,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And I support this measure that's before us wholeheartedly, and I vote for approval.

106
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:32,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

107
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:34,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion on the Councilor?

108
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:35,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

109
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Behrs.

110
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

111
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:47,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank everyone who's put so much work into this process.

112
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:57,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I've lost count of the number of meetings, I think maybe 15, 16, somewhere in there, just of the Council, not including many meetings of the Community Development Board.

113
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:13,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I echo Councilor Knight's comments about the significance of this change and bringing us into the modern day and hopefully making a lot clearer for everybody involved what can happen and can't happen as regards our zoning.

114
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:19,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also see this as a foundation for moving forward, a way for us to much more easily

115
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:31,645
[SPEAKER_09]: make the tweaks and changes that we need as we are growing as a city, both to protect our community and to grow our community.

116
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:39,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's gonna be a lot easier now, especially with this group of people who have read so much and done so much and look so much into this code.

117
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:45,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely much more knowledgeable about zoning now than I was three years ago.

118
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:49,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all for your work on this and I'm definitely supporting

119
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:53,008
[SPEAKER_09]: our work tonight and moving, you know, voting to approve this.

120
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:53,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

121
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, thank you, Madam President again.

122
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:03,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I echo the sentiments from my colleagues.

123
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:09,621
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, Council Falco, former Council Falco president and Council marks.

124
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:14,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I know spent a lot of time with this, uh, this, uh, initiative.

125
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:18,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I'm also very proud of it.

126
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:18,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that

127
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:29,763
[SPEAKER_10]: When the administration allows this body to look at representation, like attorney burrows key and having his leadership.

128
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:30,804
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think.

129
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:49,713
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been, we've been in forums of other attorneys, but to work with Mr. Brabowski and his wealth of knowledge and the pieces that he shares from other communities that he has, he has fought with and, and changed so many, so many guidelines.

130
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:54,738
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, uh, you know, without him, um, I don't know if it would have been, um,

131
00:10:56,714 --> 00:11:10,865
[SPEAKER_10]: can't say easy because it's been two years, but he really made it very educational and we appreciate his leadership with this process and we look forward to moving this forward.

132
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:11,945
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Madam President.

133
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,175
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my colleagues have,

134
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:26,645
[SPEAKER_01]: have put it really well.

135
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:41,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to say, I think this is one of the things that shows that to make the change that we want to see in our community.

136
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:50,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in this session, we've had many meetings about these

137
00:11:53,024 --> 00:12:02,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I know before our session of the City Council, the Council's been working hard on this, different community boards have been working hard on this.

138
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Neighborhood activists, experts have

139
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud that we are taking the thoughts to be able to vote on something like this.

140
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:26,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I also see this as an opportunity for us to, as I think Councilor Behrs alluded to, move forward with more ideas and to open the conversation up about how we can develop our city so that everyone wins.

141
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:30,016
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we make Medford work for all of us?

142
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:39,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is a crucial piece to that puzzle.

143
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,454
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important first step, right?

144
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important step to get us all on the same page, to bring

145
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,083
[SPEAKER_01]: our code to the modern day to give clarity to everyone.

146
00:12:51,383 --> 00:13:04,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need that platform for us to move forward and for us to have those, you know, discussions about new ideas that we might or might not take up, but we need this first step first.

147
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:08,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to be voting for this.

148
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:11,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

149
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:12,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kerrio.

150
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Madam President, President.

151
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:21,416
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a document I'm proud to be part of three different presidents worked on this nine city councils working on this.

152
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:27,639
[SPEAKER_22]: And we all stayed unified on this and know where we work for a common goal.

153
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:32,422
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we did a real good job took some time and this is the first part.

154
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:39,895
[SPEAKER_22]: of our zoning and look forward to passing this this evening and moving forward to the next phase of the of this.

155
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:44,377
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you everybody for all the time everybody put in and thank you.

156
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:45,497
[SPEAKER_22]: John Falco was not here.

157
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:47,518
[SPEAKER_22]: He was the original starter of this.

158
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:48,338
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

159
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:50,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the discussion with the council.

160
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,541
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could just for a moment from the chair, I want to echo my fellow

161
00:13:55,623 --> 00:14:00,886
[SPEAKER_15]: and thanking former Councilor Beto for really getting us to this point where we could carry it across the finish line in this term.

162
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:10,031
[SPEAKER_15]: We had countless meetings on this, all public meetings, and I think perhaps too often it's highlighted where we disagree in this body.

163
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:20,157
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you attended any of these meetings, it was all of us digging our heels in and doing the work and having the important discussions and representing the interests of the city and finding common ground.

164
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:22,138
[SPEAKER_15]: That happened among the council,

165
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:32,746
[SPEAKER_15]: it happened as we work with the Community Development Board and it happened as you know we had the department heads come in and have discussions so that we could get a document that I think we're all proud of that really represents the work of the council.

166
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:41,253
[SPEAKER_15]: We can get mired in lots of things but zoning is a major piece of the council and our responsibility and I think this is something that we're all proud of

167
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:50,278
[SPEAKER_15]: and that we've all been able to have our hands on it and represent different points of view and move Medford forward and also act, as many have said, as a first step to the next thing.

168
00:14:50,418 --> 00:15:01,143
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping that, you know, the administration was able to empower us with Attorney Bobrowski, and I hope that they will empower us and fund us to continue this work because it's important work and this is what we've just begun.

169
00:15:02,204 --> 00:15:02,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice-Presidents.

170
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:06,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you for your comments.

171
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I wholeheartedly agree.

172
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,168
[SPEAKER_09]: When Councilor Marks was mentioned, it reminded me

173
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,637
[SPEAKER_09]: that we should thank all the residents who participated in this process.

174
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:19,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he would be loudly voicing that.

175
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,463
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a lot of residents involved in our committee of the whole meetings, raising questions, some of whom are here tonight.

176
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:29,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you watched any of those community development board meetings, those are pretty resident focused as well.

177
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:33,991
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a lot of different residents from a lot of parts of the city finding typos and

178
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:39,929
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for commas and providing, you know, really substantive and helpful advice on zoning and planning and development.

179
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:43,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so just wanted to add that to, to the record tonight before we vote.

180
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:44,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

181
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:48,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, thank you.

182
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:51,274
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, I neglected to, uh, thank you.

183
00:15:52,523 --> 00:16:04,589
[SPEAKER_22]: for his work, I mean, he's probably one of the finest legal minds in the state on this issue, and he made it a lot easier than it looks.

184
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,870
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, I just wanna thank him.

185
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,133
[SPEAKER_22]: I say, the man is a wealth of knowledge, and I hope we're able to bring him back for the phase two of this.

186
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,214
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you, Mark, for your work.

187
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Congressman Carvella.

188
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:18,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Any comments from the public, either in the chambers or on Zoom?

189
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:30,213
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll give one more moment if anyone else would like to comment on the paper before us.

190
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:41,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Knight for approval to be ordained, seconded by Councilor Collins.

191
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:43,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

192
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:46,186
[SPEAKER_11]: To be ordained.

193
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:48,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Behrs.

194
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:48,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

195
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:50,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Kerrio.

196
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

197
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:52,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

198
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:53,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

199
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:55,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

200
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:55,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

201
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

202
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:58,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

203
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:00,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Seng?

204
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:02,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

205
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:05,578
[SPEAKER_11]: President Morrell?

206
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:06,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

207
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:09,601
[SPEAKER_15]: 74-0 in the negative, the motion passes.

208
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Motions, orders and resolutions.

209
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:23,372
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-073, this is for me unless any councilors object, I think it's read from the chair.

210
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:37,733
[SPEAKER_15]: report offered by President Morrell be it so resolved that the city council approved and transmit to the general court for their consideration, the following home rule petition as originally introduced by the mayor, and as amended by the city council and committee of the whole.

211
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,961
[SPEAKER_15]: and act authorizing the election of a charter commission in the city of Medford.

212
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:48,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Be enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in general court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows.

213
00:17:48,822 --> 00:18:03,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Section one, notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 43B of the general laws or the provisions of any general law, special law or regulation to the contrary, the city of Medford city council shall at the first regular city election or earlier occurring special election

214
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:11,669
[SPEAKER_15]: held on or after the 60th day following the effective date of this act by order provides for election of a nine member charter commission.

215
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:20,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Section two, the charter commission shall be composed of one commissioner elected from each of the eight wards of the city and one elected at large.

216
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:31,818
[SPEAKER_15]: In the event of a charter commissioner elected to represent a particular ward should move within the city during their term of office, they may continue to serve as the representative from the ward from which they were elected.

217
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:39,985
[SPEAKER_15]: The vacancy created by any commissioner who moves from the city during their term of office or who resigns may be filled by majority vote of the entire commission.

218
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:54,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Section three, other than as set forth here in the provisions of chapter 43B of the general laws shall be applicable to the nomination and election of charter commissioners and to the duties and responsibilities of the city and the charter commission elected here under.

219
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:58,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Section four, this act shall take effect upon its passage.

220
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:12,271
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by the City Council and Committee of the Whole, President Morrell moved to amend the language of the petition to fill any vacancy on the Charter Commission by replacing that member with the person who received the next highest number of votes for that position on the commission.

221
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins second.

222
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:19,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Approved on a roll call vote of six in favor and Councilor Carviello abstaining because he had just arrived.

223
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any discussion from the Council on this paper?

224
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:27,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Barrett.

225
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

226
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:37,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Just that I believe we should reflect the language of the amendment that you just read in the actual language of the petition before it is submitted.

227
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:58,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And basing that language on the language of the city charter of the city of Medford, that would be a motion to amend this to replace at the end of section two, the words may be filled by majority vote of the entire commission that would be struck and would be replaced with

228
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:07,239
[SPEAKER_09]: shall be filled by that defeated candidate who received the highest number of votes for that specific seat and is eligible and willing to serve.

229
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I have that?

230
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:10,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

231
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:13,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you can you transmit that to me in some way?

232
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:13,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

233
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:15,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can have and that's that's straight from the city charter.

234
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:18,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it takes up the word city council.

235
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:22,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

236
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:23,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion from the council?

237
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:29,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Any members of the public who would like to speak on this paper?

238
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Come up to the podium.

239
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,475
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see any hands on Zoom at the moment, so.

240
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:40,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address, please.

241
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:43,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

242
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Every city has the right to charter review.

243
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,640
[SPEAKER_17]: You've heard it before and you'll hear it again.

244
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:58,962
[SPEAKER_17]: The charter, the instrument that dictates how our city government is structured and implemented is a living document.

245
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:03,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Wisdom and smart governance would dictate periodic review.

246
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:08,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Yet Medford's charter has not been looked at for more than three decades.

247
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:16,068
[SPEAKER_17]: That means the last review happened before my 29 years as a resident and has been pointed out here

248
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,001
[SPEAKER_17]: before more than one member of this council was even born.

249
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:37,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Charter review has been attempted several times, for at least two of those times, the barrier has come from you, the city council, and you are the body that today will determine the fate of another home rule petition to initiate charter review.

250
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:43,688
[SPEAKER_17]: I started joining some of my fellow residents a few months ago to organize around the issue.

251
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,541
[SPEAKER_17]: We contacted each of you to hear your thoughts.

252
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:53,704
[SPEAKER_17]: To those of you who met and talked with us, thank you for the productive discussions and the chance to listen to your concerns.

253
00:21:54,984 --> 00:22:01,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of you felt the elected charter review commission outlined in this paper might not be representative of all the neighborhoods in our city.

254
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:08,570
[SPEAKER_17]: We responded to your specific asks and we got word representation applied to this petition.

255
00:22:10,114 --> 00:22:20,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, some of you who expressed support have flip-flopped for reasons ranging from complaints about social media comments to declarations that charter review should come from the people.

256
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:24,123
[SPEAKER_17]: First, I would like to say, councillors, you are the people.

257
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:28,405
[SPEAKER_17]: You are our elected officials, and we have spoken to you on this.

258
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:39,252
[SPEAKER_17]: I have here a letter, which I ask to be entered into the record, endorsed by 227 residents, urging you to vote yes on this paper.

259
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:47,823
[SPEAKER_17]: In recent years, nearly 5,000 people have signed a petition to get a Charter Review Commission on the ballot.

260
00:22:48,963 --> 00:22:57,205
[SPEAKER_17]: That's well over 50% of the entire number of votes each of you received in the last election, and in many cases, it's closer to 100%.

261
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:07,148
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition, this paper will put candidates from each ward, as some of you requested, on the ballot to be elected by the people

262
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,033
[SPEAKER_17]: to a charter review commission that will engage the community in its 18 month process.

263
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:21,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Recommendations for modifications to the charter, if any, would go on the ballot before they could be implemented.

264
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,483
[SPEAKER_17]: In light of all this, how can you argue that this process would not come from the people?

265
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:34,227
[SPEAKER_17]: I ask that you honor the support you expressed to us and vote in favor of this paper.

266
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:41,285
[SPEAKER_17]: While it is not the only route to charter review, it is the most expeditious in the current moment.

267
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:50,488
[SPEAKER_17]: And it offers you a chance to respond to your constituents and show that you value their concerns and you value their civic engagement.

268
00:23:51,028 --> 00:24:00,952
[SPEAKER_17]: For what better way to promote civic engagement than inviting every resident of this city to join in reviewing how their city government works.

269
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:06,735
[SPEAKER_17]: We are determined to partake of that opportunity, indeed of that right.

270
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:11,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Collecting signatures is not the only other alternative available.

271
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,739
[SPEAKER_17]: We are exploring all of them.

272
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:20,522
[SPEAKER_17]: And if this petition fails, we will pursue them as swiftly and as transparently as possible.

273
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:25,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Every city has the right to a review, and we will have ours.

274
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:32,671
[SPEAKER_17]: It is up to you to decide whether you will help to honor that right in this moment or choose to delay it.

275
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:33,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

276
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mrs. Powell.

277
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other, any further comments?

278
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Either on Zoom or in person?

279
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:51,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Please raise your hand if you'd like to speak, either on Zoom or, slide me down the camera.

280
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:04,433
[SPEAKER_15]: being no further request to speak from the public.

281
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:05,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion from the council?

282
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:07,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President.

283
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:07,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Nye.

284
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:22,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm convinced that the best path to ensure comprehensive and informed review of our city's charter is to follow the time-tested path of gathering signatures and complying with the various provisions of the general laws that surround that process.

285
00:25:22,697 --> 00:25:24,817
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some that would disagree.

286
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:27,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And to them, I say that, you know,

287
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:36,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Charter is our local constitution, and in effect is a document that's far too important to allow an abbreviated review and to take shortcuts.

288
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:42,490
[SPEAKER_07]: The process established in the general law specifically establishing charter review is more than just a procedure.

289
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:48,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the right of local self-government, and the politicians shouldn't be deciding this for the people.

290
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:57,457
[SPEAKER_07]: This alone should give every resident the reason to pause and say, let's let this process unfold in its time-tested wisdom.

291
00:25:58,562 --> 00:25:59,963
[SPEAKER_07]: the initiative petition process.

292
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Proper discernment is never rushed.

293
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:12,149
[SPEAKER_07]: A perfect example of this proper discernment was in November, 2015, when the people of Medford spoke at the ballot box and overwhelmingly adopted the Community Preservation Act.

294
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,212
[SPEAKER_07]: The success of this program can be attributed to the Preserve Medford campaign.

295
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:26,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this group could have came to the council and pleaded with us to take shortcuts and to put this matter on the council agenda and to put it on the ballot, to do a homeown petition and to send it forward.

296
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:40,339
[SPEAKER_07]: But instead, there was a grassroots campaign with efforts devoted to speaking to residents door to door, in the community, in the streets, at the parks, addressing concerns and issues, and raising awareness and educating the electorate about the CPA.

297
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result, because people got a chance to talk, information was shared, concerns were raised, and it was time to vote.

298
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,201
[SPEAKER_07]: The voters were informed, aware, and knowledgeable.

299
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It was democracy at its best.

300
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:52,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming off a three-year pandemic,

301
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:56,848
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not had the ability to attend our children's games or school events.

302
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:59,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Graduations and proms have been canceled.

303
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,412
[SPEAKER_07]: There's absolutely zero sense of normalcy.

304
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:09,479
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the strong relationships with the neighbors in our community that we've had prior to the pandemic, and we need to build those back up.

305
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,405
[SPEAKER_07]: In a time when we have no sense of normalcy or stability, I don't think our child should be treated with any less care than the CPA.

306
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:23,313
[SPEAKER_07]: The residents of our city deserve every opportunity to absorb the information before they're asked to decide on whether to do anything to our child.

307
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:25,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And the initiative petition process meets this mark.

308
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope my position's not misunderstood, Madam President.

309
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:37,360
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an important issue, and my disagreement is not over the method, is over the method, and not over the motivation, and over the process, and not over the principle.

310
00:27:38,841 --> 00:27:42,423
[SPEAKER_07]: But ultimately, this should be a grassroots effort that comes from the ground up, not the top down.

311
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,804
[SPEAKER_07]: The people shouldn't be making the decisions for the politicians.

312
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:45,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

313
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:49,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

314
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:51,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Behrs.

315
00:27:54,657 --> 00:28:03,785
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve as amended, as amended by Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Collins.

316
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:05,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

317
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Behrs.

318
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:12,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

319
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:14,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Kerrio.

320
00:28:14,714 --> 00:28:14,954
No.

321
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:17,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

322
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:17,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

323
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:19,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

324
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:19,943
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

325
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:22,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

326
00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:22,744
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

327
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:24,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Sang?

328
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:25,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

329
00:28:27,427 --> 00:28:28,027
[SPEAKER_11]: President Morrell?

330
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:28,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

331
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:35,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Or in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

332
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,412
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-282 offered by President Morrell.

333
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I read from the chair unless there's any objections?

334
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:55,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas, as a condition of the MBTA multifamily zoning requirement passed as part of the 2021 economic bond bill, the draft guidance released by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development must be discussed at a meeting of the Medford City Council before May 2, 2022.

335
00:28:57,247 --> 00:29:17,955
[SPEAKER_15]: And whereas the public comment period of the MBTA multi-family zoning requirement is open until March 31, 2022, be it so resolved that the Metro City Council invite Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, to present MBTA draft guidance on Section 3A of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40A, as required by the Department of Housing and Community Development.

336
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:23,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless there's any discussion by the Council, should we go to Director Hunt?

337
00:29:24,526 --> 00:29:34,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe that this was raised Madam President some 2436 months ago with the question was asked to the city solicitors to whether or not the city's in compliance with the Municipal Monetization Act and these provisions that you speak of.

338
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,791
[SPEAKER_07]: To date, we have not received response from the administration.

339
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:44,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like to highlight the fact that our ability to conduct business is hampered when we are not provided with the tools and toolbox necessary to do such.

340
00:29:45,192 --> 00:29:53,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we are some period of time later, now addressing an issue that we could have put to bed a very long time ago had we been provided with the support necessary for us to conduct our business.

341
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:02,847
[SPEAKER_07]: As we look at the work that we've done this evening, when we have someone in our corner that's willing to provide us with the legal advice that we need, we are able to put out a very good work product.

342
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:05,650
[SPEAKER_07]: When we don't have that, here we are.

343
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Before May 2nd, we have to do something.

344
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:12,165
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been waiting since the Municipal Modernization Act passed for an answer as to whether or not we're in compliance.

345
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:13,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd just like to point that out.

346
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:23,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And once again, reiterate my priority for the budget for this year to have an assistant city solicitor dedicated to the Memphis City Council.

347
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:24,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

348
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:27,356
[SPEAKER_15]: I did err in not referencing your previous paper in this request.

349
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:31,939
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank you for bringing this up many months ago, and hopefully Director Hunt can provide us some information.

350
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:36,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Morrell, I have a presentation to share with you.

351
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:46,216
[SPEAKER_20]: Part of the answer to this is actually the city has been waiting for the guidelines from the state to tell us whether or not we are in compliance.

352
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:47,436
[SPEAKER_20]: We needed the guidelines.

353
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:50,357
[SPEAKER_20]: Draft guidelines were released in January.

354
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:53,218
[SPEAKER_20]: The draft guidelines were not clear.

355
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,879
[SPEAKER_20]: They are open for comments, and that's part of my presentation this evening.

356
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,120
[SPEAKER_20]: If I have permission on the Zoom, I could share the slides if that's

357
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:03,335
[SPEAKER_20]: the easiest way to do it.

358
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:08,617
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can explain what we are looking for clarity on.

359
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:14,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, could you allow Director Hunt to share?

360
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Mr. Mulkey on the call as well?

361
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:19,362
[SPEAKER_06]: With the zoning issue?

362
00:31:19,482 --> 00:31:22,183
[SPEAKER_20]: I do not see him.

363
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,664
[SPEAKER_20]: I do not believe that he is on it.

364
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,087
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that is being addressed by the planning directors and in meetings with the

365
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:32,614
[SPEAKER_20]: the state.

366
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:43,214
[SPEAKER_20]: So good evening, councilors, thank you for your time.

367
00:31:43,354 --> 00:31:49,479
[SPEAKER_20]: I will try to be as brief as possible, but with as much information as we're able to provide at this time.

368
00:31:50,540 --> 00:32:06,032
[SPEAKER_20]: I have the formal bill language, the draft guidance that was issued in January by the state, the timeline for when we expect to have final guidance and what the state is asking for us, the implications for the city, and then if there are any questions and comments.

369
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:13,701
[SPEAKER_20]: This page and the next slide are in fact the full text of the law.

370
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you like me to read this out?

371
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,762
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's very hard to see.

372
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:27,507
[SPEAKER_20]: This is available and I'll provide these slides to all of you as well.

373
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:30,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Oops, sorry.

374
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,450
[SPEAKER_20]: And then so a quick summary of it is that this bill amended chapter 48.

375
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:41,053
[SPEAKER_20]: to include multifamily zoning requirement for MBTA communities.

376
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,234
[SPEAKER_20]: It applies to 175 MBTA communities.

377
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:55,579
[SPEAKER_20]: And the goal of the legislation is to encourage multifamily housing production by requiring municipalities to have zoning districts where multifamily housing is allowed as of right.

378
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:04,662
[SPEAKER_20]: The actual production of the housing depends on many factors and production is not required under the law, just zoning as of right.

379
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:19,218
[SPEAKER_20]: The draft guidelines that have come out state that we must actually the law states that we must be in compliance in order to be remain eligible for a variety of different grant programs from the state.

380
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,739
[SPEAKER_20]: That's important.

381
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:27,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So multifamily, do we just do we know how much.

382
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:34,416
[SPEAKER_07]: with the dollar figure, the grant eligibility would be on the table that we lose access to.

383
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:38,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it $100 million worth of grant money, or is it $65,000 a grant?

384
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:46,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, there are about five to 10 different grant programs that are incorporated in this.

385
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:58,661
[SPEAKER_20]: The state named several in the law, and then the draft guidance actually included several more grant programs that you would need to be in compliance with to be eligible for.

386
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:13,237
[SPEAKER_20]: And many of these are economic development grants that do not have set rule set guidelines as to maximum amounts, but we've seen 10s of millions of dollars per community could come through these grant rounds so we think they're very valuable grants.

387
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,340
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been receiving them in the past.

388
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:21,626
[SPEAKER_20]: Over the past 10 years, yes, I didn't get a complete summary but yes the city has done several of them.

389
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:38,757
[SPEAKER_20]: So under the law, the multifamily housing has to be permitted as right, no age restrictions, and the housing has to be suitable for children, minimum gross density of 15 units per acre, and no more than a half mile from a subway or bus station.

390
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:49,600
[SPEAKER_20]: All of this is in the law, all of this is straightforward, and our staff believe that under these specific guidelines, we're in compliance as are many, many communities.

391
00:34:51,318 --> 00:35:02,884
[SPEAKER_20]: The draft guidance then goes on to issue a test to determine what reasonable size is and what the minimum multi-unit family capacity is.

392
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:11,528
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are items that are not in the law, the language of it, but are in the guidelines that we have received from DHCD.

393
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:17,651
[SPEAKER_20]: The minimum land area must be a zone that's at least 50 acres in size.

394
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:19,918
[SPEAKER_20]: within a half mile of the acre.

395
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:26,104
[SPEAKER_20]: The minimum multifamily unit capacity is determined by the number of units.

396
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:30,788
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is where I could put the chart in.

397
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:39,575
[SPEAKER_20]: If you are a subway community, rapid transit is a different number than if you are a bus or if you're an adjacent community.

398
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:42,337
[SPEAKER_20]: For the subway units, it's 25% of your current

399
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:47,583
[SPEAKER_20]: units in your community.

400
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:59,328
[SPEAKER_20]: And they actually have provided us with a chart because many of the planning directors said, wait, you want us to produce 25% of our current number of units within a half mile of the T station?

401
00:35:59,888 --> 00:36:05,271
[SPEAKER_20]: And so they've provided a chart and that number from Medford would be 6,442 units.

402
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:08,812
[SPEAKER_20]: And that honestly, that didn't make sense.

403
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:14,735
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, would be allowed as of right within a half mile of the T under the draft guidance.

404
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:21,094
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've been talking with other planning directors, and we have been talking with staff from the state.

405
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:32,142
[SPEAKER_20]: And we basically said, I've talked with Chelsea's planning director in Cambridge and Somerville and we've all said we either don't understand this, or it's unreasonable, because this doesn't make sense.

406
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:37,967
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have been encouraged to submit comments to the state by the comment period.

407
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:41,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Because 15 units per acre, not a problem.

408
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,889
[SPEAKER_20]: We're probably in compliance with that number.

409
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:50,853
[SPEAKER_20]: But this number seemed to be more than anybody could really rationalize.

410
00:36:51,293 --> 00:37:00,677
[SPEAKER_20]: So anyhow, that is part of the sticking point and why I've been reluctant to come forward without having further conversation with the state before discussing it, because that's just stunning.

411
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,260
[SPEAKER_20]: So we asked then, okay, how do we calculate

412
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,633
[SPEAKER_20]: this gross density because they also talked about the minimum 15 units.

413
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:20,619
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we determine, many of you are now very familiar with zoning, and you'll see that we don't have anything in our zoning that talks about units per acre.

414
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,702
[SPEAKER_20]: We talk about heights, we talk about setbacks, we talk about lot coverage.

415
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:29,105
[SPEAKER_20]: So we said to the state, how do we determine what are the guidelines?

416
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:31,627
[SPEAKER_20]: And they said, oh, we have to create those guidelines.

417
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,588
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't exist yet.

418
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:36,792
[SPEAKER_20]: I asked very specifically, do we look at a current parcel sizes?

419
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:41,615
[SPEAKER_20]: And do we look at setbacks from parcel lines and lot coverage?

420
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:44,478
[SPEAKER_20]: And they said, please ask that in the open comment period.

421
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:56,078
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you ask me if we're currently in compliance, I'll tell you, it doesn't sound like it, and I don't think so, but there is no way to know until the state issues the final guidance.

422
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:10,292
[SPEAKER_20]: So the other thing, the one piece that is good is that they said they intend to create a tool that we could then apply to our zoning to tell us whether or not we're in compliance so that it would be standardized, but the tool doesn't exist yet.

423
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:14,273
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's a part where we have a lot of concerns.

424
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:17,935
[SPEAKER_20]: The next piece is determining suitability for families with children.

425
00:38:18,655 --> 00:38:20,396
[SPEAKER_20]: That units cannot be age restricted.

426
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:30,940
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we have no problem whatsoever with that in Medford, but they also have started to say that under the draft guidance, you cannot limit the number of occupants per unit.

427
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,783
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is something that I know that has been very significantly discussed by this council and by our planning board.

428
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,606
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is also something that we'll be putting comment in on.

429
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:49,853
[SPEAKER_20]: They did say that districts do not have to be contiguous and that they don't all have to fall within a half mile of the transit station.

430
00:38:50,273 --> 00:38:57,799
[SPEAKER_20]: So that sounded hopeful that you could have some of your density within a half mile, but not all of it, but there's no guidelines as to what does that mean?

431
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:58,700
[SPEAKER_20]: What is not all?

432
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:07,027
[SPEAKER_20]: And then they will be developing compliance or criteria to determine if you're compliant with the law, but they have not yet provided us with that.

433
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,212
[SPEAKER_20]: So we ask for a timeline.

434
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:14,414
[SPEAKER_20]: March 31st is the deadline for public comments.

435
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:16,995
[SPEAKER_20]: We are preparing public, we are preparing comments.

436
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:20,136
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be happy to take comments from the council as well.

437
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:26,759
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm also happy to provide you an email afterwards with the information on how to submit your own comments directly.

438
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,743
[SPEAKER_20]: By May 2nd, we have to submit a form to the state with some information about our current zoning.

439
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:49,854
[SPEAKER_20]: And on that form it, we need to give the date and the minutes that we attended a public meeting and that we presented this so this meeting right now is our compliance, such that for this coming year we are now in compliance with the state guidelines.

440
00:39:50,927 --> 00:40:05,977
[SPEAKER_20]: This summer is when they said they'll be releasing the final guidelines and that by December, they would like an action plan from us that does not have to include exactly the zoning we're gonna pass, but rather what our process is for passing the zoning.

441
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:11,000
[SPEAKER_20]: July, 2023, they'll tell us if they have approved our action plan.

442
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:17,845
[SPEAKER_20]: And by December, 2023, they will ask that we have adopted zoning to bring us into compliance.

443
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:26,030
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll need to do, that's the next real deadline with action in order to stay in compliance with this new law.

444
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Question?

445
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:33,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they saying we have to change our zoning?

446
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:37,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are they saying if we don't change our zoning, you don't have access to these grant funds?

447
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, they're saying if you don't change your zoning, you won't have access to the grant.

448
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:43,723
[SPEAKER_07]: In essence, we don't have to do anything.

449
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:44,844
[SPEAKER_20]: That is correct.

450
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:54,966
[SPEAKER_20]: There, there are communities that are actually discussing that whether it is better to lose access to these grant funds, then to come into compliance.

451
00:40:55,186 --> 00:41:01,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what I'm what's the trade off how much money we get from these grants if we're not getting any money from the grants is it really worth creating 6500 units.

452
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:09,697
[SPEAKER_20]: We had looked at some of that, and really what we could tell you is sort of about the different grant programs.

453
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:21,863
[SPEAKER_20]: My inclination would be to not get into that right now, that we want to submit comments about our concerns, because the law as written is a perfectly reasonable law.

454
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:26,425
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the guidelines that we have significant concerns with.

455
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:31,208
[SPEAKER_20]: So my inclination is to submit comments

456
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:35,043
[SPEAKER_20]: and then to see what the guidelines are that come out over the summer.

457
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:47,710
[SPEAKER_20]: And at that time to make a decision whether the final version, because I will tell you that I do have not yet spoken to a planning director in Massachusetts who feels comfortable with these guidelines as they have come out.

458
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,692
[SPEAKER_20]: Not to mention the fact that they're not specific enough.

459
00:41:51,953 --> 00:41:54,374
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know exactly what we're measuring and how.

460
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:57,876
[SPEAKER_20]: So once we see the guidelines, that is an option.

461
00:41:58,176 --> 00:41:59,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Kerrio, I don't know.

462
00:41:59,597 --> 00:41:59,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry.

463
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:15,375
[SPEAKER_22]: Alicia I'm so I'm half a mile from the subway, but pretty much regulators to the voluntary correct unless the train station in West Metro falls into that or the new train station up at Tufts.

464
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:16,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for asking that.

465
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:21,423
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually, we actually had some of our GIS staff put a map.

466
00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:26,044
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is a map of our zoning that's got color on it for the different zones.

467
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:30,345
[SPEAKER_20]: And then those circles are the half miles.

468
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:35,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I, yeah, you know what, that is an excellent- My glasses aren't that strong enough.

469
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:36,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me see.

470
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:39,547
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, I am using this lovely view.

471
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:41,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually.

472
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:45,276
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.

473
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:49,759
[SPEAKER_18]: So sorry, I apologize.

474
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:55,063
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you go back to so where would the purple circle be?

475
00:42:55,543 --> 00:43:08,012
[SPEAKER_20]: So the purple circle that is the West Medford train station that qualifies into that that that qualifies and I will tell you that most of the housing around there is single family one and general residential.

476
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:08,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

477
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:17,417
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't straight up asked whether the Green Line stations will count, but frankly, they're supposed to open this summer.

478
00:43:18,058 --> 00:43:21,463
[SPEAKER_20]: So we absolutely assume, why wouldn't they count?

479
00:43:21,543 --> 00:43:24,267
[SPEAKER_20]: They will be open train stations at that point.

480
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:28,643
[SPEAKER_20]: And so looking at those areas- That's a pretty dense area.

481
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:34,844
[SPEAKER_20]: It is relatively dense, but interestingly enough, a lot of the zoning is single family, two in general residential.

482
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:41,906
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we have there now is stuff that is nonconforming, that is a higher density.

483
00:43:42,846 --> 00:43:51,568
[SPEAKER_20]: The Wellington train station area is actually an interesting area to look at because there is stations landing, for example, is in there already.

484
00:43:52,708 --> 00:44:07,418
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are other areas that housing is not allowed as of right multifamily, but honestly we should really consider it because there is a lot of multifamily housing in that area already in this room we have we have there's some room up there, there is absolutely room.

485
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:12,702
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's there, I mean there's potential here but the part of the question is the deep in the details.

486
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:20,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it have to be within a half a mile from a train station located in your community or just the train station?

487
00:44:21,545 --> 00:44:28,708
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you are a community that has one of these in your community, then yes.

488
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:37,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, we haven't, that's actually because if you're getting at the Oak Grove stations and stuff, what I'm saying is, I mean, say it's 6,500 units, right.

489
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:40,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's more than half a mile of a station, right?

490
00:44:40,785 --> 00:44:46,470
[SPEAKER_07]: The only circles that we have, but we have Winchester station, you have Oak Grove station, you have ball square station.

491
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:52,755
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be able to take those 6,500 units instead of slapping them right in Wellington circle, which is probably where they're going to end up going.

492
00:44:53,396 --> 00:44:54,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, be able to spread them around.

493
00:44:55,110 --> 00:45:00,333
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is something that we'll make a note of and ask for specific clarification of.

494
00:45:00,874 --> 00:45:12,961
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that Cambridge was specifically saying to us that if they could spread the number of units they're being asked to allow as of right across all of the train stations in Cambridge, it's not so onerous.

495
00:45:13,762 --> 00:45:22,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think the idea is that most of these stations like the Greenland, for example, isn't, it's not Memphis train, it's a regional, it's for the region, right?

496
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:24,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So why should Memphis bear the brunt of all the housing?

497
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:26,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Why shouldn't the region?

498
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:36,152
[SPEAKER_07]: If the train station is there for transportation needs for the region, and we're trying to meet housing needs for the region, then why shouldn't our regional partners that utilize this service that we have also feel some of the impact?

499
00:45:36,598 --> 00:45:37,179
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

500
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:45,427
[SPEAKER_20]: So all of, and I will say Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, Winchester all have stations so they're all subject to this 25% number.

501
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:51,773
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have buses and some of the further out because there are 175 communities, they have lower percentages 15% and 10% for the

502
00:45:53,882 --> 00:45:56,464
[SPEAKER_20]: for the less than further out communities.

503
00:45:57,304 --> 00:46:01,967
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is one of the questions of clarity that we'll be asking, and how do we distribute this?

504
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:07,811
[SPEAKER_20]: And honestly, this 6,500 units as of right is a little surprising.

505
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:09,292
[SPEAKER_20]: Like it's high.

506
00:46:09,492 --> 00:46:17,917
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm all for housing and I'm all for, you know, but that's not just a little, that's really changing the nature of the community.

507
00:46:18,698 --> 00:46:20,179
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes.

508
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President.

509
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:25,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

510
00:46:26,562 --> 00:46:30,936
[SPEAKER_09]: The 6500 would include current units within the radii.

511
00:46:32,235 --> 00:46:54,166
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the other clarity that we're asking for that it's not whether it's new units or units units allowed as of right and the one thing that we did ask them we said to them, none of us have big open spaces that are undeveloped, and they said no we expect that it would involve you allowing them so that if somebody were to buy these properties, they could then develop this density of units would

512
00:46:54,746 --> 00:47:05,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure if you haven't gotten there yet, that's fine, but would say triple deckers versus two families meet the per acre requirement instead of moving to five, six, seven story buildings.

513
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:09,744
[SPEAKER_20]: If you were looking at 15 units per acre.

514
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:12,505
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the triple deckers and stuff that they would.

515
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:12,605
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

516
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:25,931
[SPEAKER_20]: If we're looking at 30 and 40 units 50 units per acre and it sort of depends how big is it a 50 acre zone, or are we able to spread it across all of this it's a lot more acres.

517
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:29,612
[SPEAKER_20]: then maybe we're talking 20 units per acre, 30.

518
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:35,015
[SPEAKER_20]: And honestly, these are not numbers that planners usually use to look at.

519
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:38,276
[SPEAKER_20]: We looked at floor area ratios and heights and setbacks.

520
00:47:38,877 --> 00:47:41,938
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're all trying to get our heads around, what does this mean?

521
00:47:42,038 --> 00:47:46,580
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a measurement that you usually use to describe zoning.

522
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, because I would think that would be a good tool in our toolbox.

523
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:57,203
[SPEAKER_09]: compared to say knocking down a bunch of two families and building an eight story, whatever, or whatever that would look like.

524
00:47:59,986 --> 00:48:03,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Third question, just looking at Wellington, there's a lot of water in that half mile.

525
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:07,857
[SPEAKER_09]: How would that affect this minimum land area calculation?

526
00:48:08,335 --> 00:48:11,276
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's a good question, and one that we're submitting.

527
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:23,002
[SPEAKER_20]: In the form that we have to fill out, it asks us to, it talks about what are the acreage within a half mile of your train station that is non-buildable, and they say specifically such as water.

528
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:33,467
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we know we have to provide them back with that information in May, but we don't actually know how they're gonna take it into account because it's not explained in their guidelines.

529
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:34,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

530
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:37,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And just the ball square station is technically in Medford, right?

531
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:38,915
[SPEAKER_20]: It is actually, yes.

532
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:40,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

533
00:48:41,757 --> 00:48:45,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And then just, you know, I know it's right there on the corner of a corner, but you know.

534
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

535
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:50,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

536
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:50,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll leave it at that.

537
00:48:50,743 --> 00:48:55,846
[SPEAKER_09]: But just to say that this whole, this did not go through the legislative process.

538
00:48:55,926 --> 00:49:03,431
[SPEAKER_09]: If anyone was following it when this passed at the end of 2020, this was snuck in at the end of December with a bunch of other stuff that

539
00:49:04,627 --> 00:49:12,336
[SPEAKER_09]: a year before one representative was able to stop because they tried to pass an informal session and someone stood up and said, well, hold on a minute.

540
00:49:12,456 --> 00:49:18,222
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to do this, you need to give us these tools that allow us to protect people who are here and avoid displacement.

541
00:49:18,262 --> 00:49:19,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And that never happened.

542
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:21,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And the negotiations were never filled.

543
00:49:21,786 --> 00:49:24,309
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I think we're suffering from that.

544
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,630
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like DHCD

545
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:30,488
[SPEAKER_09]: is, you know, this was Governor Baker's proposal, it's Governor Baker's housing department.

546
00:49:31,128 --> 00:49:33,849
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's really pushing the envelope here, it seems to me.

547
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:39,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm frustrated with this, as I was frustrated when they passed this 15 months ago.

548
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:40,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

549
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:49,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Alicia, with the air rights that wanted to be included in this, we could certainly use we would, we don't see why we wouldn't be able to include that.

550
00:49:50,574 --> 00:50:02,783
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will say that we don't know, so we're not being told we have to build the housing, we don't have to design the housing, we just have to allow it to be built as of right.

551
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:05,805
[SPEAKER_20]: So what exactly does that mean?

552
00:50:05,865 --> 00:50:08,447
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I said, I'm still trying to figure that out.

553
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:11,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

554
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

555
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:18,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia, thank you so much for this very helpful

556
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,981
[SPEAKER_03]: thorough presentation.

557
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I have just two clarifying questions to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.

558
00:50:24,684 --> 00:50:41,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at this map, to become eligible for these grants, we would need to create zoning that would allow within each of these circles for say 6,400 units of single family housing to be built within each circle.

559
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:43,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that my understanding?

560
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:46,589
[SPEAKER_20]: That was our original read of the draft guidelines.

561
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:56,778
[SPEAKER_20]: When we asked DHCD staff that specifically last week, they said, no, it could be spread further out.

562
00:50:57,018 --> 00:51:00,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Portions of it had to be within a half mile of your train stations.

563
00:51:01,802 --> 00:51:10,628
[SPEAKER_20]: And because I looked at them and I said, 6,500 units within a half mile of the train station, that's a lot.

564
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,950
[SPEAKER_20]: And she's like, oh, no, no, no, you wouldn't have to do that.

565
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:13,911
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be spread out.

566
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:17,333
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said, that's not how we're reading your draft guidelines.

567
00:51:17,914 --> 00:51:21,356
[SPEAKER_20]: And her response was, please submit a comment stating that.

568
00:51:22,077 --> 00:51:23,718
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will be writing that one up.

569
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

570
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gets at my second question, which is, you know, we have these radii here, but you also said the districts don't have to be contiguous.

571
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:45,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds as though that gets us the confusion that you just mentioned, which is it's not necessarily clear that all of that as of right housing has to be encompassed within that circle, but maybe start there.

572
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, of course, that's something I'd also

573
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:50,482
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's part of what it exists, right?

574
00:51:50,603 --> 00:51:52,726
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's part of what we're trying to understand.

575
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:56,693
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're trying to ask them where we are asking them for clarity on that.

576
00:51:57,287 --> 00:52:11,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, they have sort they have indicated that and I think in the guidelines, it does say that it has to be partially within and it's but it's not completely clear how much within and then how far do you go?

577
00:52:11,154 --> 00:52:21,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Because, for example, if you allowed as of right development throughout our entire community, um, that doesn't now this number is not sounding crazy.

578
00:52:21,279 --> 00:52:21,319
[SPEAKER_20]: Um,

579
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,232
[SPEAKER_20]: not to say that it is crazy, but it is.

580
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:29,094
[SPEAKER_20]: But that, what does that look like?

581
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:30,435
[SPEAKER_20]: And then how do you measure that?

582
00:52:31,176 --> 00:52:39,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if you asked us how much housing is allowed as of right, right now in the city of Medford, that's not a number that we know or even how we would calculate that.

583
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:46,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Because then we would say, well, do we respect all the parcel lines and ownership lines of current parcels?

584
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:50,149
[SPEAKER_20]: do we incorporate setbacks?

585
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,850
[SPEAKER_20]: How would you actually calculate that right now?

586
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,032
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we're waiting for that guidelines to understand.

587
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:57,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

588
00:52:57,232 --> 00:52:57,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

589
00:52:57,492 --> 00:52:58,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate that.

590
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia, if I could ask just a few questions.

591
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:05,517
[SPEAKER_15]: So forgive me, is there any affordability reference in this?

592
00:53:05,677 --> 00:53:14,221
[SPEAKER_15]: So in theory, I think to Vice President Behr's point, this legislation, essentially, someone could buy up, a developer could buy up entire neighborhoods of two and three families.

593
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:15,902
[SPEAKER_15]: They all get kicked out.

594
00:53:16,942 --> 00:53:22,265
[SPEAKER_15]: or they sell a property and now we have hyper dense luxury housing in place in theory?

595
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:32,410
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do believe and it is something that we should state request clarity that anybody who has inclusionary housing requirements would still apply.

596
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,711
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no reason there is nothing in here.

597
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:40,954
[SPEAKER_20]: And they have stated verbally that yes, your inclusionary housing guidelines and ordinances would still apply.

598
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:42,575
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't negating those.

599
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:49,910
[SPEAKER_20]: So you would look at those numbers for Medford, but this is not requiring that any of it be affordable.

600
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:56,772
[SPEAKER_20]: And actually for communities that don't have inclusionary housing, it does not require that any affordable housing get built at all.

601
00:53:57,232 --> 00:54:11,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think I share a number of my counselor's concerns and just also the vice president there is, I mean, this may, you know, if this were to go through, we were to opt in, do exactly the opposite of what it's intended to displace more residents and have city of luxury housing.

602
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

603
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:22,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any or could there be a comment on the fact that they're dangling this grant money?

604
00:54:22,815 --> 00:54:28,858
[SPEAKER_15]: If a city were to opt in, do they have to opt in at first bite or could they wait and see what this money actually is?

605
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:32,900
[SPEAKER_15]: And in two years, say we want to opt into this program, perhaps we may have figured out what it is.

606
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,062
[SPEAKER_20]: It's our understanding that you need to do it to be in compliance.

607
00:54:37,618 --> 00:54:43,481
[SPEAKER_20]: Therefore, at any time, a community could come into compliance with a regulation.

608
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:56,149
[SPEAKER_20]: I do agree that that might be something we should ask for further clarity on, and we will, frankly, because of the basis of being at this meeting tonight, we will be in compliance, because we will submit that form by May 2nd.

609
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Therefore, we are in compliance through December of 2023 right now.

610
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:01,572
[SPEAKER_20]: The question then is,

611
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:06,811
[SPEAKER_20]: past that point.

612
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:13,433
[SPEAKER_20]: So we actually do as a city have plenty of time to then look at the rules as they come out, look at the programs.

613
00:55:13,553 --> 00:55:17,514
[SPEAKER_20]: I will tell you that it is our intention this year to apply to some of those grant programs.

614
00:55:18,394 --> 00:55:21,375
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some of you may have heard of the one-stop grant program.

615
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,336
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all encompassing, that is part of this.

616
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:28,157
[SPEAKER_20]: And we actually have submitted letters of interest to that program this year.

617
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:32,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Further discussion, Council Member Knight?

618
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:42,723
[SPEAKER_08]: have the city's ability to apply for grants would also impact the Housing Authority's ability to apply for grants.

619
00:55:44,104 --> 00:55:49,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Off the top of my head I do not know if these are grant programs that they could apply to.

620
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:51,791
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't looked at that.

621
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:59,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Tufts University's property would be taken into consideration, right, at all for the density calculation.

622
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:07,513
[SPEAKER_20]: They do ask us on that form about institutional ownership of property within the circle, because it is actually an interesting question.

623
00:56:08,013 --> 00:56:11,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Tufts University is currently zoned a department two.

624
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:15,319
[SPEAKER_20]: The difference is it has to be suitable for multifamily.

625
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,645
[SPEAKER_20]: And if they build housing, as a rule, it's dormitory, it's age restricted.

626
00:56:22,795 --> 00:56:35,088
[SPEAKER_20]: So as much as we would love to see more dorms, take students out of the apartments in Medford and free up housing for families, it is our understanding that that would not comply, would not count.

627
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

628
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:44,137
[SPEAKER_22]: Alicia, if the state were to accept one of the grants, what are we on the hook for?

629
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:49,486
[SPEAKER_22]: What does that, what do we have to do after we took the money?

630
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:56,231
[SPEAKER_20]: In terms of then, do we have to, it is my understanding, and I would want to sort of check the rules.

631
00:56:56,311 --> 00:57:02,216
[SPEAKER_20]: And so to be clear, the state law of the past is the only thing that's legally in effect.

632
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:04,778
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the guidelines now, and those are subject to change.

633
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:12,123
[SPEAKER_20]: It implies that if we were to get a grant now, you have to be in compliance to receive the grant.

634
00:57:12,524 --> 00:57:14,205
[SPEAKER_20]: But once you've been given the grant,

635
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,957
[SPEAKER_20]: then one would assume you don't have to stay in compliance.

636
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,259
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we had a grant that went through 2024.

637
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,843
[SPEAKER_22]: What would we use the grant for?

638
00:57:26,364 --> 00:57:29,567
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking at you because a lot of the grants are economic development grants.

639
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:31,508
[SPEAKER_20]: So some of the things, are you able to speak to that?

640
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:35,592
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is Victor Schrader, our economic development director.

641
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:37,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, 55 Cedar Street.

642
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:44,549
[SPEAKER_16]: The MassWorks grant program is mostly for infrastructure pre-development.

643
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:49,412
[SPEAKER_16]: I think at one time Medford considered MassWorks for the Governor's Ave garage.

644
00:57:50,532 --> 00:57:53,494
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's one of the grant programs.

645
00:57:54,114 --> 00:58:01,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the others are for transportation planning, economic development studies, planning exercises.

646
00:58:02,118 --> 00:58:08,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's actually what we've submitted through the One Stop program for this year is some funding for planning.

647
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,571
[SPEAKER_16]: economic development related planning.

648
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:17,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

649
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:18,393
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a few slides left.

650
00:58:18,613 --> 00:58:27,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, that was actually the last slide was the the map there and there was just I think that was truly it.

651
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:29,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

652
00:58:29,578 --> 00:58:30,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Further discussion on the council.

653
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:34,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Members of the public would like to speak.

654
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:47,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to thank Director Hunt for coming before us and explaining all of this.

655
00:58:47,271 --> 00:58:51,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you said, if you could follow up with these slides and how to submit comments, I think that'd be really appreciated.

656
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:52,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you again.

657
00:59:07,987 --> 00:59:11,610
[SPEAKER_20]: to stay in compliance, to submit public comments, to hear your concerns.

658
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:21,838
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it's my expectation that we'll discuss this again once the final guidelines are out and we understand what this really, really means for the city.

659
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,180
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you very much for your time this evening.

660
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:24,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Alicia.

661
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Will the council receive a copy of the MBTA information form that's submitted?

662
00:59:30,464 --> 00:59:32,826
[SPEAKER_20]: We're happy to provide you with a copy of that.

663
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:36,913
[SPEAKER_20]: we'll figure out how we should save a copy of it.

664
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:44,538
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an online form, so I'm not sure if it'll be in screenshots or what, but we do have a PDF copy to review the questions.

665
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:46,339
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, we'll work on that.

666
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,180
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

667
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file.

668
00:59:49,142 --> 00:59:49,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

669
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:53,545
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by President Behrs to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

670
00:59:53,585 --> 00:59:54,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

671
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:01,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Behrs.

672
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:02,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

673
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:03,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Kerrio.

674
01:00:04,213 --> 01:00:04,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

675
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:05,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

676
01:00:05,656 --> 01:00:05,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

677
01:00:06,357 --> 01:00:06,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

678
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,338
[SPEAKER_15]: President Morrell.

679
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

680
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,740
[SPEAKER_15]: 22 dash 283 offered by Councilor Knight.

681
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:31,027
[SPEAKER_15]: He is so resolved that the Metro City Council request an update from the city administration and Tufts University relative to the March 15 2022 chemical laboratory evacuation at 62 Talbot Street.

682
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:32,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, thank you very much.

683
01:00:32,788 --> 01:00:39,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I just last Tuesday, there was a chemical spill, I believe, or an evacuation of the chemical laboratory at 62 Talbot Street.

684
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:40,932
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about all the information.

685
01:00:41,328 --> 01:00:43,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been able to find out about this.

686
01:00:43,310 --> 01:01:02,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that it was an event that was handled appropriately by our first responders and by our friends at Tufts University, but it's nice for us to know exactly what happened, what went on, to be sure that we can provide a sense of relief to those that live in the neighborhood who are asking questions and have concerns about what they live next to and what risks they may pose to them.

687
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:10,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I'd ask the administration to respond to this, and Tufts University to respond to this request in a timely manner, and ask my council colleagues to support the measure.

688
01:01:11,652 --> 01:01:19,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the discussion on the motion of Council night seconded by bears.

689
01:01:19,918 --> 01:01:23,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President bears.

690
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

691
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,823
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a Caribbean.

692
01:01:28,924 --> 01:01:29,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Council calls.

693
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:30,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

694
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Council night.

695
01:01:31,345 --> 01:01:31,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

696
01:01:31,966 --> 01:01:32,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

697
01:01:32,806 --> 01:01:33,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

698
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:34,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor saying, Yes.

699
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:41,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

700
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:43,321
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-284 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

701
01:01:44,862 --> 01:01:46,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

702
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:50,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving forward to 22-285 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

703
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:54,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it so resolved that Councilor Carvalho update the council on the library foundation and the library.

704
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Carvalho.

705
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:57,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Madam President.

706
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:58,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Barbara Kerr on the call?

707
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:00,207
[SPEAKER_15]: I did see her earlier.

708
01:02:00,227 --> 01:02:01,008
[SPEAKER_22]: Is she still there?

709
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:01,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me know she's there.

710
01:02:03,082 --> 01:02:11,108
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to give a little brief report as the library, as the foundation, the fundraising end is pretty much coming to the end.

711
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:15,591
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to give a little report of how much has been collected up to date.

712
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:21,775
[SPEAKER_22]: So, so far in total donations, we've collected, I mean, we've raised $5,846,846.11 in donations.

713
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:22,175
[SPEAKER_22]: We've had,

714
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:40,770
[SPEAKER_22]: $324,000 in in-kind donations, both from East Cambridge Savings and the Cummings Properties.

715
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:56,038
[SPEAKER_22]: So in total, the foundation up to today has raised $6,170,011, of which 3.5 million has already gone to the city toward the construction costs.

716
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:58,640
[SPEAKER_22]: And anyone who's had a chance to go by there has seen

717
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,140
[SPEAKER_22]: the great work that's been done in there.

718
01:03:01,761 --> 01:03:11,003
[SPEAKER_22]: And at our meeting last week, Barbara said close to 10,000 people have gone into that library since it's open, and that's short of time.

719
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:12,623
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanna thank everybody.

720
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:13,244
[SPEAKER_14]: More than that.

721
01:03:14,364 --> 01:03:14,844
[SPEAKER_22]: More than that.

722
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,385
[SPEAKER_19]: More than that.

723
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:25,491
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to thank all the benefactors that the community that, you know, they have reached out with the donations.

724
01:03:25,611 --> 01:03:35,237
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, we are still, you know, collecting things, but we are sort of, you know, it's going to be winding down at some point, but just wanted to give everybody a little, sorry.

725
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:40,741
[SPEAKER_22]: And I invited Barbara to just give everybody a little update of what's happening inside the building.

726
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:49,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, I'm Barbara Kerr, 35 Baker Place in Newton.

727
01:03:49,903 --> 01:03:50,923
[SPEAKER_21]: We're doing really well.

728
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:56,366
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, as you know, it's been kind of chaotic for, oh, good heavens, I'm on a screen.

729
01:03:57,246 --> 01:03:57,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

730
01:03:57,907 --> 01:04:04,590
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been very chaotic, but this last week was the first time I felt like we had actually finally moved in.

731
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:09,652
[SPEAKER_21]: We did have some shelving shortages, but most of it came last month.

732
01:04:09,872 --> 01:04:14,414
[SPEAKER_21]: And as of today, the public areas are pretty much up and running.

733
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:17,577
[SPEAKER_21]: bigger the way we're supposed to be.

734
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:20,219
[SPEAKER_21]: And it wasn't 10,000 people.

735
01:04:20,259 --> 01:04:21,921
[SPEAKER_21]: We've had a lot more than 10,000 people.

736
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:30,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Our circulation in February was 9,000 items above what the circulation was in November at Boston Avenue.

737
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:40,235
[SPEAKER_21]: And I looked and it's 6,000 above the average month in FY19 when we were back in the old building.

738
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,277
[SPEAKER_21]: So it went up 4,000 items in

739
01:04:44,305 --> 01:04:52,147
[SPEAKER_21]: February, another five, no, 4,000 in January, another five in February, and we're still going.

740
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:57,669
[SPEAKER_21]: People are beginning to discover us, and the weather's nice, and the building is working the way it's supposed to.

741
01:04:57,869 --> 01:05:10,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Children and teen are crazy busy and scary, kind of, and the downstairs is quiet, and we had designed the place for all sorts of different kinds of seating and tables,

742
01:05:11,372 --> 01:05:15,374
[SPEAKER_21]: computer areas and people are using them the way we wanted them to.

743
01:05:15,774 --> 01:05:23,658
[SPEAKER_21]: And this month we've started a pretty full schedule of programs and we have more than one program room now.

744
01:05:23,758 --> 01:05:27,260
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can have five programs at the same time.

745
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,201
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's, it's going very well.

746
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:30,742
[SPEAKER_21]: It really is.

747
01:05:30,782 --> 01:05:41,027
[SPEAKER_21]: If you haven't been down since January, come down because now it's, it looks a lot better than it did when we had green bookcases and everything was all over the place, but it's really,

748
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:43,858
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm very pleased with where we are right now.

749
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:47,739
[SPEAKER_21]: So please come and see us if you haven't been down recently.

750
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:50,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Barbara.

751
01:05:51,141 --> 01:05:55,002
[SPEAKER_22]: For all the naysayers who said libraries are irrelevant, no one uses anymore.

752
01:05:55,602 --> 01:06:01,725
[SPEAKER_22]: This is pretty much a fact that people do use libraries and they are relevant.

753
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,205
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Barbara.

754
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, thank you.

755
01:06:04,286 --> 01:06:06,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Barbara.

756
01:06:06,287 --> 01:06:07,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

757
01:06:10,283 --> 01:06:15,668
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to receive in place on file second by Vice President bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

758
01:06:28,637 --> 01:06:29,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President bears.

759
01:06:29,558 --> 01:06:29,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

760
01:06:30,339 --> 01:06:30,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caribbean.

761
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:31,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

762
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

763
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:32,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

764
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:34,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor night.

765
01:06:34,902 --> 01:06:35,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

766
01:06:36,643 --> 01:06:38,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor saying, Yes.

767
01:06:39,592 --> 01:06:40,152
[SPEAKER_11]: President Morrell.

768
01:06:40,553 --> 01:06:42,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, certainly for zero negative motion passes.

769
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:54,781
[SPEAKER_15]: 22 dash 286 communications from the mayor, the honorable President members of the city council, your present morale and members of the members of the council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body

770
01:06:55,693 --> 01:07:02,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Confirm the appointment of Robert Delfano, a 46 team app to the license commission to a term to expire June 1st, 2028.

771
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:06,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert will be present via Zoom and a copy of Robert's resume and appointment letter are attached.

772
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

773
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:10,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Sincerely, Brianna Lindbergh, Mayor.

774
01:07:11,762 --> 01:07:19,207
[SPEAKER_15]: I do believe we have Mr. Delfano on the call and I don't know if any councilors have any discussion before we hear from him.

775
01:07:26,487 --> 01:07:27,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

776
01:07:27,468 --> 01:07:35,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Delafano, we already have your name and address, so if you could just share, get a brief synopsis of your resume and work in this area.

777
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:36,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, good evening.

778
01:07:38,456 --> 01:07:40,217
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Robert Delafano.

779
01:07:41,198 --> 01:07:44,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I reside at 46 Hume Avenue in Medford, Mass.

780
01:07:47,923 --> 01:07:52,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you speak to your resume a little bit with regards to this position?

781
01:07:53,427 --> 01:07:53,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.

782
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:54,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

783
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:58,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a little difficult time hearing you, Madam President, I'm sorry.

784
01:07:59,503 --> 01:08:07,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in regards to my resume, I recently retired from the fire department a couple of years ago, and

785
01:08:10,597 --> 01:08:13,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the department for 36 years.

786
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:21,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And prior to that, I worked for Charles Gilman and Son, which was a liquor wholesaler in actually Medford, Mass.

787
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:27,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a sales representative with the greater Boston area as my territory.

788
01:08:27,123 --> 01:08:33,665
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm familiar with a lot of the ABCC rules and regulations.

789
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:36,726
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that was quite a few years ago.

790
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:42,908
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel as though I'd be an asset to the, to the commission.

791
01:08:43,608 --> 01:08:44,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be able to help out.

792
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:49,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know one of the commissioners is retiring.

793
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:57,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had applied for the position from the council.

794
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:58,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

795
01:08:58,611 --> 01:09:03,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you number one for your service to the city of

796
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:09,350
[SPEAKER_07]: It's people like you that make the city go around.

797
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:12,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for putting your life on the line for the residents of this community.

798
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:17,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly as one member of this council don't have much of an opinion one way or the other.

799
01:09:18,097 --> 01:09:28,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Relative to Mr. Delano's appointment to this position I think that, you know, basis, he is a resume that would enable him to meet the basic criteria of the job and I think that he'd be able to do a good job at it.

800
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:30,725
[SPEAKER_07]: He has shown us through his

801
01:09:32,465 --> 01:09:35,087
[SPEAKER_07]: History is a firefighter that he knows how to serve the public.

802
01:09:36,187 --> 01:09:44,293
[SPEAKER_07]: My issue isn't necessarily with disappointment at all, Madam President, my issue is the fact that right now we're in the middle of state election cycle.

803
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:52,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have candidates that are in the process of trying to get their nomination papers certified, but we do not have a board of registrars.

804
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:56,002
[SPEAKER_07]: in our elections office to certify these papers.

805
01:09:56,663 --> 01:10:05,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So while I understand the importance of a liquor commissioner in this community, I don't think that that carries the same weight as a registrar of voters here in our community.

806
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:13,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the mayor needs to act on these appointments that are necessary for us to comply with state law so that we can conduct our state elections that are coming up.

807
01:10:13,554 --> 01:10:19,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the candidates that are participating in these state elections can have the opportunity to get their paperwork certified.

808
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:24,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, all three of our registrars have stepped down in the past 12 months.

809
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:27,302
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no registrars of voters.

810
01:10:29,004 --> 01:10:35,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have a look at commissions retiring as well as an appointment that's backfilling that and I'm going to support Mr. Dolfano when the time comes.

811
01:10:35,929 --> 01:10:38,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly have no problem with his application before us this evening.

812
01:10:39,773 --> 01:10:42,035
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I do have a problem filling appointments

813
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:53,582
[SPEAKER_07]: when we have a big void down in our elections office and we have a major state election coming up right now and we need a board of registrars down there.

814
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,145
[SPEAKER_07]: We have legislation pending

815
01:10:58,146 --> 01:11:10,456
[SPEAKER_07]: in the city solicitor's office that we've been waiting on from the administration now, and I'm sure Councilor Beas can talk a little bit more to that than I. We've met on it, we've had Committee of the Whole on it, something that we all support in establishing an Elections Commission.

816
01:11:11,037 --> 01:11:17,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are a couple items that I think are very important that should be taken precedent over some of these appointments that have come before us, Madam President.

817
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:21,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Belafonte, like I said, this has nothing to do about your appointment or your ability to do this job.

818
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:26,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It really has to do with the administration and the approach that they're taking in addressing some of these issues.

819
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:34,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, we're looking at a board of registrars that's been vacant now for how long, Mr. Clark, can you tell me how long, Mr. Lasky and Miss Murray.

820
01:11:36,285 --> 01:11:40,391
[SPEAKER_11]: The former chair, Miss Murray resigned on about.

821
01:11:42,274 --> 01:11:45,458
[SPEAKER_11]: the 11th but we didn't receive the resignation letter until October.

822
01:11:45,478 --> 01:11:47,801
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about the 11th of September.

823
01:11:49,123 --> 01:11:57,934
[SPEAKER_11]: We received Mr. Lasky's General Lasky's resignation on the day of the September preliminary election after the polls had opened in the Mr. Wade.

824
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:02,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Wade was was January because of illness and he's moving out of Medford.

825
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:11,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And the mayor has the mayor temporarily appointed Mark Crowley to take Mr. Lasky's General Lasky's unexpired term.

826
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:13,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, when was this appointment made temporarily?

827
01:12:14,107 --> 01:12:18,270
[SPEAKER_11]: That was made late October right before the November election.

828
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:23,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this temporary appointment allow us to comply with the Secretary of State's guidelines and standards?

829
01:12:23,314 --> 01:12:24,435
[SPEAKER_11]: That brings that well.

830
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:29,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Registrar Wade was still on the board of registrars at that point.

831
01:12:30,302 --> 01:12:33,743
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was a quorum which allowed the November election to be conducted.

832
01:12:35,103 --> 01:12:37,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there is no longer a quorum now that Mr. Wade has resigned.

833
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:40,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Crowley still serves as a temporary appointee.

834
01:12:40,825 --> 01:12:41,405
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.

835
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:42,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

836
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:45,866
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's actually the chair of the board.

837
01:12:46,547 --> 01:12:48,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Only one person on the board.

838
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still sitting ex-officio.

839
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:52,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President.

840
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:53,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

841
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:57,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I appreciate council night's points.

842
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:11,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, Mr. Delfano, my comments here are not reflective of your appointment, but I do think when an appointment, this was advertised as an urgent appointment, it was advertised as important.

843
01:13:13,064 --> 01:13:24,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see similar advertising for the board of registrars, first of all, but secondly, in general, I don't think that appointees should be coming here and justifying their own appointments to this council.

844
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:35,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that should be the process of the city of Medford and the mayor's administration to come before this council and present an appointee to answer questions on behalf of that appointee.

845
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,581
[SPEAKER_09]: and then allow the appointee to speak on their own behalf and answer questions as well.

846
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:41,701
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are a number of appointments.

847
01:13:42,021 --> 01:13:47,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think the process here on a number of appointments, both why are things sitting vacant so long?

848
01:13:48,462 --> 01:13:50,203
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the appointment process in general?

849
01:13:50,223 --> 01:13:53,583
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this council doesn't have the authority to confirm any appointments.

850
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:59,184
[SPEAKER_09]: The ones that it does have the authority to confirm are some of the most important appointments to boards and commissions in this city.

851
01:13:59,944 --> 01:14:01,925
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think that the process needs to be improved.

852
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:03,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly wouldn't mind

853
01:14:04,558 --> 01:14:18,501
[SPEAKER_09]: beyond the administration coming here and presenting the appointments themselves, you know, presenting the rationale as to why they appointed this person, the applications of the people who applied for the position and why they chose this eventual appointee.

854
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:33,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think there's a lot of transparency in the process that could be brought to this council, brought before the council, especially given the fact that we don't approve every single appointment to boards and commissions, but especially when it comes to the board of registrars and the fact that

855
01:14:34,835 --> 01:14:36,716
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we were having such delay there.

856
01:14:36,796 --> 01:14:45,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I would move to table this until we receive further appointments as are so urgently needed in this community.

857
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, Mr. Delfano, this is not reflective of you.

858
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:53,844
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just reflective of where we are right now in terms of appointments to boards and commissions in the city.

859
01:14:54,164 --> 01:14:54,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

860
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Barris.

861
01:14:58,766 --> 01:15:00,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Garabello, did you want to speak?

862
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:02,528
[SPEAKER_22]: I was going to a motion for

863
01:15:03,693 --> 01:15:04,293
[SPEAKER_22]: his appointment.

864
01:15:04,554 --> 01:15:17,980
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do respect Council business is this comments here but I hate to hold this up for that for that so I mean, that's you know that's what that's the wall of the party that's fine.

865
01:15:21,193 --> 01:15:27,938
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, if we let this sit, then we leave another commission open.

866
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:38,686
[SPEAKER_22]: And as I sympathize and agree 100%, the Board of Registrars is a very important thing, and that should have been done also.

867
01:15:39,992 --> 01:15:40,932
[SPEAKER_22]: That should be done too.

868
01:15:40,972 --> 01:15:42,173
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what we're waiting for after that.

869
01:15:42,493 --> 01:15:46,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be happy to amend my motion to table for one week, just to get a response from the administration.

870
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:48,854
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't care.

871
01:15:48,874 --> 01:15:50,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Dolfano, he's a good person.

872
01:15:50,414 --> 01:15:51,575
[SPEAKER_22]: He's a good volunteer in the community.

873
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:55,376
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, this is no reflection on you.

874
01:15:56,736 --> 01:16:02,357
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you and your family for many, many years, and you're good people, and we will support you.

875
01:16:02,377 --> 01:16:06,478
[SPEAKER_15]: So the motion table isn't debatable, but I do see Chief of Staff Nazarian has her hand up.

876
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:09,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll withdraw the motion.

877
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:13,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Temporarily to hear from the chief of staff.

878
01:16:13,662 --> 01:16:14,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief of staff in his area.

879
01:16:16,058 --> 01:16:19,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, President Morrell and members of the City Council.

880
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:28,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I am happy to look into the points that have been made this evening regarding appointments and the registrar of voters in particular.

881
01:16:29,341 --> 01:16:45,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I would propose that the City Council, given especially the fact that Bobby Delfano is here this evening, has spent the time, propose the fact that the body move to approve or confirm the appointment of Bobby Delfano.

882
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:46,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

883
01:16:48,586 --> 01:16:49,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Chief of Staff Nazarian.

884
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:50,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Behrs.

885
01:16:53,028 --> 01:17:00,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a more significant commitment that the Chief of Staff could make relative to a timeline for when registrars will be appointed?

886
01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:03,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, what will it be looked into?

887
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:07,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President.

888
01:17:08,955 --> 01:17:09,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President.

889
01:17:12,492 --> 01:17:12,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

890
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:16,276
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point in time, I would like to look further into it.

891
01:17:16,296 --> 01:17:17,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to make commitments that I can't keep.

892
01:17:19,038 --> 01:17:25,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's frankly that one of the resignations is a little bit new to me, but allow me please some opportunity.

893
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:30,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to write to the city council this week with further information once I've had an opportunity to look into it.

894
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:43,690
[SPEAKER_07]: On that, Madam President, I do believe, looking at the general laws, that I think these appointments to the Board of Registrars are supposed to come through the City Council as well and be appointed by the City Council for confirmation.

895
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:49,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm not sure that the Mayor has the right to appoint Mark Corrales to the Board of Registrars without confirmation.

896
01:17:52,576 --> 01:17:53,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Temporary or not.

897
01:17:53,397 --> 01:17:53,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I would agree.

898
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:09,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I have I talked about the need for this Council to have a lawyer by any chance this have I have I spoke about that at all ever because I mean the left hand doesn't know what the rights doing and no one can scratch the head across the hall.

899
01:18:09,704 --> 01:18:10,885
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I don't know what's going on.

900
01:18:11,326 --> 01:18:17,793
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, ultimately, I'm looking at the general law right here and in the first section says the position shall be filled nearly as reasonably as possible.

901
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,975
[SPEAKER_07]: and it should be confirmed by the council, unless that charter says something different.

902
01:18:22,495 --> 01:18:23,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, I'm at a loss.

903
01:18:24,176 --> 01:18:28,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at a loss to the inaction on easy items that keep us in compliance with state law.

904
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:31,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy items that keep us in compliance with state law.

905
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Bob, I'm gonna vote for you.

906
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:34,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna vote for you.

907
01:18:34,962 --> 01:18:35,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I support your resume.

908
01:18:35,802 --> 01:18:37,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I support your appointment.

909
01:18:38,584 --> 01:18:44,767
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, however, I don't support the antics and the human resource nightmare that we have going on across the hall.

910
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:48,369
[SPEAKER_15]: The clerk is offering to provide some clarification.

911
01:18:49,909 --> 01:18:56,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Council night to clarify a little bit on what you can ask the court with all due respect I don't think it's your job to clarify the actions the administration.

912
01:18:56,933 --> 01:19:11,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate what you're trying to do I really do my frustration level on this is like going through the roof because, you know, we all take an oath to comply with the law to withhold the laws of the Commonwealth of Constitution the ordinances of the city, and I feel like it only, it only applies when someone's looking.

913
01:19:12,496 --> 01:19:18,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes, it only applies when someone's looking at if no one points out it's just going to continue it's just going to continue just going to continue.

914
01:19:18,423 --> 01:19:22,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very frustrating, but but please continue I do apologize for interrupt.

915
01:19:23,849 --> 01:19:24,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

916
01:19:24,169 --> 01:19:29,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that and I understand, I understand what you're saying.

917
01:19:30,907 --> 01:19:34,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Back when when General Lasky and former chairman resigned.

918
01:19:34,888 --> 01:19:44,691
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually did meet with the city solicitor, and we spoke with with representatives of Secretary of State's office to make sure that we could get temporary registrars in place so that we can have quorum.

919
01:19:47,072 --> 01:19:58,555
[SPEAKER_11]: both offices, the city solicitor and Secretary of State's office, that temporary appointments can be made as long as they're, I mean, a permanent appointment would absolutely require council confirmation.

920
01:19:58,735 --> 01:20:06,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that was made very clear to us on both sides, but a temporary or emergency appointment would not require confirmation.

921
01:20:06,938 --> 01:20:14,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason there is a difference there is because there is a definite, I'm sorry, there's a definite expiration of the term

922
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,602
[SPEAKER_11]: which the term would expire on the confirmation of the successor.

923
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:21,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It's curious also that it just so happened to be like right before an election.

924
01:20:21,963 --> 01:20:27,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we still, we're just finding out now, right, the chief of staff just finding out now about a resignation of a member.

925
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:31,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now, but it was in November, right before the election, right.

926
01:20:31,588 --> 01:20:33,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was an appointment that was made temporary.

927
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:38,432
[SPEAKER_07]: And that person still never before the council made permanent and it's been well over 90 days.

928
01:20:40,761 --> 01:20:41,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

929
01:20:41,902 --> 01:20:44,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I would motion to table for one week.

930
01:20:45,004 --> 01:20:54,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would hope that the long awaited issues both around the Elections Commission and the potential appointment of a registrar would be on our agenda next week.

931
01:20:55,272 --> 01:20:55,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

932
01:20:55,972 --> 01:20:57,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion to table for one week.

933
01:21:00,317 --> 01:21:00,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

934
01:21:01,539 --> 01:21:09,529
[SPEAKER_22]: Along with this opening and other ones that know many people have reached out to me about boards and commissions that are holdovers for a while and they're saying that.

935
01:21:11,222 --> 01:21:16,006
[SPEAKER_22]: they've tried to contact the administration on whether they want them to continue on.

936
01:21:16,086 --> 01:21:17,447
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, you want me to stay.

937
01:21:17,487 --> 01:21:18,348
[SPEAKER_22]: No, you don't want me to stay.

938
01:21:18,988 --> 01:21:22,451
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're not getting any feedback either way.

939
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:30,097
[SPEAKER_22]: So just to say, I mean, if you look at the list, there's many, many holdovers on many important commissions.

940
01:21:31,218 --> 01:21:35,381
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, that's something that I don't know why people aren't getting back.

941
01:21:36,281 --> 01:21:37,522
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to replace them, replace them.

942
01:21:37,562 --> 01:21:39,544
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't, then ask them to stay on.

943
01:21:41,536 --> 01:21:46,820
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Barris to table for one week, and what's the additional language?

944
01:21:53,504 --> 01:22:02,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't have my microphone on, but my answer to the president's question was there's no additional amendment to the paper other than tabling for one week.

945
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:08,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, I would hope that papers to address these concerns would appear on the council agenda next week.

946
01:22:08,855 --> 01:22:09,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

947
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:18,061
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of vice president bears to table the appointment for one week seconded by second Councillor Collins.

948
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:19,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

949
01:22:24,863 --> 01:22:25,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President bears.

950
01:22:25,663 --> 01:22:25,943

964
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:50,693
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can work through the chief of staff or the administration.

965
01:22:50,753 --> 01:22:51,674
[SPEAKER_15]: You came out tonight.

966

968
01:22:58,218 --> 01:23:01,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I, for one, as one member, I wouldn't require Mr. Delfano to come back.

969
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:02,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this is an issue about him.

970
01:23:02,563 --> 01:23:04,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more an issue about what's going on across the hall.

971
01:23:05,186 --> 01:23:10,472
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I voted not to table, because I don't feel as though he should be held victim for his boss's mistakes.

972
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,757
[SPEAKER_07]: But with that being said, I'm satisfied for him to not have to return.

973
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:22,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. D'Alfano, if you didn't catch that yet, don't feel like you don't have to come back next week.

974
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:25,648
[SPEAKER_15]: We've heard from you, this is more of an issue with the administration, nothing to do with you.

975
01:23:26,008 --> 01:23:28,128
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for taking the time tonight.
