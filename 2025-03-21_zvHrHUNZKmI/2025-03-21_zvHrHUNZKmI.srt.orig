1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:05,573
[SPEAKER_13]: before we get started tonight we're going to

2
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:34,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Read a report from, uh, last week's, uh, committee of the whole meeting.

3
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the purpose of the meeting was held.

4
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:39,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the meeting was held Wednesday night, May 18th.

5
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:55,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the purpose of the meeting was to review and discuss public safety present with the council and the committee of the whole was Brian Karens, the acting director of, uh, commissioner of public works, Frank Gilberti, the chief of the Metro fire department, Leo Sacco, Jr.

6
00:00:56,521 --> 00:01:25,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief of the Medford Police Department, Roy Belson, Superintendent of Medford Public Schools, Jennifer Woods, the Chief of Staff, Mayor Burke, Penny Funioli, the Director of Addiction Services in the City of Medford, Lauren Felch of the Mayor's Communication Director for the City Council, and three citizens, Erin DiBenedetto, a member of the Medford School Committee, Anna Fretz,

7
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:48,368
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, citizen of, uh, Yale street and Harold McGilvery, uh, of the Medford police department, uh, meeting, uh, discussed various aspects of public safety and, uh, had four recommendations that the police purchase a new speeding electronic sign that a solar panel speed sign on Harvard street be put back and fixed.

8
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:51,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And there'd be a similar sign on high street.

9
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:52,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

10
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:09,068
[SPEAKER_10]: to keep a list of costs individually, and I think that was in relation to some of the ancillary fields in the realm of Medford Public Schools, and also to receive a report.

11
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that report was already given to us.

12
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,714
[SPEAKER_10]: It was handed to us, even though there was insistence to ask for it, it was in a packet that was given to us.

13
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:19,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And $93,500.

14
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:30,685
[SPEAKER_10]: to be explained that may have been added to the school budget in some manner that we're not aware of.

15
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:36,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So the chair now recognizes that was our committee report, and it was reported out favorably.

16
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,133
[SPEAKER_10]: We now recognize Councilor Caviello.

17
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:49,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if we could have a moment of silence for Ron Tarantino, who was killed this week for his father.

18
00:02:50,725 --> 00:03:07,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford policemen, so if we could, before we start the meeting, please, if you would all rise in a moment of silence for Ron Tarantino Jr., Auburn police officer who was murdered in the line of duty, son of retired police officer of Medford, Ron Tarantino.

19
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,460
[SPEAKER_10]: President, just if I could go on that?

20
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Counselor.

21
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

22
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:33,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Officer Tarantino actually grew up on Alexander Ave here in South Meffitt and went to the Kennedy School and also played youth baseball in the city of Meffitt.

23
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:50,040
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ron, in addition to his father being with the Meffitt Police Department for a number of years, also grew up in our community and he was a great police officer and he'll be sorely missed, Mr. President.

24
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:50,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

25
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:56,871
[SPEAKER_10]: While we're under suspension, we'll take this matter of congratulations.

26
00:03:57,172 --> 00:04:00,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It was offered under suspension by Councilor Caviello.

27
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:08,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Bill Hager on his recent selection as Executive Director of the West Medford Community Center.

28
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caviello.

29
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

30
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I was able to meet Mr. Hager this week.

31
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,263
[SPEAKER_05]: He seems like a nice gentleman.

32
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,676
[SPEAKER_05]: For what I understand, they had about 40 candidates out for the job, and Mr. Hager was selected out of 40.

33
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:29,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was done through a grant that was helped out by our local state delegation, who helped secure the grant to finance the position.

34
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:35,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will be meeting with Mr. Hager this week, and maybe we'll invite him to a meeting to introduce himself.

35
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:38,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Counselor.

36
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,806
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Caviello to return to the regular order of business.

37
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you do that, I think a resident wants to speak.

38
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:52,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a resident wanted to speak on the committee of the whole report.

39
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,731
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't mind, I'm not sure of the protocol.

40
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:55,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

41
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

42
00:04:57,532 --> 00:05:01,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Annmarie Fretz, 215 Harvard Street, overlooking Yale Street.

43
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:08,237
[SPEAKER_18]: I took copious notes at the meeting and sent them to all the city councilors, to the chief of staff,

44
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:11,179
[SPEAKER_18]: the mayor and to her executive assistant.

45
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:21,922
[SPEAKER_18]: So if anyone wants to take a look at those notes from the committee of the whole meeting, also known as the public safety summit, they're available through those sources or any one of the city councilors.

46
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:27,443
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about eight pages of notes and that's how I operate just so I can track things.

47
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:36,826
[SPEAKER_18]: This meeting was brought about by three years of efforts by councilor Marks and a lot of issues that have come up during the years.

48
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you had said,

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Cohen that it had been four years since there had been such a meeting, um, focused mostly on the Haines square area.

50
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:56,449
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just would like to recap and give you an executive summary of what I got out of the meeting, uh, which may be different from what a counselor might hear.

51
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:06,915
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, basically we are looking at the chief asking for six patrol cars in this budget cycle.

52
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:08,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Six unmarked cars.

53
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:24,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Four civilian administrators to fill in for the crime stats and crime scene analyst, as well as an IT specialist that are taking up the time of officers that are on the staff.

54
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:27,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Those officers could be out doing patrols.

55
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,283
[SPEAKER_18]: He'd like to have 10 civilian dispatch officers, which would free up those officers as well.

56
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,623
[SPEAKER_18]: but it would be a shared fire department and police department dispatch service.

57
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:55,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Currently, my estimations after looking at the 1990 numbers, which fell into the former city ordinance, it said we needed approximately 130 to run the city, which is the chief verified.

58
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:59,695
[SPEAKER_18]: We need about 28 more officers to bring the staff to those levels.

59
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,118
[SPEAKER_18]: At this point, we have two officers that will be retiring this year.

60
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:13,920
[SPEAKER_18]: before the end of January 2017, 10 more officers in waiting who have reached the age of 55 and have reached 30 years of service.

61
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:23,782
[SPEAKER_18]: In speaking with other lieutenants this week, I find that by 2019, we'll be down by 30 officers reaching those ages as well.

62
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:28,484
[SPEAKER_18]: And some may retire early and some may be leaving, some may be doing other things.

63
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:32,605
[SPEAKER_18]: The current senior staff to senior

64
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:38,177
[SPEAKER_18]: officers to patrolman ratio is right now one to three.

65
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:50,226
[SPEAKER_18]: We have three captains, nine lieutenants, 16 sergeants out of 104 officers, which brings 76 patrolman, 12 of whom are in administrative roles.

66
00:07:51,507 --> 00:08:02,175
[SPEAKER_18]: So when we call for enforcement of parking on sidewalk, which is my bailiwick, we are taking them away from possibly looking at an assault.

67
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:09,807
[SPEAKER_18]: like there was this past Sunday at Dunkin' Donuts, or perhaps they're having lunch or dealing with a prisoner within the building.

68
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:20,756
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not to say, as one of the lieutenants stated, don't call, but there's some serious stuff being taken care of with a very thin staff, as stated by the chief himself.

69
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:27,862
[SPEAKER_18]: We need two speed radar sleds to accommodate

70
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,659
[SPEAKER_18]: traps or just traffic control in our area.

71
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,360
[SPEAKER_18]: They're $15,000 a piece.

72
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:46,069
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to replace the two solar-powered speed traps, one on Brooks School and one on Harvard Street, which I believe Councilor De La Russo just mentioned.

73
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,232
[SPEAKER_18]: We have absolutely no control on Harvard Street.

74
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:57,358
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a truck last week jump the curb and drive across our sidewalk, hit another curb, graze a tree, and just run along the sidewalk.

75
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:00,629
[SPEAKER_18]: The sidewalk where I walk with my dog, and that scared me.

76
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:01,930
[SPEAKER_18]: I was watching it from a car.

77
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:04,692
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is a common occurrence these days.

78
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:19,844
[SPEAKER_18]: The police themselves would like the basic infrastructure, the communications, IT, and all the systems that operate, that they call in on, that they communicate with each other in different buildings.

79
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:22,346
[SPEAKER_18]: They would like that upgraded, and it's a serious issue.

80
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:25,909
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe this issue came up when Captain Doherty had to

81
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:34,283
[SPEAKER_18]: reconstruct a system, which is how all of his overtime that became a political issue last year evolved.

82
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:52,334
[SPEAKER_18]: With regards to the Medford High School, I went there Saturday to take a look at accessing the swimming pool because my children used to swim there on swim teams and on high school teams when they were competing.

83
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:59,333
[SPEAKER_18]: And I could not get into the parking lot, because the two lanes of traffic were streaming out the entrance and the exit.

84
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,435
[SPEAKER_18]: There was no one directing traffic.

85
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:04,357
[SPEAKER_18]: So the cars were just streaming out two at a time.

86
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,038
[SPEAKER_18]: There should have been an ingress.

87
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:06,699
[SPEAKER_18]: There wasn't.

88
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,961
[SPEAKER_18]: The other exit or entrance was being used.

89
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:13,724
[SPEAKER_18]: There was no way to confront it or deal with it.

90
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:15,125
[SPEAKER_18]: And there was no one directing it.

91
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:20,029
[SPEAKER_18]: I went around the backside and to the rear entrance,

92
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Caution tape is stretched across the parking lot in the back where it cliffs up.

93
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:31,586
[SPEAKER_18]: And there were about 50 people that appeared to be part of the language school.

94
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:35,169
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't see anyone in that area patrolling that area.

95
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,953
[SPEAKER_18]: It took me, again, 20 minutes to get back to the pool and all the doors were open.

96
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:42,174
[SPEAKER_18]: I could have walked in and just walked around the area.

97
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:49,200
[SPEAKER_18]: And what Superintendent Belson said was that

98
00:10:51,780 --> 00:11:07,090
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief should beef up his staff and put in patrols rather than have someone assigned or on the payroll of the school department to monitor 600 or 700 people at that facility on a Saturday or Sunday.

99
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:20,119
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't imagine what it would be like when it's out of towners going in there, which people don't understand the capabilities of just a bunch of people who are not obeying rules.

100
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,760
[SPEAKER_18]: as far as driving and parking.

101
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:39,285
[SPEAKER_18]: The news is good in that the police department, while stretched thin, has made significant and important arrests with solid jail time being given out to the criminals.

102
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:43,546
[SPEAKER_18]: The West Medford breaking and entering thieves were arrested in another city.

103
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:44,686
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's going to be followed.

104
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:50,028
[SPEAKER_18]: The MPD right now, Medford Public

105
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:55,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Police Department is currently staffed at 104 officers total.

106
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,223
[SPEAKER_18]: That includes all senior officers.

107
00:11:57,663 --> 00:12:01,426
[SPEAKER_18]: They need at least 15 officers to adequately service Medford.

108
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:03,748
[SPEAKER_18]: They have difficulty reaching that number.

109
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:17,680
[SPEAKER_18]: We also have $8 million in free cash that could be devoted to go out and hire other officers who have either left their company that they're working for, left their city, relocated,

110
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,834
[SPEAKER_18]: from another part of the country, there are many people out there.

111
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:29,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Or people coming from the MPs, from the Army, it will take them six months through training.

112
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:37,524
[SPEAKER_18]: But if someone's already a licensed police officer, qualified in the state of Massachusetts, they could readily be hired here.

113
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:46,610
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, I just want to thank the police department for doing everything they've done

114
00:12:47,555 --> 00:13:04,782
[SPEAKER_18]: they're stretched very thin, they're trying as hard as they can, and I think what they're going to try to do is when people call in to ask for assistance, give them a real-time frame in which they are expected to be responding based on the cars that are out on patrol or responding to assaults and things like that.

115
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:08,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

116
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:10,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

117
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:15,686
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello to return to the regular order of business, all those

118
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

119
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:24,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to thank Ms.

120
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:31,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Fretz for being here for this public safety summit, which was held last Wednesday.

121
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:38,821
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I wish they had done, and I think we had requested it, is that a reverse 911 call be sent out.

122
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,383
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's probably what the meeting deserved.

123
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:47,406
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Councilman Marks, with the support of the rest of the council, had pushed for a public safety summit.

124
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,806
[SPEAKER_15]: for months, if not years, to take place.

125
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,507
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it was very difficult.

126
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,968
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank the president for getting all the players in the room.

127
00:13:55,508 --> 00:14:10,094
[SPEAKER_15]: But to get the chief of police, the chief of fire, superintendent, and almost the whole council in the room, plus the chief of staff and somebody from the mayor's office, which I believe was the council liaison, it took a lot.

128
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:14,596
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was a well-we discussed many, many issues.

129
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,477
[SPEAKER_15]: It was two and a half hours, and there really was

130
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I think one or two residents, which was a shame because I don't believe it was publicly advertised.

131
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:25,573
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my first comment.

132
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:28,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we got a lot of information.

133
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:35,217
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we did realize how understaffed our police department is and the fear of what's going to happen when we do get retired.

134
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:39,719
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the retiree rate in the next couple of years is going to bring our levels even lower.

135
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:46,462
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope that the mayor does what she needs to do with regards to hiring accordingly because it does, as the chief said, it takes

136
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:52,249
[SPEAKER_15]: almost a year to get the officers trained and ready to go out on the road.

137
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:59,092
[SPEAKER_15]: With regards to the committee of the whole report, it's very vague in our request.

138
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:07,896
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just, one of the big things, because I think it was mentioned by a couple of councillors, that one of the biggest things we get complaints about is the speeding and the traffic.

139
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:14,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really important, I think, that the electronic sign that we have has been broken for

140
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:16,421
[SPEAKER_15]: God knows how long.

141
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:19,262
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I caught wind of it a few months ago, and it's still broken.

142
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:25,903
[SPEAKER_15]: So we did ask the chief of police for cost estimates and to purchase at least one electronic speeding sign.

143
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:32,905
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't have our office — every time we get a complaint about speeding, we can't, you know, set up stings every day in every area.

144
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,786
[SPEAKER_15]: So the speeding signs do help a great deal.

145
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:42,387
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could get — the chief of police could let us know how much those cost, and I believe he said it was about $15,000.

146
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:46,068
[SPEAKER_15]: 15,000, and we did request that we purchase one.

147
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:54,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, the fixed street signs with the speed, I know they're on Elm and I believe three other locations.

148
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:55,809
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple of them are broken.

149
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Harvard needs to be fixed.

150
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,790
[SPEAKER_15]: High Street needs to be fixed.

151
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also asked for a cost.

152
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if we could get this, if we could maybe put this on the floor tonight.

153
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:09,312
[SPEAKER_15]: We did ask for a cost of those signs to possibly put them up in other locations.

154
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:14,587
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the one on Elm definitely curbs speeding as I drive that every day.

155
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:21,853
[SPEAKER_15]: And as you see people approaching, I think it just brings realization of the speed somebody's going and it does slow cars down.

156
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:27,078
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's very important on where it is placed on Elm due to the Wrights Pond opening up very soon.

157
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:36,306
[SPEAKER_15]: I was concerned with regards to the school aspect of the conversation and the lack of

158
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:38,609
[SPEAKER_15]: security after hours.

159
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:40,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we're secure during the day.

160
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,513
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a Medford police officer there, as well as Officer Mazzacca.

161
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:50,856
[SPEAKER_15]: But after school hours and on the weekends, when we do have the public in and out of the building, there's no security.

162
00:16:51,397 --> 00:17:01,743
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was mentioned that the parents are a good way for security, parents that are at events, as well as the custodians.

163
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:06,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just don't feel that that's adequate enough to secure our building.

164
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:11,567
[SPEAKER_15]: especially with the potential leasing of Edgar Lee Fields.

165
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,209
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to have a lot of out-of-towners, a lot of leasing at that field, and our schools will be opened.

166
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:21,731
[SPEAKER_15]: I know whether or not they're, you know, some of the doors are locked.

167
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:27,073
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to have potential liability issues there, and security is extremely important.

168
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,854
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's something that needs to be looked into further.

169
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,416
[SPEAKER_15]: But all in all, I think it was a great meeting, and I'm glad we

170
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,002
[SPEAKER_15]: department heads in attendance, and we were able to get our questions answered.

171
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:47,425
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I could go on and on, and as Anne mentioned, I think eight pages of notes with, you know, 115 questions that were asked.

172
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:58,429
[SPEAKER_15]: It definitely did help, and hopefully we can get the information out to the public, because I know a number of people were interested in it, and it's too bad we didn't advertise it.

173
00:17:58,469 --> 00:17:59,510
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't advertised more.

174
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,811
[SPEAKER_15]: It would have been nice if they did the reverse 911 call.

175
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

176
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:11,220
[SPEAKER_08]: If you would just pause with me for a moment, I'm trying to make an adjustment to the queue system.

177
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:22,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's working.

178
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:23,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

179
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:24,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Marks.

180
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:26,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

181
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:34,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank Anne Fretz for her thorough minutes that she presented to the council.

182
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:42,799
[SPEAKER_01]: based on a very lengthy and very important public safety summit that this council has called for for the past several years.

183
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:48,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for finally organizing this, because it is an important issue.

184
00:18:49,803 --> 00:19:03,812
[SPEAKER_01]: This issue not only is for safety within the community, it's also to get a handle prior to the budget on what is needed to provide police protection in our community.

185
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:10,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we heard loud and clear, at least I did, from Chief Sacco that there were a number of things he'd like to accomplish.

186
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:18,243
[SPEAKER_01]: However, his budget has been level funded at the very best over the last several years.

187
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:29,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And things he'd like to accomplish, like possibly having a separate truck unit in the community to pull over 18 wheelers that are going through our community.

188
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,091
[SPEAKER_01]: at great clips of speed.

189
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:53,869
[SPEAKER_01]: He would like to do this, but can't afford it because we don't have the manpower and the current manpower aren't trained to pull over these 18-wheelers and check the weight and the equipment they're driving with, if they have chemicals on board, and also their logs and so forth.

190
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:57,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one issue that the chief mentioned he would like to have additional staff.

191
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:07,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also brought up at the meeting regarding the Mystic River and how many years ago you never really saw many people on the Mystic.

192
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:13,150
[SPEAKER_01]: On the upper Mystics you would, but the lower Mystics you never saw many people on.

193
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:18,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have the Meffitt High School row team on the Mystic River.

194
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:21,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the questions I brought up was regarding

195
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:29,172
[SPEAKER_01]: if we have, in case of emergency, a quick response to getting to anyone that's on the Mystic.

196
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:36,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chief Sacco said that really the police department's ill-equipped to handle an emergency on the Mystic.

197
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:41,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fire department does have a small boat that they would use.

198
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:50,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And largely, we would depend on the state police, who happen to be on the other side of the locks, to come to an emergency.

199
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,227
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Mystic River.

200
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:55,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was an issue of concern that was raised.

201
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:19,587
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that Ann didn't mention is the fact that this council, and we've even had, I know Councilor Scott Pelley had just recently, along with Councilor Caviello and myself, a Committee of the Whole meeting, I'm sorry, a subcommittee meeting to discuss concerns with the bus stop in front of the Oasis and the need to create

202
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:35,427
[SPEAKER_01]: a truck area that would allow for deliveries, and also the corner of Harvard and Maine, which has been a concern about trucks parking on the sidewalk.

203
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:50,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And to date, and this has been going on for quite some time, to date, we have yet to address any of the concerns posed by the residents to keep trucks off of the corner of Harvard and Maine.

204
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:55,625
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has also been a concern, Mr. President.

205
00:21:56,326 --> 00:22:01,729
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I would like to mention is that, you know, every community is faced with priorities.

206
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,152
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this community, it's easy to say, well, we don't have the funding.

207
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:07,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we can't afford to do this.

208
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,234
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't afford to do that.

209
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:21,021
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have $8 million sitting in what I refer to a free cash account, you can call it a rainy day account, you can call it anything you'd like, but it's $8 million of taxpayer money

210
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:27,411
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in an account that could be used for whatever the community considers a priority.

211
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:34,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think public safety has to be in the top one or two priorities for a community.

212
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:37,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting tired of hearing, well, we don't have the manpower.

213
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:41,456
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to go out and enforce that, but we don't have the manpower.

214
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:44,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we'd like to do speed radar, we don't have the manpower.

215
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that story is getting a little old.

216
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,239
[SPEAKER_01]: When taxes go up every year,

217
00:22:50,675 --> 00:23:00,817
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are paying more and more on their taxes, and you're getting less and less for city services, I think, you know, we have to know what the priorities are of the administration.

218
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:05,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And clearly, public safety has taken a back seat in this community.

219
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:10,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy that the meeting was called for the Public Safety Summit.

220
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:18,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, like Councilor Longo-Kern, wish that there were more ways to notifying residents

221
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:31,059
[SPEAKER_01]: by putting it up on the city website, reverse 911, putting it on maybe the government channel and the education channel to get the word out.

222
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:37,963
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was very little done to promote this particular very important meeting about public safety.

223
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:45,888
[SPEAKER_01]: The other issue that was brought up is the fact that we have to have better communications with the police department.

224
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:48,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is on behalf of

225
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:57,171
[SPEAKER_01]: The residents that I've spoken with would like to see an increased presence in the neighborhoods, and would like to see community policing brought back.

226
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:06,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one thing we mentioned to Chief Sacco, and he said, well, there's a lot of different aspects of community policing, and we're currently doing some of them.

227
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:16,119
[SPEAKER_01]: But my vision of community policing is when an officer rides by on a bicycle in a neighborhood, or an officer is down in the square checking doors

228
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:30,307
[SPEAKER_01]: in businesses after hours to make sure that they're locked or to make sure that, you know, the parks are safe, to make sure that there is a presence in the community and not just a drive-by.

229
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:45,598
[SPEAKER_01]: As I told you, Mr. President, when I took a bike ride a couple of weeks ago, it's amazing what you can see in this community when you're not just doing a drive-by and when you happen to take the time either to walk or on a bicycle and you can see

230
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,853
[SPEAKER_01]: things at a very different perspective than you can when you're driving by.

231
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what residents are feeling right now.

232
00:24:52,715 --> 00:25:00,139
[SPEAKER_01]: They may see the occasional police car drive by, but they're not seeing the presence that they come to expect in this community.

233
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:11,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I just can't buy the fact that Manning is so low that we can't perform these basic, basic tasks and basic city services.

234
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:15,667
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a large majority of, in my opinion,

235
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,521
[SPEAKER_01]: the workload from the police department, which was to issue tickets.

236
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:21,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, you know what?

237
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,502
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to free you up from that issuing tickets.

238
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:26,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not your job.

239
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:31,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Your job is to go out there, to be part of the community, and to prevent crime in our community.

240
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:36,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'd like to see more in that way.

241
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:42,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that in this budget that whatever recommendations the chief made,

242
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:54,713
[SPEAKER_01]: unlike prior years, that the administration take a long look at each department head's wish list to make sure that it's not just a wish, but it's something that actually comes to fruition.

243
00:25:55,774 --> 00:26:01,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I hate to see the chief go through the motions of creating a wish list and nothing ever happened.

244
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:07,758
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been the case over the last several years, not with just the police, with every single department in this community.

245
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:12,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank Anne Fretz again for giving us that in-depth minutes.

246
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:15,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank the council president for calling for this meeting.

247
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:22,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope this is one of just many meetings throughout the course of the year, Mr. President, so we can stay in tune with public safety.

248
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

249
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks on the motion of Councilor Marks that the paper be received in place on file.

250
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:32,909
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor, all those opposed carries on.

251
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:37,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Request of Councilor Caviello to return to the regular order of business.

252
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:38,614
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

253
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:39,455
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

254
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:45,698
[SPEAKER_10]: The regular order of business motions, orders, and resolutions.

255
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:46,939
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-507 offered by Councilor Marks.

256
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that crime-related and pedestrian safety issues be discussed.

257
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:54,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, this sounds redundant at this point.

258
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:56,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

259
00:26:57,805 --> 00:26:59,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Public safety is not redundant.

260
00:26:59,126 --> 00:26:59,706
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important.

261
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just state, Mr. President,

262
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:14,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you read my article about four or five weeks ago in the paper, but I asked residents if they thought their neighborhood was safe and to respond back on several questions that I asked.

263
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:32,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was pleased to say that I received dozens of emails from residents who gave quite lengthy explanations on why or why not they thought their neighborhood was safe in ways that they believe method could improve on public safety in the community.

264
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:47,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I told residents that it took the time to reach out to me that I would put this on the council agenda and I would go through each and every email and, um, make a list of concerns that residents had in our community.

265
00:27:48,494 --> 00:28:01,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I stated a couple of weeks ago during an issue, uh, that we were talking about public safety, um, I was quite, uh, surprised, uh, because I thought the article that I wrote was going to, um,

266
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:14,375
[SPEAKER_01]: elicit responses of people feeling unsafe in their neighborhood, people feeling that there are an abundance of crime-related issues going on in this community.

267
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:17,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And exactly, it was the total reverse.

268
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:29,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say probably roughly 90% to 95% of the responses I received were not towards crime-related issues, but towards pedestrian safety issues.

269
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part,

270
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:39,899
[SPEAKER_01]: people in this community felt very unsafe traversing on city sidewalks and on city streets in this community.

271
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd just like to go through a few, Mr. President.

272
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:55,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be lengthy, but I think this merits, because I'm not aware of many polls the city sends out to find out what's going on in the community and ways of improving the community.

273
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:59,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Although there's been a lot of transition teams set up,

274
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:07,657
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't seen any responses really back from these transition teams or anything really done with these transition recommendations.

275
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:17,743
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd like to go through a few, Mr. President, because residents mentioned to me that speeding traffic interferes with their ability to enjoy our neighborhoods.

276
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:29,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And traffic calming approaches, which is something that I've spoken about for the last several years, is a way of redesigning streets to slow down traffic, resulting in safer streets,

277
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:31,769
[SPEAKER_01]: returning the streets back to our neighborhoods.

278
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:44,241
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a number of residents that really took the time to explain what they thought a safe neighborhood was all about in regards to pedestrian safety.

279
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:53,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the issues that were mentioned to me via email, and I did have a few phone calls because I gave that option also, but mostly emails.

280
00:29:55,122 --> 00:30:02,948
[SPEAKER_01]: people offered suggestions and I know one was, why don't we have more of the raised crosswalks throughout the community?

281
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:15,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been something I know this council and I've personally worked on and raised crosswalks do have a traffic calming way to them.

282
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,101
[SPEAKER_01]: They reduce the pedestrian crossing distance.

283
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:22,063
[SPEAKER_01]: They improve visibility.

284
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also slow down speeding cars.

285
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:27,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one thing that was mentioned.

286
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:28,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we have more?

287
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:33,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not quite sure why we don't have more, to be honest with you, in this community.

288
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:39,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just on major roads, but throughout our neighborhoods that are experiencing speeding.

289
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:43,132
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also talk about curb extensions.

290
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:49,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And curb extensions are just a way of making it quicker for a pedestrian to cross a street.

291
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,097
[SPEAKER_01]: It also narrows the pathway down

292
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,532
[SPEAKER_01]: for cars, and cars and drivers will inherently slow down because it's a narrower path.

293
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:02,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of these approaches are done by surrounding communities.

294
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:06,996
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned many times, we don't have to recreate the wheel.

295
00:31:07,036 --> 00:31:13,219
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go on the City of Cambridge website, they'll walk you through step one, step two, step three.

296
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:21,582
[SPEAKER_01]: They've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, thousands of hours to put together reporting on safe streets.

297
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:24,940
[SPEAKER_01]: and ways to improve pedestrian safety.

298
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't need to recreate the wheel.

299
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:30,203
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually go in and steal some of their ideas.

300
00:31:31,804 --> 00:31:39,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that would go a long way to improving some of the concerns that residents raised.

301
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:44,591
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also a lot of concern about, which this council has discussed ad nauseam,

302
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:49,335
[SPEAKER_01]: about vehicles parking on sidewalks, safe routes to school.

303
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was something developed.

304
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:54,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have two former school committee people.

305
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:06,588
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something developed by the school department, but residents were looking for something that was more widely known in the community and better routes to involve the entire community.

306
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:13,773
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also talk about the broken sidewalks, which I'm hoping this council will address

307
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:17,055
[SPEAKER_01]: very shortly with a bond appropriation.

308
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:21,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossing lights that are broken throughout the community.

309
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Crosswalks not clearly marked.

310
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,041
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost in June, so think about it.

311
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:34,505
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost six months, almost a half a year into the year, and our crosswalks still are not painted.

312
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:38,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I should say a majority of them still are not painted.

313
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:42,949
[SPEAKER_01]: They also mentioned about poor lighting in many

314
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,113
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the community, in particular some of the business districts at night.

315
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:59,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the hillside area was mentioned on several emails about poor lighting, and even in Meffitt Square, although there's been some improvement to the lighting in Meffitt Square.

316
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:08,852
[SPEAKER_01]: They've talked about signage faded or misdirected, so they'll have a sign that tells you no left turn, but you could take a left turn there.

317
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:15,318
[SPEAKER_01]: or they'll have a sign that's too far back, a stop sign, so you don't know if you have to stop or not.

318
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:18,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the things that are being brought up.

319
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:22,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And we heard from Chief Sacco, Mr. President, the other day.

320
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find this very interesting because I called for this years ago.

321
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,688
[SPEAKER_01]: The Traffic Commission does yeoman's work.

322
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:32,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have the chief of police who runs a very, very busy department.

323
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:35,434
[SPEAKER_01]: He's involved with internal investigations.

324
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:38,296
[SPEAKER_01]: He's involved with community outreach.

325
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:45,691
[SPEAKER_01]: He's involved with running a large, very important 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week department.

326
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:54,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And to have him the head of the traffic division, I'm sorry, traffic commission, to me does that position an injustice.

327
00:33:55,238 --> 00:34:07,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that the chief is not a very worthy person to sit on that, but that really should be someone that can dedicate a good majority of their time to move these issues forward, to go out and do the research,

328
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:10,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the traffic commission just doesn't sit back and listen.

329
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:15,557
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to go out in the street, do the research, and a lot of the committee members do yeoman's work.

330
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:29,121
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really believe that that traffic commission needs to be looked at in the way it's defined, and possibly maybe have the chief as an ex officio member and not as the chairman of it.

331
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:37,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even in his own opinion, he said that's a lot of work, a lot of time, and it's very time consuming.

332
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:38,865
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the right job.

333
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:40,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely time consuming.

334
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:46,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then potholes and other issues were mentioned about safety.

335
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:52,428
[SPEAKER_01]: The crime related side of it was a lot less, as I mentioned.

336
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:58,729
[SPEAKER_01]: People thought there should be better communication between the police and the community as a whole.

337
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:05,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents were concerned that there's not enough available crime statistics reported.

338
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:13,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Councilor Falco brought this up about possibly having crime statistics citywide and by neighborhood.

339
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:23,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now that doesn't exist, or if it does exist, it's not adequate enough to give people enough information on what's actually happening in the community.

340
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big concern of residents.

341
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:32,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents would also like to see neighborhood crime watch groups throughout the entire city that would communicate.

342
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,807
[SPEAKER_01]: They also mentioned about community policing,

343
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:40,214
[SPEAKER_01]: and would like to see a larger police presence within the neighborhoods.

344
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:42,675
[SPEAKER_01]: They mentioned about late-night solicitors.

345
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:45,576
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a no-knock ordinance in the community.

346
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:51,398
[SPEAKER_01]: It covers everyone except for religious and political groups, I believe.

347
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,559
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't put any type of regulation on religious and political groups.

348
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:04,923
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you firsthand, living in the Wellington area, right around dinner time, you can almost expect your door's going to ring with someone at your door.

349
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:08,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be, in my opinion, the cable wars.

350
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:12,068
[SPEAKER_01]: One night I'll have Comcast, the next night Verizon's there.

351
00:36:12,728 --> 00:36:13,748
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back and forth.

352
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,829
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy how they do it.

353
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, I believe, needs to be taken seriously also.

354
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:29,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And also at the monthly community policing meeting that they mentioned, there needs to be a better exchange of info.

355
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:34,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents who attend this meeting said it appears to be just a venting

356
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:54,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So people go in and vent and never receive any feedback from the police department on ways to improve public safety in this community, helpful tips on improving policing or how to prevent you from being a victim of robbery or assault or anything else, home burglary.

357
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:59,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would like to see more communication rather than just a venting session.

358
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:02,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things that were brought up, Mr. President.

359
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:14,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you allowing me to have the time, but this is a very important subject, and we may all feel safe in the community now, but safety could be like the wind.

360
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:17,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important that we stay on top of this.

361
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important that we provide the financial backing to allow our police department to have the latest and greatest equipment, and also the latest and greatest facility, which we currently know is inadequate right now.

362
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,654
[SPEAKER_01]: and needs to be replaced.

363
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I appreciate it again, Mr. President.

364
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:45,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank all those residents who reached out to me and took the time to explain what was going on in their neighborhood.

365
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:49,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping some of this will carry through to budget.

366
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:50,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it will with me.

367
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:57,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of my recommendations will be based on what I — what feedback I received from residents.

368
00:37:58,313 --> 00:37:59,254
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you, Mr. President.

369
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:02,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, welcome.

370
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

371
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

372
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,182
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a very, very sober topic and we should discuss it.

373
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:13,943
[SPEAKER_14]: We should discuss it a lot, but we also should have action on it.

374
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:21,728
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would definitely hope, not hope, expect that the mayor turns this into a priority.

375
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:28,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether it's the police building itself, whether it's to tear down the old one and put up a new one, whether it's to put a

376
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:36,032
[SPEAKER_14]: second floor or third floor on the existing structure, whatever it takes that's acceptable to the police department themselves.

377
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:39,375
[SPEAKER_14]: The morale of the police department in the city has got to be terrible.

378
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I get mixed reviews.

379
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:43,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure they love and hate me at different times, and that's fine.

380
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:45,099
[SPEAKER_14]: They're allowed to do that.

381
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,562
[SPEAKER_14]: But we don't have enough police officers.

382
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:55,306
[SPEAKER_14]: And a few factors is that, first of all, we pay them through details.

383
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:58,769
[SPEAKER_14]: And that structure, we're not paying them what they're worth.

384
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:01,036
[SPEAKER_14]: And number two, we get a kickback from that.

385
00:39:01,116 --> 00:39:07,279
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't want to give up the details because the city gets a 15 percent kickback on every hour that an officer works.

386
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,241
[SPEAKER_14]: That system is archaic and it needs to go.

387
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:12,342
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to free them up for training.

388
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:23,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I mean training, I mean they need to be doing exercises on sweeping buildings, which also brings us into the school department issues, because there's no building that's better to sweep than the high school.

389
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:29,292
[SPEAKER_14]: But if the high school is being sold on the weekends to private entities, then we can't use it for exercising.

390
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:38,418
[SPEAKER_14]: for exercises for the cops to sweep a building or to practice for an emergency situation, whether it's the fire department or the police department.

391
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:45,639
[SPEAKER_14]: This has to become an absolute priority for this new mayor, and I'm going to expect that.

392
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,460
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing more important than the police department.

393
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:58,682
[SPEAKER_14]: And like I said, and the other factor is a lot of police officers, I'm doing Memorial Day at the Oak Grove Cemetery, and I'm focusing on police officers that were veterans who became police officers.

394
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:07,475
[SPEAKER_14]: and police officers who belong to the National Guard and Reserves who have died in action, whether overseas or on the street.

395
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:10,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be focused on that this Memorial Day.

396
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:21,282
[SPEAKER_14]: We have police officers that might get pulled away from their duties as a Medford police officer to go into the National Guard and Reserves.

397
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:23,924
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to also have more officers available for that.

398
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:29,903
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're down to 104, then we don't have enough officers.

399
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to have 130 recommended.

400
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:34,807
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a city that's huge.

401
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:37,128
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very compact, small city.

402
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,290
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we don't do something about it, it will be too late.

403
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,053
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a point at which it becomes too late to do something.

404
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:45,674
[SPEAKER_14]: And a crisis will ensue.

405
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:47,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you will have an overreaction.

406
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:51,018
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you plan it out, then you can move forward.

407
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:55,401
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, practicing the traffic calming measures.

408
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:59,974
[SPEAKER_14]: are absolutely essential for the police, because it'll cut down on the speeding.

409
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:02,535
[SPEAKER_14]: It will absolutely cut down on the speeding.

410
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:14,340
[SPEAKER_14]: And wait until the 490 units goes into Locust Street, and wait until Wegmans comes into Locust Street, wait until Riverside Ave becomes, you know, absolute gridlock.

411
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait until all of this stuff happens, what are you gonna do?

412
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:21,224
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't expect people to do more than what they're capable of doing.

413
00:41:22,324 --> 00:41:24,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And while I criticize the police at times,

414
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:26,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm more their advocate than not.

415
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,724
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see too many people up here over and over and over again.

416
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:37,952
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm grateful that that woman spoke today, Ann, because they need an advocate in the city.

417
00:41:39,194 --> 00:41:42,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that you guys say that you want the police building and you want police officers.

418
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:44,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Do something about it.

419
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:49,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Make your voices heard loud and clear that this is a priority in the city.

420
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:53,636
[SPEAKER_14]: And until, because you know when they want money for parks, they find it, no offense.

421
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,518
[SPEAKER_14]: When they want money for certain things, they find it.

422
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,962
[SPEAKER_14]: But the city as a whole doesn't appreciate the police department.

423
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:02,224
[SPEAKER_14]: And they need to start.

424
00:42:02,684 --> 00:42:04,225
[SPEAKER_14]: And they will when the crime goes up.

425
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:09,170
[SPEAKER_14]: When it affects them in their backyard, believe me, the citizens will be in here.

426
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:14,068
[SPEAKER_14]: And by then it'll be too late because you'll have a lot of angry men and women in here.

427
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,309
[SPEAKER_14]: And they'll be saying, I want this and I want that.

428
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:18,710
[SPEAKER_14]: And where's the money going to come from then?

429
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,351
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll find it, but it's going to cost on some other level.

430
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Some other service in the city is going to have to pay for it.

431
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:26,412
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to have to take the hit.

432
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:29,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And so thank you very much for listening.

433
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:34,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

434
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:34,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

435
00:42:34,994 --> 00:42:36,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

436
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:39,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Anne-Marie Frentz, 215 Harvard Street.

437
00:42:39,214 --> 00:42:49,237
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the things I'd like to pick up on with the support of the police station is it's probably 7.30 right now and they're eating their dinner at the desk office and the spiders are coming down out of the ceiling.

438
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:52,078
[SPEAKER_18]: They just asked me to come back and take a look at them.

439
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:58,240
[SPEAKER_18]: If they're brown spiders, they're in big trouble down there, but that's the condition that they're living under with the ceiling dripping and things like that.

440
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:05,403
[SPEAKER_18]: But what I really wanted to pick up on was what Councilor Marks was talking about with public safety with the painting of the sidewalks.

441
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:06,203
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

442
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,611
[SPEAKER_18]: the painting of the crosswalks, the raised crosswalks, et cetera.

443
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:21,493
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe Councilor Knight brought this up, Councilor Falco brought it up, and Councilor, I'm sorry, Scarpelli brought it up.

444
00:43:21,553 --> 00:43:24,393
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, starting to choke you.

445
00:43:24,913 --> 00:43:32,254
[SPEAKER_18]: With the staffing currently in the highway division, there are 15 members on the staff with Steve.

446
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:35,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven of them were available to work this week.

447
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:47,802
[SPEAKER_18]: and it's an incredible burden for them to pick up on what is put in the C-Click fix, in addition to their regular duties of filling potholes, fixing roads, painting lines, posting signs, et cetera.

448
00:43:48,102 --> 00:43:56,788
[SPEAKER_18]: They just don't have the manpower, and it dovetails into public safety, because if they're not fixing it, it's not getting done, and it can't be enhanced.

449
00:43:57,389 --> 00:43:59,190
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't keep our public safety in hands.

450
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:03,553
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually wrote a letter of apology today to Brian Cairns, because I asked for

451
00:44:05,122 --> 00:44:27,195
[SPEAKER_18]: After two weeks of waiting for the blockades to be put in front of the four house lots that are between my driveway at the Lincoln and Kennedy schools to the corner of Harvard and Main Street, having had nothing done, I wrote and asked for the orange and white trash barrels or orange and white traffic signs to be distributed.

452
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:31,398
[SPEAKER_18]: The traffic department told me that the traffic commission has to put them out.

453
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:32,874
[SPEAKER_18]: It has to be approved.

454
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:34,635
[SPEAKER_18]: We've already been through that with the bollards.

455
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,376
[SPEAKER_18]: They've already been through that with pots.

456
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:43,679
[SPEAKER_18]: And the chief of police has said the mayor can decide at a moment's notice to put out whatever she wants to block things.

457
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:49,522
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't want to put signs because they're permanent and they would dig up what sidewalks still remain.

458
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:55,104
[SPEAKER_18]: But I did apologize to Brian because it would end up falling on him to put the barrels out.

459
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:59,566
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is how desperate we are for those four house lots to be blocked.

460
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:11,159
[SPEAKER_18]: so that we're able to get from our driveway, not walking the full length of Harvard Street, but just those four lots to get to what is called an 85% walkability square.

461
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,441
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not, it's zero, it's not safe.

462
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:20,607
[SPEAKER_18]: I proved it last week with the ProTech guy, just jumping the sidewalk, nevermind parking on the sidewalk or driving on it.

463
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:22,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing has changed.

464
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:24,490
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have the parking enforcement.

465
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,333
[SPEAKER_18]: They're off doing more critical details

466
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:31,359
[SPEAKER_18]: There's gas leaks all over the place.

467
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,460
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no one managing the traffic.

468
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:42,665
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go down Harvard Street and you see them doing a traffic repair where they've cut into a lane and a half of traffic, there isn't anyone available to run a detail for them.

469
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:46,267
[SPEAKER_18]: It's basically becoming chaos all over the city.

470
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:51,029
[SPEAKER_18]: We need more men on both DPW, but more important, on the police department.

471
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

472
00:45:55,907 --> 00:45:56,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, welcome.

473
00:45:57,027 --> 00:45:58,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

474
00:45:58,648 --> 00:45:59,548
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Robert Pente.

475
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:01,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

476
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a member of the Zagos Party.

477
00:46:03,729 --> 00:46:07,671
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this isn't the first time we're talking about police safety and security here within this community.

478
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:10,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I can remember Councilor De La Ruza when you first came on.

479
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:14,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of the priorities in this council was the police department in a public safety building.

480
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:18,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're here so many years later after the fact under a new administration.

481
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:24,596
[SPEAKER_11]: If you really want to have public safety be a real major concern, a major issue here within this council,

482
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,710
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a budget.

483
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:31,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was you, Councilor Falco, who said early on that you would like the budget process to be informed a little bit early.

484
00:46:31,473 --> 00:46:32,774
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that we've all asked about.

485
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:36,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks, you just alluded to having a wish list for which we don't have, we haven't seen.

486
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:42,779
[SPEAKER_11]: You are now coming into almost the end of May, and you have yet to have a budget presented before you.

487
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:45,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Surrounding cities and towns are already discussing it.

488
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:53,685
[SPEAKER_11]: If this council is really serious about public safety, they would hold the budget up, demand from the mayor, not only a time schedule,

489
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:59,016
[SPEAKER_11]: but the financial wherewithal to put a new police department together and to hire more police officers.

490
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:04,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think once that takes place, this administration knows that this Meffitt City Council is serious.

491
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're not just talking about it.

492
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:07,599
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not just referring to it.

493
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:08,999
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean business this time.

494
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:13,320
[SPEAKER_11]: We just had a very tragedy this past week with Officer Tarantino.

495
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,381
[SPEAKER_11]: His father was a Meffitt police officer.

496
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:20,602
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't a matter of whether black lives matter, white lives matter.

497
00:47:21,203 --> 00:47:22,543
[SPEAKER_11]: It's every life matters.

498
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:25,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what people have to understand when they look at a police officer.

499
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:37,349
[SPEAKER_11]: They're there each and every single day, just like a fireman, in the public safety realm of this community, to take care of the people that they were, how can you say, that they were charged to do.

500
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't do it asking for any recompense or any notoriety.

501
00:47:42,073 --> 00:47:42,913
[SPEAKER_11]: It's their job.

502
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's give them a break this time.

503
00:47:46,516 --> 00:47:49,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman Marks, you alluded to $8 million sitting in free cash.

504
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:52,320
[SPEAKER_11]: City of Marlin, a perfect example.

505
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:57,487
[SPEAKER_11]: They got $8 million, and they also got $8 million in grants toward a new police station.

506
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,049
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't even delved into this matter.

507
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:12,239
[SPEAKER_11]: You folks haven't even been called into a roundtable meeting with this administration to talk about this, not only as a priority, but as a necessary demand to keep our city safe.

508
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:17,803
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't have folks like Ian Fratz or Jeanne Martin coming up, and sometimes they may say, hey, they're a pain in the neck.

509
00:48:17,992 --> 00:48:20,233
[SPEAKER_11]: And you might even think that I'm a pain in the neck, but you know something?

510
00:48:20,653 --> 00:48:24,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind being the pain in the neck, because this is my community, and I love it.

511
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:35,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I served on this board for 36 years, and I have yet to see the Medford Police Department get what they really need, not only in more men and a new building, but a sense of priority here in this community.

512
00:48:35,961 --> 00:48:54,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I compare that and I look and see the nonsense that's going on in the school department, praising the superintendent for whatever he's doing, which can't even compare to what the Smithford Police Department and the Smithford Fire Department does on a daily basis protecting this community and every single one of us in this room, that to me should be the priority.

513
00:48:54,646 --> 00:49:03,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you really want to be strong about it, you would hold this mayor, Mayor Stephanie Burke, hold her feet to the ground and do not move on that budget until you get your answer.

514
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,931
[SPEAKER_11]: for more policemen and a new police department.

515
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Be happy to answer any questions if anybody has them.

516
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:10,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

517
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:14,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion.

518
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair awaits a motion.

519
00:49:22,703 --> 00:49:25,986
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello to receive in place on file.

520
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:30,089
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a Mr. Citizen wishes to come and speak.

521
00:49:30,537 --> 00:49:31,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, sir.

522
00:49:31,437 --> 00:49:33,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

523
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:34,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

524
00:49:35,258 --> 00:49:36,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

525
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:42,079
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dr. John Starello, and I just want to make a comment about holding up the budget.

526
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,039
[SPEAKER_00]: It will never happen.

527
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Our charter does not allow it.

528
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:56,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Our charter arranges for a majority of the city council to be programmed, and I say programmed, to pass the budget.

529
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:58,542
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be passed.

530
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,692
[SPEAKER_00]: at the last possible moment.

531
00:50:01,692 --> 00:50:02,572
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my prediction.

532
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Council, caveat to receive in place on file.

533
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:08,675
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

534
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,556
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

535
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:12,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

536
00:50:13,017 --> 00:50:15,778
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-508, offered by Vice President Lundell Kern.

537
00:50:16,238 --> 00:50:26,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the administration provide the city council with information on why $100,000 was taken from the city side to cover the deficit in the Edgeley Field account.

538
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:29,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the city council be informed

539
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:32,052
[SPEAKER_10]: as to which account the $100,000 came from.

540
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President, do we know that to be true?

541
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:36,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we do.

542
00:50:36,813 --> 00:50:40,893
[SPEAKER_15]: The superintendent wrote it to us, and he gave it in the packet on Wednesday night.

543
00:50:40,933 --> 00:50:41,874
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we all received it.

544
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:52,356
[SPEAKER_15]: State City Hall has recently made a transfer of $100,000 to assist in meeting the fiscal year 15 debt payment by supplementing the fund.

545
00:50:54,303 --> 00:51:00,665
[SPEAKER_15]: And because we made that transfer, Edgerly Field closes fiscal year 15 with a positive balance.

546
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:02,965
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, we were informed on Wednesday.

547
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:17,108
[SPEAKER_15]: We just weren't informed with regards to where on the city side this money has come from and why we've transferred it from the city side to the school side when the school side operates with over $50 million budget.

548
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:22,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to further amend it because the packet that we did get on Wednesday is kind of thick.

549
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,570
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of reading.

550
00:51:24,062 --> 00:51:37,448
[SPEAKER_15]: It also mentions $97,800 is paid from the city side to La Conte Rink.

551
00:51:38,268 --> 00:51:48,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could also get an update on why we're taking another almost $100,000 from the city side to La Conte Rink, there may be a very good explanation for it.

552
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:52,214
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just like to know where it's coming from, why it's being paid

553
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:56,710
[SPEAKER_15]: that operate under community schools, which obviously operates under.

554
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:00,453
[SPEAKER_10]: So just one moment, counselor, just a clarification.

555
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:10,379
[SPEAKER_10]: In the absence of the clerk, just if we all could be clear about what our amendments are.

556
00:52:10,759 --> 00:52:16,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're asking, so I can have some clarity to assist Mrs. Donahue.

557
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:21,106
[SPEAKER_10]: We are asking for an amendment to have

558
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:28,699
[SPEAKER_10]: an explanation on why $97,000 was taken to settle out La Conte Ring?

559
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:31,961
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if it's to settle out or if it's just a payment.

560
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:35,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe somebody on the council can explain that.

561
00:52:35,203 --> 00:52:48,051
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the last two years from, we were only given the last two years for La Conte, so reviewing that, it looks like there's $97,800 that comes from the City of Medford, and like I said, to La Conte Ring.

562
00:52:48,091 --> 00:52:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councillor Scarpelli.

563
00:52:52,031 --> 00:53:00,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that the rink is under the city, still in the city side, but is run by, scheduled by the athletic director.

564
00:53:00,054 --> 00:53:00,794
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only difference.

565
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can ask if that money needs to go within the system, but I believe it's in the city's budget, but it's scheduled through the athletic director.

566
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:12,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a school.

567
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:15,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's what we talked about.

568
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:18,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.

569
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:19,101
[SPEAKER_15]: So right.

570
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:21,142
[SPEAKER_15]: The athletic director oversees all aspects.

571
00:53:21,683 --> 00:53:30,668
[SPEAKER_15]: And it just, I mean, the money, I'm assuming either it's separate, it's coming through community schools, so whether that's city or school, I agree, I understand.

572
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:33,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpalla.

573
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,933
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I gather, it's not, community schools doesn't receive any monies.

574
00:53:38,593 --> 00:53:40,434
[SPEAKER_03]: All they do is schedule.

575
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:46,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes, all they do is schedule the money and the financial part is through the city, it's a city account.

576
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:48,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Constance.

577
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:56,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so my question still remains, why is there city money going to the La Conte rink, you know, 97-8?

578
00:53:57,274 --> 00:53:59,756
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm simply asking the question.

579
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:10,941
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the rink, we have the fields, we have community schools, and we have the pool, four functioning facilities that are, you know, supposed to generate money.

580
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:18,065
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe when we went out to bond for Edgerly Field in 2011, we were told this was going to be a self-sustaining

581
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:31,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Endeavor, it's about $255,000 in interest, $155,000 a year in principal, and we were told that that was going to be generated through revenues every year.

582
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:43,735
[SPEAKER_15]: And each year, it seems like we're coming up short, and this last year, for the fields, looks like we're shorter than ever at the $97,000—$93,000, I'm sorry.

583
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:47,357
[SPEAKER_15]: So, to be transferring money blatantly—I mean, I think, actually,

584
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:52,863
[SPEAKER_15]: by Pat Valley, who is the director of administration and finance for the schools.

585
00:54:53,363 --> 00:54:56,043
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we need to know this before budget time.

586
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:58,304
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there are enough, I could also further amend it.

587
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:03,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any other, that's the only two portions of money that are coming out of the general fund for the city.

588
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:15,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe, I would assume the general fund, but we're in the general fund coming out of the city and going towards these four independent pieces of property, revenue generating property within the city.

589
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:21,853
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to know if there's any other money that's also coming out from the city side to support any of these four facilities.

590
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:31,157
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of vice president, Lolo Kern as amended by vice vice president, Lugo current councilor night.

591
00:55:31,757 --> 00:55:39,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I think, um, uh, rather important question that we should be asking is why the school department is paying down this bond.

592
00:55:40,251 --> 00:55:50,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we take a look at all the other bonded debt that we have in the city, whether it be the science labs, the school pool, the rebuilding of our new schools, the debt was carried by the city side.

593
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:56,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this instance, and I can't think of any other instance that's occurring at this point in time or in the past.

594
00:55:57,163 --> 00:56:02,605
[SPEAKER_02]: where the school budget would actually be required to use their operational funds to fund the bonded debt.

595
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:07,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the real question is, why is the school department responsible for paying the bonded debt?

596
00:56:08,388 --> 00:56:09,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that not coming from the city side?

597
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:20,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as far as I can tell, and my research would indicate, that this is the only instance where that's happened in the history of the city since, you know, the last 20 years.

598
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:34,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's really the question to ask, Mr. President, is why is the school department being required to pay down the bond at Edgeley Field based on operating expenses, when every other bond in the community, including the new pool, including the building of the new schools, was covered through the city side?

599
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:35,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

600
00:56:35,273 --> 00:56:40,055
[SPEAKER_10]: So amended by Councilor Knight, that the question be asked to whom?

601
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:50,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the question would have to be asked to the budget director of the Office of Administration and Finance in the schools, in contrast with that of our

602
00:56:50,893 --> 00:56:52,734
[SPEAKER_02]: budget office here in the city, Mr. President.

603
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:56,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, why is this the best way to go about it in terms of, um, paying down the debt?

604
00:56:56,878 --> 00:57:00,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is the school department being saddled with this burden through their operational account?

605
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:06,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Because their ability to raise revenues is far more restricted than ours as, as the city government.

606
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:07,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

607
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:09,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

608
00:57:10,348 --> 00:57:13,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, chair, chair recognizes council members.

609
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:16,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

610
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:16,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh,

611
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to have been on the council when this came forward.

612
00:57:21,743 --> 00:57:33,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And when originally the Field of Dreams was in its infancy, there was a salt tower, as we all remember, which was going to pay for the field and the upkeep of the field.

613
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:36,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And that fell through.

614
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:47,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, I recall the mayor, it was Mayor McGlynn at the time, stating that they're going to be able to get a fair amount of revenue

615
00:57:47,575 --> 00:57:50,116
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Field of Dreams, Edgeley Field.

616
00:57:50,756 --> 00:57:57,779
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was going to pay for the bond and the interest, as well as any maintenance costs.

617
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:11,785
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure where along the line people in this community had a lapse of memory, because the superintendent the other night was at a public safety meeting, and he indeed said the same thing.

618
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:15,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And he even put it in an email to a resident

619
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:22,267
[SPEAKER_01]: that was kind enough to take the notes for the meeting, and Mr. Belson corrected the resident.

620
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:32,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could just read it, Mr. President, it says, the payment for the bonded indebtedness is always paid from the municipal account.

621
00:58:32,695 --> 00:58:37,659
[SPEAKER_01]: For some unknown reason, the Edgeley Field Bond was charged the school account.

622
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:45,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know why the superintendent has a lapse of memory, but he was superintendent at the time,

623
00:58:46,785 --> 00:58:49,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And when this issue was going on, it was known.

624
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:53,348
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't a secret how the bond was going to be paid for.

625
00:58:53,368 --> 00:58:57,870
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be paid through the revenues generated through the field.

626
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:04,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even have a copy, if anyone would like to take a look at it, boston.com, July 28, 2010.

627
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:09,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And the article's entitled, Field of Dreams Set for August Opening.

628
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:15,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, the city which footed the roughly $2 million bill for the fields

629
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:22,899
[SPEAKER_01]: expects to recoup much of the money it laid out by renting the facility during the fall, spring, and summer seasons.

630
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:29,865
[SPEAKER_01]: McGlynn said the rental fees will eventually help the city pay for the bond it took out to pay for the fields.

631
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:35,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not, I think people are trying to say something's wrong here.

632
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:42,277
[SPEAKER_01]: The superintendent alluded to the fact that this has never happened before for some unknown reason.

633
00:59:44,408 --> 00:59:51,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I missed something, but it wasn't unknown to me when I took the vote that this was going to be paid back by the revenues generated.

634
00:59:52,433 --> 01:00:13,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if the revenues aren't enough to pay for it, according to the Director of Administration and Finance, in her letter dated May 9, 2016, in the Facility Financial Activity Review, she quite emphatically states, operationally, the fund is able to cover expenses with revenue.

635
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:23,830
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the bond interest and principal payments are not sustainable by the fund, and as reflected, have eaten away at any balance created the first year of operation.

636
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:30,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Efforts are underway with City Hall to identify funding to redirect and structure the debt payments.

637
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:37,495
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently, that's already happening because the city administration gave $93,000 to the school department.

638
01:00:38,155 --> 01:00:38,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't vote on it.

639
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:42,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hear about it until I read it in this report.

640
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:46,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently there's money shifting back and forth.

641
01:00:46,861 --> 01:00:57,085
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not quite sure that the issue is whether or not the school side has to pick up the bond indebtedness.

642
01:00:57,505 --> 01:00:59,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a given, in my opinion.

643
01:01:00,227 --> 01:01:01,067
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact is that

644
01:01:01,352 --> 01:01:04,914
[SPEAKER_01]: the fields may not be generating the revenue that was anticipated.

645
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:05,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine.

646
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:18,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we have to look to pay for this bond another way, then we need to come forward and say that, but not to come out and say, uh, for some unknown reason, because the superintendent's a smart man.

647
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I, I think there are other smart people in this community and other people with memories.

648
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:28,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a good long memory of what took place.

649
01:01:29,617 --> 01:01:31,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Edgeley Field in fiscal 2015 generated $210,480.

650
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:31,658
[SPEAKER_01]: FY16 generated $172,982.

651
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:36,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly, that is not enough to pay for the maintenance and the bond indebtedness.

652
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,442
[SPEAKER_01]: But, Mr. President, it's clearly the responsibility of the school side

653
01:01:58,832 --> 01:01:59,513
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay for this.

654
01:02:00,253 --> 01:02:02,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no reservation about that.

655
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:10,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the discussion needs to be had with the school department and the school committee, then they should have those discussions.

656
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:24,090
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not trying to pull the wool over people's eyes and say that this was never a topic, it was never intended to be paid for by the school committee, by the school department, because that is quite emphatically untrue.

657
01:02:25,063 --> 01:02:29,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all received a copy of the RFP.

658
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:33,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess there was just another one voted on recently.

659
01:02:34,346 --> 01:02:48,832
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found it quite amazing, Mr. President, that this entity that may put up the bubble structure on Edgeley Field for the winter months, the city is going to charge them $75,000 in rental for those months.

660
01:02:53,289 --> 01:03:01,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it quite amazing that if you do the math, and I did it on the back of a sheet with a pencil, so it's not exact.

661
01:03:02,025 --> 01:03:16,148
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the hours that are in the RFP and the days that are in the RFP that this outside entity has control of the facility, it comes out to roughly $62.25 an hour.

662
01:03:16,689 --> 01:03:22,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the city of Meffitt's saying, OK, you want to go back there and practically own our whole edge of the field?

663
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:24,110
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to charge you $62.25.

664
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,451
[SPEAKER_01]: The amazing part about it, Mr. President,

665
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Scarpelli could probably speak better than I could on it.

666
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:43,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Method Yutzaka is currently paying, I believe it is $75 per hour for Edgeley Field.

667
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:48,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And under this RFP, and the way I understand it is,

668
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:53,956
[SPEAKER_01]: The fees aren't cemented yet, so I guess they haven't really figured it out yet.

669
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:59,819
[SPEAKER_01]: But the RFP calls for rentals to groups affiliated with the city of Meffitt.

670
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:05,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Meffitt Public Schools would pay $145 per hour.

671
01:04:06,903 --> 01:04:07,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.

672
01:04:07,884 --> 01:04:09,244
[SPEAKER_01]: The residents bonded this.

673
01:04:10,005 --> 01:04:13,827
[SPEAKER_01]: We all gave our money to put up $2 million to bond it.

674
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:15,368
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our edge of the field.

675
01:04:15,728 --> 01:04:16,388
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take it.

676
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:18,410
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give it to an outside entity.

677
01:04:19,412 --> 01:04:32,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have that outside entity make money off our bond that the residents paid for by charging our students, our youth groups, double the price to rent the fields.

678
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:35,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

679
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:43,623
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we want to get into the business of utilizing that field year round and put our own bubble, we should have that discussion then.

680
01:04:44,203 --> 01:04:45,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about it.

681
01:04:45,964 --> 01:04:48,505
[SPEAKER_01]: But to outsource it to an outside entity,

682
01:04:49,032 --> 01:05:04,057
[SPEAKER_01]: after the residents of this community are paying for the bond and then charging our own students and our own residents double the fee to use the field is a fleecing of the taxpayers of this community, Mr. President.

683
01:05:04,602 --> 01:05:06,263
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other way of stating it.

684
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, more needs to be done on this.

685
01:05:09,324 --> 01:05:12,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the school committee is moving forward on this.

686
01:05:12,665 --> 01:05:15,206
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me tell you, more needs to be done on this.

687
01:05:15,566 --> 01:05:16,706
[SPEAKER_01]: More needs to be looked at.

688
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:22,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I understand it is these prices don't even include the heating of the bubble.

689
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:26,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

690
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it goes with everything, soup to nuts.

691
01:05:31,711 --> 01:05:34,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with all the utilities and the staffing.

692
01:05:35,169 --> 01:05:36,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that may be the case.

693
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:37,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see that.

694
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:39,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rather large RFP.

695
01:05:40,251 --> 01:05:45,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see that, but, uh, the fee has doubled, uh, unless it gets changed again, who knows?

696
01:05:46,214 --> 01:05:59,640
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, as one member of this council, I'm not going to sit by, uh, after the residents are paying for this $2 million bond, giving it to an outside community, uh, an outside entity, uh, to make money off our residents.

697
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,340
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's happening.

698
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,128
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making money off our residents.

699
01:06:02,449 --> 01:06:05,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 10 years, according to the contract, we own the bubble.

700
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:08,250
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the bubble's going to look like in 10 years from now?

701
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:11,131
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble's going to be burst in 10 years from now.

702
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:15,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something we're going to want to inherit in 10 years from now.

703
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:19,254
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to take a closer look at this.

704
01:06:19,594 --> 01:06:20,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank Councilor Longo-Kern.

705
01:06:20,995 --> 01:06:26,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we get answers on this immediately, because this is taxpayer money that's being expended.

706
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:37,628
[SPEAKER_01]: In the interest of our youth sports, in the interest of our sports at Meffitt High School, this needs a closer scrutiny before it gets approved, Mr. President.

707
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:42,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Vice President.

708
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:43,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

709
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:49,652
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could further amend the paper in the first paragraph of the letter from Ms.

710
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:50,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Valle.

711
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:57,474
[SPEAKER_15]: It does mention that there is missing information in this packet with regards to personnel employed at the four

712
01:06:58,433 --> 01:07:01,216
[SPEAKER_15]: listed venues, that information will be ready.

713
01:07:01,576 --> 01:07:04,398
[SPEAKER_15]: It supposedly was ready on the 16th of May.

714
01:07:04,879 --> 01:07:11,704
[SPEAKER_15]: If the council could get a copy of that, a listing of the personnel employed at the four below listed venues.

715
01:07:15,007 --> 01:07:18,850
[SPEAKER_15]: I, too, agree there's definitely concerns with the bubble.

716
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:21,312
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a lot of pros and a lot of cons.

717
01:07:23,048 --> 01:07:25,750
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know the school committee is doing their due diligence.

718
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:30,292
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know they've gone through probably three or four copies of an RFP.

719
01:07:30,752 --> 01:07:32,193
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are true concerns.

720
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:36,315
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of my concerns is just the availability to Medford residents.

721
01:07:36,696 --> 01:07:38,857
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do understand it's the winter months.

722
01:07:38,977 --> 01:07:51,784
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you see kids wanting to get on those fields and a bubble back there, and they see that it's occupied every hour on the weekends by outside organizations and almost all

723
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:55,399
[SPEAKER_15]: afternoon by other, you know, organizations.

724
01:07:55,939 --> 01:08:02,042
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's a tough swallow when we're the ones paying for this bond and obviously the city side helping pay for that bond.

725
01:08:03,462 --> 01:08:04,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

726
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:12,326
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Vice President Longo-Curran as amended by Vice President Longo-Curran and Councilor Knight, just one moment, sir.

727
01:08:14,186 --> 01:08:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

728
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:16,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

729
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:20,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, would it be possible for all the council members to get a copy of the RFP?

730
01:08:23,368 --> 01:08:23,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it will.

731
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to make that as an amendment?

732
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:28,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like, I would like a copy of the RFP so I can speak intelligently also.

733
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:40,476
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Vice President Longo-Curran, as amended by Vice President Longo-Curran, Councilor Knight and Councilor Caviello, that the City Council receive a copy of the RSVP.

734
01:08:41,797 --> 01:08:41,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And?

735
01:08:42,717 --> 01:08:43,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

736
01:08:43,097 --> 01:08:44,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you know, I have the same concerns.

737
01:08:44,418 --> 01:08:47,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I said a few weeks ago, I hear the phone calls coming already.

738
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I, you know, we've heard them from other things.

739
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,662
[SPEAKER_05]: My kid goes to school there, and there's no room for us to play.

740
01:08:54,483 --> 01:08:59,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, before the phone calls start coming, I'd like to see the RFP, Mr. President.

741
01:09:00,547 --> 01:09:00,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

742
01:09:01,007 --> 01:09:02,108
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the RFP.

743
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:04,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Request for proposals.

744
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:08,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

745
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:08,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

746
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

747
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:13,937
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

748
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:16,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a member of the Sarkis party.

749
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd just like to say, and I brought this up about two or three weeks ago,

750
01:09:20,802 --> 01:09:21,563
[SPEAKER_11]: regarding the bubble.

751
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:25,687
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a bond council that wrote the bond proposal.

752
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:41,122
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think of this thing logically and you think it through, you're allowing a private for-profit business to come in and take advantage of a city's bond at the city's interest rate and for them to make a profit on city time, on city property.

753
01:09:41,922 --> 01:09:46,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if we're going to do that, are we opening up Pandora's box to the swimming pool?

754
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:49,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we opening up to the skating rink?

755
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:53,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we opening up to the new $14.5 million science labs that we have in the school?

756
01:09:53,300 --> 01:10:05,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything that we've had a bond that can have an effect upon the people within this community, we are now saying, come on in, pay us for what you think you want to pay us, and we'll entertain it if not accept it.

757
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,787
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Councilman Marks made an interesting comment a few weeks ago when we had this discussion as it relates to it.

758
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:15,329
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're putting so much time into the bubble, I wish they would put more time into the educational process.

759
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:16,172
[SPEAKER_11]: at the school.

760
01:10:16,932 --> 01:10:20,973
[SPEAKER_11]: They put a lot of time into hiring 5,000 administrators at over $95,000 a piece.

761
01:10:21,053 --> 01:10:28,314
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a matter of fact, one of them was one who was terminated from one school, but hired back up at the high school at $95,000.

762
01:10:29,035 --> 01:10:31,915
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of interest, a lot of input went into that.

763
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:35,856
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we look at this, you have a definitely, you have a legal question here.

764
01:10:36,456 --> 01:10:42,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this council voted, all seven of you voted to have a report back from the bond council.

765
01:10:43,017 --> 01:11:04,143
[SPEAKER_11]: From the bond counsel who wrote this for the city of Medford, the legal question is, can the city of Medford rent or lease this piece of property to a private for-profit company and then charge back the city of Medford for its use of the same property that they have leased for a measly $75,000 a year?

766
01:11:04,163 --> 01:11:05,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's all they give in the city of Medford.

767
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:10,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't forget, if you're right, Counselor Marks, if it's a 10-year deal and the city gets the bond,

768
01:11:11,288 --> 01:11:19,631
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not costing these people anything, because they will write this off on a tax write-off for 10 years for its use, especially if it's a for-profit business.

769
01:11:20,451 --> 01:11:22,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And what are we going to get at the very end as a community?

770
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:28,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever the repairs that are needed to take place are going to take place, and who's going to have to pay for the city?

771
01:11:29,134 --> 01:11:34,756
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the type of questions that would be great ballot questions to put out there during a general election.

772
01:11:35,396 --> 01:11:41,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if it's such a wonderful argument and a wonderful issue, the pros and cons of public hearings

773
01:11:41,487 --> 01:11:47,291
[SPEAKER_11]: and meetings at city council and at school committee meetings would serve the purpose of whether the people want this or not.

774
01:11:48,192 --> 01:12:04,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if I had a student up at the high school right now, I would be more concerned on the educational quality of where that student needs to go or would like to go rather than arguing over a bubble that might have some not only logistical, legal questions, but would have questions over the fact that what are we doing?

775
01:12:05,003 --> 01:12:05,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Taxpayers' money.

776
01:12:07,024 --> 01:12:10,987
[SPEAKER_11]: When we as members of the Memphis City Council voted for the science labs,

777
01:12:11,307 --> 01:12:14,049
[SPEAKER_11]: for the skating rink, for the swimming pool, and Edgeley Field.

778
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:23,917
[SPEAKER_11]: We were taking the taxpayers of Medford's money and the bond rating that we were getting at that particular time to purchase that piece of bond in behalf of the city of Medford.

779
01:12:25,058 --> 01:12:36,528
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not doing that now because what you're doing is you're abdicating the responsibility of the bond responsibility by the city and you're allowing an outside for-profit business to come in here, take advantage of it,

780
01:12:36,923 --> 01:12:46,786
[SPEAKER_11]: and pay the city a measly $75 an hour, $75,000 a year, while at the same time make thousands and hundreds and thousands of dollars over the life of the bubble.

781
01:12:47,787 --> 01:12:49,107
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not good financing.

782
01:12:49,387 --> 01:12:50,728
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't make good sense to me.

783
01:12:51,428 --> 01:12:56,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this needs a lot more attention to the fact that you need all the legal questions asked.

784
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:59,851
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you really need to compare this with this upcoming budget in the school department.

785
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:05,448
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes a huge difference as it relates to where priorities are going.

786
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:08,069
[SPEAKER_11]: We just got through talking about public safety, policemen.

787
01:13:08,109 --> 01:13:09,610
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about a new police station.

788
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you're talking now about a bubble.

789
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:24,375
[SPEAKER_11]: And before the bubble bursts on the city of Medford and you get stuck with a financial boondoggle, I think we need to say, let's slow down and let's really take a look and see what's going on, because that's what this is all about.

790
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:25,595
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your money.

791
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:26,335
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our money.

792
01:13:26,675 --> 01:13:27,536
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the city's money.

793
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:28,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It's everybody's money.

794
01:13:29,373 --> 01:13:46,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're going to allow a private for-profit business to come in and take advantage of our community and our real estate to the detriment of our city, for a measly $75,000, then you're really selling yourself short, and you're selling the taxpayers short.

795
01:13:47,336 --> 01:13:47,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

796
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:56,218
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair recognizes Vice President Longo-Kern.

797
01:13:56,678 --> 01:13:57,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

798
01:13:57,078 --> 01:13:58,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Mr. President.

799
01:13:58,989 --> 01:14:09,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Just while we're on the topic of the four facilities, it's showing, if I'm reading it correctly, it's showing, might as well ask all my questions now rather than wait till we meet with the superintendent.

800
01:14:09,634 --> 01:14:17,739
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like the community schools is in deficit for 2016 currently at 117,000, and then the pool is at a loss as well, deficit 41,000.

801
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:32,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could get an update with regards to how those two facilities are going to be funded.

802
01:14:32,736 --> 01:14:43,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it does mention that there's a balance that the community schools in the front page says the community schools funds are going to balance out the pool budget.

803
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,622
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm not sure how that's going to happen when the community schools is running at $117,000 deficit.

804
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:49,782
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could just ask that question.

805
01:14:49,802 --> 01:14:54,064
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion by Vice President Longo-Kern as amended by Vice President Longo-Kern

806
01:14:54,558 --> 01:15:15,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilors Knight and Caviello, and further amended by Vice President Lungo Kern, that the administration report back to the City Council as to how and why the pool and community school budgets are in deficit, and how, in fact, it will be that they will balance themselves out.

807
01:15:16,152 --> 01:15:17,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct, Madam Vice President?

808
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:18,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, thank you.

809
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:19,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

810
01:15:33,205 --> 01:15:34,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Martins.

811
01:15:35,106 --> 01:15:36,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

812
01:15:36,626 --> 01:15:40,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And just one other aspect of the very lengthy RFP.

813
01:15:40,548 --> 01:15:47,990
[SPEAKER_01]: It also states that this outside entity will be responsible for any snow removal leading up to the site.

814
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:55,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case they don't provide snow removal, the city of Method will provide snow removal and then get reimbursed.

815
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:56,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.

816
01:15:56,353 --> 01:16:02,195
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have our manpower getting off the streets and doing what they need to do, freeing up the schools and

817
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:10,125
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing parking lots and everything else to go clean this for a men's soccer league that has nothing to do with the city.

818
01:16:10,545 --> 01:16:12,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things in here, Mr. President.

819
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:18,929
[SPEAKER_01]: If we start going through it line by line, I don't see how this is paying off for our community.

820
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:20,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

821
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:20,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

822
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,691
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion as amended, all those in favor?

823
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:25,072
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

824
01:16:25,112 --> 01:16:28,373
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

825
01:16:28,393 --> 01:16:30,414
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-509, offered by Councilor Falco.

826
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:33,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas the city of Medford is made up of many different neighborhoods.

827
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:50,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas these neighborhoods are unique and have their own different concerns and issues be resolved that the Medford city council request that beginning in September metric police department hold their monthly community meetings in each sector of the city.

828
01:16:50,863 --> 01:16:51,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Falco.

829
01:16:52,124 --> 01:16:53,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

830
01:16:53,185 --> 01:16:59,510
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to begin by, uh, um, just saying, uh, that the public safety meeting that we had last week was very,

831
01:16:59,858 --> 01:17:01,359
[SPEAKER_12]: informative, very educational.

832
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:04,702
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, it's something that I agree we should have on a regular basis.

833
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:06,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would help us all.

834
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:10,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, but tonight's resolution is about working together to protect our neighborhoods.

835
01:17:10,746 --> 01:17:17,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, once a month down at the Medford police station, there's a monthly meeting where residents can come and talk about the different issues in their neighborhood.

836
01:17:18,772 --> 01:17:21,313
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a, it's a, it's a very informative meeting.

837
01:17:21,353 --> 01:17:22,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been there before.

838
01:17:22,274 --> 01:17:26,317
[SPEAKER_12]: I have learned a lot and it's always good to see what's going on in each of the different neighborhoods.

839
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:39,376
[SPEAKER_12]: But I believe the meetings could be more productive and engage more citizens if we could actually maybe take those meetings on the road and take them to each of the, uh, the police department divides the city into four different sectors.

840
01:17:39,396 --> 01:17:45,422
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be nice if we could actually have those meetings, um, you know, in each sector of the city.

841
01:17:46,002 --> 01:17:55,470
[SPEAKER_12]: So therefore the residents can go to the meeting in their neighborhood and actually talk to the police officers that actually work that neighborhood, get to know them,

842
01:17:55,925 --> 01:18:03,408
[SPEAKER_12]: they can get to know the issues and everybody can work together to actually solve some of the city's problems with regard to crime.

843
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:06,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I think there'd be very informative.

844
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,270
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a lot of benefits.

845
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:10,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, we talked about crime data.

846
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:21,896
[SPEAKER_12]: If we actually got that person, if chief SACRA actually got that person in the budget that was collecting crime data and you could go over that, you know, in a neighborhood meeting and find out what's going on in your neighborhood.

847
01:18:22,017 --> 01:18:22,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just think it's better,

848
01:18:23,623 --> 01:18:24,223
[SPEAKER_12]: for our neighborhoods.

849
01:18:24,263 --> 01:18:25,424
[SPEAKER_12]: It helps educate everyone.

850
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:26,744
[SPEAKER_12]: We all keep an eye out for each other.

851
01:18:26,925 --> 01:18:30,466
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just think it's a good way of bringing everybody together.

852
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:38,029
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why I said let's start in September is because they don't meet in July and August, and the last meeting's in June.

853
01:18:38,309 --> 01:18:40,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think September would be a good starting date.

854
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:44,112
[SPEAKER_12]: If you did September, October, November, and December, you could hit all sectors of the city.

855
01:18:44,532 --> 01:18:51,395
[SPEAKER_12]: And that wouldn't limit to just, you know, I want to be clear, it's not like if we had the meeting in Wellington

856
01:18:52,543 --> 01:18:53,804
[SPEAKER_12]: you just talk about Wellington issues.

857
01:18:54,004 --> 01:19:06,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone could go to talk about any issue, but it would be in that sector of the city and you know, the residents, you know, hopefully there'll be a lot of people from that sector there, uh, to talk about the issues that happen or occur in that neighborhood.

858
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,551
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, everyone is welcome.

859
01:19:08,671 --> 01:19:10,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody could talk about any issue that they want to.

860
01:19:11,232 --> 01:19:13,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I, I think this is a, in my opinion, it's a good plan.

861
01:19:14,034 --> 01:19:15,114
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's something that we should do.

862
01:19:15,574 --> 01:19:18,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's something that's long overdue and I think it would definitely bring the community together.

863
01:19:19,316 --> 01:19:20,577
[SPEAKER_12]: So, uh, I'd like to move approval.

864
01:19:21,638 --> 01:19:27,883
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight, an excellent measure, Councilor.

865
01:19:27,983 --> 01:19:28,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

866
01:19:28,523 --> 01:19:37,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And I must say the idea of starting in September is beneficial in a number of ways, especially since it's a season of enthusiasm and rebirth in many ways.

867
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:38,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I would agree.

868
01:19:38,911 --> 01:19:40,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's back from summer vacation.

869
01:19:40,612 --> 01:19:41,312
[SPEAKER_12]: They're well rested.

870
01:19:41,332 --> 01:19:41,973
[SPEAKER_12]: They're ready to go.

871
01:19:42,453 --> 01:19:42,993
[SPEAKER_12]: They're involved.

872
01:19:43,014 --> 01:19:43,654
[SPEAKER_12]: They're engaged.

873
01:19:43,714 --> 01:19:47,737
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, it'd be nice to actually have the residents from each of the neighborhoods

874
01:19:48,133 --> 01:19:51,894
[SPEAKER_12]: come to the meeting and be engaged in the process and what's going on, and we can all help each other out.

875
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:53,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

876
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Citizen, if you would please state your name and address for the record.

877
01:19:56,816 --> 01:19:57,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

878
01:19:57,196 --> 01:20:04,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and I agree with you that this is a wonderful idea, and I think it's great.

879
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:08,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring the show on the road, and bring it to the neighborhoods, and

880
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:10,692
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you'll get more participation, hopefully.

881
01:20:11,392 --> 01:20:11,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully.

882
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:14,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Some neighborhoods you still won't get a response, trust me.

883
01:20:14,874 --> 01:20:17,236
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can always try.

884
01:20:17,736 --> 01:20:18,536
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's right.

885
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:24,659
[SPEAKER_14]: But my point is, is that we're asking for the police to come out again and do something for us.

886
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,840
[SPEAKER_14]: What are we going to do for the police?

887
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not pointing fingers at you.

888
01:20:27,581 --> 01:20:28,001
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

889
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:34,345
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm saying as a body, what are we doing for the police to motivate them?

890
01:20:34,845 --> 01:20:36,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we keep asking for them to do

891
01:20:37,323 --> 01:20:43,044
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, patrols and community organizing and community policing and everything else.

892
01:20:43,465 --> 01:21:05,190
[SPEAKER_14]: But like Mr. Pender said, if the place that you guys can show your voice is not to approve the budget unless there's more money for the police department, whether it be for the police building, whether it be for more police officers, then that's when we can show that we're willing, even if it's two officers, it doesn't have to be 20 all at once.

893
01:21:05,868 --> 01:21:08,729
[SPEAKER_14]: And things like cruises should be on a regular budget anyway.

894
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:13,571
[SPEAKER_14]: We should get two new cruises every year no matter what because they're always on the road and they're always working.

895
01:21:13,991 --> 01:21:15,372
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, what are we going to do?

896
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:19,553
[SPEAKER_14]: But cruises are small potatoes because we really do need personnel and we need a new building.

897
01:21:20,034 --> 01:21:21,994
[SPEAKER_14]: So what are we doing for them?

898
01:21:22,014 --> 01:21:28,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Because again, we keep asking of them, but I don't see the hand going back to the other side.

899
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:30,798
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not pointing to you because I think it's a great idea.

900
01:21:31,098 --> 01:21:31,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

901
01:21:31,398 --> 01:21:31,838
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.

902
01:21:31,918 --> 01:21:32,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

903
01:21:32,599 --> 01:21:33,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's wonderful.

904
01:21:33,953 --> 01:21:36,074
[SPEAKER_14]: but I just wanted to make that note.

905
01:21:36,094 --> 01:21:36,954
[SPEAKER_12]: You bring up a good point.

906
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:41,796
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that, you know, the public safety, uh, meeting was, I think very beneficial.

907
01:21:41,836 --> 01:21:52,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I know to me, I think everyone involved, uh, it was nice to actually, uh, you know, listen to the chief and just find out his wants and needs with regard to law enforcement.

908
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:59,123
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, you know, to me, that's very beneficial because he's there and, uh, officer McGilvery was there as well.

909
01:21:59,263 --> 01:21:59,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean,

910
01:21:59,943 --> 01:22:01,083
[SPEAKER_12]: He's in the trenches every day.

911
01:22:01,143 --> 01:22:02,604
[SPEAKER_12]: He sees what's going on in the streets.

912
01:22:02,644 --> 01:22:12,386
[SPEAKER_12]: He can actually tell you firsthand, the chief can too, what they need, what their wants are, their needs are, what would they like to see added to the police department with regard to personnel and whatnot.

913
01:22:12,446 --> 01:22:13,686
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was very beneficial.

914
01:22:13,746 --> 01:22:17,527
[SPEAKER_12]: I think with regard to the budget, we need to make some serious decisions there.

915
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:22,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hoping that we get a budget soon, but public safety needs to be a top priority.

916
01:22:22,728 --> 01:22:26,389
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think money definitely needs to be infused

917
01:22:27,118 --> 01:22:29,058
[SPEAKER_12]: into the police department.

918
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:34,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to ask the public, what are we willing to sacrifice to have these new police officers?

919
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:41,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's going to have to come out of some fund someplace, whether it's the bubble or the skate rink or a park.

920
01:22:41,781 --> 01:22:46,242
[SPEAKER_14]: What are we willing to sacrifice to have this happen, unfortunately?

921
01:22:46,423 --> 01:22:51,044
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are certain things that shouldn't be questioned, like we need another teacher for English.

922
01:22:51,344 --> 01:22:52,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard we had a shortage of that.

923
01:22:53,064 --> 01:22:54,864
[SPEAKER_14]: So that shouldn't be on the docket.

924
01:22:54,885 --> 01:22:56,885
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are other places where we can come up with funds.

925
01:22:57,507 --> 01:22:59,088
[SPEAKER_14]: for two officers for this year.

926
01:22:59,468 --> 01:23:00,569
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a big ask.

927
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's a big ask.

928
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:03,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

929
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:04,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

930
01:23:05,191 --> 01:23:05,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, sir.

931
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:06,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

932
01:23:06,651 --> 01:23:08,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

933
01:23:08,372 --> 01:23:10,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Dave Champy, 35 Greenhall Street.

934
01:23:11,394 --> 01:23:14,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Falco, that's an excellent proposal.

935
01:23:15,476 --> 01:23:16,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Undoable.

936
01:23:18,017 --> 01:23:22,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you try to arrange the venues for these meetings?

937
01:23:25,441 --> 01:23:25,901
[SPEAKER_12]: I've tried.

938
01:23:26,816 --> 01:23:28,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I will tell you right here tonight.

939
01:23:29,597 --> 01:23:31,839
[SPEAKER_12]: I will take it on myself and I will organize all four meetings.

940
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:32,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

941
01:23:33,019 --> 01:23:33,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

942
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Most best response we've got from the council in a long time.

943
01:23:37,001 --> 01:23:37,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

944
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:39,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

945
01:23:39,643 --> 01:23:45,406
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Falco and seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor.

946
01:23:47,307 --> 01:23:49,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote has been requested.

01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:53,350

949
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:53,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

950
01:23:54,471 --> 01:23:55,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Pelco.

951
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:55,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

952
01:23:56,092 --> 01:23:56,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

953
01:23:56,752 --> 01:23:56,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

954
01:23:57,733 --> 01:23:58,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice-President Lockhart.

955
01:23:58,613 --> 01:23:58,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

956
01:23:59,694 --> 01:24:00,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Matz.

957
01:24:00,254 --> 01:24:00,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

958
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scapelli.

959
01:24:02,415 --> 01:24:02,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

960
01:24:03,376 --> 01:24:04,036
[SPEAKER_13]: President George.

961
01:24:04,116 --> 01:24:04,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

962
01:24:04,637 --> 01:24:07,998
[SPEAKER_10]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

963
01:24:08,018 --> 01:24:19,985
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-510 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate John Jack Buckley for his many years of service to the city of Medford.

964
01:24:20,025 --> 01:24:22,046
[SPEAKER_10]: As a member of the Medford School Committee,

965
01:24:22,379 --> 01:24:26,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Director of Public Works, Project Manor, and Hormel Commission Chairperson.

966
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:34,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that Mr. Buckley be invited to a future council meeting to receive an official council commendation.

967
01:24:34,762 --> 01:24:35,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

968
01:24:36,062 --> 01:24:37,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

969
01:24:38,362 --> 01:24:41,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of us behind this rail and many of us in this community know John Jack Buckley.

970
01:24:41,503 --> 01:24:44,544
[SPEAKER_02]: He's served our community diligently for many, many years.

971
01:24:44,764 --> 01:24:48,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Jack was a school committee member when I was in elementary school.

972
01:24:48,545 --> 01:24:49,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the good fortune of growing up

973
01:24:50,873 --> 01:24:54,816
[SPEAKER_02]: a neighbor to him, and he's been a great asset to our community, Mr. President.

974
01:24:55,676 --> 01:25:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Last month was his last meeting as the chairperson of the Hormel Commission, and he has stepped down from public service at this point in time, and he is officially retired.

975
01:25:04,222 --> 01:25:19,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Buckley and thank him for all the work that he's done on behalf of the citizenry here in Medford, and I'd also like to have him come down to a council meeting and receive an official council commendation highlighting and denoting his many years of service that we appreciate here in the city.

976
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:21,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Jack, and thank you, Councilor Knight.

977
01:25:22,088 --> 01:25:24,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Caviello on the motion of approval.

978
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:25,530
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

979
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:26,571
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

980
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:27,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

981
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:30,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

982
01:25:30,033 --> 01:25:40,918
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-511, petition by Dr. John Stirella, 20 Metcalfe Street, Medford, Mass., to address the Council about the founding fathers in Medford.

983
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:43,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the petitioner present?

984
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:01,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening and welcome.

985
01:26:01,711 --> 01:26:03,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

986
01:26:05,836 --> 01:26:06,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

987
01:26:07,338 --> 01:26:15,408
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, I would like to set up my teleprompter and proceed.

988
01:26:33,844 --> 01:26:34,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

989
01:26:35,525 --> 01:26:47,409
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Dr. John Storella of 20 Metcalf Street in Medford, speaking on the Founding Fathers and Medford.

990
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:59,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, Mr. President, some younger residents have asked me about my background, so I want to humbly offer this short resume for the record.

991
01:27:01,213 --> 01:27:02,094
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in 1924.

992
01:27:04,332 --> 01:27:08,155
[SPEAKER_00]: when Calvin Coolidge was President of the United States.

993
01:27:09,916 --> 01:27:18,103
[SPEAKER_00]: When World War II broke out in December 1941, I was 17 years old and volunteered to serve in the Navy.

994
01:27:19,704 --> 01:27:32,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I was assigned to a small amphibious ship called an LSM, which is a landing ship medium, in the North Atlantic Fleet, and became gunnery and communications officer.

995
01:27:33,944 --> 01:27:42,129
[SPEAKER_00]: When the war in Europe was won in 1945, I was assigned to train my crew for the invasion of Japan.

996
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:45,691
[SPEAKER_00]: And so was Jake Keating.

997
01:27:46,211 --> 01:27:48,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may remember him.

998
01:27:49,914 --> 01:27:54,456
[SPEAKER_00]: He is Medford's deceased police chief and city councilor.

999
01:27:55,877 --> 01:28:00,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately for us, the atom bomb suddenly ended the war.

1000
01:28:01,437 --> 01:28:06,581
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing the loss of hundreds of thousands of American and Japanese lives.

1001
01:28:09,823 --> 01:28:21,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I returned to school after the war and received a bachelor of science degree from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.

1002
01:28:22,652 --> 01:28:29,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I received a doctor's degree from the Columbia School of Dental and Oral Surgery, and last month,

1003
01:28:30,117 --> 01:28:34,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended my 65th graduation reunion at Columbia in New York City.

1004
01:28:36,762 --> 01:28:41,906
[SPEAKER_00]: In between, I had interned at the Creedmoor Hospital in Queens, New York.

1005
01:28:43,247 --> 01:28:52,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught clinical pathology at Tufts University and practiced for 44 years in East Boston, serving a needy population.

1006
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:59,899
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1960s, I contributed to the development of dental implants and was invited

1007
01:29:00,465 --> 01:29:05,849
[SPEAKER_00]: to the first international symposium on dental implantology in Paris, France.

1008
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:13,715
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, I have been retired for 21 years and enjoying my retirement.

1009
01:29:15,716 --> 01:29:22,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to assure all the people in government that my presentation is not personal.

1010
01:29:24,003 --> 01:29:26,745
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on philosophy and principle.

1011
01:29:28,066 --> 01:29:29,867
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not directed at anybody.

1012
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:33,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not here to judge anybody.

1013
01:29:35,288 --> 01:29:48,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider all of you in government my friends, and I mean to give you my energetic and materialistic support to the best of my ability if you should have the private need.

1014
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:59,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, I honestly believe in a prayer that says, it is in giving that we receive.

1015
01:30:01,337 --> 01:30:02,458
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we receive?

1016
01:30:04,259 --> 01:30:06,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We receive joy and peace.

1017
01:30:09,464 --> 01:30:18,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it was only 240 years ago, back in 1776, that the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence from the oppressive ruler of England.

1018
01:30:19,552 --> 01:30:25,416
[SPEAKER_00]: They pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for liberty.

1019
01:30:26,937 --> 01:30:27,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it.

1020
01:30:29,059 --> 01:30:39,026
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of us would do that today, pledge our lives, our fortunes, our sacred honor for the hope of liberty?

1021
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:48,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the founding fathers embarked on a war of seven years against the most powerful nation in the world at that time.

1022
01:30:49,293 --> 01:30:57,539
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a war filled with starvation, disease, and sacrifice, which the patriots barely won with a lot of luck.

1023
01:30:58,738 --> 01:31:16,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Abigail Adams, who was born here in Weymouth and was the wife of our second president, John Adams, said, austerity, who are to reap the blessings, will scarcely be able to conceive the hardships and sufferings of their ancestors.

1024
01:31:18,847 --> 01:31:26,690
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only 229 years ago that the founding fathers set up a government to serve the people, not themselves.

1025
01:31:27,832 --> 01:31:28,732
[SPEAKER_00]: but all the people.

1026
01:31:29,993 --> 01:31:38,977
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to serve the people, they wrote a constitution, which established a government with checks and balances within the government.

1027
01:31:40,977 --> 01:31:50,121
[SPEAKER_00]: They accomplished this by having three branches of government, an executive, a legislative, and a judicial, with each one able to check excessive power by the other two.

1028
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:56,904
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first time in history that a nation of people shaped and formed

1029
01:31:57,335 --> 01:32:02,057
[SPEAKER_00]: their own government, and all 13 colonies voted for it.

1030
01:32:03,057 --> 01:32:09,580
[SPEAKER_00]: John Adams said, the happiness of the people is the purpose of government.

1031
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:26,746
[SPEAKER_00]: And since happiness is derived from virtue, that form of government, with virtue as its foundation, is more likely than any other to promote general happiness.

1032
01:32:28,787 --> 01:32:47,256
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea was to give patriots, to have the patriots serve in the government for a short period of time at small compensation, and then to return home to their occupations and live under the same laws that they had passed, and give other patriots a chance to serve the people.

1033
01:32:48,477 --> 01:32:51,819
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they believed in term limitation.

1034
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:58,162
[SPEAKER_00]: After one four-year term, George Washington, the first president, wished to retire.

1035
01:32:59,345 --> 01:33:03,487
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nation wanted him to stay on because there was no replacement of Washington's stature.

1036
01:33:04,568 --> 01:33:10,951
[SPEAKER_00]: And he stayed for one more term with some self-doubt, and then retired happily to Mount Vernon.

1037
01:33:13,112 --> 01:33:23,238
[SPEAKER_00]: No other president served more than two terms until Franklin Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms during the Great Depression, which was followed by World War II.

1038
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:27,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, seeing the harm done, the nation ratified the 22nd Amendment,

1039
01:33:29,603 --> 01:33:31,705
[SPEAKER_00]: setting a limit of two terms.

1040
01:33:33,687 --> 01:33:49,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 1787, after the Revolutionary War was won, Benjamin Franklin at the Constitutional Convention said, quote, there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the affairs of men.

1041
01:33:50,941 --> 01:33:53,644
[SPEAKER_00]: They are ambition and avarice.

1042
01:33:55,645 --> 01:33:57,327
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the love of money.

1043
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:00,787
[SPEAKER_00]: and two, the love of power.

1044
01:34:02,288 --> 01:34:06,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Separately, each of these has great force in prompting men to action.

1045
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:13,970
[SPEAKER_00]: But when united in view of the same object, they have in many minds violent effects.

1046
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:25,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Placed before the eyes of such men a post of honor that shall at the same time be a place of profit, and they will move heaven and earth to obtain it."

1047
01:34:26,872 --> 01:34:27,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Close quote.

1048
01:34:28,035 --> 01:34:38,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Benjamin Franklin went on to say, though we may set out in the beginning with moderate salaries, we shall find that such will not be of long continuance.

1049
01:34:39,158 --> 01:34:55,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasons will never be lacking for proposed augmentations, and there will always be a party for giving more to the rulers that the rulers may be able in return to give more to them.

1050
01:34:55,341 --> 01:34:57,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, as all history informs us,

1051
01:34:58,688 --> 01:35:09,231
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been in every state and kingdom a constant warfare between the governing and the governed, the one striving to obtain more for its support and the other to pay less."

1052
01:35:09,632 --> 01:35:10,112
[SPEAKER_00]: End of quote.

1053
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:17,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Benjamin Franklin was trying to make government unattractive to people motivated primarily by power and money.

1054
01:35:18,675 --> 01:35:25,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And his prediction of giving more and more to the rulers has been demonstrated right here in Medford.

1055
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:33,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Salaries for incumbents have increased year after year after year.

1056
01:35:34,515 --> 01:35:45,603
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the result of having career politicians and why Thomas Jefferson, our third president, said that he supported mandatory rotation in office.

1057
01:35:47,684 --> 01:35:50,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that leads us to the plight of the people of Medford.

1058
01:35:51,828 --> 01:35:56,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Abraham Lincoln spoke of government of the people, by the people, for the people.

1059
01:35:58,054 --> 01:36:00,895
[SPEAKER_00]: But what government do we have here in Medford?

1060
01:36:01,815 --> 01:36:10,319
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, we have government of the mayor, by the city council, for the public employees.

1061
01:36:11,339 --> 01:36:14,800
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what our charter of a strong mayor has done to us.

1062
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:18,602
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, we have government for the people.

1063
01:36:19,602 --> 01:36:23,824
[SPEAKER_00]: But in practice, in reality, we have little democracy.

1064
01:36:24,944 --> 01:36:26,465
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small city like Medford,

1065
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:34,644
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be easy to include the people, but the people are rarely consulted on major issues.

1066
01:36:36,545 --> 01:36:52,456
[SPEAKER_00]: James Madison, our fourth president, said, the accumulation of power in the hands, in the same hands, even if elected, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.

1067
01:36:54,037 --> 01:36:55,398
[SPEAKER_00]: The political philosophers say

1068
01:36:55,803 --> 01:36:57,944
[SPEAKER_00]: that people get the government they deserve.

1069
01:36:59,184 --> 01:37:00,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not agree with that nonsense.

1070
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:07,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree that the people, by not voting, commit an act of omission.

1071
01:37:08,428 --> 01:37:16,090
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ruling elite commit a sin of commission by serving themselves instead of the people.

1072
01:37:18,351 --> 01:37:23,553
[SPEAKER_00]: The people may want to make some changes in Medford Charter, but the process is so complicated

1073
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:28,540
[SPEAKER_00]: and take so many years that the establishment will not allow it.

1074
01:37:29,701 --> 01:37:30,721
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that recently.

1075
01:37:31,662 --> 01:37:35,123
[SPEAKER_00]: The establishment loves the present charter as it is.

1076
01:37:36,543 --> 01:37:39,704
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the plight of the people of Medford.

1077
01:37:41,165 --> 01:37:45,146
[SPEAKER_00]: No government of the people, by the people, for the people.

1078
01:37:46,287 --> 01:37:50,108
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, there is precious little democracy.

1079
01:37:51,849 --> 01:37:52,569
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion,

1080
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:56,136
[SPEAKER_00]: The people of Medford are good people.

1081
01:37:57,737 --> 01:37:59,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are altruistic.

1082
01:38:01,258 --> 01:38:10,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them will serve at no compensation or benefit to themselves for a short period of time and then leave like the founding fathers.

1083
01:38:12,522 --> 01:38:21,646
[SPEAKER_00]: We must elect those charitable people to make this a better world, which means to make this a better Medford.

1084
01:38:23,635 --> 01:38:28,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while we are here, Medford is our world.

1085
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:30,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1086
01:38:35,983 --> 01:38:36,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Doctor.

1087
01:38:39,465 --> 01:38:40,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair awaits motion.

1088
01:38:43,788 --> 01:38:45,910
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Council night to receive and place on file.

1089
01:38:49,872 --> 01:38:51,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1090
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Method, Massachusetts.

1091
01:39:01,045 --> 01:39:02,507
[SPEAKER_16]: It was great to hear Dr. Starella.

1092
01:39:03,167 --> 01:39:09,573
[SPEAKER_16]: He's always so profound, and it ain't easy to follow him.

1093
01:39:10,914 --> 01:39:13,396
[SPEAKER_16]: However, on this subject of U.S.

1094
01:39:13,436 --> 01:39:14,297
[SPEAKER_16]: government, I liked it.

1095
01:39:14,737 --> 01:39:22,304
[SPEAKER_16]: He reminded me of some things that have been bouncing around in my head of late, especially with these elections that are coming up on a national level.

1096
01:39:24,787 --> 01:39:35,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, I feel that I've been lied to back in elementary school in Somerville and when I finished the kindergarten at the Hancock School.

1097
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,722
[SPEAKER_16]: They told me it was a democracy.

1098
01:39:42,865 --> 01:39:43,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think so.

1099
01:39:45,527 --> 01:39:48,911
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more like a capital C, capitalism.

1100
01:39:52,040 --> 01:40:16,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Bernie Sanders, I believe, is right in one area for sure, that the Supreme Court allowed Citizens United to exist as an entity a few years back, and it was by a five to four Supreme Court vote.

1101
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:18,879
[SPEAKER_16]: and Mr. Scalia is gone.

1102
01:40:19,539 --> 01:40:23,061
[SPEAKER_16]: So now it might be a draw if it came back before the Supreme Court.

1103
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:28,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Citizens United, a lot of people don't know what that means.

1104
01:40:28,684 --> 01:40:31,085
[SPEAKER_16]: They think it's a wonderful two words put together.

1105
01:40:32,045 --> 01:40:45,912
[SPEAKER_16]: But in reality, the way I understand it, it allows that entity to collect unlimited money, funds, different currencies worldwide,

1106
01:40:46,887 --> 01:41:02,690
[SPEAKER_16]: from you and I or from China, Russia, Soviet Union, it doesn't matter, England, and big conglomerates in this country, big oil, et cetera.

1107
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:09,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Rupert Murdoch controls newspapers by the hundreds worldwide.

1108
01:41:12,512 --> 01:41:15,252
[SPEAKER_16]: So they collect unlimited funds, unlimited.

1109
01:41:17,042 --> 01:41:22,925
[SPEAKER_16]: And furthermore, they do not have to disclose where they received any of these funds.

1110
01:41:25,487 --> 01:41:46,038
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm thinking maybe they are the ones that create these super PACs and give it to hopefully their next political puppet that they want as a leader of the United States of America.

1111
01:41:47,252 --> 01:42:07,889
[SPEAKER_16]: whoever that might be on either side does not matter because they want that person to win with all the monies that were collected, illicit and unknown locations, and they don't want the apple cart to be upset in Washington, D.C.

1112
01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:16,756
[SPEAKER_16]: So even the Republicans, they don't want Trump, they don't want Cruz, but they're going to allow

1113
01:42:17,627 --> 01:42:22,111
[SPEAKER_16]: maybe Mrs. Hillary, to win the next four years.

1114
01:42:24,993 --> 01:42:32,419
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they're willing to give up four years in order not to upset their apple cart in Washington, D.C.

1115
01:42:32,999 --> 01:42:36,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, the Sicilians are right to fish for us from the head down.

1116
01:42:38,323 --> 01:42:39,784
[SPEAKER_16]: It starts in Washington, D.C.

1117
01:42:40,285 --> 01:42:43,167
[SPEAKER_16]: It comes to the local governors and to your local yokels.

1118
01:42:43,904 --> 01:42:48,326
[SPEAKER_16]: in any town and community out of the 351 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1119
01:42:51,068 --> 01:42:56,290
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I care too much about justice.

1120
01:42:56,931 --> 01:42:58,071
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my only agenda.

1121
01:42:59,272 --> 01:43:09,117
[SPEAKER_16]: I like to change the old adage from the founding fathers and say, no further taxation without proper representation and

1122
01:43:09,463 --> 01:43:16,186
[SPEAKER_16]: to stop the waste, hire Trump to negotiate edge of the bubble before we end up with the Superdome in New Orleans.

1123
01:43:16,386 --> 01:43:17,026
[SPEAKER_16]: God forbid.

1124
01:43:17,046 --> 01:43:17,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Good luck.

1125
01:43:19,327 --> 01:43:22,248
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight that the paper be received and placed on file.

1126
01:43:22,288 --> 01:43:22,928
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1127
01:43:22,948 --> 01:43:23,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

1128
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:26,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1129
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:27,230
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-512.

1130
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:30,071
[SPEAKER_10]: My omission, my apologies.

1131
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:34,453
[SPEAKER_10]: The committee, the whole report from May 18th, 2016 on public safety.

1132
01:43:35,963 --> 01:43:38,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I read it at the beginning of the meeting and didn't ask for approval.

1133
01:43:39,084 --> 01:43:40,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair awaits motion.

1134
01:43:41,305 --> 01:43:44,346
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice-President LeClerc.

1135
01:43:44,646 --> 01:43:45,347
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1136
01:43:45,367 --> 01:43:46,027
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1137
01:43:46,087 --> 01:43:46,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1138
01:43:46,927 --> 01:43:53,930
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello to go on to suspension to receive papers in the hands of the clerk.

1139
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:54,851
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1140
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:55,931
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1141
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:56,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1142
01:43:57,352 --> 01:43:58,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1143
01:43:59,592 --> 01:44:02,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the DPW Director contact

1144
01:44:03,916 --> 01:44:17,183
[SPEAKER_10]: the Department of Conservation and Recreation to repair a huge pothole on Route 16 on the walking path across from CKS Furniture Store that's on the Mystic Valley Parkway, Counselor?

1145
01:44:17,563 --> 01:44:17,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1146
01:44:18,383 --> 01:44:18,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1147
01:44:18,963 --> 01:44:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1148
01:44:19,724 --> 01:44:30,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is in the privy of the DCR, but I received information that there was a pothole where a small child can fall right through and it was open

1149
01:44:32,642 --> 01:44:33,462
[SPEAKER_03]: and dangerous.

1150
01:44:34,843 --> 01:44:56,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I did try to call my contacts at the DCR and left message, but maybe the city has a, the DPW director has a better line of communications, but it is on the walking path located at the Satellites across the street from CKS and the courthouse where the McDonald Field sign is located.

1151
01:44:56,434 --> 01:45:00,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they can contact the DCR and

1152
01:45:01,229 --> 01:45:06,414
[SPEAKER_03]: in the sake of public safety and so someone doesn't lose a child.

1153
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:07,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

1154
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:07,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1155
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:10,578
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Scott Pelley, all those in favor?

1156
01:45:10,598 --> 01:45:11,198
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1157
01:45:11,218 --> 01:45:13,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1158
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:26,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Vice President Lovell-Curran be resolved that the Alden Chambers video system be upgraded slash fixed due to connection, connection?

1159
01:45:27,335 --> 01:45:29,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Connection problems, Madam Vice President.

1160
01:45:29,837 --> 01:45:31,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Rosa.

1161
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:36,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure we all have received complaints when people are watching our meetings and the school committee meetings.

1162
01:45:36,961 --> 01:45:40,824
[SPEAKER_15]: They're fading out, especially at between 8 and 8.30, a lot of crackling.

1163
01:45:40,844 --> 01:45:42,065
[SPEAKER_15]: You can barely hear the sound.

1164
01:45:42,565 --> 01:45:47,168
[SPEAKER_15]: So just ask the administration if we can get some updates to correct the problem.

1165
01:45:48,729 --> 01:45:51,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I would hope that more meetings are going to be publicized in the chambers.

1166
01:45:52,171 --> 01:45:52,812
[SPEAKER_15]: We ask for more.

1167
01:45:54,645 --> 01:46:05,148
[SPEAKER_15]: meetings on video, so these are important meetings, school committee meetings are important, and when you can barely hear a good portion of them, it's obviously not a good thing.

1168
01:46:05,188 --> 01:46:07,169
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we can get that fixed, that would be appreciated.

1169
01:46:07,209 --> 01:46:09,510
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Vice President Longo-Curran, Councilor Caviello.

1170
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:10,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1171
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:20,713
[SPEAKER_05]: On Councilor Longo's motion there, I happened to meet the gentleman from Comcast who fixed it the last time it broke, and what he told me was,

1172
01:46:21,923 --> 01:46:28,587
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing needs to be, he says, it's archaic in the world of today.

1173
01:46:29,527 --> 01:46:35,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And he explained to me that it wasn't that much of a cost to bring that up to 2016 speed.

1174
01:46:39,353 --> 01:46:45,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was a ridiculous amount of money, but I see he kind of laughed that he came in to fix something that was that archaic, Mr. President, so.

1175
01:46:46,557 --> 01:46:47,537
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval.

1176
01:46:50,697 --> 01:46:55,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we ask the administration to get an estimate on what it would cost to put in a new system?

1177
01:46:55,358 --> 01:46:59,199
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended by Vice President Lungo Kern for an estimate to repair the system.

1178
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:01,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1179
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:13,861
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can't, can we amend that to maybe find that employee that has done it already and then have him report, see if this Comcast will report back to us.

1180
01:47:14,501 --> 01:47:15,801
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1181
01:47:16,122 --> 01:47:16,802
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1182
01:47:16,862 --> 01:47:17,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1183
01:47:17,522 --> 01:47:18,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

1184
01:47:20,997 --> 01:47:23,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, two, uh, condolences here.

1185
01:47:23,838 --> 01:47:24,899
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll read them together.

1186
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:29,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor, uh, be it resolved that a moment's silence be held for a long time.

1187
01:47:29,961 --> 01:47:39,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford resident Romolo Mack mashy on his recent passing and also be it resolved that a moment's silence be held for a long time.

1188
01:47:39,646 --> 01:47:43,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford resident, Dorothy Selfridge on her recent passing.

1189
01:47:45,189 --> 01:47:47,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1190
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:47,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh,

1191
01:47:48,059 --> 01:47:52,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Mack Maskey was a fixture in this community for a number of years.

1192
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:56,261
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a great family man, and he is gonna solely be missed.

1193
01:47:57,042 --> 01:48:09,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dorothy Selfridge was very active in the community also, and she lived on Warren Street and had a number of sons, and they were just a great family.

1194
01:48:09,866 --> 01:48:11,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, she will be solely missed.

1195
01:48:12,746 --> 01:48:14,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Please stand for a moment of silence.

1196
01:48:26,491 --> 01:48:30,955
[SPEAKER_10]: The records of the meeting of May 17th, 2016 are passed to Councilor Caviello.

1197
01:48:31,295 --> 01:48:32,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Councilor, how do you find those records?

1198
01:48:32,936 --> 01:48:35,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the records and they appear to be in order.

1199
01:48:36,259 --> 01:48:45,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, while I have the floor, if I can remind everybody, tomorrow is the veterans' lunch right in this room at City Hall.

1202
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:54,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it is lunch free for all the veterans of Medford.

1203

[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's very nicely attended, and again, I hope- Sponsored by the?

[SPEAKER_05]: Great organization, I must say.

1206
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:04,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Great organization.

1207
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:05,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
