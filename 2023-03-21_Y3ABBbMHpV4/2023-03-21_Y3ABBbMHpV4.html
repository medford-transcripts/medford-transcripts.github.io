    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=253.575s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Fallon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=256.698s">Also</a>  referred to as the Black National Anthem, Lift Every Voice and Sing was a hymn written... Lift Every Voice and Sing was a hymn written as a poem by the NAACP. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=270.293s">The</a>  leader, James Weldon Johnson in 1900. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=273.794s">Lift</a>  Every Voice and Sing was communally sung within black communities while the end of Lazy Pete began to promote the hymn as the Negro national anthem in 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=287.358s">Hear</a>  His Lift Every Voice and Sing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=298.812s">Every</a>  voice and sing to earth and heaven ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=314.589s">Ring</a>  with the harmonies of liberty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=322.705s">Let</a>  our rejoicing rise, high as the listening skies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=338.257s">Let</a>  it resound loud as the rolling sea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=351.049s">Sing</a>  a song full of the hope that the present has brought us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=385.154s">Facing</a>  the rising sun of a new day begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=389.177s">Let</a>  us march on till victory is won. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=396.543s">Let</a>  us march on till victory is won. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=416.047s">Let</a>  us march on to victory.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=445.009s">That</a>  was a very hard one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=450.294s">Now,</a>  are y'all ready for some fun?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=452.756s">No!</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=454.337s">I'm</a>  sorry, I was a little bit on my luck here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=457.56s">Are</a>  y'all ready for some fun?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=470.811s">Are</a>  y'all ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=474.085s">Introducing</a>  the PSU's opening dance!</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=508.807s">I</a>  miss you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=548.648s">One,</a>  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=672.293s">All</a>  right, now please welcome our superintendent, Marie Edward-Lindsay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=678.295s">We're</a>  saving the superintendent the last. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=689.218s">That</a>  is the last, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=691.399s">So</a>  I'll go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=692.019s">May</a>  and Marie, I don't know if you'll turn here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=695.34s">I</a>  just want to say good afternoon to the members of high school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=703.508s">Thank</a>  you to BSU and the advisors for inviting me to be a part of the celebration of Black History Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=711.071s">I</a>  know you want to get to more music and dancing to celebrate, but I'm just going to speak for a minute or two, give you a little history about here at Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=719.834s">This</a>  is a wonderful program that the school puts on, and it's exciting to see all that's in store. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=725.496s">We've</a>  been celebrating Black History Month all throughout the community, and it's truly inspiring to hear from so many people about the importance of uniting us as a community and recognizing the achievements as well as the struggles that our Black neighbors have endured. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=743.567s">I'm</a>  proud that our city is diverse, inclusive, and forward-thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=748.814s">I</a>  want to thank our DEI Director, Frances Guage, for her work to ensure that Medford is always attempting to serve our community members with respect and kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=760.12s">Black</a>  history is our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=763.041s">Medford's</a>  history. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=764.862s">And</a>  we have deep ties to the past, both uplifting and demoralizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=770.905s">The</a>  city wouldn't stop on the Underground Railroad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=774.878s">Duggar</a>  Park is named after Lieutenant Colonel Edward Duggar, who fought in World War I. It is the first park in suburban Boston named after an African-American, and it's right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=790.804s">Medford</a>  is also home to the Royal House of Slave Quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=801.252s">We</a>  have now used the relics of our past to highlight both the abomination of slavery as well as to celebrate the significant contributions of Belinda Sutton. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=813.421s">Belinda</a>  was an African-born woman who was enslaved by the royals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=818.605s">Belinda</a>  successfully petitioned for a pension from the royals and is among the earliest narratives by an African-American woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=827.887s">Her</a>  narrative is seen by some as the first call for reparations for American slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=834.451s">We</a>  cannot run from our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=836.733s">We</a>  must embrace it and learn from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=839.594s">We're</a>  learning how to be a better city, better school system, more compassionate, and more inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=847.239s">And</a>  knowing the passion and determination that our students have for creating a better future for all, with that, I know that life is ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=857.54s">it's</a>  bright. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=858.44s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=892.711s">Now,</a>  please welcome our Black Student Union, Dwayne Soka.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1108.644s">Next</a>  up, let's give a nice warm welcome to our superintendent, Dr. Heather Hicks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1123.414s">Good</a>  afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1129.898s">I</a>  can't resist sometimes, so I just want to give a shout out right now to my seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1137.583s">So</a>  seniors! <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1142.458s">June</a>  7th will be here sooner than you can think. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1146.442s">But</a>  I'm so happy to be here to celebrate with all of you, Black History Month celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1152.268s">I</a>  want to give a great shout out to our PSU advisors, to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1156.632s">Faye</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1157.633s">Jackson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1158.734s">Please</a>  wave so everyone can see you and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1161.958s">Jackson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1169.611s">So</a>  in preparation for today's remarks, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1183.701s">the</a>  leadership and guidance that we've been giving to the students all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1187.803s">And</a>  I know that as we kind of talked about the theme of this year being about change agents, I wanted to take a few minutes to actually just share with you who some of the great change agents are from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1203.549s">We</a>  heard from our mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1205.791s">She</a>  gave us the names of some change agents, but I think that this is really important because these were normal people who ended up doing extraordinary things and they became change agents for the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1222.082s">So</a>  many times I've spoken to you in Medford, in particular West Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1231.408s">It's</a>  one of the oldest African American communities in the entire United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1238.493s">And</a>  that community was established in the early 1800s just after slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1244.537s">I</a>  talked about in the past about the Underground Railroad and the wonderful abolitionists that were here in Medford, George Stearns, and <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1260.433s">Lydia</a>  Marie Child, where people know her for her famous poem, Over the River and Through the Woods, but she wrote a book called An Appeal in Favor of That Class of Americans Called Africans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1275.496s">She</a>  was an abolitionist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1277.416s">But</a>  I also want to tell you about some change agents of African descent that came through Medford and made an impact <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1288.928s">not</a>  only in Medford, but beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1291.571s">I'm</a>  going to talk a little bit right now about Prince Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1295.074s">He</a>  was born in Barbados. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1297.337s">And</a>  I know we have students here that are of Asian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1301.641s">When</a>  people were wearing their flags on a Wednesday, I talked to one of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1307.047s">He</a>  was born in 1735, but he came <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1312.381s">to</a>  Boston at the age of 17 and he settled in Medford at the age of 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1321.507s">What</a>  he ended up doing, he bought real estate and he ended up joining the Continental Army. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1329.773s">What</a>  I can say to you about Prince Hall, he served as a change agent because he started the Freemasons and he used his status to help liberate slaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1342.6s">So</a>  Bedford was part of his story, and his story was part of freeing slaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1351.863s">If</a>  you go into Boston, in a section called Roxbury, Grove Hall in particular, it's a predominantly African-American community in Roxbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1363.567s">There</a>  is a hair school there called Lyell In School of Beauty Culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1371.559s">Elizabeth</a>  Oliver Newton started her business in Medford and from Medford she was the first African American person to be able to open a hair school for <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1389.176s">African</a>  Americans because at that point in time, they weren't accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1393.818s">And</a>  she was an hairstylist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1396.138s">So</a>  she's just someone that I wanted to just highlight as someone who came through Medford but ended up creating an establishment that supported African Americans <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1407.529s">and</a>  or Afro-Caribbeans to do something that they wanted to do when it wasn't accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1413.792s">And</a>  if you're in the Brokaw area, between Bowling Alley and Lawrence Street, her hair school is still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1423.737s">I</a>  also want to just, because you know, I may have said to you I grew up in West Medford, if you ever go by the fire station in West Medford, Mr. Charles Booker, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1436.909s">He</a>  was the first African-American firefighter in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1443.373s">Mr.</a>  Alonzo Fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1447.815s">He</a>  was the chief usher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1451.037s">He</a>  served five presidents of the White House. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1456.64s">Then</a>  there was also a change agent, Mr. Ansel Alexander, known as Bud Colbright, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1466.055s">He</a>  was an orphan, and the city of Medford reunited him with his mother and siblings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1476.578s">He</a>  went on to serve in World War II, and he was so appreciative of what the city of Medford did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1484.78s">As</a>  an adult, in 2003, he donated $100,000 to bring new play equipment <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1495.307s">to</a>  the Duggar Park community because that was where he grew up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1500.71s">So</a>  as I think about change agents and people who make a difference in the world, I think about all of those people who make a difference who have come through Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1513.555s">So</a>  I want you to know that Medford has a rich history. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1517.597s">All</a>  of you who are in here are part of Medford's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1522.026s">I</a>  am part of Medford's history, and so are you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1526.129s">I</a>  encourage you to know that just because I mentioned a few change agents, I want all of you to know that you can be change agents of tomorrow as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1536.595s">So</a>  I want to close with a quote from Dr. Rae Jameson. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1542.539s">She</a>  was the first African-American astronaut to fly on a space shuttle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1550.483s">She</a>  once said, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1555.1s">by</a>  other people's limited imaginations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1559.844s">Dr.</a>  Jameson speaks the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1562.666s">And</a>  I want to thank you, Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1564.787s">Happy</a>  Black History Month to you all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1570.712s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edwards.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1584.116s">He</a>  will be telling us how he navigated through the white spaces of retail and black markets.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1591.098s">Hello</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1599.739s">My</a>  name is Brian Owens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1602.8s">I</a>  grew up in Arlington, Massachusetts, right next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1609.659s">So</a>  don't take that against me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1614.661s">But</a>  why I mention that is that growing up as a black man or a black child, my family's fourth generation African-American in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1624.385s">It's</a>  about Roxbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1625.405s">I've</a>  heard of Roxbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1626.486s">I</a>  know a lot about West Medford because I spent a lot of time in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1630.087s">I</a>  was a basketball court as a kid in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1632.208s">I</a>  was probably talking to some nice people here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1640.547s">So,</a>  I say that because part of the speech I'm going to make today is about experience, my strength, and my hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1646.949s">The</a>  topic's about being a change agent, and why I mention that is because growing up black in Arlington, or just black in Boston in general, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1657.185s">One,</a>  education's everywhere you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1659.366s">My</a>  mother, who just passed away a year ago from pancreatic cancer, was a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1665.488s">She</a>  was assistant superintendent of Boston Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1669.55s">She</a>  was an assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1671.19s">She</a>  was a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1671.711s">She</a>  was a first grade teacher, second grade teacher, third grade teacher, fourth grade teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1676.713s">All</a>  I gotta say is education's at the foundation of everything we're about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1679.314s">So</a>  one of the reasons why I mentioned being a change agent <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1686.311s">Ask</a>  some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1688.932s">Being</a>  around other folks, understanding how to relate to other people are one of the advantages I have in business too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1695.073s">Part</a>  of what I do now is, how many people use TikTok? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1700.814s">How</a>  many people use Instagram? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1707.816s">So,</a>  how many people watch the Super Bowl this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1713.998s">How</a>  many people like the Dunkin' Donuts commercial? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1717.839s">How</a>  many people like that Toothy commercial? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1721.401s">Well,</a>  three out of four of those commercials my company made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1726.784s">I</a>  work for the world's largest advertising and communications company in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1732.086s">So</a>  if you're looking to be a social influencer, part of my job is to track Instagram and TikTok to see who is a nano-influencer and find ways to make money for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1742.082s">So</a>  why I say that is because education has changed the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1745.584s">So</a>  if you are a change agent, even if you're in high school right now, you can be a millionaire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1751.386s">Did</a>  you guys hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1753.827s">I'm</a>  saying, if you are in high school right now, and you understand who you are, understand your own personal story, and you have a following, you're able to make money off of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1765.012s">All</a>  right, why I say that is because if you don't understand who you are, what you're about, it's very hard to know where you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1771.519s">So</a>  as a change agent, as being a person of color in this community, you're forced to really listen to who you are and your own personal story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1779.465s">So</a>  my experience growing up in this community was very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1783.988s">Part</a>  of the reason why I was successful growing up in this community is because I played sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1788.492s">So</a>  I graduated from Belmont Hill School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1791.754s">I</a>  played ice hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1793.536s">I</a>  went to college for ice hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1795.697s">Full</a>  scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1798.899s">For</a>  football, I played division one football and division one ice hockey at Colgate University. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1804.463s">I</a>  mentioned that because I got a full scholarship to Delaware Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1814.131s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1814.511s">Because</a>  my mother was an educator. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1816.693s">She</a>  understood the power of education. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1818.374s">She</a>  understood that that school lacked diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1821.957s">And</a>  because of that lack of diversity, I had an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1825.54s">Because</a>  of that opportunity, I couldn't mess it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1828.846s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1829.066s">So</a>  instead of saying, I'm not going to play nice hockey, I played nice hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1833.589s">And</a>  because I tried something I wasn't very comfortable with, I became very successful at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1837.851s">I</a>  also played lacrosse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1838.992s">I</a>  also ran track. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1841.533s">I</a>  mention these things not because <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1852.828s">me</a>  the ability to understand people from Canada, people from Russia. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1856.749s">I've</a>  been called the N-word by probably 15, probably 20 different languages on that plane I took. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1863.291s">I</a>  got a lot of advice when I was a young kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1865.772s">And</a>  after a while, I just started scoring goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1869.793s">When</a>  you start scoring goals, you start getting recruited. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1871.954s">When</a>  you start getting recruited, you start getting scholarship offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1875.014s">You</a>  start getting scholarship offers, professional players start looking at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1878.575s">I</a>  actually played a little professional hockey, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1887.42s">I</a>  mentioned a lot of things about myself, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1889.902s">Oh,</a>  this and that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1891.243s">Because</a>  of those things, being a person of color, that ego, my ego got too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1897.667s">So</a>  being a person of color, thinking I was better than everybody else, once you start playing sports and you start getting attention, you start to struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1906.753s">And</a>  if you don't have a community of people that you identify with, you struggle by yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1919.522s">When</a>  you get depressed, you suffer from mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1922.443s">And</a>  if you have bad energy, you probably pass on bad energy, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1925.604s">So</a>  you make everyone around you miserable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1929.805s">I've</a>  known that for a very, very, very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1934.247s">Why</a>  I mention that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1935.207s">Because</a>  because of that experience, I now have strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1939.83s">I</a>  got through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1941.271s">Now</a>  I have faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1943.012s">Why</a>  do I have faith? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1943.973s">Because</a>  I can look back at those experiences as a person of color, surviving it, and being able to help anyone, even anyone your age right now, understand who they are and their personal story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1955.741s">There's</a>  a lot of hope in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1957.863s">What</a>  do I mean by hope? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1959.944s">Well,</a>  I mentioned how many people here use TikTok or Instagram. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1963.727s">I</a>  am now in the business of creating strategies for big brands like <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1969.656s">Coca-Cola,</a>  Advil, Palladol. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1974.458s">What</a>  else do we have going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1977.92s">Powerade.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1978.78s">These</a>  are big global brands that I work on right now to help these folks understand themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1985.503s">And</a>  we're looking at folks like you often and looking at more diverse bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1991.346s">So</a>  part of what I'm doing right now is having black and brown businesses go to market. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1996.228s">So</a>  if you're a small business owner, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=1998.539s">And</a>  if you're working on a direct-to-consumer or an e-commerce site, part of what my job is is to help brown companies become as big as a billion dollars as fast as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2009.528s">So</a>  part of what I'm doing now is taking that privilege I had at all those schools, growing up in Harlem City, growing up in Massachusetts, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2016.935s">You</a>  all don't even understand how much of an advantage you have growing up here, going to school here, compared to if you were anywhere else in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2023.62s">Why</a>  do I say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2024.341s">Because</a>  if I say I'm from Massachusetts, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2026.681s">My</a>  resume speaks for itself, because people respect the education of this city, as well as this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2032.304s">So</a>  now I'm actually teaching people, because now part of my job isn't about making money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2037.407s">Part</a>  of it's about making money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2040.388s">But</a>  the people that are very successful as an SDP, or a CEO, or EVP, or all these high-level folks that are teachers, people are able to teach something, to master something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2053.155s">If</a>  you can master something, you can make money off of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2056.249s">quit</a>  my period. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2057.809s">So</a>  the more you understand what your personal brand is, and if you can't teach it, you don't really know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2063.151s">That's</a>  why I was told as a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2065.132s">So</a>  your ability to understand something in a way where you're mastering it so you can actually instruct somebody, you do a lot of that on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2071.834s">Helping</a>  other people, using videos to teach other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2075.655s">Those</a>  are all teaching moments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2080.836s">If</a>  you're having a hard time in school, do it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2084.466s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2084.546s">Because</a>  once you get done with it, you have a lot of opportunity to make a lot of money on your own personal grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2091.194s">You</a>  spend enough time learning yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2093.236s">So</a>  as a person of color, if you're black in this room, if you're brown in this room, keep doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2098.602s">Keep</a>  learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2099.363s">Because</a>  the more you're able to identify with the people that don't look like you, as well as understand your own personal story, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2110.652s">You</a>  guys hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2112.033s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2112.894s">Help</a>  somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2115.716s">Stop</a>  thinking about yourself and help somebody else, because that energy comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2121.32s">And</a>  the more you're able to help somebody else, your community gets stronger, your mental health gets better, and everyone around you can win. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2128.985s">Because</a>  I'm around people winning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2130.126s">I</a>  don't know about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2132.227s">I</a>  like to win, and I want to make sure everyone in this room can win, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2135.489s">So</a>  I can be of any help to anyone, personal or not,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2164.01s">How</a>  many know who Ashby Berners-Woods is? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2167.632s">Just</a>  a raise of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2169.993s">Does</a>  anyone know who Ashby Berners-Woods is? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2179.934s">This</a>  is a story that should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2182.816s">And</a>  people who wrote this tribute are here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2219.093s">We</a>  were both students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2221.855s">We</a>  graduated back in 2009-2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2224.497s">Since</a>  then, I went to US Boston for biology, worked at Apple for a little bit of time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3ABBbMHpV4&t=2248.68s">My</a>  sister, she...
