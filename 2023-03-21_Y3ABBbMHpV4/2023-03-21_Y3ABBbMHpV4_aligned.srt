1
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:10,106
Welcome Medford High for our annual Black History Month assembly.

2
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:15,669
This is brought to you by the Medford High Black Student Union.

3
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:25,514
So, I'm Melissa Antoine, the voice of Medford High.

4
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:46,597
You know who I am?

5
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:47,557
I'm Kevin.

6
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:59,001
On this glowing Friday evening, the Black Student Union has put together an aspect of culture of what it means to be Black.

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:09,784
We're going to have speeches, we're going to have dancing, and we're going to have some fashion events.

8
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:11,685
Are y'all ready?

9
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,165
Y'all got no energy.

10
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:35,027
Where are our Tigers players?

11
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,667
All right, that's better, that's better.

12
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:42,128
All right, where are our sophomores?

13
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:42,488
Hey, hey, hey!

14
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:44,529
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.

15
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,509
Where are your juniors?

16
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,390
Our future seniors, yeah!

17
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,111
There you go, that's about the big ride!

18
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:04,232
I love the energy, I love it, I love it.

19
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:07,514
Good afternoon students, faculty and guests.

20
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:27,959
Thank you for your presence today.

21
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:45,399
I'd like to welcome our mayor, Mayor Brianna Longo Kern, our superintendent of schools, Dr. Edward Benson, and other guests that have joined us today.

22
00:02:55,567 --> 00:03:07,771
Our program today includes song, dance, poetry, and a fashion show, all of which will focus on the beauty of African American culture.

23
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:15,233
I hope you all walk away today with an appreciation of Black History Month and reflect on what you learned as we celebrate Black History Month.

24
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:20,655
Please provide your undivided attention to our presenters who've worked very hard

25
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:31,521
I'll wait until everyone's ready.

26
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:33,582
Thank you.

27
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:41,485
I hope you all walk away today with an appreciation of Black History and can reflect on what you've learned as we celebrate Black History Month.

28
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:47,368
Please provide your undivided attention to our presenters who've worked very hard in preparation for this event.

29
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:52,070
Thank you to all the performers, and I hope you all enjoy the presentation.

30
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:14,816
Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

31
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:28,288
Also referred to as the Black National Anthem, Lift Every Voice and Sing was a hymn written... Lift Every Voice and Sing was a hymn written as a poem by the NAACP.

32
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:33,754
The leader, James Weldon Johnson in 1900.

33
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:47,298
Lift Every Voice and Sing was communally sung within black communities while the end of Lazy Pete began to promote the hymn as the Negro national anthem in 1970.

34
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:56,361
Hear His Lift Every Voice and Sing.

35
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:13,588
Every voice and sing to earth and heaven ring.

36
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:21,596
Ring with the harmonies of liberty.

37
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:38,197
Let our rejoicing rise, high as the listening skies.

38
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:43,221
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

39
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:56,195
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.

40
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:29,017
Facing the rising sun of a new day begun.

41
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:36,483
Let us march on till victory is won.

42
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,328
Let us march on till victory is won.

43
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:59,190
Let us march on to victory.

44
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,274
That was a very hard one.

45
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,395
Now, are y'all ready for some fun?

46
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:32,976
No!

47
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:37,140
I'm sorry, I was a little bit on my luck here.

48
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,741
Are y'all ready for some fun?

49
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:38,921
Yeah!

50
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,643
Yeah!

51
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:42,144
All right.

52
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:48,069
Presented by the BSU, we have some dancers for y'all.

53
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:48,870
Are y'all ready?

54
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:51,772
Are y'all ready?

55
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:57,488
Introducing the PSU's opening dance!

56
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:29,689
I miss you.

57
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:30,017
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

58
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,201
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

59
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:27,483
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

60
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,705
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

61
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:47,699
Thank you

62
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:18,255
All right, now please welcome our superintendent, Marie Edward-Lindsay.

63
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:29,178
We're saving the superintendent the last.

64
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:31,379
That is the last, right?

65
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:31,979
So I'll go first.

66
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:35,160
May and Marie, I don't know if you'll turn here.

67
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,261
I just want to say good afternoon to the members of high school.

68
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:51,051
Thank you to BSU and the advisors for inviting me to be a part of the celebration of Black History Month.

69
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:58,834
I know you want to get to more music and dancing to celebrate, but I'm just going to speak for a minute or two, give you a little history about here at Medford.

70
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:04,616
This is a wonderful program that the school puts on, and it's exciting to see all that's in store.

71
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:21,966
We've been celebrating Black History Month all throughout the community, and it's truly inspiring to hear from so many people about the importance of uniting us as a community and recognizing the achievements as well as the struggles that our Black neighbors have endured.

72
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:28,110
I'm proud that our city is diverse, inclusive, and forward-thinking.

73
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:38,859
I want to thank our DEI Director, Frances Guage, for her work to ensure that Medford is always attempting to serve our community members with respect and kindness.

74
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,441
Black history is our history.

75
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,162
Medford's history.

76
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:49,945
And we have deep ties to the past, both uplifting and demoralizing.

77
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,727
The city wouldn't stop on the Underground Railroad.

78
00:12:54,878 --> 00:13:09,443
Duggar Park is named after Lieutenant Colonel Edward Duggar, who fought in World War I. It is the first park in suburban Boston named after an African-American, and it's right here in Medford.

79
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:20,427
Medford is also home to the Royal House of Slave Quarters.

80
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:32,240
We have now used the relics of our past to highlight both the abomination of slavery as well as to celebrate the significant contributions of Belinda Sutton.

81
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:37,564
Belinda was an African-born woman who was enslaved by the royals.

82
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:47,052
Belinda successfully petitioned for a pension from the royals and is among the earliest narratives by an African-American woman.

83
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:53,250
Her narrative is seen by some as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

84
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,252
We cannot run from our history.

85
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,734
We must embrace it and learn from it.

86
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:06,258
We're learning how to be a better city, better school system, more compassionate, and more inclusive.

87
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:16,885
And knowing the passion and determination that our students have for creating a better future for all, with that, I know that life is ahead.

88
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,020
it's bright.

89
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:18,840
Thank you.

90
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:32,063
Are y'all ready for some Soca?

91
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:41,424
For those who don't know, Soca is a blend of African and East Indian rhythms.

92
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:45,985
It's a band that has a rich history of black people and it is one of the most

93
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:58,148
Now, please welcome our Black Student Union, Dwayne Soka.

94
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:39,740
Yeah!

95
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:21,867
Oh!

96
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:43,334
Next up, let's give a nice warm welcome to our superintendent, Dr. Heather Hicks.

97
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:48,097
Good afternoon, everyone.

98
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:57,563
I can't resist sometimes, so I just want to give a shout out right now to my seniors.

99
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,004
So seniors!

100
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,761
June 7th will be here sooner than you can think.

101
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:12,248
But I'm so happy to be here to celebrate with all of you, Black History Month celebration.

102
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:16,532
I want to give a great shout out to our PSU advisors, to Ms.

103
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:17,553
Faye and Ms.

104
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,234
Jackson.

105
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:21,757
Please wave so everyone can see you and Ms.

106
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:22,298
Jackson.

107
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:35,057
So in preparation for today's remarks,

108
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:47,163
the leadership and guidance that we've been giving to the students all along.

109
00:19:47,803 --> 00:20:02,469
And I know that as we kind of talked about the theme of this year being about change agents, I wanted to take a few minutes to actually just share with you who some of the great change agents are from Medford.

110
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,870
We heard from our mayor,

111
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:19,881
She gave us the names of some change agents, but I think that this is really important because these were normal people who ended up doing extraordinary things and they became change agents for the world.

112
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:30,048
So many times I've spoken to you in Medford, in particular West Medford,

113
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:38,393
It's one of the oldest African American communities in the entire United States of America.

114
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:44,277
And that community was established in the early 1800s just after slavery.

115
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:58,366
I talked about in the past about the Underground Railroad and the wonderful abolitionists that were here in Medford, George Stearns, and

116
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:14,516
Lydia Marie Child, where people know her for her famous poem, Over the River and Through the Woods, but she wrote a book called An Appeal in Favor of That Class of Americans Called Africans.

117
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:16,776
She was an abolitionist.

118
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:27,698
But I also want to tell you about some change agents of African descent that came through Medford and made an impact

119
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:30,670
not only in Medford, but beyond.

120
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:34,233
I'm going to talk a little bit right now about Prince Hall.

121
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:36,916
He was born in Barbados.

122
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,181
And I know we have students here that are of Asian descent.

123
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:45,925
When people were wearing their flags on a Wednesday, I talked to one of our students.

124
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:48,628
He was born in 1735, but he came

125
00:21:52,381 --> 00:22:00,347
to Boston at the age of 17 and he settled in Medford at the age of 25.

126
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:08,572
What he ended up doing, he bought real estate and he ended up joining the Continental Army.

127
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:21,702
What I can say to you about Prince Hall, he served as a change agent because he started the Freemasons and he used his status to help liberate slaves.

128
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,842
So Bedford was part of his story, and his story was part of freeing slaves.

129
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:42,706
If you go into Boston, in a section called Roxbury, Grove Hall in particular, it's a predominantly African-American community in Roxbury.

130
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:50,349
There is a hair school there called Lyell In School of Beauty Culture.

131
00:22:51,559 --> 00:23:08,256
Elizabeth Oliver Newton started her business in Medford and from Medford she was the first African American person to be able to open a hair school for

132
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:13,277
African Americans because at that point in time, they weren't accepted.

133
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,498
And she was an hairstylist.

134
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:26,722
So she's just someone that I wanted to just highlight as someone who came through Medford but ended up creating an establishment that supported African Americans

135
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:33,092
and or Afro-Caribbeans to do something that they wanted to do when it wasn't accepted.

136
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:41,977
And if you're in the Brokaw area, between Bowling Alley and Lawrence Street, her hair school is still there.

137
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:56,244
I also want to just, because you know, I may have said to you I grew up in West Medford, if you ever go by the fire station in West Medford, Mr. Charles Booker,

138
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:01,752
He was the first African-American firefighter in the city of Medford.

139
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:05,374
Mr. Alonzo Fields.

140
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,916
He was the chief usher.

141
00:24:11,037 --> 00:24:14,399
He served five presidents of the White House.

142
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,504
Then there was also a change agent, Mr. Ansel Alexander, known as Bud Colbright, Jr.

143
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:35,218
He was an orphan, and the city of Medford reunited him with his mother and siblings.

144
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:44,760
He went on to serve in World War II, and he was so appreciative of what the city of Medford did.

145
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,762
As an adult, in 2003, he donated $100,000 to bring new play equipment

146
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:59,209
to the Duggar Park community because that was where he grew up.

147
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:11,494
So as I think about change agents and people who make a difference in the world, I think about all of those people who make a difference who have come through Medford.

148
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,337
So I want you to know that Medford has a rich history.

149
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:20,819
All of you who are in here are part of Medford's history.

150
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:24,928
I am part of Medford's history, and so are you.

151
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:35,614
I encourage you to know that just because I mentioned a few change agents, I want all of you to know that you can be change agents of tomorrow as well.

152
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:41,798
So I want to close with a quote from Dr. Rae Jameson.

153
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:50,463
She was the first African-American astronaut to fly on a space shuttle.

154
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:51,344
She once said,

155
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,342
by other people's limited imaginations.

156
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:01,825
Dr. Jameson speaks the truth.

157
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,167
And I want to thank you, Mustangs.

158
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:06,649
Happy Black History Month to you all.

159
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:11,952
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.

160
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:20,799
Let's give a warm welcome for our next deaf leader, Mr. Ryan Owens.

161
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,076
Mr. Owens is the Senior Vice President of Retail and Strategy.

162
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:30,538
He will be telling us how he navigated through the white spaces of retail and black markets.

163
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:31,058
Hello.

164
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:39,719
Hello everyone.

165
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:42,780
My name is Brian Owens.

166
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,881
I grew up in Arlington, Massachusetts, right next door.

167
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,200
So don't take that against me.

168
00:26:54,661 --> 00:27:03,585
But why I mention that is that growing up as a black man or a black child, my family's fourth generation African-American in Boston.

169
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:05,385
It's about Roxbury.

170
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:06,466
I've heard of Roxbury.

171
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:10,027
I know a lot about West Medford because I spent a lot of time in West Medford.

172
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,188
I was a basketball court as a kid in the summertime.

173
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:16,010
I was probably talking to some nice people here and there.

174
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:26,009
So, I say that because part of the speech I'm going to make today is about experience, my strength, and my hope.

175
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:34,612
The topic's about being a change agent, and why I mention that is because growing up black in Arlington, or just black in Boston in general,

176
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:39,346
One, education's everywhere you go.

177
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:45,428
My mother, who just passed away a year ago from pancreatic cancer, was a teacher.

178
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:48,790
She was assistant superintendent of Boston Public Schools.

179
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,170
She was an assistant principal.

180
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,691
She was a principal.

181
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,832
She was a first grade teacher, second grade teacher, third grade teacher, fourth grade teacher.

182
00:27:56,713 --> 00:27:59,274
All I gotta say is education's at the foundation of everything we're about.

183
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:02,835
So one of the reasons why I mentioned being a change agent

184
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:06,891
Ask some questions.

185
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:14,813
Being around other folks, understanding how to relate to other people are one of the advantages I have in business too.

186
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:20,794
Part of what I do now is, how many people use TikTok?

187
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:22,655
How many people use Instagram?

188
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:26,876
Alright, I work in advertising, so one of my clients is Coca-Cola.

189
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:30,917
So, how many people watch the Super Bowl this year?

190
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:35,678
How many people like the Dunkin' Donuts commercial?

191
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,440
How many people like that Toothy commercial?

192
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:45,743
Well, three out of four of those commercials my company made.

193
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:51,246
I work for the world's largest advertising and communications company in the world.

194
00:28:52,086 --> 00:29:01,011
So if you're looking to be a social influencer, part of my job is to track Instagram and TikTok to see who is a nano-influencer and find ways to make money for you.

195
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:05,043
So why I say that is because education has changed the game.

196
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:09,685
So if you are a change agent, even if you're in high school right now, you can be a millionaire.

197
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,227
Did you guys hear me?

198
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:23,292
I'm saying, if you are in high school right now, and you understand who you are, understand your own personal story, and you have a following, you're able to make money off of that.

199
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:30,575
All right, why I say that is because if you don't understand who you are, what you're about, it's very hard to know where you're going.

200
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:39,445
So as a change agent, as being a person of color in this community, you're forced to really listen to who you are and your own personal story.

201
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:42,968
So my experience growing up in this community was very difficult.

202
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:47,491
Part of the reason why I was successful growing up in this community is because I played sports.

203
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:50,573
So I graduated from Belmont Hill School.

204
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:52,655
I played ice hockey.

205
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,957
I went to college for ice hockey.

206
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:56,418
Full scholarship.

207
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:04,443
For football, I played division one football and division one ice hockey at Colgate University.

208
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:13,771
I mentioned that because I got a full scholarship to Delaware Hill.

209
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:14,491
Why?

210
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:15,832
Because my mother was an educator.

211
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:18,354
She understood the power of education.

212
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:20,656
She understood that that school lacked diversity.

213
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:24,939
And because of that lack of diversity, I had an opportunity.

214
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,681
Because of that opportunity, I couldn't mess it up.

215
00:30:28,846 --> 00:30:29,026
Right?

216
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:32,388
So instead of saying, I'm not going to play nice hockey, I played nice hockey.

217
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:37,831
And because I tried something I wasn't very comfortable with, I became very successful at that.

218
00:30:37,851 --> 00:30:38,872
I also played lacrosse.

219
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:40,032
I also ran track.

220
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,094
I mention these things not because

221
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:56,649
me the ability to understand people from Canada, people from Russia.

222
00:30:56,749 --> 00:31:03,271
I've been called the N-word by probably 15, probably 20 different languages on that plane I took.

223
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,692
I got a lot of advice when I was a young kid.

224
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:08,573
And after a while, I just started scoring goals.

225
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,934
When you start scoring goals, you start getting recruited.

226
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,994
When you start getting recruited, you start getting scholarship offers.

227
00:31:15,014 --> 00:31:18,555
You start getting scholarship offers, professional players start looking at you.

228
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:20,076
I actually played a little professional hockey, too.

229
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,662
I mentioned a lot of things about myself, right?

230
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:30,922
Oh, this and that, right?

231
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:37,066
Because of those things, being a person of color, that ego, my ego got too big.

232
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:46,733
So being a person of color, thinking I was better than everybody else, once you start playing sports and you start getting attention, you start to struggle.

233
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:53,317
And if you don't have a community of people that you identify with, you struggle by yourself.

234
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:02,423
When you get depressed, you suffer from mental health.

235
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:05,564
And if you have bad energy, you probably pass on bad energy, too.

236
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:08,385
So you make everyone around you miserable.

237
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:12,706
I've known that for a very, very, very long time.

238
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:15,067
Why I mention that?

239
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:17,928
Because because of that experience, I now have strength.

240
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,611
I got through it.

241
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:22,132
Now I have faith.

242
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:23,953
Why do I have faith?

243
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:34,080
Because I can look back at those experiences as a person of color, surviving it, and being able to help anyone, even anyone your age right now, understand who they are and their personal story.

244
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,843
There's a lot of hope in that.

245
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:38,723
What do I mean by hope?

246
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:43,026
Well, I mentioned how many people here use TikTok or Instagram.

247
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:47,590
I am now in the business of creating strategies for big brands like

248
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:54,438
Coca-Cola, Advil, Palladol.

249
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,820
What else do we have going on?

250
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,760
Powerade.

251
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:05,023
These are big global brands that I work on right now to help these folks understand themselves.

252
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:11,306
And we're looking at folks like you often and looking at more diverse bodies.

253
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:15,548
So part of what I'm doing right now is having black and brown businesses go to market.

254
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,729
So if you're a small business owner,

255
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:28,908
And if you're working on a direct-to-consumer or an e-commerce site, part of what my job is is to help brown companies become as big as a billion dollars as fast as they can.

256
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:36,054
So part of what I'm doing now is taking that privilege I had at all those schools, growing up in Harlem City, growing up in Massachusetts, frankly.

257
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:42,559
You all don't even understand how much of an advantage you have growing up here, going to school here, compared to if you were anywhere else in the country.

258
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,321
Why do I say that?

259
00:33:44,341 --> 00:33:45,582
Because if I say I'm from Massachusetts,

260
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:51,543
My resume speaks for itself, because people respect the education of this city, as well as this community.

261
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:56,906
So now I'm actually teaching people, because now part of my job isn't about making money.

262
00:33:57,407 --> 00:33:58,487
Part of it's about making money.

263
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:12,954
But the people that are very successful as an SDP, or a CEO, or EVP, or all these high-level folks that are teachers, people are able to teach something, to master something.

264
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,216
If you can master something, you can make money off of it.

265
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:16,949
quit my period.

266
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:22,711
So the more you understand what your personal brand is, and if you can't teach it, you don't really know it.

267
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,291
That's why I was told as a child.

268
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:31,513
So your ability to understand something in a way where you're mastering it so you can actually instruct somebody, you do a lot of that on social media.

269
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:35,074
Helping other people, using videos to teach other people.

270
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:36,935
Those are all teaching moments.

271
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,536
I share that because it's helpful.

272
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:43,437
If you're having a hard time in school, do it anyway.

273
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:44,526
Why?

274
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:50,573
Because once you get done with it, you have a lot of opportunity to make a lot of money on your own personal grades.

275
00:34:51,194 --> 00:34:52,795
You spend enough time learning yourself.

276
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:58,221
So as a person of color, if you're black in this room, if you're brown in this room, keep doing it.

277
00:34:58,602 --> 00:34:59,203
Keep learning.

278
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:04,989
Because the more you're able to identify with the people that don't look like you, as well as understand your own personal story,

279
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:11,413
You guys hear me?

280
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:12,794
Yes.

281
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,655
Help somebody else.

282
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:20,519
Stop thinking about yourself and help somebody else, because that energy comes back.

283
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:28,164
And the more you're able to help somebody else, your community gets stronger, your mental health gets better, and everyone around you can win.

284
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:30,106
Because I'm around people winning.

285
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:31,166
I don't know about you.

286
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:35,169
I like to win, and I want to make sure everyone in this room can win, too.

287
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:38,852
So I can be of any help to anyone, personal or not,

288
00:35:52,245 --> 00:36:03,890
Alright, before we go to the next speaker, I just want to ask a quick question if I can get a raise of hand.

289
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:07,612
How many know who Ashby Berners-Woods is?

290
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,973
Just a raise of hand.

291
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:14,375
Does anyone know who Ashby Berners-Woods is?

292
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,796
This is a story that should be done.

293
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:26,938
And people who wrote this tribute are here.

294
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,835
We were both students here.

295
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,457
We graduated back in 2009-2010.

296
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:10,722
Since then, I went to US Boston for biology, worked at Apple for a little bit of time.

297
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:40,752
My sister, she... So yeah, a brief history of my time here.

298
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:45,277
I grew up in Lea Ferry Park.

299
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:56,659
I grew up in a lot of different things.

300
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,679
I grew up in orchestra from third grade at the day school.

301
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,820
It's not even a school here anymore.

302
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,981
But through 12th grade, I played music.

303
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:06,141
I now play the bass guitar semi-professionally.

304
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:06,441
I teach.

305
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:09,242
If you want to learn the bass, let me know.

306
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,403
But during my time here, I was in poetry.

307
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:17,064
And the summer coming into freshman year, my friend Ashley, she was a flyer.

308
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:22,726
Actually, if you look at the cheerleading state champion in 2007, she was already on that team.

309
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,361
they caught her the wrong way, and her liver pretty much exploded.

310
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,761
She bled out eternally.

311
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:43,623
As a former memorial, we collect here, actually outside this gym, where I wrote a poem, you know, this is a commemorator.

312
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:53,125
My sister drew and found some images on it, like the wings and like the face, on the head, and it's just really, really beautiful.

313
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:00,402
and actually should do it in person.

314
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:01,762
Thank you guys.

315
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:12,725
All right, thank you, thank you, thank you.

316
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:14,965
All right, we have one more.

317
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:21,487
We're gonna have speeches of hope by one of our sophomores, Chris Xavier.

318
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:41,211
It's a little scary to come up here, but I wanted to participate in this for my black culture.

319
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:49,976
Just wrote this whole poem, a flash speech, about being black, about what it's like to be black, raising up in America.

320
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:51,377
All right.

321
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:54,398
What does it mean to be black in America?

322
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:58,421
Being black in America means our kindness is awakened.

323
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:00,802
Being black means our silence

324
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,716
Being black means our language is slang.

325
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:10,477
Being black means our confidence is conceit.

326
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,097
Being black means our mistakes as defeats.

327
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:15,738
Being black means our success is accidental.

328
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:19,599
Being black means minimizing our intelligence to potential.

329
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:22,600
Being black means our questions mean we are unaware.

330
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,961
Being black means our advancements are somehow unfair.

331
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:28,822
Being black means our worst self-concern is annoyance.

332
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:35,241
apprehensive.

333
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,483
Being black means we're defiant if we separate.

334
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:42,686
Being black means we're vague if we assimilate.

335
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:45,607
Being black means our character is constantly under attack.

336
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:49,289
Being black means having the power of our race makes us too black.

337
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,991
Being black means labeling us as criminals.

338
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,532
But what does it mean to actually be black in America?

339
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:59,115
My daddy told me, to be black in America, you have to endure white supremacy.

340
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:00,736
You have to fear the police.

341
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,261
The American, you have the luxury of saying, this shit don't comply.

342
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:12,863
To be black in America, you have to hope that someone orders your compliance because you can't no longer be in a relationship with a man or something.

343
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:16,924
Being a black in America makes you grow up being aware of racism continuously.

344
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:21,405
We was brought up in a difficult system, a system that feels like a game we're just falling in.

345
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:24,746
While we're in it, it's a lot of people that are just trying to survive.

346
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:27,607
But we don't want to survive, we just want to live.

347
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:33,090
The government needs us with weed and drugs to give us a hopeful opportunity.

348
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:37,674
And we just end up deeply amongst each other, thinking it's the way out.

349
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,777
Thinking it's the toll to our connection.

350
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:49,325
And we just... Yeah, that's why you see a lot of kids trapped in because they have nothing else to turn to.

351
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:53,389
Their dreams end up not coming true because of their skin color, which makes it hard for them.

352
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:20,917
But what do you do when you have no one there to support your team?

353
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:23,499
You end up giving up on your team.

354
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:37,305
take the only option to get what the government left you, and that's selling dope or just being you.

355
00:42:38,046 --> 00:42:39,987
It's not our fault that we're viewed as monsters.

356
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:42,389
We're not monsters, we're just physical children.

357
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:45,631
They label us as criminals, we're just kids in a system.

358
00:42:59,282 --> 00:43:04,906
Last but not least, the students of BFU have prepared a fashion show.

359
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:12,170
This fashion show represents different cultures and eras from black and white.

360
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:21,096
First up, we're going to have traditional African clothing.

361
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:56,804
Please join me in a round of applause for all the graduates who have made it this far.

362
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:21,432
And rigorously, even down to the last minute, it's been a good experience for all of us.

363
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:23,993
I feel like we've grown closer because of it.

364
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:28,255
So thank you for all of your hard work, determination, and effort.

365
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:29,836
Thank you.

366
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:39,880
I'd also like to call our Black Community Advisors to the center as well.

367
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:40,621
Ms.

368
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:41,781
Jackson, Ms.

369
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:42,722
Day, and Ms.

370
00:48:42,782 --> 00:48:43,442
Cabello-Russo.

371
00:48:51,732 --> 00:48:57,277
have worked very hard to put the show together and actually plan it for future shows.

372
00:48:57,297 --> 00:49:00,120
We'll be having a special presentation last day.

373
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,184
I'd also like to thank

374
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:22,445
And Brian Owens, M.D.A., for also being here and speaking at our event today.

375
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:26,490
Mr. Apollo is not here, but we would like to welcome him.

376
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,474
Mr. Apollo, if you're here, please come out.

377
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:44,999
I don't know what I would do without you, I don't know what we would all do without you, so thank you for always being there behind the scenes, supporting us as well.

378
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:46,381
The bell is about to ring.
