[SPEAKER_11]: The meeting is called to order.

13
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:54,781
[SPEAKER_11]: The action discussion item for this committee meeting is again, 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.

14
00:05:55,641 --> 00:06:03,026
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the first planning and permitting committee meeting of the new year.

15
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:08,429
[SPEAKER_11]: We have seen a lot of work in this committee so far.

16
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,790
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of that is still ongoing.

17
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:13,543
[SPEAKER_11]: the fall.

18
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:17,407
[SPEAKER_11]: We shepherded through the Mystic Avenue Corridor District proposal.

19
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:23,473
[SPEAKER_11]: The Salem Street Corridor District proposal is still being considered in public meetings by the Community Development Board.

20
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:27,757
[SPEAKER_11]: The Green Score proposal is still being considered in public meetings by the Community Development Board.

21
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:29,138
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of things in the pipeline.

22
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:38,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, we are beginning our consideration, just the very beginning of the conversation on a new topic, which is the neighborhood residential topic.

23
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,693
[SPEAKER_11]: So before I turn it over to our zoning consultant, I just kind of want to orient us to the goal of this meeting, what we're gonna be looking at.

24
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:56,939
[SPEAKER_11]: This topic, which we're calling neighborhood residential, is just a jumping off place for adjusting the zoning rules for the areas of the city that are currently residential and zoned as single family one or single family two.

25
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:07,387
[SPEAKER_11]: There are districts like this throughout the city, as everybody knows, but they're especially concentrated in North Medford, West Medford, with some pockets in Glenwood, Wellington, and Hillsides.

26
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,271
[SPEAKER_11]: So why are we looking at SF1 and two districts now?

27
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:17,616
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the same goals that carry us through the rest of the city for the rest of our zoning overhaul.

28
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:24,201
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that there are areas of the city where the zoning does not reflect what is currently built on the ground.

29
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:38,529
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that there are areas of the city where the zoning isn't allowing us to use our property or land the way that we know community members want us to, where it could better affirm our goals or where it could better affirm just what's already there.

30
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:48,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also know that we have a need to allow for more housing development in Medford to keep pace with high demand, high scarcity, and increasingly high property valuations.

31
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:52,172
[SPEAKER_11]: And zoning can offer tools to help us with all these problems.

32
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:57,595
[SPEAKER_11]: So with a lot of the current SF districts, we know we'll have to let geography and context guide the way.

33
00:07:57,655 --> 00:08:03,298
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, in North Medford, narrow winding streets and steepness affect what is appropriate and possible.

34
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:12,152
[SPEAKER_11]: We also do have areas that are next to, for example, some brand new transit hubs, and it doesn't make sense to not take advantage of those areas of the city for greater density in a thoughtful way.

35
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:19,942
[SPEAKER_11]: So in just a minute, I'm going to turn it over to Paola from NS Associates for slides about what we're going to be considering tonight.

36
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:22,786
[SPEAKER_11]: This presentation

37
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:29,899
[SPEAKER_11]: will walk us through a jumping off point for considering some new neighborhood residential approaches and existing SF and GR.

38
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:38,830
[SPEAKER_11]: It also incorporates what new state law dictates around allowing ADUs by right in single family districts.

39
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:52,319
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to recenter on the goals for tonight before we get into the weeds, and I know that pal is also going to reorient us in kind of the where this falls in the overall trajectory of, you know, what topics have come before this and what topics will come after this.

40
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight we're not looking at a proposal that we're going to be voting on or approving.

41
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:02,865
[SPEAKER_11]: This is to serve as a jumping-off point that's based on the current zoning of SF1 and 2 districts.

42
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:06,246
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very much not going to do this all in one fell swoop.

43
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:14,009
[SPEAKER_11]: My goals for tonight is for this to be councilors' chance to put their initial thoughts, concerns, questions, requests for changes on the record.

44
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:26,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we'll come back at our next meeting in two weeks, and as associates, we'll have taken all of that feedback and put together an amended proposal that we'll look at again before it is then referred for further review in more public meetings by the CDB.

45
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,841
[SPEAKER_11]: So at this point, I see President Bears has his hand up, and then I'll turn it over to Paula.

46
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

47
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:39,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank you for getting us off to the start of this meeting.

48
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:48,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to note just that the comprehensive plan and the zoning that we've been implementing based on the comprehensive plan for the city

49
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:59,153
[SPEAKER_06]: which was developed over two years with input from thousands of residents, is based on a model of neighborhoods, squares, and corridors.

50
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:08,237
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been looking at corridors so far, and we'll be looking at squares going forward, and this

51
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:35,235
[SPEAKER_06]: tonight we're talking about neighborhoods and neighborhood residential and I really appreciate that this meeting you know we're taking a second meeting in two weeks to look at a proposal and starting tonight just looking at general ideas and the research that has been done on the neighborhood residential and having looked at the presentation that was sent over by email I

52
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:51,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really looking forward to the presentation, but also, you know, do have some thoughts and some suggestions that I'm going to make after this meeting and look forward to seeing those hopefully incorporated into the draft that we see in two weeks.

53
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:57,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I just want to thank again, the chair and the team that's working on this as well as fellow members of the committee.

54
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

55
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

56
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:06,483
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I will now recognize Paola.

57
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:07,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks as always for being here.

58
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, good night.

59
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:17,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.

60
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:18,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Paola Ramos Martinez.

61
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:22,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm senior planner and urban designer at Innos Associates.

62
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:24,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Here at my right is Emily Innos.

63
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,486
[SPEAKER_04]: She's the director of Innos Associates.

64
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very glad to be here to share our thoughts and proposal.

65
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:35,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to share now my screen.

66
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:39,850
[SPEAKER_04]: There we are.

67
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:55,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to repeat some of the things if I can.

68
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:59,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, it's taking a bit of time for some reason.

69
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:07,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, great.

70
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:13,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

71
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:15,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to take your time.

72
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:16,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the screen frozen?

73
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We can see the screen share on Zoom.

74
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:25,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it might require maybe with the Zoom update a change in the booth to click the screen share instead of the video.

75
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:39,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, perfect.

76
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:55,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

77
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it safe?

78
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:00,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using the internet.

79
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:05,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely saved on the desktop.

80
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:08,709
[SPEAKER_04]: What I can do is.

81
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you not able to share, Paola?

82
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, is it not reflecting what's on your screen?

83
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to share the PDF.

84
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:17,495
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

85
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:22,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I can share on my side if that is easier, but you'd have to tell me when to switch.

86
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:34,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

87
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:36,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for that.

88
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:37,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All good.

89
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:46,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to just repeat a few things that were already introduced by Vice President Collins.

90
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:53,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the agenda today, we're going to look at the timeline, the plan for the 2025

91
00:13:56,225 --> 00:14:11,253
[SPEAKER_04]: the public hearing process and this is where public can give their comments when and we will look at those precise dates that we will be updating in all our meetings from now on.

92
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,736
[SPEAKER_04]: We will give a bit of introduction and that is the comprehensive plan.

93
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:16,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you

94
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:19,320
[SPEAKER_04]: where we are basing our proposals.

95
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:28,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We will look at some of the analysis that we used to do the proposal and then we will show the proposal for the neighborhood residential districts.

96
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:31,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end we will leave obviously the time

97
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:34,821
[SPEAKER_04]: for everyone to comment on the proposal.

98
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,867
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I want to make very clear is this is a draft.

99
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:41,951
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nothing decided.

100
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:43,573
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we are here.

101
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:44,875
[SPEAKER_04]: We want your comments.

102
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:57,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So here are the all the dates that we are going to have a planning and permitting committee meeting in this from now until May.

103
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:09,290
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are in starting this year January 15th as today and we are looking into neighborhood residential with especially the SF1 and SF2 districts.

104
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:27,897
[SPEAKER_04]: What we did today was making a frame of all that residential structure so that it will help us to not only for this month but also for the next one for February when we will look more into the denser part of the urban residential.

105
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:39,611
[SPEAKER_04]: In March and April, we will look at the commercial framework that is the squares, that is Medford Square and West Medford Square.

106
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:43,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will look at other corridors that we have not looked into yet.

107
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:47,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at the end, we will look into Wellington Glenwood area.

108
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:56,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at the topics from January, as we said, neighborhood residential, we are looking districts SF1 and SF2.

109
00:15:56,962 --> 00:16:01,284
[SPEAKER_04]: We are looking at those dimensional standards and development standards.

110
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:10,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And then citywide topic will be, we are working with housing, housing affordability and many other topics that we will look later.

111
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:11,589
[SPEAKER_04]: district.

112
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh February, urban residential districts, apartment one, two, and general residential.

113
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:18,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, dimensional and development standards.

114
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:23,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a citywide topics, we will look into ADUs and neighborhood notes.

115
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:27,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Um then in March, the commercial framework and Medford Square.

116
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:37,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh we will look at district C one, commercial one, and then the topics again, dimensional and development standards, and then the citywide topics, we'll look into

117
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:49,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And then April, West Medford and other corridors, commercial one, we will look into dimensional development standards that's in all of them.

118
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:54,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And the citywide topics will be transport demand management and the site plan review.

119
00:16:56,172 --> 00:17:16,243
[SPEAKER_04]: we will end up with Wellington Glenwood area in May, districts office one, two, industrial and mixed use zone, and then dimensional development standards, and we will review the parking requirement at the end so that we have a better knowledge from the studied districts already.

120
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:25,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the plan that we have, it's quite tight, but yeah, we think all these topics are big importance.

121
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:29,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are those opportunities for the public?

122
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:38,898
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the process every time that we bring a draft that has to go through until it gets approved?

123
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So first we present the topic as we are doing today with the neighborhood residential.

124
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:53,789
[SPEAKER_04]: We presented at the planning and permitting meeting to city council, and then we have a moment of comment from the public.

125
00:17:54,729 --> 00:18:06,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We presented a second time in the next planning and permitted meeting committee meeting where could be already referred to this topic from the city council into the city board.

126
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:11,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, in this place, we have a moment for public comments.

127
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,160
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes into city board.

128
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Um hoping to be voted on the topic.

129
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:22,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Um and in this place we also have a moment for public comments.

130
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:39,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it will if it gets voted um and approved by the uh city board maybe with recommendations then it goes to the city council again and gets voted to be approved and here again we will hear comments from the public.

131
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:42,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are as minimum we have these four

132
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,868
[SPEAKER_04]: moments to hear from the public.

133
00:18:48,089 --> 00:19:00,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to be clear on where we are now with other topics and what are those dates for the city board or the city council later on.

134
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:06,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, the gray text are those meetings that we already had.

135
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: the blue is the ones that we will have, and then the red is the ones that we are having.

136
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:28,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So we already have, for example, with Salem Street, we already have the first two meetings, and then next week, the 22nd, we will have Salem Street to be on the city board.

137
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:33,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone wants to comment on Salem Street, we will go with Salem Street and Green Score.

138
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for that.

139
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:41,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So both topics will go next week on the city board, and we will hear comments from the public.

140
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:54,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in February, if it gets voted and referred to the city council, then in February, we will vote and hear again for Salem Street and Green Score.

141
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:58,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So today we are first time that we will present this topic.

142
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,200
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the 15th of January.

143
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:11,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We will bring back the neighborhood residential with any comment and adjustment with the comments that the city councilors will give and comments from the public.

144
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We will bring it the 29th of January in the next planning and permitting meeting.

145
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:22,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once we know we can more or less in.

146
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:29,759
[SPEAKER_04]: If everything goes well in February, we will have the city board and then in March will be here back in city council.

147
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will be updating these dates whenever we know the next one.

148
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:45,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So in every meeting, we will have this and see what topics have been done, what topics are in process and which ones are starting.

149
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:52,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that that is helpful for everyone that wants to give us their comments.

150
00:20:54,372 --> 00:21:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So as an introduction, as President Collins already said, we have been basing our principles on the Medford Comprehensive Plan that was released and was published in January 2023.

151
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:35,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I really recommend that people to, if it's interested to read this plan, or at least these strategies that were in, that were created at the end in this product, in this booklet, because we are basing our update in the zoning into those principles.

152
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:41,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We also based ourselves in the climate action and adaptation plan that was released in April, 2022.

153
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:51,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So here in these, this is a plan that is in the comprehensive plan.

154
00:21:51,628 --> 00:22:02,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we see all the identified corridors, squares, transitional areas, civic anchors, and then the densities of those residential neighborhoods.

155
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is really the base that we are working on to create the upzoning.

156
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is the introduction that I wanted to talk about.

157
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We now are going to go on to the analysis that we have been doing.

158
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:22,746
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your current zoning.

159
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:29,591
[SPEAKER_04]: We are looking now at the SF1 and SF2, single family one and single family two districts.

160
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:35,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see them in this map as the yellow, very light yellow and

161
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:37,696
[SPEAKER_04]: a bit brighter yellow.

162
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:47,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So this month we are going to be studying these neighborhoods and giving some proposals.

163
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:56,168
[SPEAKER_04]: What we are going to bring today, and you will see it on the proposal, is the framework for the residential neighborhood.

164
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have all the transit in a plan so that we can really see it where the big hubs for bus and for the T or the commuter rail are.

165
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:23,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are all the mixed use districts, the non only residential kind of districts that we have from the comprehensive plan.

166
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:27,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I analyze this a little better, we have

167
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:32,337
[SPEAKER_04]: in orange and then in dark orange or brownish color.

168
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:34,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the corridors.

169
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,179
[SPEAKER_04]: We already worked on Mystic Avenue.

170
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:42,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it as a bit different because that's a citywide corridor and the others are more regional.

171
00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:47,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We are working on Salem Street and that's one of the other corridors.

172
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:48,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And

173
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have the squares that we will look into in March.

174
00:23:53,345 --> 00:24:04,175
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the institutional, which is the University Tufts area, and then a special district that we will study at the end.

175
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:11,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are looking into residential, so we wanted to know what is there at this moment.

176
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:18,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this plan, we have the different types of residential buildings.

177
00:24:18,462 --> 00:24:24,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's a single family, a two family, three family, four or more than nine units.

178
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:30,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And this help us already to see what is the density, not really the density that the

179
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:38,011
[SPEAKER_04]: current zoning has, but the real density that we have at this moment in the city.

180
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:49,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from here, we already introduced this, this incongruence, incongruency, incongruence, sorry, sorry.

181
00:24:51,856 --> 00:25:05,181
[SPEAKER_04]: These differences that we can find from the existing and from the current zoning so that when we update it, we reflect the existing so that we can take out some of the non-conformities that we have.

182
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:17,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to introduce one residential typology that you are going to see in our proposal, which is historic conversion.

183
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:18,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is this about?

184
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:24,117
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an existing structure that is originally designed for one unit dwelling.

185
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:35,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are going to propose a conversion from this one unit to a two-unit or multi-unit dwelling with no change of the external structure.

186
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:42,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And so each unit will have an independent entrance directly from the outside or through a common vestibule.

187
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:48,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the goal of this historic conversion kind of typology or type?

188
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:58,502
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to preserve the cultural heritage of that community and ensure that the changes that are made are keeping the historical character of the area.

189
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:07,448
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to increase density citywide, but this will help in small increments, and we will enable that smaller and more diverse housing options.

190
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:12,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it will protect historical buildings as well.

191
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:16,854
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is our proposal.

192
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is a first draft.

193
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:28,223
[SPEAKER_04]: We will explain why the thought process that is behind all this, but we want to hear your comments.

194
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:32,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to give you a proposal so that we can comment on it.

195
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:40,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have neighborhood, we identified four different neighborhood residential.

196
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:50,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to give a bit more gradient from the single family that you have now to general and to apartment.

197
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:57,045
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to give a bit more gradient in those definitions, in those districts.

198
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:06,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have neighborhood residential one, neighborhood residential two, three, four, and then urban residential, which has more density.

199
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And this we will look at in the next month.

200
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So neighborhood residential one, what we have is single unit dwelling and ADU.

201
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:24,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ADU is something that we will explain also next month, but we can obviously, if you have any question, we can answer this.

202
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,624
[SPEAKER_04]: This is accessory dwelling unit.

203
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:29,225
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a new law that is being passed.

204
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need a bit of more information.

205
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:35,487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we are placing this for next month.

206
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:39,449
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there is any question about this, please, you can ask.

207
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:47,374
[SPEAKER_04]: single unit dwelling plus ADU, and then we allow historic conversion to a maximum of two units.

208
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:57,221
[SPEAKER_04]: In neighborhood residential two, we have single unit dwelling plus ADU, two unit dwelling, and the historic conversion two to three units.

209
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:08,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Neighborhood Residential 3, we have single unit dwelling plus ADU, two unit, three unit, downhouse, and historic conversion from two to four units.

210
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:20,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And Neighborhood Residential 4 allows two unit dwelling, historic conversion from two to five, downhouse, multiple unit dwelling from two to four units.

211
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:27,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have urban residential will be multiple unit dwelling from plus four units.

212
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:33,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So where do we locate these areas, these districts?

213
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:36,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And just keep in mind, these lines are

214
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:44,876
[SPEAKER_04]: not, we will present the precise boundaries next time.

215
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:52,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a bit just to understand the area where we want to increase or maintain the existing density.

216
00:28:53,322 --> 00:29:03,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So neighborhood residential one, this will only be in North Medford Fulton Heights, and then the very north of West Medford.

217
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:09,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Why we're doing this is the topography makes it very difficult to allow more parking.

218
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:12,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have some restrictions in there.

219
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:18,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these are areas that do not have a lot of public transit.

220
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:23,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they depend on their own mobility.

221
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:26,464
[SPEAKER_04]: modes.

222
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:28,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we keep neighborhood residential, too.

223
00:29:29,187 --> 00:29:39,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So Lawrence States, the north part of Lawrence States and the mid to north part of West Medford, these are neighborhood residential, too.

224
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:46,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the rest of the base of this map is neighborhood residential three.

225
00:29:46,296 --> 00:30:00,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have it in West Medford area, south of Lawrence States, Haines Square, Glenwood, north of Wellington, hillside very in the north, and then between the two T stations.

226
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:05,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball Square and Medford Tufts T stations.

227
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:16,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And around that transition between the main street corridor and the T station area.

228
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have neighborhood residential four.

229
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:31,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Where have we allowed this is in two areas, well, three areas, sorry, exactly where the T stations are, Ball Square and Medford Tubs.

230
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:41,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are increasing density in these areas because of transit being available in here.

231
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:57,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Medford Square, where we have a hub of bus stations, we also allow just a bit on the north of Medford Square, this higher density of all this neighborhood residential floor.

232
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:04,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can obviously I will come back with this plan and we can discuss it further.

233
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:10,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also have some dimensional standards proposals.

234
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:13,299
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you have in your current zoning.

235
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:23,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So in your zoning, how it works, it's not about giving different dimensional standards to each district, but it goes by use.

236
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:26,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is a bit different from other communities.

237
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it makes it a bit,

238
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:42,880
[SPEAKER_04]: to uniform without having really representing the district character, but just representing single family or multifamily or detached family.

239
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:44,001
[SPEAKER_04]: All are the same.

240
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no difference or nuance within every district.

241
00:31:48,145 --> 00:31:50,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something, one of the changes that we make.

242
00:31:51,627 --> 00:32:03,890
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do is change from one, looking at what is there right now, what your current lot sizes, for example, are, and where we can reduce as much as possible nonconformities.

243
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, the minimum lot dimensions, we decrease in neighborhood residential one to 5,000 from 7,000 to 5,000 in this district, then neighborhood residential two, 4,000,

244
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,474
[SPEAKER_04]: and then three and four, 3000.

245
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:29,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Maximum height stories we keep in neighborhood one and two, the 2.5, two and a half stories.

246
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:32,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And then neighborhood three and four, we increased to three.

247
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Minimum front setbacks are very much maintained only in neighborhood three and four.

248
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:54,291
[SPEAKER_04]: We reduced to 10 and five and minimum setbacks we maintain, we just reduce in three and four to five minimum reserved bags are the same, all 15 maximum building coverage 40.

249
00:32:56,823 --> 00:33:07,033
[SPEAKER_04]: percent and 50 percent in neighborhood residential 4 and minimum open space we increase in neighborhood residential 1 and 2.

250
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:17,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually think that you do not have in your current minimum open space for single unit if I'm not mistaken.

251
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:36,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that I wanted to clarify with the accessory dwelling unit is that your accessory dwelling unit, according to the law that we see today, because this is still in progress, so we haven't seen the final, final

252
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:44,828
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we are seeing and what they have already sent is around or zero parking or one car.

253
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:54,515
[SPEAKER_04]: And this depends on where it is located, if it's close to a bus line or a transit area.

254
00:33:56,206 --> 00:34:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the maximum size for the ADUs are 900 square foot or the 50% of the total area of the principal structure.

255
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:10,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the single unit dwelling, what you have right now is two per dwelling unit.

256
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:16,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other residential types can be decreased to 1.5 per dwelling unit.

257
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:25,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, we want that historic conversion will follow certain design standards and guidelines, and that will be developed.

258
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:40,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is a bit that idea of that decrease of where that changes and differences between all these residential neighborhood districts.

259
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:44,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is it.

260
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go to the plan that I'm guessing this is what we will discuss.

261
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:53,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want any to change or something, let me know.

262
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:56,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for the presentation, Paola.

263
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:56,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Really appreciate it.

264
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:09,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that this gives us a pretty substantive jumping off point for talking about, you know, kind of the why and what next of developing amended zoning rules for these types of neighborhoods.

265
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:13,485
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna recognize Councilor Scarpelli first, but just to quickly bookend the presentation.

266
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:19,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I think some of the language that I find, like, really useful about this is thinking about creating a,

267
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:31,873
[SPEAKER_11]: new, more appropriate gradient from our most single-family, our most classic single-family lots, a lot of which will be kind of maintained exactly as they are.

268
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:34,996
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of the zoning that currently exists makes sense.

269
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:50,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the terminology needs to be updated, but a lot of that will remain that way and has to remain that way, but we can affect the gradient from smallest, least dense up to the most dense parts of the city in a way that creates that range of housing that we know that we really need and kind of fill in some of those

270
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:58,673
[SPEAKER_11]: gaps where people need types of housing that aren't being built because they either can't be developed under our current zoning or we haven't encouraged it enough.

271
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:00,113
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for that language.

272
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:02,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that's a really helpful way of thinking about this.

273
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one really quick clarification.

274
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:13,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're going to come back to this on the ADU's piece when we're talking about that law being developed that is a state law that communities like Medford will be obligated to factor into their zoning.

275
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll first recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then we'll go to President Bears.

276
00:36:19,421 --> 00:36:20,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

277
00:36:21,102 --> 00:36:25,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, my question was from the beginning of the presentation, but Paul, thank you very much.

278
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:35,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you could see the hard work in the presentation, and there is a lot of excitement with some of these opportunities.

279
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:48,921
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that I'd be remiss to say that, you know, we're seeing some we're seeing the impacts of, um, the lack of communication again to really get the word out to the neighborhoods and

280
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:56,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know that in the last few weeks we've done, we've tried to do the best we can and we're doing more than we can.

281
00:36:56,104 --> 00:37:00,565
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we were seeing it now with so many questions.

282
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:07,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we're getting to the end of the Salem Street district and the neighborhoods rallying

283
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:17,095
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and really not feeling like they've been part of the part of the process or have been given the questions answered.

284
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:21,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there's a lot of fear and a lot of questions going on.

285
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:29,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, as tonight started, I received a few emails from, um, residents from Lawrence Estates, uh,

286
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:35,014
[SPEAKER_02]: letting me know that they just found out that there's some sort of a meeting.

287
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:51,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I think we I know that I've shown you the date from when the last council really focused on implementing a more robust process and communications and bringing these meetings to the neighborhoods.

288
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:58,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's not it wasn't written in the R. F. P. I know Councilor President Bears informed us.

289
00:37:58,838 --> 00:37:59,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think

290
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:11,701
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move forward, we really need to find a better way, even if it's a reverse 911, letting the neighborhoods know that these meetings are happening.

291
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:19,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know we've had up to almost 20 meetings now discussing this process, but

292
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:40,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I implore all of us to understand that there is groundswell starting in a negative undertone when it doesn't have to be for the fact that even the Salem Street situation, a lot of these, the questions that the fair, a lot of them could be answered in the meeting with the simple sentence or two.

293
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:41,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

294
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think again, uh, if we when we move forward, I see our schedule.

295
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:48,796
[SPEAKER_02]: The schedule looks great.

296
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:53,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the beginning phases of this process, this new process.

297
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I just don't want to be in the same place we are with the Salem Street

298
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:27,166
[SPEAKER_02]: uh quarter and what we're hearing now and the displeasure and the the anger and the discourse and this divide now and it's it's it's something that I think we need to find a way that this council this uh city administration needs to really we we have so many avenues a communications director we have um we have different avenues that we can tap into I mean it's we really need to find a way if we can to please

299
00:39:28,997 --> 00:39:52,709
[SPEAKER_02]: set the schedule, alert people when we're going to be talking about their neighborhoods so they can be present or at least to be told that we've done A, B and C. I just don't think people have heard us and they truly don't know the impacts that are being created in their neighborhoods until it's time to

300
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:58,637
[SPEAKER_02]: to the end product, which we're seeing Salem Street getting really close.

301
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:04,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and I'm sure everybody there is heard the negative undertone.

302
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:08,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I hate to be the Debbie Downer every time.

303
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:14,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you come to come to us for for meeting because of all the hard work you've done.

304
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:18,568
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just had to share that with you as we move forward with this next process.

305
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:19,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

306
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:22,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President, for allowing me to speak.

307
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:32,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you Councilor I really do appreciate that feedback and, you know, I think that there is a lot in there that I think.

308
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:33,896
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, that I agree with.

309
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:50,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, well, since our last meeting wrapped up at midnight last night, a lot of what I've been working on today has been kind of revamping that communications strategy that we can use so that, you know, the next six months of this zoning project are better communicated.

310
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:59,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the highlight for me, and I think this speaks to some of what you're saying, is that the information is out there, the meetings are public, the answers are out there, but they need to be easier to find.

311
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:00,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we're working on.

312
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:07,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And follow through on the plan that me and President Bears are drafting as council leadership to make that successful.

313
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:10,304
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll take the collaboration of the city administration.

314
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:16,992
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think you're right that, you know, there's so much positive in these proposals and we really want to be able to

315
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:32,964
[SPEAKER_11]: broadcast and communicate well with the community to answer their questions easily and quickly so that people can know exactly what's going on, be informed, and ideally be as excited as we are about implementing the goals that the community put into the comprehensive plan.

316
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,465
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for that comment.

317
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,386
[SPEAKER_11]: It really- Appreciate it.

318
00:41:35,886 --> 00:41:36,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

319
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:38,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're working on it.

320
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:40,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

321
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:43,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll recognize President Bears next.

322
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:51,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

323
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:57,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Chair Collins and Councilor Scarpelli for your comments.

324
00:41:57,154 --> 00:42:00,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you Paula and Emily and the team for this presentation.

325
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:10,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a concern about the level of incremental step up that we see here.

326
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:15,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not necessarily saying

327
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:23,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make a motion, and I'm not saying that it has to go exactly by the lines in this proposal as exists now.

328
00:42:25,195 --> 00:42:31,461
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think for neighborhood residential, it really should just be NR1, NR2, and NR3.

329
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:38,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And perhaps we could consider something like NR4 as an urban residential one and an urban residential two.

330
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:40,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that would be a more

331
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:57,142
[SPEAKER_06]: incremental change to allow for more of what we see actually existing in a lot of these places compared to the zoning that was passed in many cases decades after homes were constructed.

332
00:42:57,162 --> 00:43:04,647
[SPEAKER_06]: That limited what could be built beyond what's actually there and created all the nonconformities that we have.

333
00:43:05,854 --> 00:43:10,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would recommend, and I'm gonna make a motion and I will email it to the clerk.

334
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:29,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do have a second motion, but I would move to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by one, removing the NR4 district type and considering that as part of the urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district.

335
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:39,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Classifying all the areas currently on this proposal listed with some adjustments based on the work that you guys are going to do to go down to the parcel level.

336
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:45,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.

337
00:43:46,546 --> 00:43:50,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Classify the areas currently in the proposal listed as NR3, as NR2.

338
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:08,926
[SPEAKER_06]: and classify all the areas currently listed on the proposal as NR4, as NR3, and to adjust the NR3 type to remove the one unit by right, which I think will meet some of the changes.

339
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:21,612
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would also just note that any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2.

340
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:33,863
[SPEAKER_06]: and that any district where the current zoning is an apartment district should be NR3.

341
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:40,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Perez.

342
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:43,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you email that motion to myself as well as the clerk?

343
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:45,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'll do that.

344
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:48,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have a further motion, but I know folks want to discuss that one first.

345
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a significant change.

346
00:44:53,668 --> 00:44:54,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

347
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:58,292
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll wait for that to come through.

348
00:44:58,312 --> 00:45:19,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I might need part of that reread, but that was to remove neighborhood residential four, have that be considered instead as part of the urban residential that we'll be considering in February, those denser districts, and then to downshift neighborhood residential two and three to kind of step the gradient down by one level of density.

349
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:22,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that an accurate synopsis?

350
00:45:22,658 --> 00:45:24,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I left out a lot of the detail that you mentioned.

351
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:30,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, yes, that's fair.

352
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm emailing it now.

353
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

354
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:39,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

355
00:45:42,186 --> 00:45:42,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

356
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:46,290
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I'll say that given the garbled nature of the Zoom

357
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:53,871
[SPEAKER_10]: call and the complicated nature of the request, I definitely need that reread because I did not understand what that was.

358
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a couple of things.

359
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:00,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one, I'm really excited about the idea of historic conversions.

360
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:10,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's wonderful, like not changing the exterior of the building but allowing for it to become maybe, you know, a five-bedroom becomes a two-bedroom and a three-bedroom is such a great idea.

361
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:19,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I wanted to ask a little bit about the NR2 and NR3 areas that used to be single-family.

362
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:31,472
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm specifically thinking about, as I look at the map, like Lawrence Estates and those parts of West Medford that were single-family, single-family one.

363
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:37,954
[SPEAKER_10]: And curious, because you did mention that you're trying to get it to reflect what's currently there,

364
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:57,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that in those areas, the two-unit and three-unit allowance under these new zoning neighborhoods, is that reflective or is that going to be a significant change in those two areas, the Lawrence Estates and the West Medford?

365
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is a good question.

366
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:22,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So from going to single family one to single family two, it's not that big incremental.

367
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:28,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big defining change of the structure or a super high density.

368
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:31,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are increasing just that small increment.

369
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:48,992
[SPEAKER_04]: The current zoning, it shows that in the area of Medford, the West Medford area, we do see some of the single, the two units going further than this general residential that is already there.

370
00:47:50,372 --> 00:47:59,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are following a bit that trend that it seems that is expanding more than what is reflecting on the general residential.

371
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:25,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And there we have a commuter rail station, so we think that it is a place that we could increase just a little bit that density, and especially the sizes of these lots are more than good to have a two-unit dwelling, so it's really possible to

372
00:48:26,975 --> 00:48:30,858
[SPEAKER_04]: to apply a two unit at least in that area.

373
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:37,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And then south of Lawrence, so there is a bus line that cross area.

374
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:49,834
[SPEAKER_04]: The south is quite flat and it's close to the Medford Square and the commuter rail transit areas.

375
00:48:50,415 --> 00:48:54,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems a good area also to up

376
00:48:55,979 --> 00:49:00,221
[SPEAKER_04]: to increase a bit that density in that south area.

377
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,922
[SPEAKER_04]: The north is a bit more difficult because of topography.

378
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:08,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also keep it in these two, in the inner two, instead of increasing.

379
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:12,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

380
00:49:12,646 --> 00:49:13,846
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw me moving around, right?

381
00:49:15,027 --> 00:49:22,990
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, Councilor, you had also asked specifically about Lawrence Estates and sort of the division between the northern and the southern part of that.

382
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:32,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And this map here that has the current types of residential dwellings I know it's a little hard to see on this screen for people but maybe when they go to the website afterwards they can zoom in.

383
00:49:33,064 --> 00:49:39,234
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see that there have in the southern part of the Lawrence Estates have been quite a few conversions into two family.

384
00:49:39,734 --> 00:49:43,736
[SPEAKER_08]: there, that's that orange color that's popping out a little bit on that screen.

385
00:49:44,976 --> 00:50:01,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, in seeing that trend that there might not be that much of a difference, I think, too, we can recognize that a lot that has a building on it is probably slower to change than a lot that is vacant.

386
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:03,703
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something else that as we

387
00:50:04,683 --> 00:50:21,057
[SPEAKER_08]: As we check with you the sort of the framework idea of this and then zoom further in to understand which areas have vacant lots that might be redevelopable if these dimensional standards change.

388
00:50:21,657 --> 00:50:26,239
[SPEAKER_08]: and which areas the dimensional standards won't make a difference.

389
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:34,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's another part of looking at the existing density and where there are already buildings of a certain type.

390
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:41,564
[SPEAKER_08]: So we pay a lot of attention to this map because it's showing what's actually on the ground as opposed to the current zoning.

391
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:58,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that address your question, Councilor Callahan?

392
00:50:58,228 --> 00:51:02,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you were talking about the difference between SF1 and SF2, NR1 and NR2.

393
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:21,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, mostly I was kind of, what I was looking at, and thanks for pointing out this particular map, because now I can actually see it for myself and zoom in on it, but like in that Lawrence Estates especially, it really does look like it's currently mostly single family, and we are, you know, upping it by one and two,

394
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,082
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially like, you know, one and two levels more.

395
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:34,626
[SPEAKER_10]: So, just, I just wanted to know how much change was suggested.

396
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:42,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a question that is perhaps a silly one, but I was curious when I look at the, the

397
00:51:43,243 --> 00:51:47,386
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of diagram, the very last page that has the two and a half stories and the three stories.

398
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:56,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that I see that architecture all over the place and like the two and a half story looks, you know, a certain way and the three story looks very like blocky and cut off.

399
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:20,105
[SPEAKER_10]: how much does it, that half story matter to like not blocking people's view or not blocking people's sunlight or not blocking other things because like as an architectural piece and for the amount of extra space people get in their homes, like it, I don't know, to me seems like that might be nicer actually.

400
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:23,487
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just like, this is a, I'm totally not an architecture person.

401
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,248
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just curious more than anything, not making a suggestion.

402
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:41,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep forgetting that green means stop and red means go.

403
00:52:41,148 --> 00:52:42,689
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just not constantly on.

404
00:52:43,249 --> 00:52:43,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

405
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:46,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a good question.

406
00:52:47,191 --> 00:52:50,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We were actually talking right before the meeting that for the

407
00:52:52,553 --> 00:52:56,594
[SPEAKER_08]: the three and the four that we actually wanted to show two buildings.

408
00:52:56,614 --> 00:53:00,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We had gone with the two of the same size next to each other.

409
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:04,436
[SPEAKER_08]: But in fact, what we'd like to do is show that you could have a flat roof or you can have a pitched roof.

410
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:21,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the interesting thing with height is that when you start to think about stories rather than feet is that the building code and often, and I don't remember what it is in Medford off the top of my head, the zoning definitions have a definition of story height.

411
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:37,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you limit it to two and a half, say, and somebody wants to put on a full dormer to bump it out, that might, by the amount of livable space, that might take you up into a three-story.

412
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:45,308
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's important to understand that a three-story or a four-story limit does not mean necessarily that you're going to have a flat roof.

413
00:53:45,868 --> 00:53:49,391
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're going to change our diagramming before the next meeting to just call that out.

414
00:53:49,451 --> 00:53:51,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll double check the height definitions.

415
00:53:51,593 --> 00:53:53,634
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said, we were talking about it right before the meeting.

416
00:53:54,495 --> 00:54:12,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I think your idea, too, of how much of a difference does it make on the street, one of the things that I've noticed with a lot of our historic buildings in New England is that you can have, and it's funny when you read the assessor's records, because I recognize this, you might get a 2H or a 2T or a 3T.

417
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:21,234
[SPEAKER_08]: floor heights and our building heights are actually taller maybe than what's been built now.

418
00:54:21,314 --> 00:54:23,075
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at a beautiful historic home.

419
00:54:23,615 --> 00:54:33,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I for example lived in a house that probably violated the 35 foot requirement in the community that I was living in, but it was built before zoning was put into place.

420
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's something else we want to recognize in the portion of our thinking where we're

421
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:49,025
[SPEAKER_08]: reducing the number of non-conformities is, again, being aware of how old the buildings are, what they are, not putting an undue restriction on them.

422
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:55,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Having said that, we talked about the idea of design guidelines for historic conversions.

423
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,369
[SPEAKER_08]: We could certainly think in the development standards part of this.

424
00:54:59,649 --> 00:55:10,711
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we set up an expectation that people will be considering the contacts for a new building as opposed to a rehab and considering their relationship to their neighbors?

425
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:20,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that we can talk further as we go through these two months about thinking about residential buildings in Medford and the rules and requirements around them.

426
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:27,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Does a half story, does a two and a half or three and a half limit encourage pitched roofs?

427
00:55:29,682 --> 00:55:33,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily, there are other ways around it.

428
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:50,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think you could say, okay, this is a two and a half story building, but then there's a perhaps out of proportion, full shed dormer put on it, makes it really more like a three, but it's not necessarily architecturally well done sometimes.

429
00:55:50,276 --> 00:55:55,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why I'm saying we need to collectively think about the components of these houses.

430
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:03,565
[SPEAKER_08]: potentially as well as the houses themselves because it's not just the building massing that might affect views or light.

431
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:08,729
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the position of the building on the lot you know how far is it set back relative to next door.

432
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:14,614
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the solar orientation there's a there's a bunch of things that can come into that and I think one question.

433
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:28,067
[SPEAKER_08]: for the city council and the community to consider is how much regulation do they want to put on single family dwellings, understanding that we're looking at a way of making housing easier to do.

434
00:56:29,528 --> 00:56:34,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's a question that we can also continue to explore with you over this period.

435
00:56:38,154 --> 00:56:38,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

436
00:56:38,794 --> 00:56:39,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

437
00:56:40,255 --> 00:56:42,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I see a couple hands up.

438
00:56:42,516 --> 00:56:44,617
[SPEAKER_11]: We will take all public participation at the end of the meeting.

439
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:45,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for being here.

440
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:46,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go next to President Bears.

441
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:51,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

442
00:56:52,059 --> 00:57:05,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make my other motion, which is to request that the chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.

443
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,606
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've sent the language for both of these over.

444
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:18,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to step out in a few minutes, five minutes, but I'm happy to answer any questions on my motion now and potentially consider them if possible.

445
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,231
[SPEAKER_06]: But if not, I hope my colleagues will consider them and approve them.

446
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:24,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

447
00:57:24,352 --> 00:57:25,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

448
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:32,115
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll reread both motions.

449
00:57:33,629 --> 00:57:46,076
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that was just made was motion by President Bears to request that the chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.

450
00:57:48,357 --> 00:57:49,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And the, do I hear a motion?

451
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:50,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, a second?

452
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:52,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

453
00:57:54,588 --> 00:58:11,501
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first motion given towards the beginning of the meeting was the motion to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by removing the NR4 district type and consider that as part of urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district.

454
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:18,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as just NR1.

455
00:58:18,722 --> 00:58:20,724
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a downshift from NR2.

456
00:58:21,725 --> 00:58:25,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR3 as NR2.

457
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR4 as NR3.

458
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:37,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Adjust the NR3 district type to remove the one unit dwelling by right.

459
00:58:38,857 --> 00:58:43,783
[SPEAKER_11]: And any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2.

460
00:58:45,085 --> 00:58:47,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And any parcels, sorry, the last bit of this got cut off.

461
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:54,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

462
00:58:57,594 --> 00:59:10,722
[SPEAKER_11]: And any, sorry, that last clause is any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2, and any parcels where the district, current district is apartment one or apartment two should be at least NR3.

463
00:59:10,742 --> 00:59:23,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody need that read back again, put on the screen, or do I hear a second on the motion?

464
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:25,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming?

465
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:26,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

466
00:59:29,457 --> 00:59:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

467
00:59:30,057 --> 00:59:43,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for some, Council President Bears, just for some clarification, so you mentioned, I believe part of that motion was, for instance, making all NR2 into NR1.

468
00:59:43,724 --> 00:59:58,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to clarify, is that a, I mean, would that mean that all of the current NR1s get updated to include two-unit dwellings and historical conversion of two to three units, or would that mean that all

469
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:07,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And our twos get that requirement for two-unit dwellings removed.

470
01:00:09,332 --> 01:00:10,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the second one.

471
01:00:10,252 --> 01:00:12,613
[SPEAKER_06]: It's essentially downstepping each of the shades.

472
01:00:13,054 --> 01:00:25,599
[SPEAKER_06]: So the very light yellow would stay the same, the medium yellow would go down to the light yellow, the lighter orange would go down to the medium yellow, and the dark orange would go down to the lighter orange.

473
01:00:37,724 --> 01:00:40,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry.

474
01:00:41,113 --> 01:00:41,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

475
01:00:43,038 --> 01:00:43,720
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to finish your thought.

476
01:00:48,956 --> 01:00:49,717
[SPEAKER_10]: What mic number are you?

477
01:00:49,837 --> 01:00:50,217
[SPEAKER_11]: You're six.

478
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:51,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys.

479
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:52,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it.

480
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

481
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I heard Zach say is the opposite of what I wrote down that you read.

482
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:10,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So my understanding is that now the lightest yellow and the northern parts of Lawrence Estates and the middle part of West Medford would all include two-unit dwellings.

483
01:01:11,274 --> 01:01:12,434
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I heard, Zach.

484
01:01:12,555 --> 01:01:15,437
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I heard in the rereading of the

485
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:35,866
[SPEAKER_10]: thing and I am concerned because I think that's I'm not really comfortable if that's what we're doing is making every like two unit everywhere like that's I believe president bears please step in and correct me I think it's the opposite I think it's that yeah I'm saying the opposite I'm saying that this is an increment too far and each shade should go down one increment

486
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:43,525
[SPEAKER_10]: That is, I feel much more comfortable about that, but I'm a little concerned about the wording because to me, the wording said the other.

487
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:50,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so the current wording classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.

488
01:01:52,387 --> 01:01:54,988
[SPEAKER_11]: So NR1 stay the same, NR2s become NR1.

489
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:57,849
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how I read that.

490
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's the intent.

491
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:05,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

492
01:02:06,168 --> 01:02:07,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm much more comfortable with that.

493
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:08,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

494
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:09,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the clarification.

495
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:14,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Emily.

496
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:15,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

497
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:20,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to repeat something that Paola said at the beginning and just

498
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:24,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to give the council some information.

499
01:02:24,505 --> 01:02:27,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So she had said that the boundaries.

500
01:02:27,969 --> 01:02:40,963
[SPEAKER_08]: These are very high level boundaries and so we do an understanding the direction that President Bears has suggested, we have no objection at this point but we just want you to know that we need to go in and

501
01:02:41,343 --> 01:02:59,216
[SPEAKER_08]: just check the boundaries and make sure that with this change that they still make sense as shown or you know do they wiggle need to wiggle around a little bit more I think as I'm saying it's a high level so just to make sure that the councillors are aware of the kind of the scale that we're looking at in this particular image.

502
01:02:59,936 --> 01:03:09,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Great thank you that makes sense that the uh the boundaries between the proposed districts would have to change in any case and especially if we're contemplating this downshift for the proposal that we'll see in two weeks great.

503
01:03:11,947 --> 01:03:14,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Luebbing, I'll recognize you.

504
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:20,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I could support President Bears's motion.

505
01:03:20,514 --> 01:03:29,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think you do need additional density, particularly around the T stops.

506
01:03:31,483 --> 01:03:38,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I personally don't see the need to sort of increase the

507
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:47,448
[SPEAKER_03]: the amounts of single unit dwellings quite that much.

508
01:03:47,528 --> 01:03:51,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I personally like it as it is.

509
01:03:57,881 --> 01:03:58,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Go to Councilor Callahan.

510
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,961
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a lively debate.

511
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:01,681
[SPEAKER_10]: This is exciting.

512
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:05,163
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am in favor of sex change.

513
01:04:05,683 --> 01:04:06,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll just let you know why.

514
01:04:08,104 --> 01:04:21,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, like, I'm really encouraged by the fact that we are allowing for historic conversions and ADUs by right throughout what is currently considered single family.

515
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:28,794
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, that is enough change in those areas that I do not feel like we need to move further than that.

516
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:29,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think

517
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:49,714
[SPEAKER_10]: we will get pushback from the community is my concern that, you know, that's a little bit like those areas of Lawrence Estates and West Medford that already that is, I think, excellent and just the right amount of change that we're going to allow that doesn't really change a character of the community.

518
01:04:50,795 --> 01:04:54,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I think once we're allowing two units, that for me, that

519
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:08,888
[SPEAKER_10]: belongs more in the areas that were on this new map considered neighborhood residential three.

520
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:16,354
[SPEAKER_10]: And that also will be a change for much of those places, but I'm comfortable with that level of change.

521
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:21,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So I feel quite good, and I think better than the current

522
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:34,341
[SPEAKER_10]: suggestion, given that I do understand that because of some of the existing housing that is there, because you guys plotted this very carefully, that the boundaries are going to adjust a little bit.

523
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:37,562
[SPEAKER_10]: But to me, this feels more comfortable.

524
01:05:37,882 --> 01:05:49,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also does mean, because of the ADUs and the historic conversions by right, that we are allowing more housing throughout the city, but just in a way that I think feels more comfortable to the residents of the single-family, current single-family one areas.

525
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:51,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

526
01:05:52,004 --> 01:05:52,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

527
01:05:53,474 --> 01:05:55,516
[SPEAKER_11]: As one councilor, I think that you put that well.

528
01:05:56,056 --> 01:06:05,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that historic conversion and being able to implement the statewide ADU law will be meaningful.

529
01:06:06,143 --> 01:06:07,043
[SPEAKER_11]: We could go further.

530
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:12,767
[SPEAKER_11]: We will go further in other areas of the city where I personally think that it makes more sense topographically, geographically.

531
01:06:14,688 --> 01:06:17,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a second to the motion by President Bears?

532
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:17,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

533
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:21,373
[SPEAKER_11]: So the motion by President Bears is seconded by Councilor Callahan.

534
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a, sorry, was that a hand?

535
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:28,478
[SPEAKER_11]: No, okay, I was imagining things.

536
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:35,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any further discussion on, President Bears's had his part, we can vote on these motions anytime.

537
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:51,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further comment by councilors on the presentation, questions, concerns, potential amendments we'd like to see in the updated draft that we'll consider for January 29th and just in my,

538
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,115
[SPEAKER_11]: mental note-taking.

539
01:06:53,175 --> 01:07:01,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that in addition to the changes that we'll vote on, we can also expect to see more finessed boundaries between the various sub-districts.

540
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:21,231
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm also looking forward to the diagrams, the residential requirements, including not just one type of what can be built in each district, but more varied buildings that folks can envision them in context of what these neighborhoods might actually look like with the possible buildings, or perhaps already look like.

541
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:44,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing no further hands from councillors, we have a second on both those motions from President Bears.

542
01:07:45,598 --> 01:07:46,259
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll take them in order.

543
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:54,827
[SPEAKER_11]: read this one more time just so we can hear it and to give people time to think of potentially more motions.

544
01:07:55,587 --> 01:08:13,634
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by removing the NR4 district type and consider that as part of urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district, classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.

545
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:20,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR3 as NR2.

546
01:08:20,956 --> 01:08:24,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Classifying all areas currently listed on the proposal as NR4 as NR3.

547
01:08:26,637 --> 01:08:30,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Adjust the NR3 district type to remove the one unit dwelling by right.

548
01:08:31,518 --> 01:08:39,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Any parcel where the current district is GR should be at least NR2 and any parcels where the current district is apartment one or apartment two should be at least NR3.

549
01:08:44,063 --> 01:08:49,908
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Councilor Scarpelli and President Bears both had to drop off so we can do a voice vote.

550
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,249
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

551
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:51,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

552
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:52,930
[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

553
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:55,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Two in favor, one opposed.

554
01:08:55,152 --> 01:08:55,773
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

555
01:09:01,177 --> 01:09:04,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Three out of five is a quorum, isn't it?

556
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,802
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's two in favor and one opposed out of three.

557
01:09:07,322 --> 01:09:11,546
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but the quorum is... It's a majority of the quorum.

558
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:36,182
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Leming, to request that the Chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.

559
01:09:37,123 --> 01:09:37,783
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

560
01:09:38,223 --> 01:09:38,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

561
01:09:38,864 --> 01:09:39,384
[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

562
01:09:40,365 --> 01:09:40,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

563
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:48,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further comments or questions from Councilors at this time?

564
01:09:51,213 --> 01:09:51,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

565
01:09:53,154 --> 01:09:54,655
[SPEAKER_11]: We will go to public participation.

566
01:09:54,675 --> 01:09:56,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing nobody at the podium, I will go first to Zoom.

567
01:09:57,397 --> 01:09:58,898
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to request that you unmute.

568
01:09:58,938 --> 01:10:03,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record, and you will have three minutes.

569
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:08,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

570
01:10:08,444 --> 01:10:09,605
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Maureen Wing.

571
01:10:09,645 --> 01:10:15,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I live on 36 Dudley Street in Medford, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak and everything that's been reviewed tonight.

572
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:16,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate it.

573
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to apologize up front.

574
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:20,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I was unable to make

575
01:10:20,879 --> 01:10:23,221
[SPEAKER_07]: The December meeting due to a previous commitment.

576
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:26,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that I'm behind the eight ball here and trying to catch up.

577
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:28,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I just would like to.

578
01:10:30,535 --> 01:10:46,085
[SPEAKER_07]: mention again, uh, what a brief description of what, uh, Councilor Scarpelli said in that, uh, some of the friends and neighbors that I've been speaking with in the route 60 Salem street area are just a little bit nervous about all of this.

579
01:10:46,305 --> 01:10:55,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really appreciate that you're, um, considering other types of outreach or increasing the outreach to get us more informed and involved.

580
01:10:55,471 --> 01:10:56,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really appreciate that.

581
01:10:57,285 --> 01:11:08,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, some of the things I know that people have talked about are what, um, and I think you've addressed some of that, but again, height of buildings, they're concerned about traffic impact on route 60 route 60.

582
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:13,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and there's nervousness about a butters to Salem street.

583
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:16,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to mention that, um, going down the road.

584
01:11:16,581 --> 01:11:21,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd be aware of what I'm hearing from, uh, neighbors and residents that live near me.

585
01:11:26,752 --> 01:11:29,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for attending tonight and for sharing that feedback.

586
01:11:29,173 --> 01:11:31,814
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is duly noted and really appreciated.

587
01:11:33,295 --> 01:11:51,342
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure that we're improving at letting the residents know about what their opportunities are to get informed about these proposals, including Salem Street, especially for abutters and neighbors so that folks can be at the meetings and be in the spaces where they can ask questions, get their questions answered.

588
01:11:52,082 --> 01:11:53,142
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for raising that.

589
01:11:53,182 --> 01:11:54,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the current proposal

590
01:11:56,018 --> 01:11:56,438
[SPEAKER_11]: the proposal.

591
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:57,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Developed by Ennis has they were.

592
01:11:57,499 --> 01:12:04,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that these folks were really careful about factoring in, you know, neighborhood compatibility and being thoughtful about if we're increasing height.

593
01:12:04,981 --> 01:12:09,823
[SPEAKER_11]: By how much under what conditions we're not going to be going into that proposal in depth tonight.

594
01:12:09,903 --> 01:12:12,184
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I hope you're already aware a week from today.

595
01:12:13,424 --> 01:12:14,104
[SPEAKER_11]: January 22nd.

596
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:18,746
[SPEAKER_11]: The CD board will be discussing the Salem Street proposal for the first time.

597
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:29,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it will be a really helpful overview with an opportunity for questions and answers as well.

598
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:35,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much, and please continue to attend, even on the meetings that aren't specifically germane to your residence area.

599
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:35,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for being here.

600
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:39,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, we'll go to the podium.

601
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:41,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

602
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:51,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

603
01:12:51,776 --> 01:12:52,036
[SPEAKER_11]: That's me.

604
01:12:53,997 --> 01:12:54,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

605
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:54,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

606
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:56,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

607
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Road.

608
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:09,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a few notes during the presentation that I went to address, and I would like to thank President Bears and everyone that voted yes on the changes, because they address most of my concerns.

609
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:13,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live in the north of Lawrence Estates.

610
01:13:15,192 --> 01:13:37,283
[SPEAKER_01]: and there there's a lack of public transportation so you either have to drive or bike and it just makes gives me some doubts that so NR1 which was north-mid for Fulton Heights is actually closer to the subway than the north of Lawrence Estate so it makes me wonder how come you know

611
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Fulton Heights was in R1 and we were in R2.

612
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,879
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's a little bit concerning.

613
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:50,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, when I take the T and I don't bike, I have to walk all the way through Fulton Heights up to Malden.

614
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:55,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on West Medford, we actually have the commuter rail, which is not as efficient as the Orange Line.

615
01:13:56,942 --> 01:14:00,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that didn't make too much sense.

616
01:14:02,763 --> 01:14:05,344
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks again to President Bezos and everyone that voted yes to that address.

617
01:14:05,665 --> 01:14:18,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think that Councilor Callahan also mentioned, if you look at the map or if you walk around the neighborhood for us, all of us that live there, there's just not two-unit housing there.

618
01:14:19,191 --> 01:14:28,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only in the north of Lawrence Estates, but then if you cross to the south of Lawrence Road, where Summit Avenue is and all of that, there's not even a single two-unit house.

619
01:14:28,155 --> 01:14:30,797
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be like a huge change from what we have right now.

620
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:33,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Other points.

621
01:14:33,082 --> 01:14:37,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So the north of Lawrence Estates is also locked in by the false reservation.

622
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,690
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of dead end roads, cul-de-sacs and things like that.

623
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So also, you know, having density there doesn't make much sense to me.

624
01:14:45,657 --> 01:14:46,638
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of private ways.

625
01:14:46,938 --> 01:14:47,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in a private way.

626
01:14:48,058 --> 01:14:54,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you might know, the city does not do repairs of those roads.

627
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:55,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going through that process myself.

628
01:14:56,363 --> 01:15:00,645
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an area of our private way that is in pretty bad shape.

629
01:15:00,665 --> 01:15:06,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in conversation with engineering and DPW, and then they actually just patch it, but they would not repave it.

630
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:06,529
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to

631
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:08,169
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.

632
01:15:08,749 --> 01:15:18,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, for example, we started having two-unit houses over there, it's more neighbors that will have to become in agreement whenever we have to pay to maintain our private way.

633
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:23,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already going through the pain that not everyone wants to participate in chipping in.

634
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:26,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will make everything a lot harder.

635
01:15:26,994 --> 01:15:37,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I will be interested in considering private waste at a future meeting as well because I talk to people that live in them as well and then all of us voice concerns.

636
01:15:38,338 --> 01:15:51,943
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last point that I wanted to say is that so all this kind of I believe and maybe Councilor Lehmann can correct me on this but units are less than, dwellings are less than six units actually will not pay a linkage fee.

637
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:56,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're increasing density, what's going to happen to our existing infrastructure?

638
01:15:56,605 --> 01:16:04,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where is the funding to sort of either upgrade it or make sure that it holds up if there's more density?

639
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:05,389
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that going to work?

640
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:12,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, I think the linkage fee is only paid for joints that are more than six units or greater than or equal to, I don't remember.

641
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:16,673
[SPEAKER_01]: But these ones that we have been discussing today don't apply.

642
01:16:18,951 --> 01:16:19,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.

643
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:23,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to thank everyone for the very interesting discussion that we're getting to speak up.

644
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

645
01:16:23,953 --> 01:16:24,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

646
01:16:24,854 --> 01:16:27,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the thoughtful comments, as always, Gaston.

647
01:16:27,935 --> 01:16:36,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to quickly respond to a couple of those, and I know, sorry, we're not supposed to go back and forth, but just since you brought it up, on the linkage piece, I think that's a really reasonable question.

648
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that when we look at the zoning overhaul in totality,

649
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:53,977
[SPEAKER_11]: That issue becomes less because in some areas like the proposed NR1 districts, we're not encouraging developments that would be large enough to kick in the linkage fees.

650
01:16:54,577 --> 01:17:05,200
[SPEAKER_11]: In other areas, for example, the places that are really close to the very, very high transit stations, we might be encouraging developments that would kick into the linkage fees.

651
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:11,541
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it would have an equalizing effect, maybe not when we're just considering the neighborhood residential as a single project, but citywide,

652
01:17:12,438 --> 01:17:25,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Councilor Leming, in particular, has been making sure that we're updating our linkage fees so that when we do create new zoning, especially along places like Mystic Ave, where we're encouraging big new developments, that they're gonna be paying their fair share and that their fair share is calculated correctly.

653
01:17:25,783 --> 01:17:27,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for bringing up that point.

654
01:17:28,124 --> 01:17:30,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the other thing I was going to say was not important.

655
01:17:31,065 --> 01:17:32,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, as always, for your thoughtful commentary.

656
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:36,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate it.

657
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:37,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

658
01:17:37,888 --> 01:17:38,688
[SPEAKER_11]: You have three minutes.

659
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:42,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharon Diesso, Mass Avenue and Circuit Road corner.

660
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:43,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

661
01:17:45,742 --> 01:17:52,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering, I came in a little late and I didn't hear the announcement of who this group is here.

662
01:17:56,124 --> 01:17:59,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I've seen the name before on different agendas coming into the city.

663
01:18:00,325 --> 01:18:02,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me just get a retrospect here.

664
01:18:02,665 --> 01:18:06,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the word density, density, density.

665
01:18:07,046 --> 01:18:07,606
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the goal?

666
01:18:08,786 --> 01:18:09,506
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the goal here?

667
01:18:09,526 --> 01:18:12,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why promoting density?

668
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:17,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to do with helping out taxes and tax rate and whatnot.

669
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:20,312
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the goal?

670
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:27,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to let you finish your three minutes, and then I can respond after if you have more that you want to put on the record.

671
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:29,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry?

672
01:18:29,778 --> 01:18:33,640
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have further questions behind that, I'm happy to just give you your full time, and then I can respond afterwards.

673
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:35,781
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm wondering.

674
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:41,705
[SPEAKER_05]: this planning board and the zoning changes that are being proposed.

675
01:18:41,765 --> 01:18:43,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just give you an example.

676
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:52,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been a study, for instance, in the Lawrence Estates of how many lots are 7,000 feet or more.

677
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:53,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know?

678
01:18:54,514 --> 01:18:57,257
[SPEAKER_05]: How many homeowners have 7,000 feet or more?

679
01:18:58,538 --> 01:19:04,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So why would you go into an area like that and propose changes even if someone sold their home?

680
01:19:05,565 --> 01:19:06,346
[SPEAKER_05]: You still can't.

681
01:19:07,027 --> 01:19:08,729
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not enough land because there's only 7,000.

682
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:12,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't equal 10 unless I'm really doing

683
01:19:13,013 --> 01:19:13,994
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, bad math.

684
01:19:14,775 --> 01:19:22,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering why you are not going to places like even the state to see if they even have land that they would be willing to sell.

685
01:19:23,184 --> 01:19:32,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you destroying the look and the ambiance and the reason why some people come to those areas, they come to Medford.

686
01:19:32,713 --> 01:19:35,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen beautiful homes on 6,500 square foot lots

687
01:19:36,677 --> 01:19:37,637
[SPEAKER_05]: They've brought children.

688
01:19:37,657 --> 01:19:41,539
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a nice vitality to see them walking to the school buses.

689
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:45,340
[SPEAKER_05]: They have beautiful play areas built in their backyards.

690
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Many, many people have put in pools.

691
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:56,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why you're going into residential areas that have practically no land to offer in the first place.

692
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:01,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I'm understanding this week, it's not going to happen because the residents

693
01:20:02,987 --> 01:20:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that it doesn't happen.

694
01:20:04,809 --> 01:20:14,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It shouldn't happen in TNT area because there are better ways to raise taxes in cities besides destroying areas.

695
01:20:14,658 --> 01:20:19,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you leave this council, I hope you don't go on to another town and that's your plan somewhere else.

696
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:20,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

697
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:24,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your comments.

698
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:44,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just quickly note that all of the goals that are guiding the zoning overhaul come out of the Community Informed Housing Production Plan, Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, and Medford Comprehensive Plan, and are guided by our knowledge that Medford is a beautiful place that a lot of people live and a lot of people want to move into.

699
01:20:44,644 --> 01:20:46,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And people who live here are struggling to stay here.

700
01:20:46,646 --> 01:20:53,230
[SPEAKER_11]: People who want to live here, people who grew up here and want to buy a home, people who want to stay here are struggling to find housing to do so.

701
01:20:54,377 --> 01:20:58,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Those guide the goals around thoughtfully adding densification where it makes sense in each neighborhood.

702
01:20:59,658 --> 01:20:59,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

703
01:20:59,978 --> 01:21:01,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have one more question.

704
01:21:02,379 --> 01:21:07,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Suppose there were an area where there was land dividable and whatnot.

705
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:14,902
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had, even just as an example, 5X, you had twice as many homes, the property value would come down.

706
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So how are you gaining a tax?

707
01:21:18,963 --> 01:21:25,627
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, hike anyway, because the value of the home would be only two-thirds of what it originally was.

708
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:32,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just saying, along with my family, I maintain all the flowers.

709
01:21:32,872 --> 01:21:35,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you enjoy them next to Colleen's.

710
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:40,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole island was dedicated to my family by Michael Marks about four years ago.

711
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:44,300
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope you enjoy the decorations and all the flowers I put in.

712
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:58,713
[SPEAKER_05]: It was mainly recognized to go to my father and my family because my dad was one of the longest living residents who never moved after he bought his home years ago, so I inherited the second property.

713
01:21:59,293 --> 01:22:02,056
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's why people come and why people stay.

714
01:22:02,116 --> 01:22:04,859
[SPEAKER_05]: People used to come and admire our pine trees, the lots.

715
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:12,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, some of my yard parties are popular because of the size of my yard and the way that we maintain the beautiful trees.

716
01:22:12,603 --> 01:22:19,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there are different areas, not that anyone should be overly affected more than another area, for instance, Salem Street.

717
01:22:20,127 --> 01:22:29,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm really asking, I know a lot of you, and I don't mean this as a criticism, are not big business entrepreneurs and you haven't been on city planning boards before, etc.

718
01:22:30,413 --> 01:22:39,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to areas where you know you can actually generate appreciated revenue coming into the city that does not disturb residents.

719
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:48,964
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want to move to Medford, I'd love to move to Winchester, but I'm not going to go every week and tell them to start changing all this owning ordinance so I can afford a home.

720
01:22:49,525 --> 01:22:52,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think you need to do more math than this.

721
01:22:52,887 --> 01:22:53,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you.

722
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:56,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And a merry and healthy new year to everyone.

723
01:22:58,191 --> 01:22:59,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your comments.

724
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:11,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will just note that the goals of the housing production parts of the zoning overhaul, I believe, are motivated by the community's desire to build more housing, not as a revenue strategy.

725
01:23:14,717 --> 01:23:19,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing no further hands on Zoom, are there any further comments or motions from councilors?

726
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:27,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming?

727
01:23:30,151 --> 01:23:31,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaston, do you have an additional comment?

728
01:23:31,532 --> 01:23:33,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have a question.

729
01:23:33,513 --> 01:23:33,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

730
01:23:33,733 --> 01:23:34,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very sorry, I apologize.

731
01:23:35,034 --> 01:23:36,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about, this is the, what number is this? 17.

732
01:23:46,261 --> 01:23:52,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So NR1, it says minimum load dimensions, 5,000 square feet.

733
01:23:52,864 --> 01:23:55,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So could you explain to me, so how does that work?

734
01:23:55,405 --> 01:24:02,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that in our area, there are several loads that are larger than 5,000 square feet.

735
01:24:02,088 --> 01:24:03,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?

736
01:24:05,029 --> 01:24:06,010
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can subdivide it?

737
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:11,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, we have a 10,000 square foot load, then would it be able to be subdivided into two 5,000 square feet?

738
01:24:22,165 --> 01:24:22,906
That's what it is.

739
01:24:59,947 --> 01:25:02,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, would you guys just speak into the microphone?

740
01:25:02,569 --> 01:25:02,970
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

741
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:16,121
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, that it needs to meet all the requirements, not only the dimensions, is that we analyze the existing lot sizes in all the SF1s and SF2s.

742
01:25:17,462 --> 01:25:19,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them are non-conforming.

743
01:25:20,063 --> 01:25:22,403
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them are below the 7,000.

744
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:24,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are non-conforming.

745
01:25:24,624 --> 01:25:27,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to reduce those conformities.

746
01:25:27,305 --> 01:25:32,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And so 5,000 met a lot of those dimension.

747
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,427
[SPEAKER_01]: The last related question.

748
01:25:35,767 --> 01:25:41,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So NR2, I see in the table that it's actually the minimum dot dimension is smaller than NR1.

749
01:25:45,655 --> 01:25:55,007
[SPEAKER_01]: and then given that NR2 got converted into NR1, are you planning on keeping the minimum load dimension for the new NR1 as 4,000 or 5,000?

750
01:25:55,287 --> 01:25:56,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the rationale?

751
01:25:56,829 --> 01:26:00,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was NR2 smaller than NR1, the minimum load dimension?

752
01:26:06,324 --> 01:26:15,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're doing here is the requirements of the space around those areas as well, not only the built, but also the open space around it.

753
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:29,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So usually we are making a transition from the inner one to inner four, so that the density of what you see on the face in the street, so the setbacks are reduced.

754
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:32,703
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can build, you have a larger build coverage.

755
01:26:33,123 --> 01:26:34,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can build more house.

756
01:26:35,185 --> 01:26:39,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need a less, a smaller lot size to build more.

757
01:26:40,088 --> 01:26:46,912
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, so you will see, for example, the open space, it goes from 40% to 20%.

758
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:51,515
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how much you can build that space.

759
01:26:52,016 --> 01:26:55,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And so your house actually is bigger or the same.

760
01:26:55,978 --> 01:26:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that the lot and the surroundings are getting narrower.

761
01:26:59,921 --> 01:27:01,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see that transition.

762
01:27:03,463 --> 01:27:03,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

763
01:27:04,384 --> 01:27:04,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Paola.

764
01:27:05,505 --> 01:27:06,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your questions and comments.

765
01:27:09,647 --> 01:27:09,907
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

766
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:18,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing no further questions or motions from Councilors, I want to again thank Innocence Associates so much for being here with us.

767
01:27:18,973 --> 01:27:22,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Time and time again, you've done so much hard work for us over the course of the past year.

768
01:27:24,136 --> 01:27:25,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Emily's gesturing at Paola.

769
01:27:25,997 --> 01:27:26,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Team effort, I know.

770
01:27:29,246 --> 01:27:41,875
[SPEAKER_11]: really shaping the goals that the community has put into our guiding documents into zoning that we can consider, discuss, deliberate, amend, and talk about in public as much as we need to and vote on.

771
01:27:42,616 --> 01:27:43,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much.

772
01:27:43,837 --> 01:27:48,620
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be meeting on this topic again in two weeks with an updated proposal for councilors to review.

773
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,583
[SPEAKER_11]: So I look forward to that.

774
01:27:52,884 --> 01:27:53,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I hear a motion to adjourn?

775
01:27:53,864 --> 01:27:58,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming.

776
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:00,081
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

777
01:28:01,084 --> 01:28:01,545
[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

778
01:28:02,247 --> 01:28:03,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.

779
01:28:03,832 --> 01:28:04,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
