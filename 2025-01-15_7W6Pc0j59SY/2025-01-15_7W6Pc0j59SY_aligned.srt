16
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:45,570
The meeting is called to order.

17
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:54,794
The action discussion item for this committee meeting is again 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innis associates team.

18
00:05:55,634 --> 00:06:03,037
This is the first planning and permitting committee meeting of the new year.

19
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,440
We have seen a lot of work in this committee so far.

20
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,780
A lot of that is still ongoing.

21
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,550
the fall.

22
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:17,434
We shepherded through the Mystic Avenue Corridor District proposal.

23
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:23,478
The Salem Street Corridor District proposal is still being considered in public meetings by the Community Development Board.

24
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,762
The Green Score proposal is still being considered in public meetings by the Community Development Board.

25
00:06:27,782 --> 00:06:29,123
There's a lot of things in the pipeline.

26
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:38,811
Tonight, we are beginning our consideration, just the very beginning of the conversation on a new topic, which is the neighborhood residential topic.

27
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:56,935
So before I turn it over to our zoning consultant, I just kind of want to orient us to the goal of this meeting, what we're gonna be looking at this topic, which we're calling neighborhood residential is just a jumping off place for adjusting the zoning rules for the areas of the city that are currently residential and zoned as single family one or single family two.

28
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:07,383
There are districts like this throughout the city, as everybody knows, but they're especially concentrated in North Medford, West Medford, with some pockets in Glenwood, Wellington, and Hillsides.

29
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,267
So why are we looking at SF1 and two districts now?

30
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:17,612
You know, the same goals that carry us through the rest of the city for the rest of our zoning overhaul.

31
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:24,217
We know that there are areas of the city where the zoning does not reflect what is currently built on the ground.

32
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:38,527
We know that there are areas of the city where the zoning isn't allowing us to use our property or land the way that we know community members want us to, where it could better affirm our goals or where it could better affirm just what's already there.

33
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:48,201
And we also know that we have a need to allow for more housing development in Medford to keep pace with high demand, high scarcity, and increasingly high property valuations.

34
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:52,183
And zoning can offer tools to help us with all these problems.

35
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:57,605
So with a lot of the current SF districts, we know we'll have to let geography and context guide the way.

36
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:03,307
For example, in North Medford, narrow winding streets and steepness affect what is appropriate and possible.

37
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:12,150
We also do have areas that are next to, for example, some brand new transit hubs, and it doesn't make sense to not take advantage of those areas of the city for greater density in a thoughtful way.

38
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:19,914
So in just a minute going to turn it over to Paola from NS Associates for slides about what we're going to be considering tonight.

39
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:22,776
This presentation.

40
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:29,902
will walk us through a jumping off point for considering some new neighborhood residential approaches and existing SF and GR.

41
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:38,832
It also incorporates what new state law dictates around allowing ADUs by right in single family districts.

42
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:52,315
So just to recenter on the goals for tonight before we get into the weeds, and I know that pal is also going to reorient us in kind of the where this falls in the overall trajectory of, you know, what topics have come before this and what topics will come after this.

43
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:57,157
Tonight we're not looking at a proposal that we're going to be voting on or approving.

44
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:02,858
This is to serve as a jumping-off point that's based on the current zoning of SF1 and 2 districts.

45
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:06,238
We're very much not going to do this all in one fell swoop.

46
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:26,682
My goals for tonight is for this to be councilors' chance to put their initial thoughts, concerns, questions, requests for changes on the record, and we'll come back at our next meeting in two weeks, and as associates, we'll have taken all of that feedback and put together an amended proposal that we'll look at again before it is then referred for further review in more public meetings by the CDB.

47
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:31,861
So at this point, I see President Paris has his hand up and then I'll turn it over to Pella.

48
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:34,865
Thank you, Madam Chair.

49
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,610
Just want to thank you for getting us off to the start of this meeting.

50
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:48,680
And I want to note just that the comprehensive plan and the zoning that we've been implementing based on the comprehensive plan for the city

51
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:59,171
which was developed over two years with input from thousands of residents, is based on a model of neighborhoods, squares, and corridors.

52
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:08,241
We have been looking at corridors so far, and we'll be looking at squares going forward, and this

53
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:35,235
tonight we're talking about neighborhoods and neighborhood residential and I really appreciate that this meeting you know we're taking a second meeting in two weeks to look at a proposal and starting tonight just looking at general ideas and the research that has been done on the neighborhood residential and having looked at the presentation that was sent over by email I

54
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:51,090
I'm really looking forward to the presentation, but also, you know, do have some thoughts and some suggestions that I'm going to make after this meeting and look forward to seeing those hopefully incorporated into the draft that we see in two weeks.

55
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:57,654
And with that, I just want to thank again, the chair and the team that's working on this as well as fellow members of the committee.

56
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:58,214
Thank you.

57
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:00,996
Thank you, President Behrs.

58
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:06,499
All right, I will now recognize Paola.

59
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,880
Thanks as always for being here.

60
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:15,814
Hello, good night.

61
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:18,134
I'm here, I'm Paola Ramos Martinez.

62
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:22,635
I'm senior planner and urban designer at Innos Associates.

63
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:24,356
Here at my right is Emily Innos.

64
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,476
She's the director of Innos Associates.

65
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:32,978
And I'm very glad to be here to share our thoughts and proposal.

66
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,959
I'm going to share now my screen.

67
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:39,860
There we are.

68
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:55,179
So I'm going to repeat some of the things if I can.

69
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,440
Sorry, it's taking a bit of time.

70
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:07,222
Oh, great.

71
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:15,284
Yeah.

72
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:15,784
Take your time.

73
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:16,564
Is the screen frozen?

74
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,073
We can see the screen share on Zoom.

75
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:25,737
I think it might require maybe with the Zoom update a change in the booth to click the screen share instead of the video.

76
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:39,404
Okay, perfect.

77
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:55,764
Yeah.

78
00:12:55,804 --> 00:13:02,008
I'm using the internet.

79
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,110
That one is saved on the desktop.

80
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,712
What I can do is.

81
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,954
Are you not able to share, Paola?

82
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:13,495
Is it not reflecting what's on your screen?

83
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:16,657
I'm going to try to share the PDF.

84
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,280
I can share on my side if that is easier.

85
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,641
But you'd have to tell me when to switch.

86
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:36,487
Okay, sorry for that.

87
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:37,347
All good.

88
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:46,574
So I'm going to just repeat a few things that were already introduced by Vice President Collins.

89
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:53,399
So in the agenda today, we're going to look at the timeline, the plan for the 2025

90
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:11,247
the public hearing process and this is where public can give their comments when and we will look at those precise dates that we will be updating in all our meetings from now on.

91
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,749
We will give a bit of introduction and that is the comprehensive plan.

92
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:16,249
Where do you

93
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,313
where we are basing our proposals.

94
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:28,205
We will look at some of the analysis that we used to do the proposal and then we will show the proposal for the neighborhood residential districts.

95
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:31,570
And at the end we will leave obviously the time

96
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,813
for everyone to comment on the proposal.

97
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:38,877
One thing that I want to make very clear is this is a draft.

98
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:41,940
This is nothing decided.

99
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,561
This is why we are here.

100
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:44,883
We want your comments.

101
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:57,192
So here are the all the dates that we are going to have a planning and permitting committee meeting in this from now until May.

102
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:09,301
So we are in starting this year January 15th that's today and we are looking into neighborhood residential with especially the SF1 and SF2 districts.

103
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:27,921
What we did today was making a frame of all that residential structure so that it will help us to not only for this month but also for the next one for February when we will look more into the denser part of the urban residential.

104
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:39,609
In March and April, we will look at the commercial framework that is the squares, that is Medford Square and West Medford Square.

105
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:43,571
And then we will look at other corridors that we have not looked into yet.

106
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:47,213
And then at the end, we will look into Wellington Glenwood area.

107
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:56,204
So if we look at the topics from January, as we said, neighborhood residential, we are looking districts SF1 and SF2.

108
00:15:56,964 --> 00:16:01,288
We are looking at those dimensional standards and development standards.

109
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:10,715
And then citywide topic will be, we are working with housing, housing affordability, and many other topics that we will look later.

110
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:11,855
and development standards.

111
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:16,136
Uh February, urban residential districts, apartment one, two, and general residential.

112
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:23,538
Again, dimensional and development standards and as a citywide topics, we will look into ADUs and neighborhood notes.

113
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:27,739
Um then in March, the commercial framework and Medford Square.

114
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:37,681
Uh we will look at district C one, commercial one, and then the topics again, dimensional and development standards, and then the citywide topics will look into

115
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:49,669
And then April, West Medford and other corridors, commercial one, we will look into dimensional development standards that's in all of them.

116
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,934
And the citywide topics will be transport demand management and the site plan review.

117
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,000
We will end up with Wellington Glenwood area in May.

118
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:16,224
Districts Office 12 industrial and mixed use zone and then dimensional development standards, and we will review the parking requirement at the end so that we have a better knowledge from the studied districts already.

119
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,765
So this is the plan that we have is quite tight.

120
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:25,007
But yeah, we think all these topics are big importance.

121
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:29,610
So what are those opportunities for the public?

122
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:38,898
What is the process every time that we bring a draft that has to go through until it gets approved?

123
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:45,203
So first we present the topic as we are doing today with the neighborhood residential.

124
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:53,790
We presented at the planning and permitting meeting to city council, and then we have a moment of comment from the public.

125
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:06,859
We presented a second time in the next planning and permitted meeting committee meeting where could be already referred to this topic from the city council into the city board.

126
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,963
Again, in this place, we have a moment for public comments.

127
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:14,164
It goes into city board.

128
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:42,402
um hoping to be voted on the topic um and in this place we also have a moment for public comments then it will if it gets voted um and approved by the uh city board maybe with recommendations then it goes to the city council again and gets voted to be approved and here again we will hear comments from the public so there are as minimum we have these four

129
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,867
moments to hear from the public.

130
00:18:48,087 --> 00:19:00,258
So I just wanted to be clear on where we are now with other topics and what are those dates for the city board or the city council later on.

131
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,804
So for example, the gray text are those meetings that we already had.

132
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:13,867
the blue is the ones that we will have, and then the red is the ones that we are having.

133
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:28,272
So we already have, for example, with Salem Street, we already have the first two meetings, and then next week, the 22nd, we will have Salem Street to be on the city board.

134
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:33,895
So if anyone wants to comment on Salem Street, we will go with Salem Street and Green Score.

135
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:34,895
Sorry for that.

136
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:41,379
So both topics will go next week on the city board, and we will hear comments from the public.

137
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:54,087
And then in February, if it gets voted and referred to the city council, then in February, we will vote and hear again for Salem Street and Green Score.

138
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:58,048
So today we are first time that we will present this topic.

139
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:01,208
So this is the 15th of January.

140
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:11,731
We will bring back the neighborhood residential with any comment and adjustment with the comments that the city councilors will give and comments from the public.

141
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:16,712
We will bring it the 29th of January in the next planning and permitting meeting.

142
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:22,453
And then once we know we can more or less in.

143
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:29,775
If everything goes well in February, we will have the city board and then in March will be here back in City Council.

144
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:36,757
So we will be updating these dates whenever we know the next one.

145
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:45,920
So in every meeting, we will have this and see what topics have been done, what topics are in process and which ones are starting.

146
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:52,944
So I hope that that is helpful for everyone that wants to give us their comments.

147
00:20:54,364 --> 00:21:12,474
So as an introduction, as President Collins already said, we have the, we have been basing our principles on the Medford Comprehensive Plan that was released and was published in January, 2023.

148
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:35,127
I really recommend that people to, if it's interested to read this plan, or at least these strategies that were in, that were created at the end in this product, in this booklet, because we are basing our update in the zoning into those principles.

149
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:41,390
We also based ourselves in the climate action and adaptation plan that was released in April, 2022.

150
00:21:43,631 --> 00:22:02,861
So here in these, this is a plan that is in the comprehensive plan, and here we see all the identified corridors, squares, transitional areas, civic anchors, and then the densities of those residential neighborhoods.

151
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:08,444
So this is really the base that we are working on to create the upzoning.

152
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:17,150
So that is the introduction that I wanted to talk about.

153
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,912
We now are going to go on to the analysis that we have been doing.

154
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:22,753
This is your current zoning.

155
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:29,597
We are looking now at the SF1 and SF2, single family one and single family two districts.

156
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:35,980
You can see them in this map as the yellow, very light yellow and

157
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,701
a bit brighter yellow.

158
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:47,504
So this month we are going to be studying these neighborhoods and giving some proposals.

159
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:56,167
What we are going to bring today, and you will see it on the proposal, is the framework for the residential neighborhood.

160
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:09,874
We also have all the transit in a plan so that we can really see it where the big hubs for bus and for the T or the commuter rail are.

161
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:23,676
And these are all the mixed use districts, the non only residential kind of districts that we have from the comprehensive plan.

162
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:27,337
So if I analyze this a little better, we have,

163
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:32,339
in orange and then in dark orange or brownish color.

164
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:34,019
Those are the corridors.

165
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,181
We already worked on Mystic Avenue.

166
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:42,023
I have it as a bit different because that's a citywide corridor and the others are more regional.

167
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:47,925
We are working on Salem Street and that's one of the other corridors.

168
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:53,008
Then we have the squares that we will look into in March.

169
00:23:53,349 --> 00:24:04,180
We have the institutional, which is the University Tufts area, and then a special district that we will study at the end.

170
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:11,808
So we are looking into residential, so we wanted to know what is there at this moment.

171
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:18,013
So in this plan, we have the different types of residential buildings.

172
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:24,918
So if it's a single family, a two family, three family, four or more than nine units.

173
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,362
And this help us already to see what is the density, not really the density that the

174
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:38,026
current zoning has, but the real density that we have at this moment in the city.

175
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:49,151
And so from here, we already introduced this, this incongruence, incongruency, incongruence, sorry, sorry.

176
00:24:51,852 --> 00:25:05,179
These differences that we can find from the existing and from the current zoning so that when we update it, we reflect the existing so that we can take out some of the nonconformities that we have.

177
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:17,276
So I wanted to introduce one residential typology that you are going to see in our proposal, which is historic conversion.

178
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:18,978
So what is this about?

179
00:25:18,998 --> 00:25:24,123
This is an existing structure that is originally designed for one unit dwelling.

180
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:35,231
and we are going to propose a conversion from this one unit to a two-unit or multi-unit dwelling with no change of the external structure.

181
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:42,297
And so each unit will have an independent entrance directly from the outside or through a common vestibule.

182
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:48,903
What is the goal of this historic conversion kind of typology or type?

183
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:58,485
We want to preserve the cultural heritage of that community and ensure that the changes that are made are keeping the historical character of the area.

184
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:07,448
We want to increase density citywide, but this will help in small increments, and we will enable that smaller and more diverse housing options.

185
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:12,849
Also, it will protect historical buildings as well.

186
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,851
So this is our proposal.

187
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:19,253
Again, this is a first draft.

188
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:28,219
We will explain why the thought process that is behind all this, but we want to hear your comments.

189
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,562
So we have to give you a proposal so that we can comment on it.

190
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:40,367
So we have neighborhood, we identified four different neighborhood residential.

191
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:50,316
So we wanted to give a bit more gradient from the single family that you have now to general and to apartment.

192
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:57,039
We wanted to give a bit more gradient in those definitions, in those districts.

193
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:06,263
So we have neighborhood residential one, neighborhood residential two, three, four, and then urban residential, which has more density.

194
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:09,965
And this we will look at in the next month.

195
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:17,659
So neighborhood residential one, what we have is single unit dwelling and ADU.

196
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,985
So the ADU is something that we will explain also next month, but we can obviously, if you have any question, we can answer this.

197
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,626
This is accessory dwelling unit.

198
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:29,228
There is a new law that is being passed.

199
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:31,569
So we need a bit of more information.

200
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:35,492
That's why we are placing this for next month.

201
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:39,455
But if there is any question about this, please, you can ask.

202
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:47,379
Um, single unit dwelling plus 80 you and then we allow historic conversion to a maximum of two units.

203
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:56,584
In neighborhood residential to we have single unit dwelling plus 80 you two unit dwelling and the historic conversion 2 to 3 units.

204
00:27:57,965 --> 00:28:08,608
Neighborhood residential three, we have single unit dwelling plus ADU, two unit, three unit, townhouse, and historic conversion from two to four units.

205
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:20,451
And neighborhood residential four allows two unit dwelling, historic conversion from two to five, townhouse, multiple unit dwelling from two to four units.

206
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:27,319
And then we have urban residential will be multiple unit dwelling from plus four units.

207
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,948
So where do we locate these areas, these districts?

208
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,672
And just keep in mind, these lines are

209
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:44,875
not, we will present the precise boundaries next time.

210
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:52,658
So this is a bit just to understand the area where we want to increase or maintain the existing density.

211
00:28:53,318 --> 00:29:03,301
So neighborhood residential one, this will only be in North Medford Fulton Heights, and then the very north of West Medford.

212
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:09,688
Why we're doing this is the topography makes it very difficult to allow more parking.

213
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:12,210
So we have some restrictions in there.

214
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:18,097
And then these are areas that do not have a lot of public transit.

215
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:23,123
And so they depend on their own mobility.

216
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:26,465
modes.

217
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:28,967
Where we keep neighborhood residential, too.

218
00:29:29,187 --> 00:29:39,212
So Lawrence States, the north part of Lawrence States and the mid to north part of West Medford, these are neighborhood residential, too.

219
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:46,264
Um, and then the rest of the base of this map is neighborhood residential three.

220
00:29:46,304 --> 00:30:00,649
So we have it in West Medford area, south of Lawrence States, Haynes Square, Glenwood, north of Wellington, um, hillside very in the north, and then between the two T stations, um,

221
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:16,717
Ball Square and Medford Tufts T stations and around that transition between the main street corridor and the T station area.

222
00:30:18,197 --> 00:30:20,378
And then we have neighborhood residential four.

223
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:31,723
Where have we allowed this is in two areas, well, three areas, sorry, exactly where the T stations are, Ball Square and Medford Tubs.

224
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:41,110
So we are increasing density in these areas because of transit being available in here.

225
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:57,402
And then Medford Square, where we have a hub of bus stations, we also allow just a bit on the north of Medford Square, this higher density of neighborhood residential floor.

226
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:04,264
So we can obviously I will come back with this plan and we can discuss it further.

227
00:31:05,818 --> 00:31:10,160
So we also have some dimensional standards proposals.

228
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,301
This is what you have in your current zoning.

229
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:23,425
So in your zoning, how it works, it's not about giving different dimensional standards to each district, but it goes by use.

230
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:26,687
So that is a bit different from other communities.

231
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:29,388
And so it makes it a bit,

232
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:42,872
to uniform without having really representing the district character, but just representing single family or multifamily or detached to family.

233
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:43,992
All are the same.

234
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:47,673
There is no difference or nuance within every district.

235
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,554
So that's something, one of the changes that we make.

236
00:31:51,634 --> 00:32:03,904
What we do is change from one, looking at what is there right now, what your current lot sizes, for example, are, and where we can reduce as much as possible nonconformities.

237
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:17,135
So for example, the minimum lot dimensions, we decreased in neighborhood residential one to 5,000 from 7,000 to 5,000 in this district.

238
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,096
Then neighborhood residential two, 4,000.

239
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:21,478
and then three and four, 3000.

240
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:32,867
Maximum height stories, we keep in neighborhood one and two, the 2.5, two and a half stories, and then neighborhood three and four, we increase to three.

241
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:40,733
Minimum front setbacks are very much maintained only in neighborhood three and four.

242
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:54,309
We reduced to 10 and five and minimum setbacks we maintain, we just reduce in three and four to five minimum reserved bags are the same, all 15 maximum building coverage 40.

243
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:07,833
percent and 50% in neighborhood residential 4 and minimum open space we increase in neighborhood residential 1 and 2.

244
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:17,955
I actually think that you do not have in your current minimum open space for single unit if I'm not mistaken.

245
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:36,145
So one of the things that I wanted to clarify with the accessory dwelling unit is that your accessory dwelling unit, according to the law that we see today, because this is still in progress, so we haven't seen the final, final

246
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:44,816
But what we are seeing and what they have already sent is around or zero parking or one car.

247
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:54,529
And this depends on where it is located, if it's close to a bus line or a transit area.

248
00:33:56,217 --> 00:34:03,779
And then the maximum size for the ADUs are 900 square foot or the 50% of the total area of the principal structure.

249
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,461
And then the single unit dwelling, what you have right now is two per dwelling unit.

250
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:17,002
And then the other residential types can be decreased to 1.5 per dwelling unit.

251
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:25,104
And then, yeah, we want that historic conversion will follow certain design standards and guidelines, and that will be developed.

252
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:40,848
So here is a bit that idea of that decrease of where that changes and differences between all these residential neighborhood districts.

253
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:44,509
And this is it.

254
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:50,351
So I'm going to go to the plan that I'm guessing this is what we will discuss.

255
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:53,552
And if you want any to change or something, let me know.

256
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:56,024
Thank you so much for the presentation, Paola.

257
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:56,965
I really appreciate it.

258
00:34:57,065 --> 00:35:09,207
I think that this gives us a pretty substantive jumping off point for talking about, you know, kind of the why and what next of developing amended zoning rules for these types of neighborhoods.

259
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:13,488
I'm gonna recognize Councilor Scarpelli first, but just to quickly bookend the presentation.

260
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:19,950
I think some of the language that I find, like, really useful about this is thinking about creating a,

261
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:31,862
new, more appropriate gradient from our most single-family, our most classic single-family lots, a lot of which will be kind of maintained exactly as they are.

262
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,983
I think a lot of the zoning that currently exists makes sense.

263
00:35:35,023 --> 00:35:50,668
Maybe the terminology needs to be updated, but a lot of that will remain that way and has to remain that way, but we can affect the gradient from smallest, least dense up to the most dense parts of the city in a way that creates that range of housing that we know that we really need and kind of fill in some of those

264
00:35:51,328 --> 00:35:58,673
gaps where people need types of housing that aren't being built because they either can't be developed under our current zoning or we haven't encouraged it enough.

265
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:00,114
So thank you for that language.

266
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:02,735
I think that that's a really helpful way of thinking about this.

267
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:04,696
Just one really quick clarification.

268
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:13,682
I know you're going to come back to this on the ADU's piece when we're talking about that law being developed that is a state law that communities like Medford will be obligated to factor into their zoning.

269
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:18,025
So I'll first recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then we'll go to President Behrs.

270
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:20,753
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

271
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:24,554
And again, my question was from the beginning of the presentation.

272
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:25,755
But Paul, thank you very much.

273
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:35,637
Um, you could see the hard work in the presentation, and there is a lot of excitement with some of these opportunities.

274
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:48,920
But I think that I'd be remiss to say that, you know, we're seeing some we're seeing the impacts of, um, the lack of communication again to really get the word out to the neighborhoods and

275
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,045
Um, I know that in the last few weeks we've done, we've tried to do the best we can and we're doing more than we can.

276
00:36:56,106 --> 00:37:00,569
But I think we were seeing it now with so many questions.

277
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:07,875
And as we're getting to the end of the Salem Street district and the neighborhoods rallying

278
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:17,080
um, and really not feeling like they've been part of the part of the process or have been given the questions answered.

279
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,122
Um, and there's a lot of fear and a lot of questions going on.

280
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:29,487
So, um, as tonight started, I received a few emails from, um, residents from Lawrence Estates, uh,

281
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:35,014
letting me know that they just found out that there's some sort of a meeting.

282
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:51,986
Uh, and I think we I know that I've shown you the date from when the last council really focused on implementing a more robust process and communications and bringing these meetings to the neighborhoods.

283
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:58,130
And I know it's not it wasn't written in the R. F. P. I know Councilor President bears informed us.

284
00:37:58,851 --> 00:37:59,711
But I think

285
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:18,786
As we move forward, we really need to find a better way, even if it's a reverse 911, letting the neighborhoods know that these meetings are happening, because I know we've had up to almost 20 meetings now discussing this process.

286
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:40,448
I implore all of us to understand that there is groundswell starting in a negative undertone when it doesn't have to be for the fact that even the Salem Street situation, a lot of these, the questions that the fair, a lot of them could be answered in the meeting with the simple sentence or two.

287
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:41,049
And, um,

288
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:47,778
And I think again, uh, if we when we move forward, I see our schedule.

289
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:48,799
The schedule looks great.

290
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:57,287
We're at the beginning phases of of this process, this new process, and I just don't want to be in the same place we are with the Salem Street

291
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:27,158
uh quarter and what we're hearing now and the displeasure and the the anger and the discourse and this divide now and it's it's it's something that I think we need to find a way that this council this uh city administration needs to really we we have so many avenues a communications director we have um we have different avenues that we can tap into I mean it's we really need to find a way if we can to please

292
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:52,715
set the schedule, alert people when we're going to be talking about their neighborhoods so they can be present or at least to be told that we've done A, B and C. I just don't think people have heard us and they truly don't know the impacts that are being created in their neighborhoods until it's time to

293
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:58,653
to the end product, which we're seeing Salem Street getting really close.

294
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:04,774
And, um, and I'm sure everybody there is heard the negative undertone.

295
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:14,276
So again, I hate to be the Debbie Downer every time, um, you come to come to us for for meeting because of all the hard work you've done.

296
00:40:14,856 --> 00:40:18,557
But I just had to share that with you as we move forward with this next process.

297
00:40:18,597 --> 00:40:19,157
So thank you.

298
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:22,058
Thank you, Vice President, for allowing me to speak.

299
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:24,767
Thank you, Councillor.

300
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:26,331
I really do appreciate that feedback.

301
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:32,206
And, you know, I think that there is a lot in there that I think

302
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:33,881
you know, that I agree with.

303
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:50,647
I think, well, since our last meeting wrapped up at midnight last night, a lot of what I've been working on today has been kind of revamping that communications strategy that we can use so that, you know, the next six months of this zoning project are better communicated.

304
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:59,150
I think the highlight for me, and I think this speaks to some of what you're saying, is that the information is out there, the meetings are public, the answers are out there, but they need to be easier to find.

305
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,751
And that's what we're working on.

306
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:07,977
and follow through on the plan that me and President Behrs are drafting as council leadership to make that successful.

307
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:10,300
It'll take the collaboration of the city administration.

308
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:17,009
But I think you're right that, you know, there's so much positive in these proposals and we really want to be able to

309
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:32,960
broadcast and communicate well with the community to answer their questions easily and quickly so that people can know exactly what's going on, be informed, and ideally be as excited as we are about implementing the goals that the community put into the comprehensive plan.

310
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,481
So thank you for that comment.

311
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:35,362
It really- Appreciate it.

312
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:36,462
Thank you.

313
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:38,564
And we're working on it.

314
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:40,005
Thank you.

315
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:43,507
I'll recognize President Behrs next.

316
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:57,072
Thank you, and thank you Chair Collins and Councilor Scarpelli for your comments.

317
00:41:57,152 --> 00:42:00,874
And thank you Paula and Emily and the team for this presentation.

318
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:10,040
I do have a concern about the level of incremental step up that we see here.

319
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,243
And I'm not necessarily saying

320
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:23,933
I'm going to make a motion, and I'm not saying that it has to go exactly by the lines in this proposal as exists now.

321
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:31,457
But I think for neighborhood residential, it really should just be NR1, NR2, and NR3.

322
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:38,040
And perhaps we could consider something like NR4 as an urban residential one and an urban residential two.

323
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:40,501
And I think that would be a more

324
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:57,144
incremental change to allow for more of what we see actually existing in a lot of these places compared to the zoning that was passed in many cases decades after homes were constructed.

325
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:04,627
That limited what could be built beyond what's actually there and created all the nonconformities that we have.

326
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:10,669
So I would recommend, and I'm gonna make a motion and I will email it to the clerk.

327
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:29,537
And I do have a second motion, but I would move to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by one, removing the NR4 district type and considering that as part of the urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district.

328
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:39,809
Classifying all the areas currently on this proposal listed with some adjustments based on the work that you guys are going to do to go down to the parcel level.

329
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:45,654
Currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.

330
00:43:46,555 --> 00:43:50,718
Classify the areas currently in the proposal listed as NR3, as NR2.

331
00:43:54,096 --> 00:44:08,925
and classify all the areas currently listed on the proposal as NR4, as NR3, and to adjust the NR3 type to remove the one unit by right, which I think will meet some of the changes.

332
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:21,613
And then I would also just note that any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2.

333
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:33,878
and that any district where the current zoning is an apartment district should be NR3.

334
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:40,501
Thank you, President Perez.

335
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:43,042
Would you email that motion to myself as well as the clerk?

336
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:45,183
Yes, I'll do that.

337
00:44:45,303 --> 00:44:48,705
And I have a further motion, but I know folks want to discuss that one first.

338
00:44:48,765 --> 00:44:50,086
It's a significant change.

339
00:44:53,688 --> 00:44:54,268
Great, thank you.

340
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:58,292
I'll wait for that to come through.

341
00:44:58,312 --> 00:45:19,664
I might need part of that reread, but that was to remove neighborhood residential four, have that be considered instead as part of the urban residential that we'll be considering in February, those denser districts, and then to downshift neighborhood residential two and three to kind of step the gradient down by one level of density.

342
00:45:21,225 --> 00:45:22,446
Is that an accurate synopsis?

343
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,227
I know I left out a lot of the detail that you mentioned.

344
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,203
I think yes, that's fair.

345
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:33,727
And I'm emailing it now.

346
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,850
Thank you.

347
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:39,534
I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

348
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:42,418
Thanks.

349
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:46,283
First, I'll say that given the garbled nature of the Zoom

350
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:53,878
call and the complicated nature of the request, I definitely need that reread because I did not understand what that was.

351
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:56,920
I had a couple of things.

352
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,502
Number one, I'm really excited about the idea of historic conversions.

353
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:10,407
I think that's wonderful, like not changing the exterior of the building but allowing for it to become maybe, you know, a five-bedroom becomes a two-bedroom and a three-bedroom is such a great idea.

354
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:31,487
And then I wanted to ask a little bit about the NR2 and NR3 areas that used to be single-family, and I'm specifically thinking about, as I look at the map, like Lawrence Estates and those parts of West Medford that were single-family, single-family one.

355
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:37,948
And curious, because you did mention that you're trying to get it to reflect what's currently there,

356
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:57,300
Do you think that in those areas, the two-unit and three-unit allowance under these new zoning neighborhoods, is that reflective or is that going to be a significant change in those two areas, the Lawrence Estates and the West Medford?

357
00:47:10,754 --> 00:47:12,815
Yeah, that is a good question.

358
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:22,060
So from going to single family one to single family two, it's not that big incremental.

359
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:28,443
It's not a big defining change of the structure or super high density.

360
00:47:28,503 --> 00:47:31,565
So we are increasing just that small increment.

361
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:48,988
The current zoning, it shows that in the area of Medford, the West Medford area, we do see some of the single, the two units going further than this general residential that is already there.

362
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:59,750
So we are following a bit that trend that it seems that is expanding more than what is reflecting on the general residential.

363
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:25,866
And there we have a commuter rail station, so we think that it is a place that we could increase just a little bit that density, and especially the sizes of these lots are more than good to have a two-unit dwelling, so it's really possible to

364
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:30,848
to apply a two-unit at least in that area.

365
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:37,689
And then south of Lawrence, so there is a bus line that cross area.

366
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:49,832
The south is quite flat and it's close to the Medford Square and the commuter rail transit areas.

367
00:48:50,412 --> 00:48:54,093
So it seems a good area also to

368
00:48:55,993 --> 00:49:00,234
to increase a bit that density in that south area.

369
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:02,915
The north is a bit more difficult because of topography.

370
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:08,936
So we also keep it in these two, in the inner two, instead of increasing.

371
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:10,257
Yeah.

372
00:49:12,257 --> 00:49:13,838
You saw me moving around, right?

373
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:22,980
So I think, Councillor, you had also asked specifically about Lawrence Estates and sort of the division between the northern and the southern part of that.

374
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:32,548
And this map here that has the current types of residential dwellings I know it's a little hard to see on this screen for people but maybe when they go to the website afterwards I can zoom in.

375
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:39,235
You can see that there have in the southern part of the Lawrence Estates have been quite a few conversions into two family.

376
00:49:39,735 --> 00:49:43,739
there, that's that orange color that's popping out a little bit on that screen.

377
00:49:44,640 --> 00:50:01,055
And so, you know, in seeing that trend that there might not be that much of a difference, I think, too, we can recognize that a lot that has a building on it is probably slower to change than a lot that is vacant.

378
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:03,717
That's something else that as we

379
00:50:04,698 --> 00:50:21,047
As we check with you the sort of the framework idea of this and then zoom further in to understand which areas have vacant lots that might be redevelopable if these dimensional standards change.

380
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:26,251
and which areas the dimensional standards won't make a difference.

381
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:34,959
So I think that's another part of looking at the existing density and where there are already buildings of a certain type.

382
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:41,565
So we pay a lot of attention to this map because it's showing what's actually on the ground as opposed to the current zoning.

383
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:58,196
Does that address your question, Councilor Callahan?

384
00:50:58,216 --> 00:51:02,140
I think you were talking about the difference between SF1 and SF2, NR1 and NR2.

385
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:21,216
Yeah, no, mostly I was kind of, what I was looking at, and thanks for pointing out this particular map, because now I can actually see it for myself and zoom in on it, but like in that Lawrence Estates especially, it really does look like it's currently mostly single family, and we are, you know, upping it by one and two,

386
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:27,080
potentially like, you know, one and two levels more.

387
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:34,624
So, just, I just wanted to know how much change was suggested.

388
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:42,368
I had a question that is perhaps a silly one, but I was curious when I look at the, the

389
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:47,378
sort of diagram, the very last page that has the two and a half stories and the three stories.

390
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:56,030
And I know that I see that architecture all over the place and like the two and a half story looks, you know, a certain way and the three story looks very like blocky and cut off.

391
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:09,054
how much does that half story matter to not blocking people's view, or not blocking people's sunlight, or not blocking other things?

392
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:20,103
Because as an architectural piece, and for the amount of extra space people get in their homes, I don't know, to me seems like that might be nicer, actually.

393
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:26,268
But I'm just, I'm totally not an architecture person, so I'm just curious, more than anything, not making a suggestion.

394
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:34,190
Sorry.

395
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,334
It's all right.

396
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:40,919
I keep forgetting that green means stop and red means go.

397
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:42,701
I keep forgetting that's just not constantly on.

398
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:43,802
Exactly.

399
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:46,886
So it's a good question.

400
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:50,030
We were actually talking right before the meeting that for the

401
00:52:52,553 --> 00:52:56,594
the three and the four that we actually wanted to show two buildings.

402
00:52:56,614 --> 00:53:00,375
We had gone with the two of the same size next to each other.

403
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:04,436
But in fact, what we'd like to do is show that you could have a flat roof or you can have a pitched roof.

404
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:21,159
I think the interesting thing with height is that when you start to think about stories rather than feet is that the building code and often, and I don't remember what it is in Medford off the top of my head, the zoning definitions have a definition of story height.

405
00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:37,782
And so if you limit it to two and a half, say, and somebody wants to put on a full dormer to bump it out, that might, by the amount of livable space, that might take you up into a three-story.

406
00:53:37,802 --> 00:53:45,304
So I think it's important to understand that a three-story or a four-story limit does not mean necessarily that you're going to have a flat roof.

407
00:53:45,864 --> 00:53:49,386
And so we're going to change our diagramming before the next meeting to just call that out.

408
00:53:49,446 --> 00:53:51,147
And we'll double check the height definitions.

409
00:53:51,587 --> 00:53:53,628
As I said, we were talking about it right before the meeting.

410
00:53:54,508 --> 00:54:13,137
I think your idea, too, of how much of a difference does it make on the street, one of the things that I've noticed with a lot of our historic buildings in New England is that you can have, and it's funny when you read the assessor's records, because I recognize this, you might get a 2H or a 2T or a 3T and are

411
00:54:15,498 --> 00:54:21,243
floor heights and our building heights are actually taller maybe than what's been built now.

412
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:33,915
If you look at a beautiful historic home, I for example lived in a house that probably violated the 35 foot requirement in the community that I was living in, but it was built before zoning was put into place.

413
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:39,260
And so that's something else we want to recognize in the portion of our thinking where we're

414
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:49,030
reducing the number of non-conformities is, again, being aware of how old the buildings are, what they are, not putting an undue restriction on them.

415
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:55,176
Having said that, we talked about the idea of design guidelines for historic conversions.

416
00:54:55,236 --> 00:54:58,379
We could certainly think in the development standards part of this,

417
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:10,727
How do we set up an expectation that people will be considering the context for a new building as opposed to a rehab and considering their relationship to their neighbors?

418
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:20,673
And that's something that we can talk further as we go through these two months about thinking about residential buildings in Medford and the rules and requirements around them.

419
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:27,237
Does a half story, does a two and a half or three and a half limit encourage pitched roofs?

420
00:55:31,207 --> 00:55:33,268
Not necessarily, there are other ways around it.

421
00:55:33,388 --> 00:55:50,071
I mean, I think you could say, okay, this is a two and a half story building, but then there's a perhaps out of proportion full shed dormer put on it, makes it really more like a three, but it's not necessarily architecturally well done sometimes.

422
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:55,912
And so that's why I'm saying we need to collectively think about the components of these houses.

423
00:55:56,772 --> 00:56:03,555
potentially as well as the houses themselves because it's not just the building massing that might affect views or light.

424
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:08,717
It's the position of the building on the lot, you know, how far is it set back relative to next door.

425
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:14,600
What is the solar orientation there's a there's a bunch of things that can come into that and I think one question.

426
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:28,073
for the city council and the community to consider is how much regulation do they want to put on single family dwellings, understanding that we're looking at a way of making housing easier to do.

427
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:34,420
And I think that's a question that we can also continue to explore with you over this period.

428
00:56:38,156 --> 00:56:38,276
Great.

429
00:56:38,797 --> 00:56:39,317
Thank you so much.

430
00:56:40,258 --> 00:56:42,259
I see a couple hands up.

431
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:44,601
We will take all public participation at the end of the meeting.

432
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:45,682
Thank you so much for being here.

433
00:56:45,842 --> 00:56:46,822
I'll go next to President Behrs.

434
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:51,666
Thank you, Madam Chair.

435
00:56:52,066 --> 00:57:05,396
I just wanted to make my other motion, which is to request that the chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.

436
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:08,618
and I've sent the language for both of these over.

437
00:57:09,378 --> 00:57:18,360
I have to step out in a few minutes, five minutes, but I'm happy to answer any questions on my motion now and potentially consider them if possible.

438
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,220
But if not, I hope my colleagues will consider them and approve them.

439
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:24,101
Great.

440
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:25,081
Thank you, President Beers.

441
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:32,123
So I'll reread both motions.

442
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:46,091
The one that was just made was motion by President Behrs to request that the chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.

443
00:57:48,353 --> 00:57:49,915
And the, do I hear a motion?

444
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:50,695
Sorry, a second?

445
00:57:51,596 --> 00:57:52,557
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

446
00:57:54,585 --> 00:58:11,528
And the first motion given towards the beginning of the meeting was the motion to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by removing the NR4 district type and consider that as part of urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district.

447
00:58:13,105 --> 00:58:18,490
Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as just NR1.

448
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,712
So that's a downshift from NR2.

449
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:25,897
Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR3 as NR2.

450
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:31,301
Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR4 as NR3.

451
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:37,327
Adjust the NR3 district type to remove the one unit dwelling by right.

452
00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:43,773
And any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2.

453
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:47,776
And any parcels, sorry, the last bit of this got cut off.

454
00:58:53,922 --> 00:58:54,202
Sorry.

455
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:10,721
And any, sorry, that last clause is any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2, and any parcels where the district, current district is apartment one or apartment two should be at least NR3.

456
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:23,806
Does anybody need that read back again, put on the screen, or do I hear a second on the motion?

457
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:25,747
Councilor Lemming?

458
00:59:26,287 --> 00:59:26,707
Oh, sorry.

459
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:29,940
Thank you.

460
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:34,364
Just for some, Council President Behrs, just for some clarification.

461
00:59:34,444 --> 00:59:43,010
So you mentioned, I believe part of that motion was, for instance, making all NR2 into NR1.

462
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:58,862
Just to clarify, is that a, I mean, would that mean that all of the current NR1s get updated to include two-unit dwellings and historical conversion of two to three units, or would that mean that all

463
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:07,434
And our twos get that requirement for two-unit dwellings removed.

464
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:10,215
It would be the second one.

465
01:00:10,255 --> 01:00:12,615
It's essentially downstepping each of the shades.

466
01:00:13,056 --> 01:00:25,618
So the very light yellow would stay the same, the medium yellow would go down to the light yellow, the lighter orange would go down to the medium yellow, and the dark orange would go down to the lighter orange.

467
01:00:37,731 --> 01:00:40,177
Well, I'm sorry.

468
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:41,360
Sorry.

469
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:43,725
You want to finish your thought.

470
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:49,729
What mic number are you?

471
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:50,209
You're six.

472
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:51,470
Sorry, guys.

473
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:53,011
Go for it.

474
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:53,351
Thanks.

475
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:59,213
So what I heard Zach say is the opposite of what I wrote down that you read.

476
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:10,397
So my understanding is that now the lightest yellow and the northern parts of Lawrence Estates and the middle part of West Medford would all include two-unit dwellings.

477
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:12,418
That's what I heard, Zach.

478
01:01:12,558 --> 01:01:15,259
That's what I heard in the rereading of the

479
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:35,856
thing and I am concerned because I think that's I'm not really comfortable if that's what we're doing is making every like two unit everywhere like that's I believe president bears please step in and correct me I think it's the opposite I think it's that yeah I'm saying the opposite I'm saying that this is an increment too far and each shade should go down one increment

480
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:43,518
That is, I feel much more comfortable about that, but I'm a little concerned about the wording, because to me, the wording said the other.

481
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:50,480
Okay, so the current wording, classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.

482
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,601
So NR1 stay the same, NR2s become NR1, is how I read that.

483
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:02,002
Yes, that's the intent.

484
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:05,535
Thank you.

485
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,358
I'm much more comfortable with that.

486
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:08,059
Okay, great.

487
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,020
Thank you for the clarification.

488
01:02:14,408 --> 01:02:14,908
Go ahead, Emily.

489
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:15,850
Thank you.

490
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:20,056
I just want to repeat something that Paola said at the beginning and just

491
01:02:22,068 --> 01:02:24,029
just to give the council some information.

492
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,992
So she had said that the boundaries.

493
01:02:27,972 --> 01:02:40,962
These are very high level boundaries and so we do an understanding the direction that President bears has suggested, we have no objection at this point but we just want you to know that we need to go in and

494
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:59,211
just check the boundaries and make sure that with this change that they still make sense as shown or you know do they wiggle need to wiggle around a little bit more uh I think as I'm saying it's a high level so just to make sure that the councillors are aware of the kind of the scale that we're looking at in this particular image.

495
01:02:59,932 --> 01:03:08,656
Great thank you that makes sense that the uh the boundaries between the proposed districts would have to change in any case and especially if we're contemplating this downshift for the proposal that we'll see in two weeks.

496
01:03:09,737 --> 01:03:09,877
Great.

497
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:14,942
Councilor Leving, I'll recognize you.

498
01:03:16,483 --> 01:03:20,485
I don't know if I could support President Bear's motion.

499
01:03:20,525 --> 01:03:31,570
I mean, I think you do need additional density, particularly around the T-stops.

500
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:38,833
I mean, I personally don't see the need to sort of increase the

501
01:03:40,352 --> 01:03:47,439
the amounts of single unit dwellings quite that much.

502
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,584
So yeah, I personally like it as it is.

503
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,711
Go to Councilor Cullen.

504
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:00,958
We've got a lively debate.

505
01:04:00,998 --> 01:04:01,678
This is exciting.

506
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:05,181
So I am in favor of sex change.

507
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:06,822
And I'll just let you know why.

508
01:04:08,102 --> 01:04:21,511
I think, like, I'm really encouraged by the fact that we are allowing for historic conversions and ADUs by right throughout what is currently considered single family.

509
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:28,796
To me, that is enough change in those areas that I do not feel like we need to move further than that.

510
01:04:28,876 --> 01:04:29,297
And I think

511
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:49,706
we will get pushback from the community is my concern that, you know, that's a little bit like those areas of Lawrence Estates and West Medford that already that is, I think, excellent and just the right amount of change that we're going to allow that doesn't really change a character of the community.

512
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:54,428
I think once we're allowing two units, that for me, that

513
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:08,886
belongs more in the areas that were on this new map considered neighborhood residential three.

514
01:05:11,127 --> 01:05:16,351
And that also will be a change for much of those places, but I'm comfortable with that level of change.

515
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:21,934
So I feel quite good and I think better than the current

516
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:32,090
Um, suggestion, given that I do understand that because of some of the existing, you know, housing that is there because you guys plotted this very carefully that like the.

517
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,351
The boundaries are going to adjust a little bit.

518
01:05:34,911 --> 01:05:49,479
Um, but to me, this feels more comfortable and it also does mean because of the 80 years and the historic conversions by right that we are allowing more haze housing throughout the city, but just in a way that I think feels more comfortable to the residents of the single family, current single family one areas.

519
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:51,139
Thank you.

520
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:51,840
Councilor Callahan.

521
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:52,160
Yeah.

522
01:05:53,476 --> 01:05:55,517
As one councilor, I think that you put that well.

523
01:05:56,057 --> 01:06:05,759
I think that historic conversion and being able to implement the statewide ADU law will be meaningful.

524
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:07,039
We could go further.

525
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:12,741
We will go further in other areas of the city where I personally think that it makes more sense topographically, geographically.

526
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:17,082
Is that a second to the motion by President Behrs?

527
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:17,742
Great, thank you.

528
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:21,363
So the motion by President Behrs is seconded by Councilor Callahan.

529
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:26,566
Is there a, sorry, was that a hand?

530
01:06:27,386 --> 01:06:28,486
No, okay, I was imagining things.

531
01:06:29,506 --> 01:06:35,228
Is there any further discussion on, President Behrs had to depart, we can vote on these motions anytime.

532
01:06:38,569 --> 01:06:51,373
Any further comment by counselors on the presentation, questions, concerns, potential amendments we'd like to see in the updated draft that we'll consider for January 29th and just in my

533
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:53,118
mental note-taking.

534
01:06:53,178 --> 01:07:01,622
I know that in addition to the changes that we'll vote on, we can also expect to see more finessed boundaries between the various sub-districts.

535
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:21,230
And I'm also looking forward to the diagrams, the residential requirements, including not just one type of what can be built in each district, but more varied buildings that folks can envision them in context of what these neighborhoods might actually look like with the possible buildings, or perhaps already look like.

536
01:07:38,444 --> 01:07:39,985
Seeing no further hands from councillors.

537
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:44,770
We have a second on both those motions from President Behrs.

538
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:46,291
So I'll take them in order.

539
01:07:46,311 --> 01:07:48,733
And I will.

540
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:54,827
read this one more time just so we can hear it and to give people time to think of potentially more motions.

541
01:07:55,587 --> 01:08:13,639
This is a motion by President Bex, seconded by Councilor Callahan to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by removing the NR4 district type and consider that as part of urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district, classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.

542
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:30,473
classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR3 as NR2, classifying all areas currently listed on the proposal as NR4 as NR3, adjust the NR3 district type to remove the one unit dwelling by right.

543
01:08:31,534 --> 01:08:39,722
Any parcel where the current district is GR should be at least NR2 and any parcels where the current district is apartment one or apartment two should be at least NR3.

544
01:08:44,062 --> 01:08:49,904
So on the motion by President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Councilor Scarpelli and President Behrs both had to drop off so we can do a voice vote.

545
01:08:50,664 --> 01:08:51,244
All in favor?

546
01:08:51,724 --> 01:08:51,844
Aye.

547
01:08:52,405 --> 01:08:52,925
All opposed?

548
01:08:54,225 --> 01:08:55,125
Two in favor, one opposed.

549
01:08:55,145 --> 01:08:55,766
The motion passes.

550
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:04,048
Three out of five is a quorum, isn't it?

551
01:09:04,548 --> 01:09:06,789
But it's two in favor and one opposed out of three.

552
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:11,530
No, but the quorum is... It's a majority of the quorum.

553
01:09:25,407 --> 01:09:36,170
On the motion by President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Lemming, to request that the Chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.

554
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:37,790
All those in favor?

555
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:38,351
Aye.

556
01:09:38,851 --> 01:09:39,391
All opposed?

557
01:09:40,351 --> 01:09:40,891
Motion passes.

558
01:09:46,273 --> 01:09:48,573
Any further comments or questions from Councilors at this time?

559
01:09:48,593 --> 01:09:51,314
Okay.

560
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:54,652
We will go to public participation.

561
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:56,714
Seeing nobody at the podium, I will go first to Zoom.

562
01:09:57,394 --> 01:09:58,895
I'm going to request that you unmute.

563
01:09:58,935 --> 01:10:03,199
Please state your name and address for the record, and you will have three minutes.

564
01:10:07,622 --> 01:10:08,103
Good evening.

565
01:10:08,443 --> 01:10:09,604
My name is Maureen Wing.

566
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:15,568
I live on 36 Dudley Street in Medford, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak and everything that's been reviewed tonight.

567
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:16,569
I really appreciate it.

568
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,871
I'm going to apologize up front.

569
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:20,352
I was unable to make

570
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:26,116
The December meeting due to a previous commitment, so I know that I'm behind the eight ball here and trying to catch up.

571
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:28,618
I just would like to.

572
01:10:30,525 --> 01:10:56,653
mention again what a brief description of what uh councilor scarpelli said in that uh some of the friends and neighbors that i've been speaking with in the route 60 salem street area are just a little bit nervous about all of this and i really appreciate that you're considering other types of outreach or increasing the outreach to get us more informed and involved and i really appreciate that

573
01:10:57,298 --> 01:11:08,988
Um, some of the things I know that people have talked about are what, um, and I think you've addressed some of that, but again, height of buildings, they're concerned about traffic impact on route 60 route 60.

574
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:13,151
Um, and there's nervousness about a butters to Salem street.

575
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:16,234
So I just wanted to mention that, um, going down the road.

576
01:11:16,594 --> 01:11:21,318
So you'd be aware of what I'm hearing from, uh, neighbors and residents that live near me.

577
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,121
Thank you so much for attending tonight and for sharing that feedback.

578
01:11:29,181 --> 01:11:31,842
It really is duly noted and really appreciated.

579
01:11:33,283 --> 01:11:51,351
We want to make sure that we're improving at letting the residents know about what their opportunities are to get informed about these proposals, including Salem Street, especially for abutters and neighbors so that folks can, you know, be at the meetings and be in the spaces where they can ask questions, get their questions answered.

580
01:11:52,072 --> 01:11:53,152
So thank you for raising that.

581
01:11:53,192 --> 01:11:54,313
I know that the current proposal

582
01:11:56,018 --> 01:11:56,438
the proposal.

583
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:57,479
Developed by Ennis has they were.

584
01:11:57,499 --> 01:12:04,344
I know that these folks were really careful about factoring in, you know, neighborhood compatibility and being thoughtful about if we're increasing height.

585
01:12:04,984 --> 01:12:09,827
By how much under what conditions we're not going to be going into that proposal in depth tonight.

586
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:12,189
However, I hope you're already aware a week from today.

587
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,110
January 22nd.

588
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:18,753
The CD board will be discussing the Salem Street proposal for the first time.

589
01:12:24,177 --> 01:12:29,360
I'm sure it will be a really helpful overview with an opportunity for questions and answers as well.

590
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:35,244
So thank you so much, and please continue to attend, even on the meetings that aren't specifically germane to your residence area.

591
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:35,885
Thanks for being here.

592
01:12:38,206 --> 01:12:39,107
Next, we'll go to the podium.

593
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,888
Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

594
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:51,735
Oh, sorry.

595
01:12:51,775 --> 01:12:52,055
That's me.

596
01:12:53,997 --> 01:12:54,377
Thank you.

597
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:54,837
Thank you.

598
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:56,698
Thank you, Madam Chair.

599
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:58,198
Gaston Ferrer, 61, Stingley Road.

600
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:09,282
I took a few notes during the presentation that I want to address, and I would like to thank President Behrs and everyone that voted yes on the changes, because they address most of my concerns.

601
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,403
So I live in the north of Lawrence estate.

602
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:37,284
and there there's a lack of public transportation so you either have to drive or bike and it just makes gives me some doubts that so NR1 which was north-mid for Fulton Heights is actually closer to the subway than the north of Lawrence Estate so it makes me wonder how come you know

603
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:40,672
Fulton Heights was in R1 and we were in R2.

604
01:13:41,012 --> 01:13:42,874
To me, that's a little bit concerning.

605
01:13:43,615 --> 01:13:50,340
Because again, when I take the T and I don't bike, I have to walk all the way through Fulton Heights up to Malden.

606
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:55,845
And then on West Medford, we actually have the commuter rail, which is not as efficient as the Orange Line.

607
01:13:56,945 --> 01:14:00,408
So to me, that didn't make too much sense.

608
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,352
But thanks again to President Bezos and everyone that got addressed.

609
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:18,380
So I just think that Councilor Callahan also mentioned, if you look at the map, or if you walk around the neighborhood for us, all of us that live there, there's just not two-unit housing there.

610
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:28,146
And not only in the north of Lawrence Estates, but then if you cross to the south of Lawrence Road, where Summit Avenue is and all of that, there's not even a single two-unit house.

611
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:30,808
So that would be like a huge change from what we have right now.

612
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:33,046
Other points.

613
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:37,291
So the north of Lawrence Estates is also locked in by the false reservation.

614
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:39,694
There's a lot of dead end roads, cul-de-sacs and things like that.

615
01:14:39,754 --> 01:14:42,457
So also, you know, having density there doesn't make much sense to me.

616
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:46,640
There's a lot of private ways.

617
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:47,700
I live in a private way.

618
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:54,484
And as you might know, the city does not do repairs of those roads.

619
01:14:54,564 --> 01:14:55,785
I'm going through that process myself.

620
01:14:56,365 --> 01:15:00,647
We have an area of our private way that is in pretty bad shape.

621
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:06,011
I've been in conversation with engineering and DPW, and then they actually just patch it, but they would not repave it.

622
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:06,531
We have to

623
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:08,172
ourselves.

624
01:15:08,752 --> 01:15:18,076
So if, for example, we started having two-unit houses over there, it's more neighbors that will have to become in agreement whenever we have to pay to maintain our private way.

625
01:15:18,656 --> 01:15:23,539
I'm already going through the pain that not everyone wants to participate in chipping in.

626
01:15:23,739 --> 01:15:26,060
So it will make everything a lot harder.

627
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:37,490
So and I will be interested in considering private waste at a future meeting as well because I talk to people that live in them as well and then all of us voice concerns.

628
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:51,964
And the last point that I wanted to say is that so all this kind of I believe and maybe Councillor Llewellyn can correct me on this but units are less than, dwellings are less than six units actually will not pay a linkage fee.

629
01:15:52,584 --> 01:15:56,545
So if we're increasing density, what's going to happen to our existing infrastructure?

630
01:15:56,605 --> 01:16:04,208
And then where is the funding to sort of either upgrade it or make sure that it holds up if there's more density?

631
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:05,388
How is that going to work?

632
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:12,070
Because again, I think the linkage fee is only paid for joints that are more than six units or greater than or equal to, I don't remember.

633
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,672
But these ones that we have been discussing today don't apply.

634
01:16:18,966 --> 01:16:23,030
I think that's it, and I would like to thank everyone for the very interesting discussion that we're getting to speak up.

635
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,711
Thank you so much.

636
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:24,191
Great.

637
01:16:24,852 --> 01:16:27,074
Thank you for the thoughtful comments as always, Gaston.

638
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:36,944
Just to quickly respond to a couple of those, and I know, sorry, we're not supposed to go back and forth, but just since you brought it up, on the linkage piece, I think it's a really reasonable question.

639
01:16:36,964 --> 01:16:41,889
I think that when we look at the zoning overhaul in totality,

640
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:53,984
That issue becomes less because in some areas, like the proposed NR1 districts, we're not encouraging developments that would be large enough to kick in the linkage fees.

641
01:16:54,584 --> 01:17:05,211
In other areas, for example, the places that are really close to the very, very high transit stations, we might be encouraging developments that would kick into the linkage fees.

642
01:17:05,231 --> 01:17:06,692
So I think it would have an equalizing effect.

643
01:17:07,112 --> 01:17:11,555
Maybe not when we're just considering the neighborhood residential as a single project, but citywide,

644
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:25,756
I know Councilor Lemming in particular has been making sure that we're updating our linkage fees so that when we do create new zoning, especially along places like Mystic Ave, where we're encouraging big new developments, that they're gonna be paying their fair share and that their fair share is calculated correctly.

645
01:17:25,796 --> 01:17:27,377
So thank you for bringing up that point.

646
01:17:28,117 --> 01:17:30,999
And then the other thing I was going to say was not important.

647
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,620
Thank you as always for your thoughtful commentary.

648
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:36,763
Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate it.

649
01:17:36,783 --> 01:17:37,884
Name and address for the record, please.

650
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:38,705
You have three minutes.

651
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:42,970
Sharon Diesso, Mass Avenue and Circuit Road Corner.

652
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:43,950
Thank you.

653
01:17:45,751 --> 01:17:52,373
I'm just wondering, I came in a little late and I didn't hear the announcement of who this group is here.

654
01:17:52,393 --> 01:17:59,556
Okay, I've seen the name before on different agendas coming into the city.

655
01:18:00,336 --> 01:18:02,697
So let me just get a retrospect here.

656
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,678
I see the word density, density, density.

657
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:07,619
What's the goal?

658
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:09,510
What's the goal here?

659
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:12,852
I mean, why promoting density?

660
01:18:12,872 --> 01:18:17,494
It has to do with helping out taxes and tax rate and whatnot.

661
01:18:18,455 --> 01:18:20,316
What's the goal?

662
01:18:22,817 --> 01:18:27,840
I'm happy to let you finish your three minutes, and then I can respond after if you have more that you want to put on the record.

663
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,541
I'm sorry?

664
01:18:29,781 --> 01:18:33,643
If you have further questions behind that, I'm happy to just give you your full time, and then I can respond afterwards.

665
01:18:35,023 --> 01:18:35,764
No, I'm wondering.

666
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:41,695
this planning board in the zoning changes that are being proposed.

667
01:18:41,775 --> 01:18:43,196
Let me just give you an example.

668
01:18:44,998 --> 01:18:52,306
It has been a study, for instance, in the Lawrence Estates of how many lots are 7,000 feet or more.

669
01:18:53,367 --> 01:18:53,768
Do you know?

670
01:18:54,532 --> 01:18:57,255
How many homeowners have 7,000 feet or more?

671
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:04,944
So why would you go into an area like that and propose changes even if someone sold their home?

672
01:19:05,565 --> 01:19:12,453
You still can't, there's not enough land because there's only 7,000, it wouldn't equal 10 unless I'm really doing

673
01:19:13,013 --> 01:19:13,994
you know, bad math.

674
01:19:14,774 --> 01:19:22,698
I'm wondering why you are not going to places like even the state to see if they even have land that they would be willing to sell.

675
01:19:23,178 --> 01:19:32,183
Why are you destroying the look and the ambience and the reason why some people come to those areas, they come to Medford.

676
01:19:32,703 --> 01:19:35,144
I've seen beautiful homes on 6,500 square foot lots

677
01:19:36,685 --> 01:19:37,646
They've brought children.

678
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:41,549
It's such a nice vitality to see them walk into the school buses.

679
01:19:41,929 --> 01:19:45,352
They have beautiful play areas built in their backyards.

680
01:19:45,472 --> 01:19:47,353
Many, many people have put in pools.

681
01:19:48,394 --> 01:19:56,220
I don't understand why you're going into residential areas that have practically no land to offer in the first place.

682
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,344
And from what I'm understanding this week, it's not going to happen because the residents

683
01:20:02,985 --> 01:20:04,346
make sure that it doesn't happen.

684
01:20:04,806 --> 01:20:14,331
It shouldn't happen in TNT area because there are better ways to raise taxes in cities besides destroying areas.

685
01:20:14,651 --> 01:20:19,593
And when you leave this council, I hope you don't go on to another town and that's your plan somewhere else.

686
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:20,374
Thank you.

687
01:20:20,394 --> 01:20:24,356
Thank you for your comments.

688
01:20:25,967 --> 01:20:46,634
I'll just quickly note that all of the goals that are guiding the zoning overhaul come out of the Community Informed Housing Production Plan, Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, and Medford Comprehensive Plan, and are guided by our knowledge that Medford is a beautiful place that a lot of people live and a lot of people want to move into, and people who live here are struggling to stay here.

689
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:53,916
People who want to live here, people who grew up here and want to buy a home, people who want to stay here are struggling to find housing to do so, and I think those are

690
01:20:54,378 --> 01:20:58,625
Those guide the goals around thoughtfully adding densification where it makes sense in each neighborhood.

691
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,108
Excuse me, I just have one more question.

692
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:06,697
Suppose there were an area where there was land dividable and whatnot.

693
01:21:08,771 --> 01:21:14,897
If you had, even just as an example, Fairfax, you had twice as many homes, the property value would come down.

694
01:21:15,558 --> 01:21:20,843
So how are you gaining a tax hike anyway?

695
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:25,607
Because the value of the home would be only two-thirds of what it originally was.

696
01:21:26,488 --> 01:21:32,790
So I'm just saying, along with my family, I maintain all the flowers.

697
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:35,090
I hope you enjoy them at next to Colleen's.

698
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:40,732
That whole island was dedicated to my family by Michael Knox about four years ago.

699
01:21:41,192 --> 01:21:44,293
So I hope you enjoy the decorations and all the flowers I put in.

700
01:21:45,253 --> 01:21:58,721
It was mainly recognized to go to my father and my family because my dad was one of the longest living residents who never moved after he bought his home years ago, so I inherited the second property.

701
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:02,043
But that's why people come and why people stay.

702
01:22:02,123 --> 01:22:04,845
People used to come and admire our pine trees, the lots.

703
01:22:05,585 --> 01:22:12,107
Now, some of my yard parties are popular because of the size of my yard and the way that we maintain the beautiful trees.

704
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:19,668
So, there are different areas, not that anyone should be overly affected more than another area, for instance, Salem Street.

705
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:29,431
So, I'm really asking, I know a lot of you, and I don't mean this as a criticism, are not big business entrepreneurs, and you haven't been on city planning boards before, etc.

706
01:22:30,411 --> 01:22:39,899
go to areas where you know you can actually generate appreciated revenue coming into the city that does not disturb residents.

707
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:48,966
If they want to move to Medford, I'd love to move to Winchester, but I'm not going to go every week and tell them to start changing all this owning ordinance so I can afford a home.

708
01:22:49,527 --> 01:22:52,389
So I think you need to do more math than this.

709
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:53,931
And thank you.

710
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:56,693
And a merry and healthy new year to everyone.

711
01:22:58,179 --> 01:22:59,220
Thank you so much for your comments.

712
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:11,169
And I will just note that the goals of the housing production parts of the zoning overhaul, I believe, are motivated by the community's desire to build more housing, not as a revenue strategy.

713
01:23:14,731 --> 01:23:19,055
Seeing no further hands on Zoom, are there any further comments or motions from Councillors?

714
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,381
Councillor Lemming.

715
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:31,400
Gaston, do you have an additional comment?

716
01:23:31,621 --> 01:23:33,482
Yeah, I have a question.

717
01:23:33,502 --> 01:23:33,703
Great.

718
01:23:33,723 --> 01:23:34,904
I'm very sorry, I apologize.

719
01:23:35,024 --> 01:23:37,006
I have a question about, this is the, what number is this? 17.

720
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:52,099
So NR1, it says minimum load dimensions, 5,000 square feet.

721
01:23:52,879 --> 01:23:55,401
So could you explain to me, so how does that work?

722
01:23:55,421 --> 01:24:02,065
Because I know that in our area, there are several loads that are larger than 5,000 square feet.

723
01:24:02,085 --> 01:24:03,446
So what does this mean?

724
01:24:05,027 --> 01:24:06,007
That you can subdivide it?

725
01:24:06,268 --> 01:24:11,351
Like, for example, we have a 10,000 square foot load, then would it be able to be subdivided into two 5,000 square feet?

726
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:22,907
That's what it is.

727
01:24:59,938 --> 01:25:00,399
I'm sorry.

728
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,080
Would you guys just speak into the microphone?

729
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:02,980
That's okay.

730
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:16,107
In addition to that, that it needs to meet all the requirements, not only the dimensions, is that we analyze the existing lot sizes in all the SF1s and SF2s.

731
01:25:17,468 --> 01:25:19,489
And a lot of them are non-conforming.

732
01:25:20,069 --> 01:25:22,089
A lot of them are below the 7,000.

733
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:24,550
So they are non-conforming.

734
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:27,130
So we wanted to reduce those conformities.

735
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:32,432
And so 5,000 met a lot of those dimension.

736
01:25:34,072 --> 01:25:35,413
The last related question.

737
01:25:35,773 --> 01:25:41,694
So NR2, I see in the table that it's actually the minimum dot dimension is smaller than NR1.

738
01:25:45,656 --> 01:25:55,005
And then, given that NR2 got converted into NR1, are you planning on keeping the minimum load dimension for the new NR1 as 4,000 or 5,000?

739
01:25:55,286 --> 01:25:56,347
And what's the rationale?

740
01:25:56,827 --> 01:26:00,711
Why was NR2 smaller than NR1, the minimum load dimension?

741
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:12,220
So what we're doing here is the requirements of the space around those areas as well.

742
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,602
Not only the built, but also the open space around it.

743
01:26:16,063 --> 01:26:27,031
So usually we are making a transition from the inner one to inner four so that the density of what you see on the face in the street.

744
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:29,333
So the setbacks are reduced.

745
01:26:29,973 --> 01:26:32,714
So you can build, you have a larger build coverage.

746
01:26:33,114 --> 01:26:34,795
And so you can build more house.

747
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:39,636
So you need a less, a smaller lot size to build more.

748
01:26:40,096 --> 01:26:46,919
That's the, so you will see, for example, the open space, it goes from 40% to 20%.

749
01:26:46,959 --> 01:26:51,500
And that's how much you can build that space.

750
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,802
And so your house actually is bigger or the same.

751
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:59,283
It's just that the lot and the surroundings are getting narrower.

752
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:01,324
So you see that transition.

753
01:27:03,405 --> 01:27:03,685
Great.

754
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:04,946
Thank you, Paola.

755
01:27:05,506 --> 01:27:06,747
Thank you for your questions and comments.

756
01:27:09,648 --> 01:27:09,908
All right.

757
01:27:10,128 --> 01:27:18,413
Seeing no further questions or motions from counselors, I want to, again, thank Innis Associates so much for being here with us.

758
01:27:18,973 --> 01:27:22,295
Time and time again, you've done so much hard work for us over the course of the past year.

759
01:27:24,136 --> 01:27:25,056
Emily's gesturing at Paola.

760
01:27:25,997 --> 01:27:26,597
Team effort, I know.

761
01:27:29,242 --> 01:27:41,886
really shaping the goals that the community has put into our guiding documents into zoning that we can consider, discuss, deliberate, amend, and talk about in public as much as we need to and vote on.

762
01:27:42,627 --> 01:27:43,187
So thank you so much.

763
01:27:43,827 --> 01:27:48,609
We will be meeting on this topic again in two weeks with an updated proposal for councilors to review.

764
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:51,570
So I look forward to that.

765
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:53,830
Do I hear a motion to adjourn?

766
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:58,692
I have a motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

767
01:27:59,634 --> 01:28:00,077
All in favor?

768
01:28:01,085 --> 01:28:01,568
All opposed?

769
01:28:02,253 --> 01:28:03,462
Motion passes, meeting adjourned.

770
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:04,066
Thank you.
