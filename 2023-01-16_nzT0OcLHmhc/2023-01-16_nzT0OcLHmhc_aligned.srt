1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:01,692
Thank you so much.

2
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:02,932
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:29,705
Good morning.

4
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,531
Welcome.

5
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,271
Good morning.

6
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,247
I have a, like, century.

7
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,409
I don't even have it, but I'm sticking with it.

8
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:18,790
So, I get to know everything.

9
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,477
Because I've always tried, like, I have always tried to, like, so that this year, I'm sure that it's going to be a big success.

10
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:28,339
I think it's going to be a big success.

11
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,161
So, I think it's going to be a big success.

12
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:33,283
So, I think it's going to be a big success.

13
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:36,046
So, I think it's going to be a big success.

14
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,347
We'll likely get them seated in the back.

15
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:04,362
and I don't even know if that's true.

16
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,443
So like that's what makes it hard.

17
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:05,863
It's memory.

18
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:06,965
It's not actually what it's after.

19
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:07,545
It's not a chair.

20
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:08,166
It's not a chair.

21
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:08,947
It's not a chair.

22
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,142
So they don't know how it works.

23
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,044
And meanwhile, I can already do that.

24
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:28,145
I'll scan their home.

25
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:30,407
So for example, let's say I'm in London.

26
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:35,231
I don't know if I'm going to be able to find all three of these songs just in a second.

27
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:41,456
I'm going to say prep professor.

28
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:42,736
I'm going to say prep professor.

29
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:43,617
I'm going to say prep professor.

30
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:09,175
Hi.

31
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:39,362
Thank you.

32
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:01,236
Wow.

33
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:14,023
Okay.

34
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:14,303
Yeah.

35
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:35,976
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:01,565
They don't fight anymore.

37
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,971
Well, say you're my lawyer and you know I'm taking a breath outside.

38
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:28,872
Do I understand that?

39
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:29,432
I don't know.

40
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:30,833
You get a little whipped out of me.

41
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,334
It's just, you know, it's a big, big challenge.

42
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:34,175
I don't know what to say to you right now.

43
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:41,179
Anyway, I'm great, but, like, you know, I have, like, a lot of contracts, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through the next four or five years.

44
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,962
And now, like, I have contracts, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through the next four or five years.

45
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:51,225
And now, like, I have contracts, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through the next four or five years.

46
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:55,468
And now, like, I have contracts, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through the next four or five years.

47
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,289
And now it's like, it's not.

48
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:01,955
And the other thing is, it's like, the idea is like, CHS is just kind of like, you're not going to be able to help them right now.

49
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,117
They're just like, they don't have a place to live.

50
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:05,799
They don't have a school to go to.

51
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:07,060
They don't have a lawyer.

52
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,921
They don't have a team.

53
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,282
They don't have a school to go to.

54
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,564
They don't have a school to go to.

55
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:11,905
They don't have a school to go to.

56
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:12,806
They don't have a school to go to.

57
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,007
They don't have a school to go to.

58
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,429
They don't have a school to go to.

59
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,893
I mean, and that's where it gets kind of sticky.

60
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:30,615
It's like, now it's like, no, we'll finish out with patients that we care about, but if they can't start taking them from the baseline, they have to take them from someone else.

61
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,540
Yeah, just lay it out.

62
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,255
I think the thing that's upsetting to me is that they're saying we're too close up.

63
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,996
It's just way more than that.

64
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:21,642
And of course, because we're probably in the area that they serve, right?

65
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:28,007
Then the tailwinds are like, oh, but remember, if you bring your people to Lincoln, you don't serve that area at CHL.

66
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,829
So, away from people.

67
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,650
That's how I feel right now.

68
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,191
It's just...

69
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,514
I mean, I don't know if that would work.

70
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:04,683
It's just like this challenge where, you know, everybody wants to sell in a positive way.

71
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:06,744
But like, these things are problematic for the people.

72
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,164
And so like, it's just like, you know.

73
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:10,084
Like, you should have been six months prepping for this shit.

74
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:23,948
Yeah.

75
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:24,068
Yeah.

76
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:41,768
It was just like, it was really slight.

77
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,950
Like, I haven't notified the police that we were doing this.

78
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,531
I haven't notified...

79
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,065
I don't know if you can hear me.

80
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,346
I don't know if you can hear me.

81
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:21,169
What's going on?

82
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:21,730
How are you?

83
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,751
How you doing?

84
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:23,732
Nice to see you.

85
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:35,803
Okay.

86
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:36,063
Yeah.

87
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:55,909
Okay, and I know this is for whoever it's for.

88
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,529
We have certified people.

89
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:57,250
We've got our whole petition.

90
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:21,246
You're so impressive.

91
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:38,790
So I feel like the first, the first person that I'm going to come back and get is the

92
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:05,768
The criteria is spelled out in the process.

93
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,023
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

94
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:25,764
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

95
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:27,664
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

96
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,564
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

97
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,165
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

98
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,945
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

99
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,465
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

100
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,186
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

101
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:37,566
I'm excited to find out what he's doing.

102
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:53,991
But, you know, I don't want to, like, be interfering with the process that I've been trying to, like, try to improve.

103
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:54,431
So I stay out.

104
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:57,073
I can't go to the market, but, like, I hope to be able to, like, maybe this way.

105
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:57,533
I don't know.

106
00:11:57,553 --> 00:11:57,653
Right.

107
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:16,765
I have lots of things going on.

108
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:38,637
Yeah.

109
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:38,937
Yeah.

110
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:39,137
Yeah.

111
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:09,304
That would be great.

112
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:10,045
She's looking at time.

113
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:11,407
She's in her, she's studying right now.

114
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:11,968
And she's working now.

115
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,149
She's working full-time, part-time.

116
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,232
Part-time she's working really good, and she's probably doing okay.

117
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:24,523
I'm looking for people to do so.

118
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,341
This is for him.

119
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:00,943
Thank you very much.

120
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:20,972
Yeah.

121
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:21,092
Yeah.

122
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:44,335
I'm going to ask everybody who can to take a seat.

123
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:26,225
Somebody's happy?

124
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:37,670
Good morning, everybody.

125
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,370
Good morning.

126
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:45,973
My name is Tariq E. Carter, and I direct Elder Services here at the West Medford Community Center.

127
00:15:47,085 --> 00:16:03,711
I want you just to take stock of all the history around you, the West Medford Elder Photo Project on the top of the wall, the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project that is the circumference of the building and upstairs as well.

128
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:14,175
These are the hearts of our legacy and our heritage here as the historic African-American community in West Medford.

129
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:15,596
We're very, very proud of it.

130
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,395
We don't have a chance to see it all today.

131
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:21,576
We hope you'll come back and see it at some point in time.

132
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:27,899
I'm sure Lisa has part of that in her message that she'll share with you.

133
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,661
I want to welcome everyone to our very cozy and perhaps a bit crowded home.

134
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:37,743
We recommend, but don't mandate, that you mask up.

135
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:41,644
COVID, RSV, and the flu are all out there.

136
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:45,586
And we want everyone to enjoy today's program and health

137
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,272
confidence.

138
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:58,040
So I'll do my best to guide today's proceedings, but I want you to know that we're glad you're here versus all of the other places that you could be.

139
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:05,826
We have Method Community Media in the house, taking pretty pictures and video.

140
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:11,090
A lot of good help.

141
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,772
Cat Donnell is back there at mass control.

142
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:16,114
Kyle Douglas is in the corner.

143
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:21,048
Brian Collins, who's my friend forever.

144
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:23,729
I grew up with this dude.

145
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:26,051
You know, playing Rupaul at Duggar Park.

146
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,452
OK, never mind.

147
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,213
It's back there.

148
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,415
So again, we're just really, really happy to have you all here.

149
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:39,719
Now, we sincerely apologize to everybody who wanted to be in the room but wasn't able to make it.

150
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:45,823
Hopefully, the video will suffice so that everybody feels like they got a chance to see what we're doing today.

151
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:53,813
Today's engagement is all about unity, love, justice, equity, and peace.

152
00:17:54,613 --> 00:18:01,018
Those key aspects of human society were at the core of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'

153
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:05,882
's universal message, both as he lived and as he died.

154
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:15,669
To get us into a reflective frame of mind and heart, I would like to present Rabbi Jessica Delera Nussbaum,

155
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:20,234
from Medford's Temple Shalom to give an invocation as we begin.

156
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:42,680
On the Jewish calendar of Torah readings, we have just begun the book of Exodus, the evergreen story of humankind's journey from oppression and hate toward redemption and devotion.

157
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:57,041
Yet we know that God did not lead us by the shortest path to the promised land, neither the Israelites of the Hebrew Bible, nor the successive generations who have drawn strength and inspiration from Exodus's promise of liberation.

158
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:07,263
God, who created each one of us in the divine image, knew that we needed to get lost and to learn to trust in the possibility of a better world.

159
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:14,726
We needed to walk the paths and do the work of building a society founded on justice.

160
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:34,122
And just as every Jew is commanded to retell the exodus story at the Passover Seder, just as each Seder participant must view themselves as if they personally had been redeemed from Mitzrayim, the narrow place, it remains our labor to see to it that the narrative continues.

161
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:38,886
Our task of building trust in God, however we may understand God,

162
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,966
and trust between each other so that we can do this essential work, never ends.

163
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:49,208
Our mandate to be partners in creating a world of righteousness can never cease.

164
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:59,450
Rabbi Tarfon, one of the famous sages of the Talmud, said, Lo alecha hamlacha ligmor, v'lo ata ben chorin levatel mimena.

165
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:04,912
It is not upon you to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it.

166
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:23,111
Thus, as today we remember and celebrate Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., let's be sure to view ourselves, as he surely did, as essential partners in the work of fulfilling the promises of justice, both those divine and those simply human.

167
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:35,397
Let us feel gratitude for the freedoms and privileges we do experience, paired with a fierce determination to keep pressing forward, keep bending the arc until we find a world

168
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,879
where all human beings can be free and equal.

169
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:58,990
I will quote, as Dr. King did, the prophet Amos Amos, Vayigal kamayim mishpat mitzdaka k'naha etan, let justice well up like water and righteousness like an unfailing stream, now and forever.

170
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:09,578
Thank you, Rabbi.

171
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:13,623
We appreciate the spirit of love and remembrance in your message.

172
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:25,938
So we're going to begin the meat of today's meal with remarks by our WMCC executive director, Lisa Crossman.

173
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:26,399
Lisa.

174
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,600
Good morning, everybody.

175
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,462
Thank you so much for coming out.

176
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:40,649
I know the weather was treacherous for some of us.

177
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:47,478
And we have been through it all over this two weeks from our heat going out

178
00:21:48,085 --> 00:22:00,374
From the power going out, the snow, the ice, the everything, when all obstacles seemed against this program coming together, it came together.

179
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:05,218
It helped me realize that, you know, there are things beyond our control, right?

180
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,701
And what I value so much about Martin Luther King Jr.

181
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,623
is his leadership.

182
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:33,644
the values that you have to hold as an individual to face all these obstacles, hate, malice, anger, everyone telling you it's not possible, and still have the conviction and values to keep going, and to keep going in peace and with love.

183
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:39,746
Because there are days, we're tested here as well, where we are tested day in and day out.

184
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,220
And it's important that, as a leadership, we have clear values on what we stand on.

185
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:51,722
And that we are able to reflect that in the people who follow us.

186
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:59,184
And that we should be reminded as we go into an election year, right, who do our leaders, what do they stand for?

187
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:03,445
And is that in alignment with what I stand for?

188
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,746
So I do wanna just touch base.

189
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:11,137
Some of you may not be familiar with who we are.

190
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,779
A lot of you are familiar with who we are.

191
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,481
We are a nonprofit.

192
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,363
We're a 501c3, right?

193
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:23,125
And we are a volunteer membership organization.

194
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:26,828
The work we do depends on volunteerism.

195
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:35,034
We're at a point in life where maybe our younger people don't exactly connect with volunteerism anymore.

196
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,741
But volunteerism is important.

197
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:40,663
That's how we got our start.

198
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:42,084
People came together.

199
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:44,065
It wasn't gifted by the city.

200
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:48,848
The people here came together and said, let's do something.

201
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:49,849
Let's get it together.

202
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,650
Let's make it happen.

203
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,591
So this is 1934, when we were established.

204
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:53,531
The men's clubs is how it started.

205
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:54,752
By 1945, they became incorporated.

206
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:14,624
to promote civic, social, recreational well-being, stewardship of what was originally West Medford and grew to Medford and grew to the greater Mystic Valley.

207
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:26,453
And our mission is to connect people of Medford and the wider Mystic Valley through social, educational, cultural, health, and recreational activities.

208
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:33,318
Our primary goal is to support this idea of community, this intangible quality,

209
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:39,415
to where people feel like they belong and that other people have their best interests at heart.

210
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:45,897
So if you've ever been here for an event or an activity today, we hope you feel welcome.

211
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:52,220
We hope you feel embraced and you can feel the love that is in the work that we do.

212
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,421
This was genuinely a labor of love.

213
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:58,902
We were here at 10 o'clock last night decorating, 11 o'clock the night before.

214
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:02,584
So it truly is a labor of love over here.

215
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:20,170
Year round, we have activities here at WMCC for folks of different generations and races, ethnic backgrounds, religions, economic status, or any arbitrary division to come together and learn from each other and experience the idea of community.

216
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:33,518
In the 50s, during Jim Crow, this center was incorporated, started by a group of African American men, later to include African American women.

217
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:38,230
you know, racial segregation, discrimination, right?

218
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,211
Forced by the laws.

219
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:50,300
So, it arose out of a recognized need for the African American community, which had rooted itself in West Medford, to take care of ourselves.

220
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:59,487
At a time when African Americans were unwelcome across the tracks, beyond the three streets of Jerome, Lincoln, and one side of Arlington.

221
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:06,384
due to the racial discrimination amongst the realtors renting property in Medford.

222
00:26:08,364 --> 00:26:11,425
So what's important to see is how far we've come, right?

223
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:16,806
Recently, we were selected by the city of Medford to partner in the resiliency hub pilot.

224
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:28,388
And our goal within that is to elevate diverse communities in positions of leadership, which is something we've always done because our board is a volunteer board.

225
00:26:28,408 --> 00:26:30,289
We've always had a strong, diverse board.

226
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,943
So within that, we'll have funding to start a CirclesUSA chapter.

227
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:41,607
CirclesUSA works at national and local levels to reduce poverty.

228
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:46,811
We'll be the first agency to have a CirclesUSA in Massachusetts.

229
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:58,520
And CirclesUSA chapters gather people who are motivated to move out of poverty and match them with middle income to high income volunteers who can support and encourage them.

230
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:02,581
So with that work, we will need volunteerism.

231
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:04,442
We will need help to do that work.

232
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:07,725
There's no way that we can carry that load on our own.

233
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:10,927
And so I'll finish up.

234
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:14,210
I haven't been looking at the time, Terry.

235
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,951
I apologize.

236
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:21,255
So we'll hear more about this concept of drum majors, which was brought to my attention by Terry.

237
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:25,038
And it was an important speech for Dr. King.

238
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:40,399
And so it made the case that humans have this instinctive desire to be out front, to garner recognition, to be distinctive in some form or fashion, something he likened to the drum major of a marching band.

239
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,082
So King argued that the desire for individual greatness marred U.S.

240
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:53,909
society, but he also believed that that desire could be channeled into collective action with everyone acting as drum majors.

241
00:27:54,563 --> 00:28:02,109
for justice against the triple evils of racism, capitalism, and militarism.

242
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:07,654
King also believed that when properly channeled, the drive for greatness was a useful trait.

243
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:16,001
He called on each of us to redefine greatness by becoming drum majors in the quest for justice, peace, and righteousness.

244
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:27,922
He was calling on all Americans, but especially black Americans, to engage in collective action aimed at transforming themselves, others, and structures of injustice.

245
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:43,755
And I will finish up by saying, to do this, we must let the spirit of service, of light into the dark corners of our hearts, to empty us of our bitter attitudes that produce words of malice or fits of rage,

246
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:47,476
so that there is more room to give within us.

247
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:56,598
When you come here, we hope that if there's a problem we can solve, we hope that you share.

248
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:04,580
We hope if there's something weighing you down that you're able to leave your problems at the door and come in and enjoy and have a good time.

249
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:11,075
to think that just because you don't see your face on the wall does not mean you do not belong here.

250
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:12,636
Everybody belongs here.

251
00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:14,017
This is a community center.

252
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:17,899
It is the first of its kind in Medford as a whole.

253
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:30,808
So I hope that when you leave today, you remember that, that you see myself, you see Terry, our board members who are here, our seniors, and you feel like you're part of our family.

254
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:36,694
I came in as an outsider a year ago, and I am happy to call these people my friends.

255
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:42,256
They care about me and my son, and they didn't know me from the next person.

256
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:45,817
So if I can be as welcome, then so can you.

257
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:54,060
And we hope that you join us for the activities and events that we'll have down the line, because we are here for community spirit.

258
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,321
So please remember that and come out and add to that.

259
00:29:57,381 --> 00:30:00,042
And that's where I want to end.

260
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:14,410
Next, I would like to introduce our next speaker.

261
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,412
She is your mayor in her second term.

262
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:21,055
Please show her a warm WMCC welcome, Mayor of Mariana.

263
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:29,902
Thank you, Lisa.

264
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:32,464
Good morning, everybody.

265
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:35,526
People of all ages, it's wonderful to be here today.

266
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,661
Thank you to Lisa for planning this amazing event.

267
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:47,003
It was community senator Terry and the board to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.

268
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:47,223
Day.

269
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,224
I also just want to recognize a few people.

270
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:52,785
Dr. Edward Vincent, superintendent of schools.

271
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:55,105
We have State Rep.

272
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:56,626
Sean Garvalli, State Rep.

273
00:30:56,846 --> 00:31:02,927
Christine Barber, and then Redford City Council President, Nicole Morrell, and City Councilor, Brittany Yellow.

274
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:03,468
I think I've...

275
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:18,126
hosting today, and we know our diversity, equity, and inclusion director, Frances Wojcik, who's watching at home due to car trouble.

276
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:22,368
We were happy to help support this, and we thank you for your partnership.

277
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:26,551
Thank you to the Royal House who also partnered with us to make today happen.

278
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:34,317
Thank you for all who are attending, and thank you for inviting me to say a few words as we celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

279
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:42,810
So happy to be here to share thoughts on his impact, reflect with you all, and enjoy the music, poetry, and conversations.

280
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:54,813
The past few years have definitely tested us, but Dr. King's message of equality, love, and hope are still as relevant today as when he originally spread them some 60 years ago.

281
00:31:54,833 --> 00:32:03,195
One of the prevailing messages that Dr. King referenced on multiple occasions is the quest for a better future for the youth of America.

282
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,801
That's something I constantly grapple with.

283
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:10,605
Will I leave this city and the world a better place for my children and your children?

284
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:16,669
It's a tall task, but it's one we must achieve in order to build on the legacy that Dr. King forged.

285
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:24,335
In Medford and in all communities, we need to continually address the systematic issues that can erode the people's trust.

286
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:30,380
We're trying to do that through our advocacy on many different issues, including the MUP grant,

287
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:34,268
including transit, development, and the environment.

288
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:42,017
We need to lift up the voices of those who often go unheard and champion causes that lead to a more sustainable and powerful future.

289
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:50,487
Embracing Dr. King's leadership and ideals will help us take accountability and honor his legacy and reach those lofty goals of unity.

290
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:56,975
I look forward to the conversation today, to hear everyone talk about their experiences with Dr. King and his message.

291
00:32:56,995 --> 00:33:03,141
It has had a profound impact on so many and has helped shape so much of what we are trying to do here in Medford.

292
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:16,333
It's truly special to be able to come together, reflect on the life of Dr. King, and speak on the shared experiences we have dealing with diversity, social equity, and building a foundation of trust in our community.

293
00:33:17,017 --> 00:33:29,964
Thank you again to everybody who made this happen, who's here today, who's watching from home.

294
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:33,767
Appreciate it.

295
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:37,709
And now a song by someone who really needs no introduction.

296
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:45,153
We're proud to present our own Stacey Clayton to share the wonderful ode to sacrificial love, Bridge Over Trouble.

297
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:20,455
Thank you, thank you so much for having me today.

298
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:23,580
I'm so looking forward to sharing with you.

299
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:27,220
When you're weary and feeling small, when tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all.

300
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:57,172
I'm on your side Yeah, when times get rough And friends just can't be found Like a bridge over troubled waters

301
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:08,570
I will lay me down like a bridge over troubled water.

302
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,995
I will lay me down.

303
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:55,055
When you're down and out When you're on the street When evening falls so hard I will comfort you I'll take your part

304
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:17,394
when the darkness come and pain is all around like a bridge over troubled water

305
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:29,808
I will lay me down like a bridge over troubled water.

306
00:37:31,189 --> 00:37:33,432
I will lay me down.

307
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:52,154
Sail on silver girl, sail on by.

308
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:33,639
Your time has come to shine All your dreams are on their way See how they shine

309
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:59,367
And if you need a friend I'm sailing right behind Like a bridge over troubled waters I will ease your mind Like a bridge

310
00:39:00,597 --> 00:39:05,980
Over troubled waters, I will ease your mind.

311
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,541
Ease your mind.

312
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:52,606
Okay, all right, let it marinate.

313
00:39:53,386 --> 00:40:00,328
Let it marinate, let it get into you a little bit.

314
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:02,009
She always delivers, am I right?

315
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:12,412
All right, very good.

316
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:15,112
So Dr. King was many things.

317
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:17,053
Among them,

318
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:21,728
brilliant theologian, educated right here in the Bay State.

319
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:43,198
And I'm sure that the vapors have been caught by everyone with regard to the embrace, the monumental statue that's on Boston Common now, which is emblematic of the embrace that he and Coretta Scott King had when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

320
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:50,186
So hopefully, you all get a chance to see it at some point in time.

321
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:53,388
I've only seen it from a distance, perhaps like most of you.

322
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:56,309
And to me, it's magnificent.

323
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,370
And I know art is very subjective.

324
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:06,734
But in my mind, it's just a wonderful tribute really to love, absolutely.

325
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:13,817
Among Dr. King's many writings, the sober and compelling

326
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:27,660
letter from Birmingham jail remains a most instructive message of why we must continue to actively and non-violently pursue his goals of racial equality and social justice.

327
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:37,069
Now that letter is about 17 pages long and would take about an hour to read in its entirety.

328
00:41:41,153 --> 00:41:54,005
I've enlisted my daughter, Maya N. Carter, a stage actor working in Brooklyn, New York, and beyond, to assist me in presenting an abbreviated version of Dr. King's Timeless Reflection.

329
00:41:54,686 --> 00:42:01,772
We urge you to have a listen, and later, to read the letter in its complete and original form.

330
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:06,216
It's going to take a little bit, a little minute for us to stage this.

331
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:13,303
Thank you.

332
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:53,916
Letter from Birmingham Jail by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

333
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:56,196
16th April 1963.

334
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:01,578
My dear fellow clergymen.

335
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:11,641
While confined here in the Birmingham City Jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities unwise and untimely.

336
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:16,331
Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas.

337
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:25,797
If I sought to answer all the criticisms that crossed my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day.

338
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:28,839
And I would have no time for constructive work.

339
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:41,187
Several months ago, the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct action program if such were deemed necessary.

340
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:47,096
We readily consented, and when the hour came, we lived up to our promise.

341
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:55,645
So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here.

342
00:43:55,665 --> 00:44:01,270
I am here because I have organizational ties here.

343
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:06,135
But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here.

344
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:31,933
Just as the prophets of the 8th century BC left their villages and carried their thus saith the Lord far beyond the boundaries of their hometowns and just as the apostle Paul left his village in Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my hometown.

345
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:33,374
Moreover,

346
00:44:34,032 --> 00:44:39,074
I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states.

347
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:46,177
I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned with what happens in Birmingham.

348
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:51,699
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

349
00:44:52,519 --> 00:45:00,982
We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.

350
00:45:01,762 --> 00:45:03,623
Whatever affects one directly

351
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:06,622
affects all indirectly.

352
00:45:07,402 --> 00:45:14,625
Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial, outside agitator idea.

353
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:19,467
In any nonviolent campaign, there are four basic steps.

354
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:23,889
Collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist.

355
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:29,211
Negotiation, self-purification, and direct action.

356
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,552
We have gone through all the steps in Birmingham.

357
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:39,238
There can be no gain saying that the fact racial injustice engulfs this community.

358
00:45:39,979 --> 00:45:42,800
Its ugly record of brutality is widely known.

359
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:50,903
There have been unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham more than in any other city in the nation.

360
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:54,444
These are the hard, brutal facts of the case.

361
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:56,765
So we must see the need

362
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:11,214
for non-violent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.

363
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:24,040
The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.

364
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:33,747
Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.

365
00:46:34,348 --> 00:46:40,974
We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights.

366
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:46,780
Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging dots of segregation to say, wait.

367
00:46:48,965 --> 00:47:18,643
But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim, when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick, and even kill your black brothers and sisters, when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that

368
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:22,160
Funtown is closed to colored children.

369
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:43,539
I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality.

370
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:44,740
Actually,

371
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:50,732
We who engage in non-violent direct action are not the creators of tension.

372
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:57,755
We merely bring it to the surface, bring to surface the hidden tension that is already alive.

373
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:02,997
We bring it out in the open where it can be seen and dealt with.

374
00:48:03,777 --> 00:48:08,139
I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community.

375
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,920
One is a force of complacency.

376
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:39,056
made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self-respect and a sense of somebody-ness that they have adjusted to a degree, and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security, and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses.

377
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:48,062
The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence.

378
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:56,863
Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever, so I have not said to my people, get rid of your discontent.

379
00:48:57,324 --> 00:49:08,946
Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action.

380
00:49:10,435 --> 00:49:13,016
and pray long prayers.

381
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:24,121
If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable patience, I beg you to forgive me.

382
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:37,847
If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.

383
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,746
I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith.

384
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:58,692
Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and in some not-too-distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.

385
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:05,594
Yours for the cause of peace and brotherhood, Martin Luther King.

386
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:48,392
Thank you, Maya.

387
00:50:55,854 --> 00:51:04,477
As always, I can depend on your heart and your talent to make your old man look good.

388
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:10,779
So now we're going to pivot from the Deep South to the Near North and the Mystic Valley.

389
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:25,377
Among the many things that Lisa Crossman and I talked about in putting today's program together was a local recognition of some folk who Dr. King might have recognized as a drum major.

390
00:51:26,178 --> 00:51:39,405
Perhaps not so much as he wanted to be referred to in his memorable speech on February 4th, 1968, but more as advocates of peace, civility, and beloved community.

391
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:56,182
So without further ado, if Lisa Crossman can join me again, we want to present our first Drum Major Awards, celebrating work toward greater equity in the arts, education, civic engagement, and community legacy.

392
00:52:38,706 --> 00:52:44,109
All right, now don't be thinking she's being a white all up in here.

393
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:58,558
Okay, so from the West Medford Community Center Incorporated, we are honored to present the 2023 Drum Major Award to David Cha.

394
00:52:59,919 --> 00:53:03,321
In consideration of your arts leadership and advocacy,

395
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:23,611
as the principal of the West Medford Open Studios, and your own creativity as a writer and storyteller, we believe that you are an outstanding role model for young people and that you have taken a very direct path to building a place for the arts, as well as diversity, inclusion, and community service in this city.

396
00:53:24,011 --> 00:53:26,993
Signed, Lisa Crossman, Executive Director.

397
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,554
Date, January 16th, 2021.

398
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:17,371
Okay, in consideration of your, oh excuse me, okay, this one is in honor of civic engagement.

399
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:24,077
In consideration of your civic engagement as the Director of Citizen for

400
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:29,211
Citizen and social responsibility in the Medford public school system.

401
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:41,339
We believe that you are an outstanding role model for young people and that you have taken a very direct path to building a place for diversity, community service and social justice in the city.

402
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:30,310
West Memphis Community Center Incorporated is honored to present the 2023 Drum Major Award in the area of education to Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

403
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:44,378
In view of your courageous and capable administration as a superintendent of the Memphis public school system during some very trying and turbulent years, we believe that you are an outstanding role model for young people

404
00:55:44,763 --> 00:56:00,379
and that you have taken a very direct path to building a place for diversity, inclusion, educational equity, and social justice in the city, presented and signed Lisa Crossman, Executive Director, date January 16, 2025.

405
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,801
All right, but with both loud, we get emotional, so you know.

406
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:59,684
West Medford Community Center Incorporated is honored to present the 2023 Drum Major Award posthumously to Edward L. Buddy Clayton.

407
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:14,627
In view of Buddy's historical significance to the West Medford community and to greater Medford as its first

408
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:26,115
of the Korean War, and as a principal community builder in the early days of this unique neighborhood.

409
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:43,842
We believe that he remains an outstanding role model for young people, and that he took a very direct path to building a place for diversity, community, social justice, and neighborhood in this city.

410
00:57:44,262 --> 00:57:46,983
Signed, Lisa Crossman, dated January 16,

411
00:57:58,373 --> 00:58:06,177
So we have two of Buddy's sons and one of his grandson here to accept the award.

412
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,157
Thank you.

413
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:07,978
Thank you.

414
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:20,583
All right.

415
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:21,264
OK.

416
00:58:24,697 --> 00:58:35,529
So thank you all, drum major award winners, for your hard work, your dedication, and your inspiration to all of us.

417
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:40,474
You have our admiration and our gratitude.

418
00:58:44,138 --> 00:58:46,821
And now we would like to share some more music with you.

419
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:50,306
As they move into place, let me share a bit about them.

420
00:58:50,766 --> 00:58:54,867
Singer-songwriter Max Heineck is a true renaissance man.

421
00:58:55,387 --> 00:58:58,427
He teaches high school English at Medford High School.

422
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:09,910
He is an active and well-published poet, my poet friend, and is an owner and brewmaster at West Medford's first ever

423
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:17,735
Micro Brewery in Tap Room, Medford Brewing Company, just up the street on Harvard Avenue.

424
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:23,477
You need to stop by and get a pint if that's your place.

425
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:28,458
And it's on this side of the tracks.

426
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:39,922
Joining me on stage is a wonderful musical artist and a former English student of Max's.

427
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:46,675
She recorded extensively on Max's most recent CD project called Through Traveler.

428
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:47,735
I highly recommend it.

429
00:59:48,415 --> 00:59:53,256
I was blessed to be able to contribute lyrics for one of the songs on this album.

430
00:59:53,797 --> 00:59:59,318
That song is called Healing Waters and Linda and Max are going to favor us with this song right now.

431
01:00:08,743 --> 01:00:11,244
Thank you very much.

432
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,101
Thank you for having us today.

433
01:00:57,121 --> 01:01:02,945
It's such an honor to recognize and celebrate an icon like Dr. Martin Luther King.

434
01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:04,666
We celebrate him.

435
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:07,989
His courage will never be forgotten.

436
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,913
Healing waters roll by.

437
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:50,065
make my burdens just up and fly where I am a humble man alone in this troubled land where all of my dreams want to die healing waters roll by by and by take my poor soul to a place on high

438
01:01:51,568 --> 01:01:58,159
Although I'm a native son, I've got no place left to run.

439
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:01,545
Because all of my dreams are gone.

440
01:02:03,121 --> 01:02:13,966
But strong I have under this thing, trying to keep my people alive.

441
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:22,869
I've seen so much pain in the faces of those once brought down.

442
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:26,191
Cry, oh, cry, cry.

443
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,503
Rest in the valley where freedom lies.

444
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:47,109
Won't stay where my father died.

445
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,094
Contemplate suicide.

446
01:02:51,214 --> 01:02:56,340
There'll be a fire next time.

447
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:23,867
I have traveled these roads Longing to see justice divine With so much hatred at every stop sign To pull my strength to pass the line Healing waters roll by Make our burdens just a fright

448
01:03:24,489 --> 01:03:35,101
fly, hold my trembling hand, as I walk these troubled lands.

449
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:37,043
Oh, oh.

450
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:21,658
It's a bit of a revelation.

451
01:04:21,818 --> 01:04:23,058
I did that on purpose.

452
01:04:23,118 --> 01:04:24,719
Thank you, Max, my friend, and Linda.

453
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:25,319
That was amazing.

454
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:55,064
And I'm thrilled that I had a little something to do with your artistic contribution.

455
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:56,945
All right, all right.

456
01:04:57,285 --> 01:05:00,886
Robbing game, Timmy Torelli.

457
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:08,788
All right, friends, we're going to be like Jesus' disciples in that separate place near Galilee, and we're going to feed the multitudes.

458
01:05:09,468 --> 01:05:11,169
But it won't be bread and fishes.

459
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:15,250
We are asking you to, in an orderly fashion,

460
01:05:15,864 --> 01:05:20,626
get your lunch now, and I'm going to be led by other folks in doing this.

461
01:05:21,187 --> 01:05:30,831
And then we're going to ask you to come back to your table, and on your table you see a yellow tent card, and on that tent card is a single question.

462
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:35,333
So while you're dining, we want you to contemplate that question.

463
01:05:36,054 --> 01:05:40,516
Hopefully there's someone at each table who will be willing to record

464
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:46,613
And as you have your question, as you talk about that question, jot down some notes.

465
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:53,716
And then we'll take two or three reporters, and we'll report out on what took place at the tables during the lunch.

466
01:05:54,056 --> 01:05:56,537
It's going to be about a half an hour altogether.

467
01:05:58,178 --> 01:06:04,560
There are, I believe, roast beef and turkey wraps, as well as a vegetarian wrap option.

468
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:05,560
OK?

469
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,262
So I'm going to let some other folks deal with that, because

470
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:11,811
It's above my pay grade.

471
01:06:13,312 --> 01:06:17,696
But while you're having your lunch, please do take time to discuss.

472
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:22,860
There's a pad of paper and a pen at each table for the recording.

473
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:31,367
And hopefully the volunteer won't be too bashful to share a few impressions in about 20, 25 minutes.

474
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:32,348
Don't be bashful.

475
01:06:32,728 --> 01:06:37,692
Let's share something meaningful with one another and with the city of Medford.

476
01:06:37,972 --> 01:06:38,493
Bon appetit.

477
01:28:22,294 --> 01:28:23,455
All right.

478
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:28,259
So if I get everybody's attention.

479
01:28:28,299 --> 01:28:30,140
So how are you?

480
01:29:16,606 --> 01:29:24,608
So I want to make sure that I acknowledge Justin Tseng, City Councilor Justin Tseng, came in and joined us.

481
01:29:25,329 --> 01:29:38,277
Thank you so much for joining us in these festivities.

482
01:29:38,858 --> 01:29:48,644
So, everybody's had some lunch, been able to lunch a little bit, and that's a good thing.

483
01:29:49,284 --> 01:29:54,908
What we'd like to do is, obviously we ask for you to take a look at the tent card and

484
01:29:55,340 --> 01:30:00,662
you know, think about it a little bit and have discussions amongst your tables.

485
01:30:01,403 --> 01:30:16,429
And we'd like to share just a few, probably just going to ask maybe two of the tables to share what was heard and what was reflected during your conversations at the table.

486
01:30:16,509 --> 01:30:24,633
So if I have any volunteers amongst the people who recorded, who wrote,

487
01:30:25,702 --> 01:30:27,803
I'll take volunteers first, please, Laura.

488
01:30:28,343 --> 01:30:28,823
Okay.

489
01:30:29,364 --> 01:30:30,684
So, yes, please, can you come up?

490
01:30:30,724 --> 01:30:30,984
Yeah.

491
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,168
Just two or three of the points, okay?

492
01:30:41,188 --> 01:30:43,289
You know, as quickly as possible, that'd be good.

493
01:30:43,709 --> 01:30:44,289
Okay, yeah.

494
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:49,831
Our question was, what lessons has Medford learned from dealing with COVID-19?

495
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:54,133
And I think the big thing is we learned we needed

496
01:30:54,763 --> 01:30:56,944
to stay in contact with each other.

497
01:30:57,624 --> 01:30:59,565
And we had to find new ways to do that.

498
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:03,507
So that was, well, a lot of us learned how to Zoom.

499
01:31:04,048 --> 01:31:14,333
And we appreciated Medford Community Media filming things and arranging Zoom meetings so we could stay in touch with what's happening in the city.

500
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:23,137
We gave a lot of kudos to Mayor Brianna about bringing all the facilities together for shots, vaccination,

501
01:31:24,044 --> 01:31:30,230
information about COVID and those robocalls were very helpful too as to what to do.

502
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:33,372
So we think the city did very well.

503
01:31:35,054 --> 01:31:35,955
Thank you very much.

504
01:31:35,975 --> 01:31:36,816
Okay.

505
01:31:37,396 --> 01:31:37,716
Okay.

506
01:31:37,756 --> 01:31:38,897
Do I have another volunteer?

507
01:31:38,937 --> 01:31:41,199
I want to get the Girl Scouts table in the back.

508
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:42,701
All right.

509
01:31:43,352 --> 01:31:45,134
We're happy to have the troop with us.

510
01:31:45,254 --> 01:31:51,621
Yeah, you should get in touch with them if you if you're if you're cookie deprived.

511
01:31:52,982 --> 01:31:54,904
I personally need some thin mints.

512
01:31:54,984 --> 01:31:55,945
Okay, very good.

513
01:31:55,965 --> 01:31:56,185
Please.

514
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:23,473
just hold it right up and speak your outdoor voice okay so our question was how to improve race relations in metropolitan schools so we have realized that there have been a little

515
01:32:33,987 --> 01:32:38,988
racial issues in our school with certain kids being racist and calling people racial slurs.

516
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:43,310
So we have realized that assemblies in school don't really help.

517
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:56,513
So we think that you should get a group of students to make up rules and what is okay, what's not okay, and then they can talk about it instead of the teachers.

518
01:32:56,533 --> 01:32:59,394
And then the teachers should be more aware of what's going on in the school.

519
01:33:00,394 --> 01:33:01,275
Thank you very much.

520
01:33:01,355 --> 01:33:01,935
I appreciate your time.

521
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,459
OK, we'll take one more very briefly.

522
01:33:06,519 --> 01:33:10,062
Eileen, you want to come over to your table?

523
01:33:10,142 --> 01:33:10,202
OK.

524
01:33:38,107 --> 01:33:49,875
So one thing that I've noticed is that most people in Medford have no idea of the rich history of abolition in Medford.

525
01:33:50,255 --> 01:34:04,224
We have incredible people here, like George Stern, who was the chief person who gave money to John Brown for his raid on Harper's Ferry.

526
01:34:05,005 --> 01:34:06,826
We have Lydia Maria Child,

527
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:18,844
say, how is it that we in Medford don't even know our own history?

528
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:21,045
It's not even on the city website.

529
01:34:21,525 --> 01:34:25,926
The city website we have is all about clipper ships and brain crackers.

530
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:29,807
And that is not all the history of Medford is.

531
01:34:29,907 --> 01:34:38,329
This was a very important place in the struggle to end slavery, and we should all be cognizant of that.

532
01:34:38,949 --> 01:34:42,530
And I think it should be taught in the schools from

533
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:46,992
young ages to teenage, you know, to the high school.

534
01:34:47,412 --> 01:34:59,177
But I think one thing that would help race relations if people were educated in the history and understood what went on in the struggles that are still going on today.

535
01:34:59,837 --> 01:35:00,818
Thank you so much.

536
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:01,658
I appreciate it.

537
01:35:01,718 --> 01:35:02,098
One more.

538
01:35:03,419 --> 01:35:07,181
I'm just going to do one more.

539
01:35:12,795 --> 01:35:18,378
We're going to go full intergenerational.

540
01:35:18,438 --> 01:35:22,561
Hold this for yourself.

541
01:35:22,641 --> 01:35:22,761
OK.

542
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:23,921
Yes, please.

543
01:35:24,162 --> 01:35:25,823
So we are Sophie and Sean.

544
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:30,986
Our question was, how can New Church help foster better religious relationships in this church?

545
01:35:31,086 --> 01:35:33,367
A little louder.

546
01:35:33,847 --> 01:35:41,712
We were going to talk about music and cultural food and festivals.

547
01:35:42,732 --> 01:35:44,574
and as you said, play dates.

548
01:35:44,594 --> 01:35:47,577
And that's it.

549
01:35:47,597 --> 01:35:48,378
That's all we have.

550
01:35:48,398 --> 01:35:52,361
Okay, thank you very much.

551
01:35:52,421 --> 01:35:54,123
Thank you very much.

552
01:35:54,143 --> 01:36:01,250
Okay, so we want to be mindful and respectful of time, and so we're going to stop right there, but I do want to say,

553
01:36:03,505 --> 01:36:11,210
These conversations are really just the beginning of what we plan to do with our neighbors here at WMCC, and I would say across the city.

554
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:28,101
Conversations have been taking place for a number of years, but we want to get back to a real focus on what moves us to a greater resiliency as a city and more meaningful connections as a city of neighborhoods that are really far too separated right now, okay?

555
01:36:29,982 --> 01:36:32,704
All right, so, known by many,

556
01:36:33,309 --> 01:36:43,552
But definitely not all Methodites is the fact that our city lays claim to having the last remaining intact African slave quarters in the Northeast.

557
01:36:44,432 --> 01:36:58,496
On 15 George Street, at the ancestral home of Isaac Royal, there is a national historical site that commemorates both the existence and the shared legacy of human bondage here in the Mystic Valley.

558
01:36:59,596 --> 01:37:01,457
So today's special message

559
01:37:02,992 --> 01:37:10,217
is going to be presented by the Executive Director of the Royal House Enslaved Quarters, Kiara Singleton.

560
01:37:10,938 --> 01:37:18,044
Kiara is a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in the Department of American Culture.

561
01:37:18,644 --> 01:37:27,812
She was also an American Democracy Fellow in the Charles Warren Center at Harvard University during the 21-22 academic year.

562
01:37:28,412 --> 01:37:31,955
She has held a number of prestigious academic fellowships

563
01:37:32,425 --> 01:37:43,251
And from 2018 to 2019, she served as the Humanity in Action Policy Fellow for the ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia.

564
01:37:43,831 --> 01:37:50,755
As a policy fellow, she focused on mass incarceration, reproductive justice, and voting rights.

565
01:37:51,355 --> 01:37:59,580
She created the ACLU GA's first podcast series, Examining Justice, in order to highlight the voices of both

566
01:37:59,928 --> 01:38:05,832
community activists, and policy makers in the fight for racial, gender, and transformative justice.

567
01:38:06,573 --> 01:38:18,381
As a public history scholar, Kiara recently served as an advisor of the Boston Art Commission's Recontextualization Subcommittee for the Bronze Emancipation Group Statute.

568
01:38:18,861 --> 01:38:29,088
She is also a member of the Board of Public Humanities Fellows at Brown University in Rhode Island, which brings together a collection of museum leaders from

569
01:38:29,688 --> 01:38:30,268
New England.

570
01:38:30,668 --> 01:38:34,829
She is a scholar, an activist, and a cultural preservationist.

571
01:38:35,109 --> 01:38:37,170
Ladies and gentlemen, Kiara Singleton.

572
01:38:46,832 --> 01:38:49,233
Good afternoon, everyone.

573
01:38:55,068 --> 01:39:00,751
and to have shared the stage with so many amazing artists, performers, and community members.

574
01:39:02,873 --> 01:39:10,818
When Terry first reached out to ask me if I would deliver words for today's event, I was simultaneously honored and a bit terrified.

575
01:39:10,838 --> 01:39:15,020
I think I said something like, Terry, you know I study slavery, right?

576
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:17,141
I talk about the 18th century.

577
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:19,183
I talk about the 19th century.

578
01:39:19,723 --> 01:39:23,025
But once we get to the 20th century, in the Civil Rights era,

579
01:39:23,477 --> 01:39:25,979
While I know it, it is not my specialty.

580
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:32,383
And Terry asked me to really just think about the importance of history in our current moment.

581
01:39:32,863 --> 01:39:36,485
And so I took a moment to myself and I thought, you know, well, I can do that.

582
01:39:36,525 --> 01:39:40,428
I can talk about the long history of black freedom struggles.

583
01:39:41,488 --> 01:39:50,634
So as we all gather to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr., his life, his activism, his scholarship, his profound love of black people,

584
01:39:51,107 --> 01:39:56,452
and his deep commitment to freedom, I want to use this space to also reflect on his radicalism.

585
01:39:57,193 --> 01:40:05,821
Now, today is a day where many people will talk about Dr. Martin Luther King and share a lot of his words, oftentimes, sometimes out of context.

586
01:40:07,522 --> 01:40:16,631
People will gravitate towards the I have a dream speech, which is extremely important, don't get me wrong, but I've often found myself frustrated

587
01:40:16,967 --> 01:40:22,989
by any notion that that speech is the pillar by which young activists today should follow.

588
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:25,450
And why might you ask that I say that?

589
01:40:25,551 --> 01:40:38,136
Well, sometimes people use Dr. King as a way to tell black people and people of color to be more peaceful, to agitate within reason, and to order their steps in a way that is about working within the system as opposed to creating a new one.

590
01:40:38,776 --> 01:40:45,999
So impersonally, I think this is also a great misreading of Dr. King's words and a misreading of his actions.

591
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:50,290
So I'm going to pull from two of my favorite texts today in my remarks.

592
01:40:52,633 --> 01:41:05,464
In his last book, Where Do We Go From Here, Chaos or Community, Dr. King states that there is a tendency in this country to take one step forward on the questions of racial justice and then to take a step backward.

593
01:41:06,084 --> 01:41:10,908
This pattern that Dr. King pointed out in 1967 brings extremely true today.

594
01:41:11,689 --> 01:41:18,114
In 2020, we all witnessed one of the largest scale social justice and racial uprisings in this country.

595
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:21,017
Protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd,

596
01:41:21,357 --> 01:41:32,680
led to large-scale conversations around racism and what appeared to be a reckoning with a long history of anti-blackness, systemic racism, and police brutality in this country.

597
01:41:33,595 --> 01:41:40,463
Indeed, a step forward in the words of Dr. King, led by the amazing and relentless activists all across the country.

598
01:41:41,163 --> 01:41:52,276
However, Dr. King also warned us to never get complacent because of the tendency for this country to quite literally backtrack on progress it made in relation to racial justice.

599
01:41:52,856 --> 01:42:09,948
So just two short years after the uprisings in 2020, there's a new study that came out by mapping police violence that just let us know that this year in the United States, police killed more people than any other year that we have on record.

600
01:42:11,349 --> 01:42:19,776
Based on this data and cited in a recent article by Dr. Austin McCoy, 1,183 people died by the hands of police officers.

601
01:42:20,597 --> 01:42:23,139
Of the people murdered, 25% were black.

602
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:27,102
Now, black people only make up 13% of this country's population.

603
01:42:28,123 --> 01:42:29,825
These numbers are extremely concerning.

604
01:42:29,845 --> 01:42:39,273
When you dig deeper into the data, you find out that 32% of the people were fleeing, 11% of the people committed no actual offense,

605
01:42:40,245 --> 01:42:44,726
9% of the murders happened during mental health and wellness checks.

606
01:42:44,746 --> 01:42:46,207
8% occurred during traffic stops.

607
01:42:46,807 --> 01:42:50,508
And 18% occurred during arrests for non-violent offenses.

608
01:42:51,628 --> 01:42:55,989
So I want us to take a moment and sit with these statistics, because they're not just numbers.

609
01:42:56,569 --> 01:42:57,409
These are people.

610
01:42:58,129 --> 01:43:03,771
They are people like Kenan Anderson, a teacher from DC who was just killed in LA a few days ago.

611
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:09,052
They are people like 20-year-old UMass Boston student Arif Saeed Faisal,

612
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:12,279
who was killed right next door in Cambridge earlier this month.

613
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:16,602
Now some of you might say to me, so where's the uplifting part?

614
01:43:17,302 --> 01:43:18,083
Well, that's the thing.

615
01:43:18,563 --> 01:43:28,770
When we read and seriously engage with Dr. King's words, he says that it's not unpatriotic to tell the truth, to critique this country and to demand justice.

616
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:32,312
That part of walking in his wake is to own

617
01:43:33,308 --> 01:43:36,911
for all of us to own being angry at injustice whenever we see it.

618
01:43:37,531 --> 01:43:39,373
And we don't need to apologize for that.

619
01:43:40,574 --> 01:43:44,697
And furthermore, we should all be angry and we should be angry in community.

620
01:43:46,278 --> 01:43:56,006
And I've been to the mountaintop where Dr. King talks about the economic power of black people in this country and the importance of standing with the striking Memphis sanitation workers.

621
01:43:56,426 --> 01:43:58,588
He grounds resistance in community.

622
01:43:59,168 --> 01:44:02,811
He says, we've got to give ourselves to the struggle until the end.

623
01:44:03,347 --> 01:44:06,770
Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis.

624
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:08,251
We gotta see it through.

625
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:10,533
And we have to march.

626
01:44:10,774 --> 01:44:11,594
You need to be there.

627
01:44:12,075 --> 01:44:15,498
If it means leaving work, if it means leaving school, be there.

628
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:17,379
Be concerned about your brother.

629
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:22,484
You may not be on strike, but either we go up together or we go down together.

630
01:44:23,765 --> 01:44:29,710
So we must all ask ourselves if we will succumb to the chaos of systemic racism or fight back

631
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:32,311
for justice in community?

632
01:44:32,791 --> 01:44:34,192
I think we have the answer to that.

633
01:44:35,093 --> 01:44:37,894
So let me just say that there is no struggle without hope.

634
01:44:38,595 --> 01:44:42,057
And we don't have to look very far to see how hopeful we should be.

635
01:44:42,597 --> 01:44:46,339
I see the protests for Keenan Anderson throughout the country, and that gives me hope.

636
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:50,922
I see the protests for Arif in Harvard Square, and that gives me hope.

637
01:44:51,422 --> 01:45:00,007
We just witnessed Baldwin Hill's tenants fight back against Boston University and win against being displaced from their buildings.

638
01:45:00,553 --> 01:45:02,854
and they won the ability to purchase their homes.

639
01:45:03,954 --> 01:45:10,537
So as Dr. King said, the line to progress is never straight, and yet the fight must continue.

640
01:45:11,717 --> 01:45:14,938
So now, how do I do this work as the head of a museum?

641
01:45:14,958 --> 01:45:22,101
So I'm going to transition just a little bit and put on my scholarly hat and turn to the concept of care.

642
01:45:23,281 --> 01:45:24,942
In an article by Christina Sharpe,

643
01:45:26,196 --> 01:45:30,817
called In to Survive, she says that care is a shared risk.

644
01:45:31,678 --> 01:45:34,979
This shared risk to me relates to many of the teachings of Dr. King.

645
01:45:35,539 --> 01:45:43,401
When speaking of the sanitation workers again, he asserts, the question is not, if I stop to help this man in need, what will happen to me?

646
01:45:44,021 --> 01:45:49,162
The question is, if I do not stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to them?

647
01:45:49,763 --> 01:45:50,803
That is the question.

648
01:45:51,922 --> 01:45:55,944
He goes on to say, let us rise up with a greater readiness.

649
01:45:56,404 --> 01:45:58,525
Let us stand with a greater determination.

650
01:45:58,925 --> 01:46:05,227
And let us move on in these powerful days, these days to challenge to make America what it ought to be.

651
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:09,069
We have an opportunity to make America a better nation.

652
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:21,634
So for me, a part of understanding American history, a part of getting to that moment where the country can be a better nation, is to seriously grapple with the history of slavery.

653
01:46:22,121 --> 01:46:29,983
and the contributions that enslaved people made to building the wealth of this country, but also to building the wealth of right here in Massachusetts.

654
01:46:31,444 --> 01:46:35,765
Working in the field of slavery asks us all to bear witness.

655
01:46:36,486 --> 01:46:50,690
Bear witness to both the unimaginable violence, but also to bear witness to the ways in which enslaved people, women, men, and children resisted, created lives for themselves, experienced joy, perished, and survived.

656
01:46:51,422 --> 01:46:55,063
To hold all of these things simultaneously takes care.

657
01:46:55,663 --> 01:47:01,004
It asks us today, how not only do we care for the living, but how do we care for the dead?

658
01:47:01,905 --> 01:47:05,025
It takes the ability to go into archives and to look.

659
01:47:05,605 --> 01:47:11,607
Look through box after box in hopes of finding documents that provide us with a trace of enslaved people.

660
01:47:12,167 --> 01:47:13,667
Sometimes we find a sentence.

661
01:47:14,128 --> 01:47:17,308
In the case of Belinda Sutton, we find a wealth of petitions.

662
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:20,109
But we always find something when we look.

663
01:47:20,749 --> 01:47:28,511
When we ask different questions, we begin to imagine a world in which enslaved people not only inhabited, but they also shaped.

664
01:47:29,431 --> 01:47:40,994
We learn about their multiple attempts of running away to be reunited with their family, the kinship networks they created, and the protests that they had for the peculiar institution of slavery.

665
01:47:42,034 --> 01:47:48,876
We learn enslavers placed enslaved people as the heads of their estates in order to resist their properties being seized during war.

666
01:47:49,507 --> 01:47:52,448
We are forced also to contend with family separations.

667
01:47:52,848 --> 01:47:58,131
We are forced to think about the ways in which children were a part of the institution as well.

668
01:47:59,231 --> 01:48:05,494
However, violence is never the cornerstone of enslaved people's history, to quote Marissa Fuentes.

669
01:48:07,435 --> 01:48:15,378
Sadia Hartman writes, write our now as if it is interrupted by this past, and to imagine a free state.

670
01:48:15,889 --> 01:48:22,232
not as a time before captivity or slavery, but rather as the anticipated future of this writing.

671
01:48:23,512 --> 01:48:32,636
For me, no one is more instructive of that than Belinda Sutton, who was enslaved by the royals at the royal house plantation.

672
01:48:34,037 --> 01:48:43,501
Belinda Sutton first enters the historical archive on August 14, 1768, when her name appears simply as Belinda in Medford Vital Records.

673
01:48:44,688 --> 01:48:47,069
Those records show the baptism of her children.

674
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:53,333
The next time we meet Belinda Sutton is in 1781 through Isaac Royal, Jr.'

675
01:48:53,313 --> 01:48:53,673
's will.

676
01:48:54,414 --> 01:49:04,499
In his will, he states, I do also give unto my stepdaughter, Mary Royal Irving, my Negro woman, Belinda, in the case that she does not choose her freedom.

677
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:14,305
If she does choose her freedom, provided that she gets security, that she shall not be a charge to the town of Medford.

678
01:49:15,717 --> 01:49:24,426
In 1783, we meet Belinda again, but this time as a member of Massachusetts' relatively small but bustling free population.

679
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:35,717
After obtaining her freedom, Belinda Sutton petitions the Massachusetts General Court in 1783 for a pension from the royal estate in order to support herself and her sick daughter.

680
01:49:37,158 --> 01:49:39,280
Belinda's petition is shockingly approved.

681
01:49:39,788 --> 01:49:48,915
And she's awarded an annual pension of 15 pounds and 12 shillings, becoming one of the earliest and most significant examples of reparations in this country.

682
01:49:50,605 --> 01:49:52,966
So what do we do with stories like Belinda?

683
01:49:53,326 --> 01:49:55,007
Well, we should talk about them.

684
01:49:55,467 --> 01:49:56,588
We should know about them.

685
01:49:57,188 --> 01:49:58,729
It is a part of our local history.

686
01:49:59,029 --> 01:50:08,913
But also, they represent a testament to the long history of black activism, of black women's activism, of black women's legal activism.

687
01:50:09,253 --> 01:50:12,975
So I know we're in Massachusetts, where we always talk about the revolution.

688
01:50:13,355 --> 01:50:18,297
But when we talk about the revolution, we have to also have a different conversation about what is freedom.

689
01:50:18,716 --> 01:50:22,279
Freedom did not mean the same thing for everyone at that time.

690
01:50:22,619 --> 01:50:32,348
And when you study and when you learn about the enslaved people and the free black people in Massachusetts, what you realize is that they were creating definitions of freedom for themselves.

691
01:50:32,988 --> 01:50:44,458
And this is what, for me, Dr. King is very instructive about, thinking about our history to not only imagine what it means to think about what it means to be free, but also

692
01:50:45,176 --> 01:50:49,737
being able to rely on the people who came before us, who set the pathway.

693
01:50:51,598 --> 01:50:57,940
So I'm going to go ahead and skip, because I feel like I'm running over time.

694
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:12,985
But as historic sites and museums and different organizations embark on the journey to reckon with the histories of slavery, which really does come out of

695
01:51:13,388 --> 01:51:18,633
this post-George Floyd moment in many, many ways, especially here in Massachusetts.

696
01:51:18,653 --> 01:51:24,998
There is not an institution who is not studying their history and their connection to slavery right now, which is great.

697
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:33,726
But in doing this work, one of the things that I ask people to do is to continuously look.

698
01:51:34,206 --> 01:51:40,572
And when you think you can't find anything else, to look again, to think about the archive, to ask new questions,

699
01:51:40,965 --> 01:51:57,011
to imagine a world that always centers black people as political agents, to tell new stories, to work with descendant communities, to also talk about the ways in which the afterlives of slavery manifest in systemic racism every single day.

700
01:51:58,791 --> 01:52:03,813
And when you think you know everything that you can know, I always say, look and look again.

701
01:52:04,393 --> 01:52:09,655
Because to care means to do the work, even when it's hard, and even when it seems impossible.

702
01:52:12,813 --> 01:52:17,176
In Tales from the Haunted South, Taya Miles reflects on her fascination with historic homes.

703
01:52:17,936 --> 01:52:22,079
She says, I am haunted by homes of the past and the people who occupy them.

704
01:52:23,419 --> 01:52:31,584
As someone who runs a historic house museum, I too am haunted by homes of the past and the people who occupy them.

705
01:52:32,304 --> 01:52:40,189
However, lately, I've found myself haunted by the people, the descendants of slavery, who never stepped foot into the homes of the past, because some museums

706
01:52:40,702 --> 01:52:50,327
continue to erase them for the sake of locating this history as part of an American shameful past instead of reckoning with how the legacy of slavery is all around us today.

707
01:52:52,348 --> 01:53:03,794
So I'll end with saying that one of my goals is not only to give people the tools to understand the history, but also to give people the tools to reckon with their current moment today.

708
01:53:04,415 --> 01:53:10,578
We absolutely cannot care about black people's freedom dreams in the past if we actually do not care about their freedom.

709
01:53:43,831 --> 01:53:53,979
Thank you, Kiara, for bringing wonderful additional perspective and context to today's celebration.

710
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:02,106
Thank you for coming as you always do with the real and the sincere and not sugarcoating it.

711
01:54:02,626 --> 01:54:03,767
We appreciate you.

712
01:54:04,357 --> 01:54:06,819
And we're blessed by your joining us today.

713
01:54:13,903 --> 01:54:30,372
So it is our sincere hope that folks who have not yet visited the museum and slave quarters, when it opens back up in the spring, will take full advantage of the great history that you preserve right here in our own backyard.

714
01:54:31,063 --> 01:54:43,086
And I know that one of the things that Lisa and I have talked about is that we definitely plan on doing is putting a trip together from the community center and bringing folks over to the museum so that they can get the full tour.

715
01:54:44,326 --> 01:54:45,526
All right, thank you so much.

716
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:53,168
So I thought a lot about what poem that I would share with you today.

717
01:54:53,548 --> 01:54:57,069
You know, they got this thing in Medford now called Poet Laureate.

718
01:55:04,223 --> 01:55:06,665
It comes to my recollection, it's never happened before.

719
01:55:07,085 --> 01:55:15,590
And for it to happen with me, a brother from West Medford, who could have figured that?

720
01:55:16,591 --> 01:55:22,355
In any case, I want to read a piece called A Call to Action.

721
01:55:24,576 --> 01:55:29,459
In big cities and small towns alike, America sees a dangerous spike.

722
01:55:29,579 --> 01:55:33,162
Violent intent has reemerged as purveyors

723
01:55:33,798 --> 01:55:40,261
Lies and hate converge to weave a dark and angry story and rob the flag of all its glory.

724
01:55:41,362 --> 01:55:43,943
We are called warriors in this fight.

725
01:55:44,624 --> 01:55:51,747
Let us coalesce and get things right and battle for a common goal that speaks to our collective soul.

726
01:55:52,428 --> 01:55:57,671
Advancing the causes of truth and peace, striving to make the outrage cease.

727
01:55:58,591 --> 01:56:00,352
That's the call of allyship.

728
01:56:00,883 --> 01:56:08,086
an anchor for this human trip, not a political bargaining chip, a dialogue chain to pull and rip.

729
01:56:09,127 --> 01:56:14,909
When the village gathers to raise a barn, everyone eats good food from the farm.

730
01:56:14,949 --> 01:56:20,892
When the village gathers to raise its young, no hate speech is on its tongue.

731
01:56:21,872 --> 01:56:24,033
Dr. King called for beloved community.

732
01:56:24,515 --> 01:56:26,656
Faith and grace and love and unity.

733
01:56:27,316 --> 01:56:35,160
Can these fragrant oils grant us immunity when all around us folks hate our kinship, strange and weak?

734
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:40,982
Let us not allow their prideful rages to force us into a thousand cages.

735
01:56:41,563 --> 01:56:47,565
Let's put our smaller wants aside and be the voice that's unified.

736
01:56:48,226 --> 01:56:50,567
We can begin right where we are.

737
01:56:51,127 --> 01:56:53,228
We can let Medford raise the bar.

738
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:57,738
We can show a fractured land a hopeful future that's now at hand.

739
01:56:58,678 --> 01:57:00,198
Look to make a friend today.

740
01:57:01,179 --> 01:57:03,519
To gather together, and yes, to pray.

741
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:09,300
Regardless of which God you serve, touch a heart and strike a nerve.

742
01:57:10,161 --> 01:57:12,661
Such was the choice that Martin made.

743
01:57:13,401 --> 01:57:15,882
And for that choice, he dearly paid.

744
01:57:16,702 --> 01:57:21,323
Let's make sure his sacrifice steers the ship that breaks the ice.

745
01:57:22,059 --> 01:57:24,863
We're all called warriors in this fight.

746
01:57:25,624 --> 01:57:40,562
Let us coalesce to get things right and battle for a common goal that speaks to our collective soul, advancing the causes of truth and peace, striving to make the outrage cease.

747
01:57:41,654 --> 01:57:48,240
When this village gathers as Medford Strong, as beloved cousins, let's get along.

748
01:57:48,901 --> 01:57:54,626
Across the borders of neighborhood, let's be about the common good.

749
01:57:55,306 --> 01:57:58,329
We're all called warriors in this fight.

750
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:03,554
Let's walk in peace and truth and light.

751
01:58:34,389 --> 01:58:44,955
your spirits toward participation in our ongoing struggle for equity, harmony, peace, and justice in Medford and beyond.

752
01:58:45,776 --> 01:59:00,945
So here with a charge, a mission statement, so to speak, for that hopeful future is our friend, WMCC board member and longtime senior pastor of West Medford Baptist Church, Reverend David M. Kilpatrick.

753
01:59:19,101 --> 01:59:24,004
Gary asked me if I would share some reflections on Martin Luther King Jr.

754
01:59:24,165 --> 01:59:31,430
and his legacy, but before I do that, let me share some personal remarks with you.

755
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:37,214
I think I'm the only person in this room that knew Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

756
01:59:37,274 --> 01:59:37,894
personally.

757
01:59:39,355 --> 01:59:43,558
In the early 1960s, I was a seminary student in Rochester, New York.

758
01:59:44,759 --> 01:59:46,300
In those days, Rochester

759
01:59:47,049 --> 01:59:49,410
was owned by the Eastman Kodak Company.

760
01:59:50,370 --> 01:59:55,251
Nothing happened in Rochester unless it had the stamp of the Kodak Company on it.

761
01:59:56,372 --> 01:59:59,973
Nothing politically, nothing socially, nothing culturally.

762
02:00:01,213 --> 02:00:04,234
And the community needed to be organized.

763
02:00:04,394 --> 02:00:07,475
And a number of people came to town to help us to do that.

764
02:00:08,655 --> 02:00:12,796
One was the infamous Saul Alinensky, whom I'm sure you've heard about.

765
02:00:14,437 --> 02:00:16,117
But Martin came as well.

766
02:00:17,362 --> 02:00:27,426
And we put together a community coalition to organize the community of Rochester to advocate for itself.

767
02:00:28,846 --> 02:00:34,128
And as a young seminary student, I was on the steering committee of the coalition.

768
02:00:35,349 --> 02:00:38,810
And several times, we met together with Martin Luther King, Jr.

769
02:00:41,451 --> 02:00:43,492
Another interesting fact while I was there

770
02:00:44,848 --> 02:00:49,571
One week before he was assassinated, Malcolm X came to our seminary.

771
02:00:51,332 --> 02:00:54,514
He had recently been on a pilgrimage to Mecca.

772
02:00:56,715 --> 02:01:02,198
And on that pilgrimage, he rediscovered what the Muslim community is all about.

773
02:01:03,579 --> 02:01:13,125
People from all over the world, every size, shape, color, background, and realized what unity meant.

774
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:17,152
And he and Martin had talked about that as well.

775
02:01:19,734 --> 02:01:25,919
And at that point in their histories, they shared a common vision of the beloved community.

776
02:01:27,581 --> 02:01:32,645
So in my reflections today, I'd like to share with you some thoughts about the beloved community.

777
02:01:34,786 --> 02:01:43,614
It's probably safe to say that for most of us as young children growing up, when it was time to celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

778
02:01:44,975 --> 02:01:49,236
He was mythologized, and he's still mythologized.

779
02:01:50,116 --> 02:02:00,698
We learned that Dr. King was a good man who had a dream that one day all would be treated equally and judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin.

780
02:02:01,598 --> 02:02:12,000
Most of us left those lessons believing that Dr. King had accomplished all that he set out to do, and that we live in a better America as a result.

781
02:02:13,693 --> 02:02:14,994
Sadly, that's not true.

782
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:23,538
After all, we no longer see whites-only signs on water fountains and bathrooms in the South.

783
02:02:24,578 --> 02:02:29,641
And people of color can attend the same schools as European-American individuals.

784
02:02:31,081 --> 02:02:40,466
As we progressed in our schooling, however, some of us have been fortunate enough to be challenged by our educators to observe the ways in which race

785
02:02:42,563 --> 02:02:47,646
Our eyes may have been opened to the necessary continued work of the Civil Rights Movement.

786
02:02:48,467 --> 02:02:56,371
For many black Americans learning about Dr. King as the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he cannot drive out hate.

787
02:02:57,712 --> 02:02:58,973
Only love can do that.

788
02:03:00,433 --> 02:03:06,717
Refusing to disconnect his vision for the world from the Christian vision of peace and reconciliation.

789
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:19,238
However, as Dr. King knew, we cannot get at reconciliation without first knowing and acknowledging the truth, some of which we've heard here today.

790
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:32,388
The hard truth is that for protests and marches and outcries, that the lives of marches and outcries, that the lives of people of color matter.

791
02:03:33,569 --> 02:03:37,152
This is evident in the persistent of white supremacy

792
02:03:37,804 --> 02:03:44,948
and systemic racism that continue to deny equal rights and opportunities to people of color.

793
02:03:45,868 --> 02:03:52,691
Today, black college graduates are twice as likely to be unemployed from European-American college graduates.

794
02:03:53,652 --> 02:03:56,553
There's still an awful lot of work for us to do.

795
02:03:58,054 --> 02:04:05,958
Emphasis was placed on us because, as in the case of Dr. King, this cannot be the work of one individual

796
02:04:06,478 --> 02:04:11,219
or placed on the shoulders of even a small select group of people.

797
02:04:12,659 --> 02:04:21,201
Black youth activists and their allies played critical roles in propelling the movement forward and carrying out the work of Dr. King.

798
02:04:22,221 --> 02:04:29,742
A beloved community where there is no space for injustice or prejudice or discrimination.

799
02:04:30,862 --> 02:04:33,903
Rather, it's a space of economic and social justice

800
02:04:35,693 --> 02:04:40,515
The beloved community that Dr. King spoke about is more than just an ideology.

801
02:04:41,576 --> 02:04:50,060
In order for us to have such a beloved community, Dr. King said that we all must become outspoken champions.

802
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:53,361
Outspoken champions.

803
02:04:54,281 --> 02:04:59,684
He warned that we are all complicit when we see injustice and do nothing about it.

804
02:05:00,789 --> 02:05:11,515
He reminded us that we have a moral obligation to stand up for racial and social justice and to dismantle systems of racism and discrimination.

805
02:05:12,775 --> 02:05:17,878
The late Congressman John Lewis, a disciple of Dr. King, shared these same sentiments.

806
02:05:18,838 --> 02:05:22,841
When you see something that is not right, you have to say something.

807
02:05:24,341 --> 02:05:25,442
You must do something.

808
02:05:26,556 --> 02:05:30,818
Each of us must do our part to help to build that beloved community.

809
02:05:32,098 --> 02:05:37,820
We can trace Dr. King's advocacy for the beloved community to his theology.

810
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:45,483
And so today, in 2023, we affirm that all people are valuable in the eyes of God.

811
02:05:46,483 --> 02:05:55,126
While recognizing the historical injustices such as stealing of lands of indigenous peoples, the enslavement of Africans,

812
02:05:56,504 --> 02:06:10,634
concentrated poverty and the overall marginalization of minoritized groups, that all continues to play a role in how society is constructed and how we experience it.

813
02:06:11,715 --> 02:06:25,625
We believe that in order to fulfill the call to love God and to love our neighbors wholeheartedly, we must be attentive to the ways in which we can unintentionally perpetuate barriers

814
02:06:26,241 --> 02:06:30,845
that cause disparities and alienate already marginalized people.

815
02:06:31,946 --> 02:06:46,800
Implicit biases, microaggressions, exclusionary or exploitative policies and practices, ignorance of irrelevant cultural events pervade our culture predominantly.

816
02:06:47,841 --> 02:06:52,285
What institutions, as a Christ-centered community,

817
02:06:53,453 --> 02:07:06,061
and a religious-centered community, we must be attentive to these dynamics and dismantle systems that dehumanize people, as we are all created in the Imago Dei.

818
02:07:07,162 --> 02:07:21,491
In the context of community, we believe that the work of diversity and belonging is not only important in creating an inclusive environment where everybody can thrive, but also in allowing the community to demonstrate

819
02:07:22,315 --> 02:07:23,396
our religious faith.

820
02:07:24,536 --> 02:07:44,727
By celebrating the diversity of our community while also seeking to explicitly address racial and social disparities, we believe that we can reflect the love of God toward others and serve as a beacon of hope in a society that is still plagued by division and prejudice and hate.

821
02:07:45,647 --> 02:07:50,290
It's only through creating this kind of life-giving and hospitable community

822
02:07:50,937 --> 02:08:04,511
that we can really honor Dr. King's legacy, and in his words, bring to fruition the day when all God's children will be able to join hands and redeem

823
02:08:23,838 --> 02:08:25,579
So I love my brother Pastor.

824
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:27,960
He was my father's pastor for many, many years.

825
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:40,465
And when a pastor says, can you give me two minutes, and you say yes, and then he turns to the next person and says, can you give me two minutes, and he says yes, and he turns to the next person and says, can you give me two minutes, and he says yes, he says, OK, I got six minutes.

826
02:08:42,045 --> 02:08:43,686
Thank you very much for your reflections.

827
02:08:43,706 --> 02:08:46,847
They definitely were important to the day.

828
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:53,090
I want to welcome Stacey Clayton back to the stage

829
02:08:53,644 --> 02:09:00,209
to lead us in James Weldon Johnson's anthem of Black America, Lift Every Voice and Sing.

830
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:11,198
For those of you that don't know the words, we've placed copies of the lyrics at each table, so I'm gonna set it up on the audio and the mic to Stacy.

831
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:21,867
As we're standing as your people, and we're getting ready, preparing our hearts to sing, lift every voice and sing.

832
02:09:22,597 --> 02:09:30,181
my two senses, make sure that we're intentional at making every voice be at that table.

833
02:09:30,341 --> 02:09:39,666
And as we sing, can we reflect on experiences in our own lives where we're serving at a table where we don't see or hear every voice.

834
02:09:40,377 --> 02:09:47,501
And one of the things that this song can kind of help us to remember is to help every voice to be lifted.

835
02:09:48,321 --> 02:09:51,003
And not just one extra voice either.

836
02:09:51,383 --> 02:09:58,407
Let's move away from, you know, just having one person of color on every committee, right?

837
02:09:58,647 --> 02:10:04,070
Let's be intentional about diversifying our leadership all the way down.

838
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:07,392
Everywhere we are, let's embrace diversity.

839
02:10:07,672 --> 02:10:09,053
Your friendship circles.

840
02:10:09,571 --> 02:10:16,456
Let's make sure that they include, your children are getting to see you, be in love with people that are different from you.

841
02:10:16,837 --> 02:10:19,398
That goes for us and that goes for everybody else.

842
02:10:20,139 --> 02:10:24,042
If we all do it, we'll start a revolution here in Medford.

843
02:10:42,393 --> 02:10:46,136
So if somebody's going to make a major donation, we're going to upgrade our internet.

844
02:10:46,156 --> 02:10:49,958
Did I say that out loud?

845
02:10:49,998 --> 02:10:50,899
Yes sir, you did.

846
02:10:50,919 --> 02:10:51,539
Sorry man.

847
02:11:16,197 --> 02:11:17,197
Thank you very much.

848
02:11:45,657 --> 02:11:47,357
All right, let's do it.

849
02:11:47,397 --> 02:11:48,558
We can do this.

850
02:12:05,623 --> 02:12:07,124
Two, three.

851
02:12:08,125 --> 02:12:17,792
Lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring.

852
02:12:18,532 --> 02:12:28,320
Ring with the harmonies of liberty.

853
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:34,144
Let our rejoicing rise.

854
02:12:34,724 --> 02:12:49,273
High as the listening skies, let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

855
02:12:49,613 --> 02:12:52,035
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

856
02:12:52,175 --> 02:13:01,941
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us.

857
02:13:02,903 --> 02:13:15,493
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.

858
02:13:15,513 --> 02:13:28,164
Facing the rising sun of a new day begun, let us march on.

859
02:13:28,716 --> 02:13:34,259
Till victory is won.

860
02:13:34,279 --> 02:13:53,211
God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, Thou who has brought us thus,

861
02:13:53,751 --> 02:13:58,414
far on the way.

862
02:13:59,015 --> 02:14:18,768
Thou who has by thy might led us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray.

863
02:14:18,788 --> 02:14:21,070
We rest our feet straight from the places, our God.

864
02:14:22,489 --> 02:14:32,715
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee.

865
02:14:32,795 --> 02:14:41,280
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee.

866
02:14:47,332 --> 02:15:14,407
Shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand, true to our God, true to our native land.

867
02:15:14,547 --> 02:15:14,827
Amen.

868
02:15:24,530 --> 02:15:26,154
All right.

869
02:15:32,976 --> 02:15:39,341
So, the real performer said, we don't need no music, I just need people in the house.

870
02:15:39,361 --> 02:15:40,521
So thank you, Stacey.

871
02:15:40,562 --> 02:15:41,482
Thank you.

872
02:15:41,582 --> 02:15:45,625
Yeah, our people in the Fiskeye.

873
02:15:45,785 --> 02:15:48,687
Okay, all right.

874
02:15:49,208 --> 02:15:54,271
All right, we're pretty much at the end of our official time together.

875
02:15:54,612 --> 02:16:01,096
I'm gonna turn it over to Executive Director Lisa Crossman for closing remarks and acknowledgements.

876
02:16:08,467 --> 02:16:13,170
All right, thank you so much for hanging in there with us.

877
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:24,877
So I want to thank the mayor's office, Mayor Brianna and Frances Nwande, our diversity equity and inclusion director over at Bedford City Hall.

878
02:16:24,917 --> 02:16:27,718
If you have not been over there, please go over there.

879
02:16:27,738 --> 02:16:28,539
Please welcome her.

880
02:16:33,083 --> 02:16:35,044
Please talk to her.

881
02:16:35,405 --> 02:16:35,905
Share.

882
02:16:36,065 --> 02:16:37,366
She's willing to listen.

883
02:16:37,386 --> 02:16:39,928
No matter how far back you want to go, she's willing to listen.

884
02:16:39,948 --> 02:16:41,229
She's a wonderful woman.

885
02:16:41,269 --> 02:16:42,630
She's skilled at what she does.

886
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:46,113
Please, please, please go meet her and talk with her.

887
02:16:47,132 --> 02:16:54,217
Thank you to State Reps Christine Barber and Sean Garberly, Congresswoman Catherine Cook for coming.

888
02:16:55,057 --> 02:16:59,680
Our counselors Carol DiEllo, Merrell and Wang for coming through.

889
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:05,964
And of course, Stacy Clayton, Linda Moreau, Max Heineck.

890
02:17:06,444 --> 02:17:09,426
And my dad, Elias Carter.

891
02:17:09,506 --> 02:17:12,367
Thank you all so much for your talent today.

892
02:17:12,387 --> 02:17:16,470
David Kilpatrick, our Reverend David Kilpatrick.

893
02:17:16,981 --> 02:17:23,003
Jessica Delara Nussbaum, our caterer, Cook King, who came from Outer Worcester.

894
02:17:24,424 --> 02:17:33,647
And our honorees today, David Chow, Richard Trotter, Dr. Maurice-Edouard Francois, and Princeton.

895
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:35,161
And the family of Buddy Clayton.

896
02:17:35,201 --> 02:17:39,024
Buddy sits on our wall number 10 and you will find him up here if you have a chance to stick around and read.

897
02:17:39,124 --> 02:17:40,405
Also want to acknowledge

898
02:17:54,355 --> 02:18:05,440
back to the list, sorry, our board, our wonderful board who has been so supportive over this past year, Brian Collins, Reverend Kilpatrick, Corey Woods, Melinda Regan, and Jacqueline Furtado.

899
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:11,923
Thank you so much.

900
02:18:11,943 --> 02:18:22,148
And if you picked up a key chain and you got to see them, there is a little message on the back, but just as we set the course for our organization stepping forward this year, remembering

901
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:27,441
Patience, focus, greatness, determination, vision, and discipline.

902
02:18:27,842 --> 02:18:30,964
If there's one thing that you can find to work on, pick one, please.

903
02:18:31,064 --> 02:18:33,185
Stay focused on that for this year.

904
02:18:33,245 --> 02:18:35,747
We'll be back together next year, hopefully.

905
02:18:35,767 --> 02:18:42,832
And we will be doing our, in April, please look out for our annual legislative breakfast.

906
02:18:42,892 --> 02:18:45,874
We'll have our legislators back here and have community conversation.

907
02:18:45,934 --> 02:18:46,975
It's time for input.

908
02:18:47,695 --> 02:18:51,118
Our Juneteenth event, we should be on September, excuse me,

909
02:18:53,076 --> 02:18:57,058
We're going to have another fair, a market on the 11th.

910
02:18:57,118 --> 02:18:59,459
So we hope to all see you here.

911
02:18:59,559 --> 02:19:02,240
You are no longer guests.

912
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:04,181
You now are welcome here.

913
02:19:04,201 --> 02:19:05,861
You come in just like everybody else.

914
02:19:05,921 --> 02:19:08,302
Jake, look what's in the fridge, just like everybody else.

915
02:19:08,382 --> 02:19:11,984
You knock on the door, you interrupt me, just like everybody else.

916
02:19:12,004 --> 02:19:15,145
So we're so happy to have you here.

917
02:19:15,265 --> 02:19:20,507
And I quickly just want to show a picture here of Mr. Buddy.

918
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:24,512
who grew up as a teenager here, Mr. Cecil Fury.

919
02:19:24,632 --> 02:19:27,674
Wave your hand, Mr. Cecil.

920
02:19:27,714 --> 02:19:31,436
Mr. Cecil, as a child, grew up here.

921
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:34,138
Same hooligan he is today.

922
02:19:35,859 --> 02:19:37,700
So I just want to remind you that.

923
02:19:46,348 --> 02:19:48,509
He has been so gracious to me.

924
02:19:48,589 --> 02:19:53,230
This is our first time collaborating and he's been so gracious.

925
02:19:53,290 --> 02:19:58,632
It's just been wonderful to work with him and this whole community and I hope to be around for much longer and see you all.

926
02:19:59,072 --> 02:19:59,993
Thank you for coming out.

927
02:20:00,053 --> 02:20:00,993
Enjoy your afternoon.

928
02:20:01,013 --> 02:20:01,893
Drive safe out there.

929
02:20:10,884 --> 02:20:19,069
I also would be remiss, we would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge our men in blue.

930
02:20:20,590 --> 02:20:26,955
We have two of our members fighting.

931
02:20:27,135 --> 02:20:34,840
You hear and have been hearing for years Officer Clemente's voice on your telephone giving you all those notices.

932
02:20:36,258 --> 02:20:37,299
Words to live by.

933
02:20:38,039 --> 02:20:43,222
So thank you gentlemen, both officers, we appreciate you.

934
02:20:43,462 --> 02:20:52,928
And I want to say to Lisa, my partner in crime on this one, not real crime, not anything that you would have to arrest us for.

935
02:20:53,508 --> 02:20:55,429
but it's been a pleasure.

936
02:20:55,469 --> 02:20:57,630
So thanks everybody for coming out.

937
02:20:57,670 --> 02:21:04,293
Thank you, Kenley Tucker and the Senior Club for helping with the decorations and for serving everybody.

938
02:21:04,413 --> 02:21:09,635
If we've been remiss, if we've missed anybody, shout it to our heads and not our hearts.

939
02:21:09,675 --> 02:21:11,956
We love y'all, we love y'all.
