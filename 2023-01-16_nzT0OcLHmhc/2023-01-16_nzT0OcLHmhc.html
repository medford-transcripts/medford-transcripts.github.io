    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=73.505s">I</a>  have a, like, century. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=75.347s">I</a>  don't even have it, but I'm sticking with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=77.489s">So,</a>  I get to know everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=78.81s">Because</a>  I've always tried, like, I have always tried to, like, so that this year, I'm sure that it's going to be a big success. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=86.557s">I</a>  think it's going to be a big success. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=88.359s">So,</a>  I think it's going to be a big success. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=91.181s">So,</a>  I think it's going to be a big success. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=93.383s">So,</a>  I think it's going to be a big success. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=96.466s">We'll</a>  likely get them seated in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=125.883s">It's</a>  not actually what it's after. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=128.186s">It's</a>  not a chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=143.461s">So</a>  they don't know how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=145.182s">And</a>  meanwhile, I can already do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=147.084s">I'll</a>  scan their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=148.205s">So</a>  for example, let's say I'm in London. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=150.447s">I</a>  don't know if I'm going to be able to find all three of these songs just in a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=325.87s">Well,</a>  say you're my lawyer and you know I'm taking a breath outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=328.011s">Do</a>  I understand that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=328.932s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=332.354s">I</a>  don't know what to say to you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=334.295s">Anyway,</a>  I'm great, but, like, you know, I have, like, a lot of contracts, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through the next four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=346.162s">And</a>  now, like, I have contracts, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through the next four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=351.365s">And</a>  now, like, I have contracts, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through the next four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=356.329s">And</a>  the other thing is, it's like, the idea is like, CHS is just kind of like, you're not going to be able to help them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=361.975s">They're</a>  just like, they don't have a place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=364.137s">They</a>  don't have a school to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=365.859s">They</a>  don't have a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=378.752s">I</a>  mean, and that's where it gets kind of sticky. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=380.913s">It's</a>  like, now it's like, no, we'll finish out with patients that we care about, but if they can't start taking them from the baseline, they have to take them from someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=405.939s">Yeah,</a>  just lay it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=441.662s">Then</a>  the tailwinds are like, oh, but remember, if you bring your people to Lincoln, you don't serve that area at CHL. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=448.027s">So,</a>  away from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=449.949s">That's</a>  how I feel right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=480.682s">It's</a>  just like this challenge where, you know, everybody wants to sell in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=484.723s">But</a>  like, these things are problematic for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=486.904s">And</a>  so like, it's just like, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=488.184s">Like,</a>  you should have been six months prepping for this shit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=636.488s">So</a>  I feel like the first, the first person that I'm going to come back and get is the <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=664.687s">The</a>  criteria is spelled out in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=685.864s">I'm</a>  excited to find out what he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=709.928s">But,</a>  you know, I don't want to, like, be interfering with the process that I've been trying to, like, try to improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=789.324s">She's</a>  looking at time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=790.105s">She's</a>  in her, she's studying right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=791.427s">And</a>  she's working now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=792.028s">She's</a>  working full-time, part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=793.169s">Part-time</a>  she's working really good, and she's probably doing okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=803.422s">I'm</a>  looking for people to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=881.233s">I'm</a>  going to ask everybody who can to take a seat.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=918.443s">Somebody's</a>  happy? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=936.489s">Good</a>  morning, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=938.15s">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=939.731s">My</a>  name is Tariq E. Carter, and I direct Elder Services here at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=947.085s">I</a>  want you just to take stock of all the history around you, the West Medford Elder Photo Project on the top of the wall, the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project that is the circumference of the building and upstairs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=964.772s">These</a>  are the hearts of our legacy and our heritage here as the historic African-American community in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=974.195s">We're</a>  very, very proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=976.374s">We</a>  don't have a chance to see it all today. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=978.415s">We</a>  hope you'll come back and see it at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=981.616s">I'm</a>  sure Lisa has part of that in her message that she'll share with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=987.919s">I</a>  want to welcome everyone to our very cozy and perhaps a bit crowded home. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=994.741s">We</a>  recommend, but don't mandate, that you mask up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=998.403s">COVID,</a>  RSV, and the flu are all out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1002.004s">And</a>  we want everyone to enjoy today's program and health <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1006.631s">confidence.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1008.432s">So</a>  I'll do my best to guide today's proceedings, but I want you to know that we're glad you're here versus all of the other places that you could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1019.401s">We</a>  have Method Community Media in the house, taking pretty pictures and video. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1025.886s">A</a>  lot of good help. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1031.11s">Cat</a>  Donnell is back there at mass control. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1033.792s">Kyle</a>  Douglas is in the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1036.705s">Brian</a>  Collins, who's my friend forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1041.148s">I</a>  grew up with this dude. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1043.749s">You</a>  know, playing Rupaul at Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1046.131s">OK,</a>  never mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1047.712s">It's</a>  back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1050.233s">So</a>  again, we're just really, really happy to have you all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1054.496s">Now,</a>  we sincerely apologize to everybody who wanted to be in the room but wasn't able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1060.159s">Hopefully,</a>  the video will suffice so that everybody feels like they got a chance to see what we're doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1066.467s">Today's</a>  engagement is all about unity, love, justice, equity, and peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1074.613s">Those</a>  key aspects of human society were at the core of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1080.978s">'s</a>  universal message, both as he lived and as he died. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1086.822s">To</a>  get us into a reflective frame of mind and heart, I would like to present Rabbi Jessica Delera Nussbaum, <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1096.113s">from</a>  Medford's Temple Shalom to give an invocation as we begin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1112.077s">On</a>  the Jewish calendar of Torah readings, we have just begun the book of Exodus, the evergreen story of humankind's journey from oppression and hate toward redemption and devotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1123.338s">Yet</a>  we know that God did not lead us by the shortest path to the promised land, neither the Israelites of the Hebrew Bible, nor the successive generations who have drawn strength and inspiration from Exodus's promise of liberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1138.161s">God,</a>  who created each one of us in the divine image, knew that we needed to get lost and to learn to trust in the possibility of a better world. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1149.242s">We</a>  needed to walk the paths and do the work of building a society founded on justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1155.447s">And</a>  just as every Jew is commanded to retell the exodus story at the Passover Seder, just as each Seder participant must view themselves as if they personally had been redeemed from Mitzrayim, the narrow place, it remains our labor to see to it that the narrative continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1174.963s">Our</a>  task of building trust in God, however we may understand God, <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1179.345s">and</a>  trust between each other so that we can do this essential work, never ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1184.606s">Our</a>  mandate to be partners in creating a world of righteousness can never cease. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1190.248s">Rabbi</a>  Tarfon, one of the famous sages of the Talmud, said, Lo alecha hamlacha ligmor, v'lo ata ben chorin levatel mimena. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1199.951s">It</a>  is not upon you to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1206.242s">Thus,</a>  as today we remember and celebrate Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., let's be sure to view ourselves, as he surely did, as essential partners in the work of fulfilling the promises of justice, both those divine and those simply human. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1224.231s">Let</a>  us feel gratitude for the freedoms and privileges we do experience, paired with a fierce determination to keep pressing forward, keep bending the arc until we find a world <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1235.777s">where</a>  all human beings can be free and equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1242.381s">I</a>  will quote, as Dr. King did, the prophet Amos Amos, Vayigal kamayim mishpat mitzdaka k'naha etan, let justice well up like water and righteousness like an unfailing stream, now and forever.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1268.677s">Thank</a>  you, Rabbi. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1269.979s">We</a>  appreciate the spirit of love and remembrance in your message. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1277.788s">So</a>  we're going to begin the meat of today's meal with remarks by our WMCC executive director, Lisa Crossman. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1286.078s">Lisa.</a> </p>

    <p>[Crossman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1292.158s">Good</a>  morning, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1293.66s">Thank</a>  you so much for coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1295.603s">I</a>  know the weather was treacherous for some of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1300.729s">And</a>  we have been through it all over this two weeks from our heat going out <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1308.085s">From</a>  the power going out, the snow, the ice, the everything, when all obstacles seemed against this program coming together, it came together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1320.875s">It</a>  helped me realize that, you know, there are things beyond our control, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1325.458s">And</a>  what I value so much about Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1329.801s">is</a>  his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1332.318s">the</a>  values that you have to hold as an individual to face all these obstacles, hate, malice, anger, everyone telling you it's not possible, and still have the conviction and values to keep going, and to keep going in peace and with love. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1354.584s">Because</a>  there are days, we're tested here as well, where we are tested day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1360.799s">And</a>  it's important that, as a leadership, we have clear values on what we stand on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1367.461s">And</a>  that we are able to reflect that in the people who follow us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1372.462s">And</a>  that we should be reminded as we go into an election year, right, who do our leaders, what do they stand for? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1379.504s">And</a>  is that in alignment with what I stand for? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1385.725s">So</a>  I do wanna just touch base. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1388.675s">Some</a>  of you may not be familiar with who we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1391.157s">A</a>  lot of you are familiar with who we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1393.799s">We</a>  are a nonprofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1397.501s">We're</a>  a 501c3, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1399.463s">And</a>  we are a volunteer membership organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1403.146s">The</a>  work we do depends on volunteerism. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1407.809s">We're</a>  at a point in life where maybe our younger people don't exactly connect with volunteerism anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1416.66s">But</a>  volunteerism is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1418.761s">That's</a>  how we got our start. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1421.063s">People</a>  came together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1422.144s">It</a>  wasn't gifted by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1424.765s">The</a>  people here came together and said, let's do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1428.888s">Let's</a>  get it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1430.85s">Let's</a>  make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1431.69s">So</a>  this is 1934, when we were established. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1432.611s">The</a>  men's clubs is how it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1433.551s">By</a>  1945, they became incorporated. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1444.537s">to</a>  promote civic, social, recreational well-being, stewardship of what was originally West Medford and grew to Medford and grew to the greater Mystic Valley. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1456.506s">And</a>  our mission is to connect people of Medford and the wider Mystic Valley through social, educational, cultural, health, and recreational activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1468.414s">Our</a>  primary goal is to support this idea of community, this intangible quality, <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1474.353s">to</a>  where people feel like they belong and that other people have their best interests at heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1479.935s">So</a>  if you've ever been here for an event or an activity today, we hope you feel welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1485.917s">We</a>  hope you feel embraced and you can feel the love that is in the work that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1492.28s">This</a>  was genuinely a labor of love. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1494.441s">We</a>  were here at 10 o'clock last night decorating, 11 o'clock the night before. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1499.603s">So</a>  it truly is a labor of love over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1504.12s">Year</a>  round, we have activities here at WMCC for folks of different generations and races, ethnic backgrounds, religions, economic status, or any arbitrary division to come together and learn from each other and experience the idea of community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1522.311s">In</a>  the 50s, during Jim Crow, this center was incorporated, started by a group of African American men, later to include African American women. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1534.487s">you</a>  know, racial segregation, discrimination, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1538.27s">Forced</a>  by the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1540.192s">So,</a>  it arose out of a recognized need for the African American community, which had rooted itself in West Medford, to take care of ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1551.32s">At</a>  a time when African Americans were unwelcome across the tracks, beyond the three streets of Jerome, Lincoln, and one side of Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1561.963s">due</a>  to the racial discrimination amongst the realtors renting property in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1568.364s">So</a>  what's important to see is how far we've come, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1572.145s">Recently,</a>  we were selected by the city of Medford to partner in the resiliency hub pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1577.306s">And</a>  our goal within that is to elevate diverse communities in positions of leadership, which is something we've always done because our board is a volunteer board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1588.408s">We've</a>  always had a strong, diverse board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1592.04s">So</a>  within that, we'll have funding to start a CirclesUSA chapter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1596.864s">CirclesUSA</a>  works at national and local levels to reduce poverty. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1602.928s">We'll</a>  be the first agency to have a CirclesUSA in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1607.892s">And</a>  CirclesUSA chapters gather people who are motivated to move out of poverty and match them with middle income to high income volunteers who can support and encourage them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1619.298s">So</a>  with that work, we will need volunteerism. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1622.641s">We</a>  will need help to do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1624.562s">There's</a>  no way that we can carry that load on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1628.825s">And</a>  so I'll finish up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1631.027s">I</a>  haven't been looking at the time, Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1634.29s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1636.091s">So</a>  we'll hear more about this concept of drum majors, which was brought to my attention by Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1641.695s">And</a>  it was an important speech for Dr. King. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1646.588s">And</a>  so it made the case that humans have this instinctive desire to be out front, to garner recognition, to be distinctive in some form or fashion, something he likened to the drum major of a marching band. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1661.099s">So</a>  King argued that the desire for individual greatness marred U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1665.122s">society,</a>  but he also believed that that desire could be channeled into collective action with everyone acting as drum majors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1674.563s">for</a>  justice against the triple evils of racism, capitalism, and militarism. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1682.189s">King</a>  also believed that when properly channeled, the drive for greatness was a useful trait. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1688.274s">He</a>  called on each of us to redefine greatness by becoming drum majors in the quest for justice, peace, and righteousness. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1697.493s">He</a>  was calling on all Americans, but especially black Americans, to engage in collective action aimed at transforming themselves, others, and structures of injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1708.983s">And</a>  I will finish up by saying, to do this, we must let the spirit of service, of light into the dark corners of our hearts, to empty us of our bitter attitudes that produce words of malice or fits of rage, <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1724.415s">so</a>  that there is more room to give within us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1730.637s">When</a>  you come here, we hope that if there's a problem we can solve, we hope that you share. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1737.278s">We</a>  hope if there's something weighing you down that you're able to leave your problems at the door and come in and enjoy and have a good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1745.371s">to</a>  think that just because you don't see your face on the wall does not mean you do not belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1751.615s">Everybody</a>  belongs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1752.656s">This</a>  is a community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1754.197s">It</a>  is the first of its kind in Medford as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1759.38s">So</a>  I hope that when you leave today, you remember that, that you see myself, you see Terry, our board members who are here, our seniors, and you feel like you're part of our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1771.452s">I</a>  came in as an outsider a year ago, and I am happy to call these people my friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1776.714s">They</a>  care about me and my son, and they didn't know me from the next person. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1782.556s">So</a>  if I can be as welcome, then so can you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1786.337s">And</a>  we hope that you join us for the activities and events that we'll have down the line, because we are here for community spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1794.16s">So</a>  please remember that and come out and add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1797.381s">And</a>  that's where I want to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1810.187s">Next,</a>  I would like to introduce our next speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1814.43s">She</a>  is your mayor in her second term. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1816.432s">Please</a>  show her a warm WMCC welcome, Mayor of Mariana.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1829.181s">Thank</a>  you, Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1829.922s">Good</a>  morning, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1832.584s">People</a>  of all ages, it's wonderful to be here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1836.5s">Thank</a>  you to Lisa for planning this amazing event. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1840.201s">It</a>  was community senator Terry and the board to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1847.023s">Day.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1847.583s">I</a>  also just want to recognize a few people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1849.244s">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent, superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1853.105s">We</a>  have State Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1855.365s">Sean</a>  Garvalli, State Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1856.846s">Christine</a>  Barber, and then Redford City Council President, Nicole Morell, and City Councilor, Brittany Yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1862.947s">I</a>  think I've... <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1871.401s">hosting</a>  today, and we know our diversity, equity, and inclusion director, Frances Wojcik, who's watching at home due to car trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1878.566s">We</a>  were happy to help support this, and we thank you for your partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1882.409s">Thank</a>  you to the Royal House who also partnered with us to make today happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1887.452s">Thank</a>  you for all who are attending, and thank you for inviting me to say a few words as we celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1895.288s">So</a>  happy to be here to share thoughts on his impact, reflect with you all, and enjoy the music, poetry, and conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1903.79s">The</a>  past few years have definitely tested us, but Dr. King's message of equality, love, and hope are still as relevant today as when he originally spread them some 60 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1914.833s">One</a>  of the prevailing messages that Dr. King referenced on multiple occasions is the quest for a better future for the youth of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1924.06s">That's</a>  something I constantly grapple with. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1926.322s">Will</a>  I leave this city and the world a better place for my children and your children? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1931.606s">It's</a>  a tall task, but it's one we must achieve in order to build on the legacy that Dr. King forged. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1937.57s">In</a>  Medford and in all communities, we need to continually address the systematic issues that can erode the people's trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1945.296s">We're</a>  trying to do that through our advocacy on many different issues, including the MUP grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1951.685s">including</a>  transit, development, and the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1955.209s">We</a>  need to lift up the voices of those who often go unheard and champion causes that lead to a more sustainable and powerful future. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1963.018s">Embracing</a>  Dr. King's leadership and ideals will help us take accountability and honor his legacy and reach those lofty goals of unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1971.55s">I</a>  look forward to the conversation today, to hear everyone talk about their experiences with Dr. King and his message. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1976.995s">It</a>  has had a profound impact on so many and has helped shape so much of what we are trying to do here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1984.082s">It's</a>  truly special to be able to come together, reflect on the life of Dr. King, and speak on the shared experiences we have dealing with diversity, social equity, and building a foundation of trust in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=1997.017s">Thank</a>  you again to everybody who made this happen, who's here today, who's watching from home.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2010.004s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2013.787s">And</a>  now a song by someone who really needs no introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2018.069s">We're</a>  proud to present our own Stacey Clayton to share the wonderful ode to sacrificial love, Bridge Over Trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2057.551s">Thank</a>  you, thank you so much for having me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2060.535s">I'm</a>  so looking forward to sharing with you.</p>

    <p>[Clayton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2107.688s">When</a>  you're weary and feeling small, when tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2132.482s">I'm</a>  on your side Yeah, when times get rough And friends just can't be found Like a bridge over troubled waters <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2158.719s">I</a>  will lay me down like a bridge over troubled water. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2168.67s">I</a>  will lay me down. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2188.91s">When</a>  you're down and out When you're on the street When evening falls so hard I will comfort you I'll take your part <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2218.445s">when</a>  the darkness come and pain is all around like a bridge over troubled water <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2239.376s">I</a>  will lay me down like a bridge over troubled water. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2251.189s">I</a>  will lay me down. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2294.205s">Your</a>  time has come to shine All your dreams are on their way See how they shine <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2314.2s">And</a>  if you need a friend I'm sailing right behind Like a bridge over troubled waters I will ease your mind Like a bridge <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2340.597s">Over</a>  troubled waters, I will ease your mind.</p>

    <p>[IByfBf6FgY8_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2390.065s">Okay,</a>  all right, let it marinate. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2393.386s">Let</a>  it marinate, let it get into you a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2400.348s">She</a>  always delivers, am I right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2402.129s">All</a>  right, very good.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2413.232s">So</a>  Dr. King was many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2416.433s">Among</a>  them, <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2417.766s">brilliant</a>  theologian, educated right here in the Bay State. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2422.288s">And</a>  I'm sure that the vapors have been caught by everyone with regard to the embrace, the monumental statue that's on Boston Common now, which is emblematic of the embrace that he and Coretta Scott King had when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2445.424s">So</a>  hopefully, you all get a chance to see it at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2450.346s">I've</a>  only seen it from a distance, perhaps like most of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2453.848s">And</a>  to me, it's magnificent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2456.409s">And</a>  I know art is very subjective. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2459.05s">But</a>  in my mind, it's just a wonderful tribute really to love, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2470.115s">Among</a>  Dr. King's many writings, the sober and compelling <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2474.327s">letter</a>  from Birmingham jail remains a most instructive message of why we must continue to actively and non-violently pursue his goals of racial equality and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2490.062s">Now</a>  that letter is about 17 pages long and would take about an hour to read in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2501.153s">I've</a>  enlisted my daughter, Maya N. Carter, a stage actor working in Brooklyn, New York, and beyond, to assist me in presenting an abbreviated version of Dr. King's Timeless Reflection. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2514.686s">We</a>  urge you to have a listen, and later, to read the letter in its complete and original form. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2523.374s">It's</a>  going to take a little bit, a little minute for us to stage this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2532.867s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2568.894s">Letter</a>  from Birmingham Jail by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2573.936s">16th</a>  April 1963. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2579.157s">My</a>  dear fellow clergymen.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2582.178s">While</a>  confined here in the Birmingham City Jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities unwise and untimely. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2592.769s">Seldom</a>  do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2596.792s">If</a>  I sought to answer all the criticisms that crossed my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2606.358s">And</a>  I would have no time for constructive work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2609.98s">Several</a>  months ago, the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct action program if such were deemed necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2621.791s">We</a>  readily consented, and when the hour came, we lived up to our promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2627.757s">So</a>  I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2635.665s">I</a>  am here because I have organizational ties here.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2641.811s">But</a>  more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2646.982s">Just</a>  as the prophets of the 8th century BC left their villages and carried their thus saith the Lord far beyond the boundaries of their hometowns and just as the apostle Paul left his village in Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my hometown.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2672.794s">Moreover,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2674.032s">I</a>  am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2679.954s">I</a>  cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned with what happens in Birmingham. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2687.117s">Injustice</a>  anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2692.519s">We</a>  are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2701.762s">Whatever</a>  affects one directly <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2704.161s">affects</a>  all indirectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2707.402s">Never</a>  again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial, outside agitator idea.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2715.926s">In</a>  any nonviolent campaign, there are four basic steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2720.227s">Collection</a>  of the facts to determine whether injustices exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2724.669s">Negotiation,</a>  self-purification, and direct action. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2730.091s">We</a>  have gone through all the steps in Birmingham. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2733.396s">There</a>  can be no gain saying that the fact racial injustice engulfs this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2739.979s">Its</a>  ugly record of brutality is widely known. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2743.48s">There</a>  have been unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham more than in any other city in the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nzT0OcLHmhc&t=2751.603s">These</a>  are the hard, brutal facts of the case.</p>
