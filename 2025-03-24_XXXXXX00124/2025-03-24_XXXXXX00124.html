    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=2.866">All</a>  right, thanks so much for being here with me today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=5.593">If</a>  you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=10.827">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=11.268">Thanks</a>  for having me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=12.769">Tara</a>  Gearheart and she and her and we are Medford residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=18.896">We've</a>  been here since 2008 and really love in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=24.522">We,</a>  you know, live in by car park in the Fulton Heights area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=29.607">And</a>  I own team media consulting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=33.311">I</a>  live with my husband and three kids and two dogs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=38.714">We</a>  just recently started a pierogi business called Bob's Cheese Pierogies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=44.257">That's</a>  a little bit about us.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=47.918">Great</a>  summary. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=49.319">We'll</a>  get a lot more into some of those topics in a minute. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=51.64">But</a>  before we do that, I just want to ask you the question that is critically important to the podcast that we ask everybody, but what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=62.427">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=62.887">I</a>  mean, this is a loaded question, because there's like, it's a tie between two places, depending on the mood that we like, but our old school, and kind of our always go to is Bocelli's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=74.796">And</a>  I'm a big fan of their pesto fagioli soup and stuffed artichoke would be like the two go to things there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=84.462">But</a>  most recently, Alta Cooper, just because I love that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=92.154">cuisine.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=92.854">And</a>  yeah, when I go there, we get tostadas, nachos and all the delicious things that they serve. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=99.417">So</a>  and can't forget a margarita.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=101.718">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=104.039">You</a>  know, people mention Bachelor's all the time, and I've never been there, but I got to try it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=108.941">Yeah,</a>  it's, it's like an old school fan favorite. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=111.862">Nick,</a>  Nick was the owner. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=114.363">I</a>  think there's been a new ownership over the last couple years, but it was a family run business there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=120.205">So</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=120.832">actually</a>  a couple of, I wanna say a couple of the daughters live here and they also go to the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=128.674">So</a>  it's fun to see when back in pre-kids, when we didn't even have kids, my husband and I would post up at the bar and the daughters would wait on us when they were in their 20s. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=139.816">And</a>  now it's like, we're all living our mom lives and dropping our kids off at school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=143.737">And</a>  we're like, my, we just look at each other and we're like, my, how things have changed 20 years later.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=149.678">Oh,</a>  pre-kids.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=151.119">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=152.9">We</a>  can't even remember the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=154.321">It's</a>  like far away.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=156.502">Yeah,</a>  awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=158.663">So</a>  yeah, I'm hoping you could share with us a little bit about your business. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=162.626">I</a>  think last weekend we had the opportunity to come to the pop-up, your perogie pop-up at Redford Brewing, which is amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=168.649">So</a>  if you could tell us a little bit about kind of like how you've arrived at this point in your business.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=173.612">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=174.553">Yeah,</a>  so I, I like to say our perogie business kind of came out of private beta into public beta this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=182.404">So</a>  the concept started, my husband and I, we actually met in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=188.992">I</a>  was a waitress and he was a line cook back at Papa T's restaurant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=193.595">Shout</a>  out if you ever visit Yukon Dairy Farm. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=196.376">There's</a>  a nice little Italian spot right off the highway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=199.738">It</a>  was both of our second jobs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=206.342">He's</a>  a great cook. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=207.263">I</a>  swear in another life he was probably a chef at some point just because he has a natural knack for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=213.147">cooking</a>  everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=215.208">I</a>  have a few things that I'm really good at cooking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=218.59">One</a>  is pierogies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=220.912">But</a>  that was not something that came natural. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=224.655">Joe's</a>  grandmother, who the company is actually named after. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=227.757">So</a>  Joe's Polish and his family's Polish. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=231.76">And</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=233.981">You</a>  know, I've known Joe and his family probably like 25 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=237.964">And</a>  when I first met his grandmother, she was, she was like the sweetest lady. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=243.387">She</a>  celebrated 100 years of life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=246.389">She</a>  passed away in 2024. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=248.83">But</a>  one of her biggest passions was cooking pierogies, golumpkis, traditional Polish foods. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=257.276">And</a>  as someone who just loves a little stuffed empanada or pasta or anything like that, truthfully, I had never had pierogies before I met Joe and his grandma and his family. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=275.593">Over</a>  the years, this is her recipe, but it was actually her grandmother's recipe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=281.455">This</a>  recipe has been in the family for over 100 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=288.257">When</a>  she would come up and visit us, again, before kids and then obviously with kids, we would spend a day with his mom and Babchi. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=300.477">We</a>  would clear the kitchen and we would get all the ingredients. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=305.703">It</a>  was a process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=307.104">We</a>  would spend six hours peroguing, making the dough, rolling the dough, stuffing, boiling, buttering, packaging, sautéing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=318.597">It</a>  was a thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=321.87">And</a>  it's a very fond memory, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=324.331">And</a>  so when we were thinking of side hustles, as we always do, I like to consider myself a little bit of an entrepreneurial mind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=336.207">thinking</a>  of, okay, what are the things that we love to do, but that also make people happy, right, is like figuring out food and good food and, you know, a way to connect community and really getting back to kind of those like family values of sitting and having a meal with somebody, right, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=355.593">technology</a>  is amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=357.274">We're</a>  filming right now on the zoom doing a podcast, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=361.338">But</a>  there also is a lot of things where we're like, Hey, if we just take 20 or 30 minutes and stop down and have a good meal together and share, you know, some stories and chit chat, like, you know, that's, so that's kind of where it started is, is, is that and so the company's named after her and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=383.62">We</a>  now cook out of a kitchen, a commercial kitchen in Stoneham, so Food Revolution. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=390.622">And</a>  the owner over there, it's women-owned. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=394.343">And</a>  even though Bob's Cheese is family-owned, technically, like on the LLC paperwork, I do most of the cooking at this point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=404.926">And</a>  so we made a good connection with a couple of the other <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=409.547">chefs</a>  over there that are have their own businesses, a lot of being women led. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=415.589">So</a>  it's really kind of evolved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=418.809">I</a>  will say it's snowballed faster, really, than I thought it would, which is sometimes how these things work, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=426.091">You're</a>  just like, you have this idea and you're just like, I think this is going to be really great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=433.973">And</a>  it ends up working out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=435.833">And</a>  then you're like, oh, my gosh, I now need to like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=438.875">keep</a>  the train moving. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=440.196">So</a>  that's kind of the position that we're in right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=442.778">But</a>  we're loving it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=443.499">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=443.859">So</a>  we're trying to scale slow on purpose. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=447.622">You</a>  know, we are cooking on the weekends right now for to make orders for pickup for fresh. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=454.968">We're</a>  doing pop up events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=457.69">And</a>  then we'll probably be at some farmers markets this summer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=461.493">And</a>  then next year, depending on how things go, we'll look to do our wholesale license and then get into some boutique food shops. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=470.878">But</a>  honestly, that's a whole other animal that I'm not ready to wrap my head around yet.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=479.203">I</a>  really like that story. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=480.864">What</a>  I appreciate about it is that you talked about how food has sort of helped connect the generations in your family, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=489.09">That</a>  you sit down to a meal with your daughters and you can tell them this is something your dad's grandmother, who's no longer here, this was important to her and this is like a story of her family, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=499.838">and</a>  I think like especially at a time like this when we're talking about in like you know in our world where there's just like so much happening with like different cultures and um different ideas about belonging right that like this is such an important message for our kids um and a place like Medford you mentioned Altacuba and you mentioned like and we have a new um pub in the square right these are like cultures that people that their families are bringing to our city right and so um <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=526.698">It</a>  seems like it's a simple thing to make a pierogi. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=529.579">I'm</a>  sure it's not simple. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=531.0">I'm</a>  sure it's complicated practice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=532.681">But</a>  there's so much value to what you're doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=536.202">And</a>  I guess I wonder what your hope is in terms of an impact of the work that you're doing on our city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=544.762">Yeah,</a>  so I mean, that's like, we have an arm of the business, which is like philanthropic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=552.634">So</a>  something that was instilled from like, my grandfather, and you know, even Joe's family is like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=560.365">Um,</a>  and I own another, uh, business. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=563.548">My,</a>  I call it like my day job is, um, I own a marketing agency, uh, team media consulting, and our tagline is grow your business and grow your community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=573.317">And</a>  we celebrated 10 years last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=576.7">And</a>  one of like the milestones that we hit as an organization, as an <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=580.964">as</a>  that company was, is we've donated over $75,000 in the past decade to various charities in various communities, not only in the state of Massachusetts, but also where our clients reside. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=594.657">So</a>  one of the one of the, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=599.237">Kind</a>  of discussions for that business is if you engage us for services for execution Part of your retainer contract goes to a charity of your choice And if you don't have a charity of your choice, we pick a local charity here in Massachusetts and that ranges from pan mass challenge to national braille press for blind literacy that just because you're visually impaired and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=621.513">It</a>  doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to have independence and learn literacy and reading, because reading is fundamental to life, essentially. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=630.136">So</a>  when we were building out the pierogi business, philanthropy is a very strong foundation and cornerstone of the pierogi business as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=640.499">And</a>  we call it pierogies for a purpose, is the arm of that business. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=645.221">And</a>  so as an example, last week at the pop-up when we were at Medford Brewing, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=651.003">It</a>  was going into St. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=651.864">Patrick's</a>  Day weekend were members of the St. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=656.469">Francis</a>  and St. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=657.53">Joseph's</a>  Church in Massachusetts are in in Medford, and so they're part of affiliated with like the Mary Karina parish. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=667.825">uh,</a>  you know, foundation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=669.566">And</a>  so we did $1 from every order was donated to there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=674.229">We</a>  thankfully, and thanks to everybody that came out and, um, enjoyed our pierogies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=679.152">We</a>  really appreciate you and the church appreciates you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=681.494">So</a>  we were able to donate a hundred dollars, um, to the church from one from the a hundred orders that we send. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=686.997">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=688.817">it</a>  is one of those things where like, we call to the community kind of like, how can we impact, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=697.242">Like</a>  where we live is where so many things start, but if we're not also, you know, we can scale as large as we want, hopefully, but like to us, that means really nothing unless we're really giving back and supporting to the people that are truly, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=717.608">at</a>  the roots, like supporting our business too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=720.269">And</a>  that starts with home and our town. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=723.13">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=726.492">And</a>  so one of the other things too, is we're in the second year of our scholarship on, um, the team media business where we, um, this, my, my grandfather on my side, um, was an inventor and, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=739.078">has</a>  a few patents, one being, if you ever go to the auto aftermarket, there's a product called Fuels Duals, and if you dump it into your gas tank, it extends the life of your gas mileage. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=753.93">And</a>  so this was something as a child, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=757.154">We</a>  have very fond memories of him mixing up these solutions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=762.759">You</a>  would open the refrigerator in summertime, and there would be a gallon bottle that is like, do not drink this, because he was testing solutions for how to extend gas sustainability for mileage. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=783.218">So</a>  one of the things that our family, my sister and a few of my cousins, we started under Team Media where we do a $2,500 scholarship to graduating senior, where they are responsible for, and so this is the second year, we're super excited. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=800.571">Last</a>  year was kind of like our honorary year that we did that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=805.295">And</a>  this year we changed up the submissions, but it's basically like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=810.65">submit</a>  your story and a thousand words on an invention or a concept of how you're going to impact your community and also like kind of change the world, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=820.074">Like,</a>  and that could be through either social growth concepts or actual physical products. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=827.277">So,</a>  so that's one way we're giving back to the community and Bobshys Perogies is ultimately going to follow that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=835.44">We</a>  are, we are still startups, so we don't have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=838.215">like</a>  the funding level yet to procure a program like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=841.718">But</a>  I'm hopeful in the next couple of years that we'll be able to create a scholarship program for graduating seniors coming out of Medford High School that are getting into the trades, meaning if they want to work with their hands or in the culinary industry, so we can tie it back to, again, food to table, farm to table, community connection and conversation.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=866.562">Do</a>  you remember what the invention was for the winner last year?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=869.784">Yeah,</a>  so she actually, these twin sisters, they were phenomenal submissions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=877.029">We</a>  got really good submissions, but they actually had a garden, like a growth, a food sustainability to end <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=887.567">work</a>  to end hunger in the town of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=890.169">And</a>  so they have a whole ecosystem at their house where they basically farm and produce food and then drop it at the kitchen in the center of town, that food pantry in the center of town. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=902.898">And</a>  some <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=904.888">In</a>  the midst of being top of their class and getting amazing grades and working full-time jobs and going to school full-time, they spent their free time really curating this program of food sustainability for not just canned goods, but actually fresh foods. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=922.972">So</a>  it was really, really amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=925.692">So</a>  I actually, I emailed her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=928.593">the</a>  other day, because her first year is coming to an end. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=933.276">She</a>  ended up getting a scholarship to Harvard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=935.618">And</a>  so luckily, she stayed local. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=938.18">And</a>  I was like, hey, if you're home for the summer, we'd like an update on how the first year went. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=942.984">But</a>  our babysitter, who is a graduating senior this year, who was a junior classmate with her last year, said that she's heard that, obviously, they're doing very well at Harvard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=955.393">But</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=957.574">It</a>  was it was really, like I said, it's those types of stories where you're just like, okay, to be 18 and that focused and that able to, to do all of those things is unbelievable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=972.008">So</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=973.117">Wow,</a>  you must. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=973.918">That's</a>  kind of how I feel about these podcasts, just getting to hear all the really cool stuff people are doing and that you must get to hear some cool stories with those submissions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=982.706">Yeah,</a>  it's really awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=984.508">And</a>  then all of that just revives the... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=989.432">the</a>  excitement and the, honestly, the hope, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=993.236">At</a>  the end of the day, you're just like, we hope that we can move forward and do hard things and think outside the box and become really cool and clever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iuMrueIoEwFQpcz5YuKZO?t=1007.288">And</a>  it's really nice to see that come to fruition in so many ways in various youth settings.</p>
