[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a nice packet.

[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

33
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Here I thought I had everybody.

34
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:46,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

35
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:47,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van der Kloot.

36
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:47,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

37
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:49,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Longo-Khan.

39
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,402
[SPEAKER_07]: We could all rise to salute the flag.

40
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:12,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

41
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:25,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent or Mr. Murphy, if you want to lead us off.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,141
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say good evening to everyone.

43
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:32,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm really excited about beginning this new budget process this year.

44
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:42,768
[SPEAKER_17]: As you all have received your wonderful packets in terms of how the budget is organized this year in terms of

45
00:03:43,428 --> 00:03:52,091
[SPEAKER_17]: clarity and really being able to understand where the district is, the direction that the district would like to be moving forward in.

46
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:57,072
[SPEAKER_17]: So I really want to thank Mr. Murphy and the administrators.

47
00:03:57,252 --> 00:04:02,834
[SPEAKER_17]: All the teams have been meeting, having their administrative meetings, but I just want to say thank you.

48
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:15,208
[SPEAKER_17]: to Mr. Murphy, Michelle Kingdon and the members of his team for really working tirelessly to get this to you at this point in time.

49
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:20,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Today we're going to be starting off with elementary schools and secondary schools.

50
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:35,070
[SPEAKER_17]: As you know, the principals worked together and worked collaboratively because as a school district, our first priority is educating students and prioritizing students.

51
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:41,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone is important, but we felt that it was definitely important to start with

52
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:49,482
[SPEAKER_17]: our elementary and secondary schools to lay the foundation for our budget process.

53
00:04:50,182 --> 00:05:02,549
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I want to send a thanks in advance to Dave and the team for all the work that they've been putting into this presentation that you're going to see this evening.

54
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:07,372
[SPEAKER_17]: And the beginnings of identifying our priorities

55
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:11,074
[SPEAKER_17]: to continue to move Medford forward.

56
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:17,139
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe that it will be a very comprehensive presentation.

57
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,340
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:27,286
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to pass the baton to Mr. Murphy and members of his team and the administrators that will be presented this evening.

59
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:27,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

60
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Benson.

61
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:35,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just echo what the superintendent said with regard to our gratitude to

62
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:49,569
[SPEAKER_10]: The school leaders who are on the call this evening and the other members, particularly Michelle Kingdon, the comptroller of the district who works on the finance and operations team.

63
00:05:49,629 --> 00:06:02,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say works on, but for those who know Michelle and knows the work that she does previously for the city of Medford and now for the Medford public schools, she certainly does more than just work on our team.

64
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:11,667
[SPEAKER_10]: to her and to Janine Camuso, our Director of Human Resources, and always an important part of everything we do when we present.

65
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:17,211
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no, we can't talk about the budget without talking about the people that are in the budget.

66
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,292
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the nature of school systems.

67
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:32,241
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's both, that's challenging at times, but also it helps to remind us, I think, that while we're talking in terms of dollars and cents, we're also talking about

68
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:46,724
[SPEAKER_10]: hundreds of people who are the servants of the people of Medford and work every day to try to advance our mission and our singular mission of creating educational opportunities for students.

69
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:54,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll just say that and there'll be other opportunities to sort of talk about what this budget means over the next several weeks as we put it together.

70
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:58,630
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to start with that because as a reminder that

71
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:16,485
[SPEAKER_10]: As we get sort of lost in spreadsheets and tables and things like that, all of the decisions that are before the school committee and the work that the administration is doing right now, at the end of the day, the end result of that and the product is happening in classrooms across all of our schools.

72
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:22,350
[SPEAKER_10]: So our presentation tonight is focused on elementary and secondary schools.

73
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,195
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford Public Schools are comprised of many different departments and areas with different focal points.

74
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,199
[SPEAKER_10]: The heart of the work and where the work really takes place are within our school communities.

75
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:44,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're joined by the principals of all of our elementary and high schools, save for the Curtis Tufts High School, which will be part of our presentation, along with the rest of pupil services on Thursday.

76
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:49,123
[SPEAKER_10]: And also Dr. Cushing and Ms.

77
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:58,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Galussi, the head of secondary and elementary education, respectively, will be taking us through some of the high-level strategic priorities that have been identified

78
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:04,971
[SPEAKER_10]: by our teams as we've convened over the last several months to talk about FY 22.

79
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:17,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So before starting with elementary and before turning it over to Suzanne, I think the mayor and the superintendent have both referenced the documents that have been provided to the school committee.

80
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:26,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna share my screen momentarily just for the benefit of members of the community who might be joining this conversation tonight.

81
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:42,021
[SPEAKER_10]: The school committee knows that we've been engaged in this conversation and preparing for the FY 22 budget as early as February, as we started to identify the different variables and some of the question marks related both to our internal and external funding sources.

82
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:51,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we pick up on that conversation, and just to be clear, all the documents that were made available to the school committee will also, of course, be available to the community.

83
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:57,590
[SPEAKER_10]: and will be published on our website so people can peruse them as we go through the various steps of the budget process.

84
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:11,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So on that note, and again, for the school committee's sake, this is the same content you've received just in a PowerPoint format for people that are watching at home.

85
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,877
[SPEAKER_10]: We've talked a lot about the different sequencing of the budget process.

86
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:19,438
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is the flowchart that you saw at our last budget update.

87
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:23,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a simplified version sharing where we are now.

88
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:34,601
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are developing the superintendent's recommendation leading to the budget hearings, which will ultimately go to the municipal government to function as the district's budgetary request.

89
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:46,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I said in my memo to the school committee, and I want to reiterate the first of two major process questions that, and we talked a little bit about this at our meeting on April 26th, where,

90
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,263
[SPEAKER_10]: folks have been asking, well, what is the budget number?

91
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:57,386
[SPEAKER_10]: The budget is really developed along two lanes, and they're both very legitimate and very important lanes.

92
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:06,829
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are times, I think, when people that are participating are only familiar with one or the other, and it can become confusing.

93
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:17,053
[SPEAKER_10]: So in one lane, the school administration is meeting every day, identifying priorities, identifying efficiencies, and determining

94
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:22,054
[SPEAKER_10]: how we can make the most of the investment that the Medford community makes in its public school system.

95
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:29,257
[SPEAKER_10]: That turns into our recommendations to the school committee, who in turn take a vote and make that request of the municipal government.

96
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:38,119
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, the municipal government is responsible for the funding priorities across the city, both in the school system and elsewhere.

97
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And so ultimately they are going to make a determination as to what can be appropriated.

98
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,885
[SPEAKER_10]: And just in the last several hours, we've received more information about that and that we'll be in a position to speak to at our next budget meeting.

99
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:57,450
[SPEAKER_10]: That number very well may be less than the number that the school committee ultimately requests.

100
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:10,479
[SPEAKER_10]: The school administration's job, as we sit at the nexus of those two lanes, is to identify not just the priorities and needs to inform the school committee as to what should be the basis of the request for funding,

101
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:19,365
[SPEAKER_10]: but also we are responsible for developing the contingencies necessary to operate the school district with whatever appropriation is ultimately made.

102
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:36,975
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not to say we don't advocate or we don't attempt to inform or try to make sure that the community has as much information as possible, but everyone should understand that we are responsible both for identifying the needs of the district and articulating them and operating the district based on the appropriation that becomes available.

103
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:40,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one of two significant process issues that was addressed in the documents

104
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:46,438
[SPEAKER_10]: that went to you, but just for purpose of clarity, I wanted to reiterate that at the outset of tonight's conversation.

105
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:47,799
[SPEAKER_10]: You've seen this before.

106
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:53,643
[SPEAKER_10]: These are our funding sources, the federal, state, local, and obviously much more federal funding than normal this year.

107
00:11:54,544 --> 00:12:10,014
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the priorities that staff members, as we were developing these goals and objectives going into the new fiscal year, talking about how do we repair, rebuild, and remediate the issues and challenges caused by the enormous disruption that our students have faced.

108
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,353
[SPEAKER_10]: over the course of the last two school years.

109
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:16,794
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're looking at those primarily in three sort of umbrella buckets.

110
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:21,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Personnel and staffing, materials and infrastructure, and training and professional development.

111
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:27,557
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are themes that we do have a miscellaneous category as well, but that's sort of like the leftovers category in Jeopardy.

112
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:31,338
[SPEAKER_10]: It's anything that doesn't quite fit into one of the previous categories.

113
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:36,299
[SPEAKER_10]: So you should see those common threads as we articulate these priorities this evening.

114
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,989
[SPEAKER_10]: You've seen this before as well, just articulating that further.

115
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,391
[SPEAKER_10]: You've seen this as well.

116
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,892
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we presented on April 26th.

117
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:59,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it's important as you look at this to understand that when we say the district will require somewhere between $3.4 and $5.8 million over and above what our FY21 operating budget is, there are two significant variables.

118
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:01,923
[SPEAKER_10]: One is there are external funding sources.

119
00:13:03,712 --> 00:13:05,673
[SPEAKER_10]: which will ease this in some respect.

120
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:11,375
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know to what extent that's, and we have to in many cases prepare for the worst, but that's one piece.

121
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:25,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the second piece is understanding that the second obligation of the school administration that I spoke to earlier, which is that whatever that appropriation is, whatever appropriation is made, we are responsible for educating 4,000 students.

122
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we also, we have a responsibility to articulate what will put us in the best position to do that.

123
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:42,254
[SPEAKER_10]: But regardless of what the appropriation is, we have to be open for business on July 1st, prepared for our summer programming and getting ready for the large influx of students who will come in the fall.

124
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:58,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, this is the second process issue that I wanted to just briefly touch upon before asking Suzanne to walk us through some of the high-level priorities that will be featured in our elementary school communities in FY22.

125
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,900
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is this variable around the ESSER funding.

126
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,861
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the federal funding coming in to help school districts mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

127
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:13,743
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I said in the memo, there are sort of two schools of thought with regard to this ESSER funding.

128
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:24,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will say that the conversation that's taking place in Medford, based on my conversation with counterparts across the Commonwealth, is a conversation that's taking place in virtually every city and town in every school district.

129
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:28,127
[SPEAKER_10]: And theory one on the ESSER funds is that

130
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:35,738
[SPEAKER_10]: There are deficits across every municipality and the ESSER funds must be incorporated into the operating budget to help the school system function.

131
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:36,999
[SPEAKER_10]: That's theory one.

132
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:45,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Theory two is that the school districts have taken a disproportionate hit with regard to our mission and our ability to function from the pandemic.

133
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:55,706
[SPEAKER_10]: And therefore the ESSER funds should essentially be walled off and kept to specific COVID related initiatives and not considered part of the operating budget.

134
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And part of that theory also

135
00:14:57,557 --> 00:15:07,266
[SPEAKER_10]: is that to do otherwise would create fiscal cliffs and structural deficits, because we know the ESSER funding will eventually dry up and will not be with us in perpetuity.

136
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:18,476
[SPEAKER_10]: And the problem, as I stated in my communication to the school committee, with adopting one of those two positions wholesale is that ultimately they're somewhat untenable.

137
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:23,320
[SPEAKER_10]: The flaw in the first theory is that the ESSER funding, unlike the ARPA funding,

138
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:31,391
[SPEAKER_10]: is specifically specific in ARPA funding, meaning the American Rescue Plan Act, which is funding that's going more broadly to cities and towns.

139
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:41,236
[SPEAKER_10]: The ESSER funding does contemplate the disproportionate impact on students and the disruption that has been felt by students from the pandemic.

140
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:44,758
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the rationale and the theory behind the ESSER funding.

141
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:52,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And so to just consider that part of the overall wave of education funding does a disservice to that fact.

142
00:15:53,708 --> 00:16:11,479
[SPEAKER_10]: The flaw with the second theory of building the wall around ESSER funding as if it could not be used for anything that could be considered an operating expense is that ultimately, when you'll see as we talk about our priorities, operating expenses and expenses related to COVID ultimately collide.

143
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,662
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is inevitably overlap and integration between those two.

144
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:21,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And for that reason, to think of it completely segregated would also be misleading.

145
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,187
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, you'll see some of those cases here.

146
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:44,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And just with regard to structural deficits, which are absolutely something that we always have to keep in mind when we draw these distinctions between one time and recurring funds, there are challenges we are facing right now, and you'll hear from Suzanne and Peter about some of the specific ones at their respective levels, that are absolutely attributable to the pandemic.

147
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:52,072
[SPEAKER_10]: And they may well outlive the timeline of the ESSER funding.

148
00:16:52,753 --> 00:17:05,722
[SPEAKER_10]: But we as the educational leaders in the community feels that we have an obligation to address them as best as possible with the understanding that we are on the clock for determining how these will be sustainable.

149
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,485
[SPEAKER_10]: That may involve finding efficiencies within the school system.

150
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:17,591
[SPEAKER_10]: It may occur based on revenues ultimately returning to some semblance of normalcy.

151
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,612
[SPEAKER_10]: it may be that they are in fact unsustainable.

152
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:35,081
[SPEAKER_10]: But if something's unsustainable three or four years from now, we are not in a position to condemn our current students to continue to live through those challenges, particularly after the disproportionate impact that they have absorbed over the course of the last two years.

153
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:45,128
[SPEAKER_10]: So my recommendation as the financial advisor to the school committee is to be mindful of the need for pragmatism

154
00:17:45,801 --> 00:18:07,117
[SPEAKER_10]: both with respect to how ESSER funding will help us advance some of our operational priorities, and understanding that some of these challenges are absolutely related to COVID, excuse me, to the educational disruption caused by COVID, and we have a responsibility to address them, and we have a responsibility to address them with a great sense of urgency.

155
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:14,542
[SPEAKER_10]: As those who are joining us tonight who work in schools, help and run schools, and at sometimes, especially this year,

156
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:18,840
[SPEAKER_10]: are in classrooms covering it for various absences.

157
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,740
[SPEAKER_10]: They know that better than anyone.

158
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, we are going to move to our elementary program.

159
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:27,382
[SPEAKER_10]: And Ms.

160
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:37,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Galusi, our assistant superintendent for elementary education, is going to talk a little bit about some of the high level and district-wide priorities and objectives in the FY22 budget.

161
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:43,945
[SPEAKER_10]: She is joined this evening by our elementary school leaders, all of whom are here.

162
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:58,459
[SPEAKER_10]: But for purposes of not wanting to keep the school committee up too late this evening, they have decided, as have the secondary principals, to have one representative of the principals speak on their behalf, along with Ms.

163
00:18:58,499 --> 00:18:58,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Colucci.

164
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:03,982
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Suzanne, if you want to take it from there and talk a little bit about our elementary level FY22 priorities.

165
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:06,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, perfect.

166
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,657
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a wonderful segue, Mr. Murphy.

167
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:09,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

168
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:22,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Before I start talking about the elementary school principals, I'm just going to introduce the elementary representative that will be speaking on behalf of the principals and that is Mr. Kirk Johnson.

169
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:28,906
[SPEAKER_18]: If he could just unmute for a minute just to address the school committee.

170
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:32,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Once that happens, I will move on to the elementary school priorities.

171
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:35,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening everyone.

172
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:38,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening Mayor, good evening school committee and Dr. Vincent.

173
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the opportunity to introduce the elementary portion of the FY22 budget.

174
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,362
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of phases that led us to tonight's meeting.

175
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:54,566
[SPEAKER_00]: The first phase of the process involved the fall elementary principals meeting together to discuss the needs of our buildings.

176
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:58,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Through our discussion, the priorities of our schools are very similar.

177
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:04,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Majority of discussion revolved around the impact that COVID-19 has placed on our students.

178
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,301
[SPEAKER_00]: The second phase of the process involved a meeting with Ms.

179
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:13,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Galusi to review the highlights of our meeting and to discuss what we gauged as our priorities.

180
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:20,471
[SPEAKER_00]: The next phase of the process was to complete a budget survey for Mr. Murphy that pertained directly to our individual schools.

181
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:27,682
[SPEAKER_00]: The final phase of the process was a meeting with Mr. Murphy to fine tune any errors of the budget and to allow a time for Q&A.

182
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:36,926
[SPEAKER_00]: As the elementary representative, I want to thank all of you for your countless hours and the many efforts you provide in supporting the students of the Medford Public Schools.

183
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:37,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

184
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

185
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,886
[SPEAKER_18]: So a result of that collaborative process are the key priorities that we have displayed here.

186
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,648
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just going to explain each one of them.

187
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,590
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there are any questions, just please let me know.

188
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:59,936
[SPEAKER_18]: So the first key priority at the elementary level is grade level paraprofessionals to ensure more inclusive programming.

189
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:07,722
[SPEAKER_18]: That is just to ensure the needs of students and to support them next year, no matter the setting.

190
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:18,250
[SPEAKER_18]: So these are grade level paraprofessionals that could be supporting students in special education, but also supporting students in general education.

191
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:27,176
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that students are going to have needs that are academic as well as social emotional, and having some additional support next year will be very instrumental.

192
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:30,539
[SPEAKER_18]: The next piece is the reading intervention specialist.

193
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:37,385
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we know will be needed next year is a little bit more support in terms of intervention.

194
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:45,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Having additional reading interventionists, especially to target those foundational years that were interrupted

195
00:21:45,411 --> 00:21:46,333
[SPEAKER_18]: two years in a row.

196
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:59,872
[SPEAKER_18]: So what would be next year's second grade and third grade will be really key in making sure that we are giving the interventions and the supports to students that are having a little bit more difficulty closing that gap.

197
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:07,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Building-based professional development, that's something that I'm really excited to see part of the budget this year.

198
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:18,894
[SPEAKER_18]: As you know, it's something that's important for principals to be able to have some professional development funding in every year, but especially coming out of COVID.

199
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:22,335
[SPEAKER_18]: This will allow principals to be able to use some funding

200
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:35,432
[SPEAKER_18]: that will specifically target some training and professional development within their school buildings, which will be a little bit more drilled down and focused than district-wide professional development.

201
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:39,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Increased adjustment Councilor services.

202
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:48,729
[SPEAKER_18]: So in my work with Stacey Shulman and in speaking with her, this is something that she's also looking to do, which she'll probably report to you on later on in the week.

203
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:57,756
[SPEAKER_18]: What she's doing right now is she's reevaluating the support levels at each and every school and going to make sure that they are streamed line for support.

204
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,888
[SPEAKER_18]: instituting additional specials programming responsive to COVID-19.

205
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:12,792
[SPEAKER_18]: So as you're aware, Italian is no more, and at the elementary level, we will be needing a fifth special.

206
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:20,776
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, we were able to... Just to be clear, the fifth, the elementary class Italian previously offered in Medford is no more.

207
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:24,438
[SPEAKER_10]: The Italian language still exists, at least.

208
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:26,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

209
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:32,916
[SPEAKER_10]: People pick up the conversation halfway through that could be, you know.

210
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:34,332
[SPEAKER_18]: You are correct.

211
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:46,876
[SPEAKER_18]: So this year it was not a factor in terms of scheduling for students within buildings because of the remote academy and we were able to staff remote academy specialists.

212
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:52,959
[SPEAKER_18]: And that way students were able to get what they need and the schedule in the buildings were able to proceed.

213
00:23:53,279 --> 00:24:00,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Next year in response to everything that is happening, I am also working with Stacey Shulman as well as some principals.

214
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:02,762
[SPEAKER_18]: And we are going to be working on a fifth special

215
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:08,124
[SPEAKER_18]: that will target specifically the COVID related needs of students.

216
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:19,548
[SPEAKER_18]: That means we are looking to make sure that we are supporting students' social emotional needs, health needs, and executive functioning needs.

217
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:27,111
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the things this year that I've tried to really make a priority is getting to the schools and speaking with students and speaking with staff.

218
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:32,975
[SPEAKER_18]: I also surveyed staff in regards to the fifth special and where they feel the needs are.

219
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:52,150
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was kind of overwhelming the supports that the educators feel that would benefit students next year is giving them a little bit more time focused specifically on learning and academics so that the SEL needs are continuing throughout the entire day.

220
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:56,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Also with a little focus on executive functioning skills that may have been lost this year.

221
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:11,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Finally, the Zaner-Blauser program, which I know was presented to the school committee prior to COVID and was part of our initial budget needs before COVID hit in March, that's circling back again.

222
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:21,452
[SPEAKER_18]: As you are aware, if not, just a little refresher, Jan Hollenbeck worked with the principals and assistant principals for the past year or two.

223
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:34,676
[SPEAKER_18]: trying to get the Xenoblazer program here, which would be a focus of printing in K1 with a refresher in grade two, and a cursive writing program for grades three and four.

224
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:39,358
[SPEAKER_18]: And that covers the elementary priorities.

225
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,179
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have any questions.

226
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:50,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I think, Mayor, my recommendation would be that we move to secondary and then we take the questions sort of as a group and navigate through.

227
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:55,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to just put a few, a couple of punctuation points on the elementary stuff.

228
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:05,384
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see through this list of priorities and as they were spelled out in your packets on a school by school basis, that not every school is situated in an identical place.

229
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And our priorities essentially are meant to address that.

230
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:17,772
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some pieces like the development of a specials class to be responsive to the impact that the disruption has had, or the,

231
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:32,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I recognized need that was very much a common thread in our conversations with principals about the need for more intensive reading intervention at the elementary level coming out of these two years of disruption.

232
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:37,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are pieces that really do have to occur on a district-wide basis.

233
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,441
[SPEAKER_10]: But then there are other pieces where staffing levels are different.

234
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:48,065
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, you'll see that it is our hope to recruit and retain paraprofessional support at two of the four elementary schools.

235
00:26:48,478 --> 00:26:58,222
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because as we pick up this budget story in FY22, some of our schools have a more robust staffing in certain areas than others.

236
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:16,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And so both for purposes of making sure that we are overseeing an equitable environment in terms of our staffing structures, and also as Suzanne said, to make sure that each of our school communities are positioned to have as many students as possible in the least restrictive environments to which that they are entitled.

237
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,701
[SPEAKER_10]: these are some of the strategic decisions that we have to make.

238
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:30,663
[SPEAKER_10]: But, and in a theme that will be reoccurring throughout this evening's discussion, there are additional strategic decisions that have to be made when some of these variables are ironed out.

239
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:42,686
[SPEAKER_10]: The sort of easy example of that would be, we may identify something that is an operational priority, and so we don't intend to use ESSER funding to support that.

240
00:27:43,086 --> 00:27:47,167
[SPEAKER_10]: But if our operational funding is not sufficient to support those initiatives,

241
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:54,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And if there is, in fact, a nexus that means that we are not restricted from using that funding, then we may have to reconsider that.

242
00:27:54,659 --> 00:28:16,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is part of the complexity of this and why we need a certain level of, I would say, cognitive flexibility when it comes to figuring out how we are going to structure this and how we are going to advance these very interconnected and, in some respects, interdependent priorities and initiatives that are coming up in FY22.

243
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:28,342
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we move to secondary, and Dr. Cushing, I know, is warming up in the on-deck circle right now and ready to take some hacks to talk about our secondary priorities.

244
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:37,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll see if Mr. Tucci can hit the timer with the precision that Mr. Johnson did with regard to speaking on behalf of the secondary principals.

245
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:44,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say that one of the things, and this was addressed in the communication to you, is that it is

246
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:58,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I think impossible to look at the Medford Public Schools budget and not recognize the degree to which we are a heavily departmentalized school district, particularly for the size of this district.

247
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:08,047
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of departments, and we have a lot of money that would ordinarily be budgeted within school budgets that are living in other departmental areas.

248
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:10,749
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is particularly true at the secondary level.

249
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:37,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And so Dr. Cushing is gonna walk us through some of the secondary priorities along with Mr. Tucci, but there may be initiatives that you are familiar with from previous budget cycles or that have been discussed with the school committee and your various subcommittees that may not be explicitly addressed in some of what we're talking about tonight, but they will be addressed in our upcoming budget meetings as we get into some of those

250
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:38,883
[SPEAKER_10]: departmental budgets.

251
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,004
[SPEAKER_10]: That's certainly not a suggestion that you shouldn't ask about that.

252
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:44,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I would ask that you would, and you would pose those questions when we get to that point.

253
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:55,348
[SPEAKER_10]: But just understand that if there are things that have been common themes that you know are major priorities for the district, but are not explicitly discussed here, don't assume that we just forgot about it.

254
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:59,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, Dr. Cushing, do you want to take us through the secondary world?

255
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:00,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

256
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:01,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

257
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

258
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:08,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf of secondary education today.

259
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:21,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to take a quick moment on the eve of Teacher Appreciation Day and Teacher Appreciation Week to really give a shout out and kudos to all the Medford educators and the educators brought across Massachusetts.

260
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:30,626
[SPEAKER_14]: who have really done yeoman's work over the past year to double up iPads and computers and whatever else necessary to get our kids learning.

261
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:33,588
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'd really like to thank them for that.

262
00:30:34,568 --> 00:30:37,710
[SPEAKER_10]: On that note, I believe it's also Principal Appreciation Day.

263
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:46,515
[SPEAKER_10]: So for those of us who have principals in our lives who want... Hopefully we all remember that and have expressed that and communicated the important role that school leaders play.

264
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:47,355
[SPEAKER_10]: But I apologize for

265
00:30:47,772 --> 00:31:00,958
[SPEAKER_14]: interrupting and I that's quite all right and I would actually like to throw it to one of our stellar secondary principals Mr. Tucci at this time Mr. Tucci would you be so kind as to take it away as Mr. Johnson did.

266
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:05,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Dr. Cushing, and good evening, Madam Mayor and Medford School Committee.

267
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:14,135
[SPEAKER_01]: On behalf of the principals at the secondary level, the Medford Public Schools would like to collectively thank you for your support of our students and schools throughout the course of this school year.

268
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:18,319
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all certainly looking forward to a strong finish to the school year while planning for the next.

269
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:35,688
[SPEAKER_01]: In our budget narratives you'll find our high level strategic priorities in the area of personnel instruction materials and supplies and professional development, develop these budgetary proposals in a collaborative fashion, but the primary objective to rebuild repair and reaffirm our public education mission.

270
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:45,173
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to express our gratitude to the Medford School Committee for your leadership, support and advocacy of our students and schools.

271
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:49,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions for any of us after Dr. Cushing's presentation, please do not hesitate to ask.

272
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:50,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

273
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Mr. Tucci.

274
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:57,087
[SPEAKER_14]: So, ladies and gentlemen, the school committee and the public watching.

275
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:13,958
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have COVID has really created this, this sense of have and have not, you know, we've had this influx where we've been able to do a lot to be able to support students, but there were certain things that were eliminated in the last year's budget that are really fundamentally critical, especially at our middle schools.

276
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:23,124
[SPEAKER_14]: as we consider students returning to full-time education next year that are mission critical when it comes to reading and math.

277
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:32,591
[SPEAKER_14]: And so while we were able to restore our reading specialists at the elementary level, we were unable to do so at the middle school level.

278
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:41,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And so looking at our restoration of reading and math interventionists and specialists at the middle school is a fundamentally critical priority for us.

279
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:51,170
[SPEAKER_14]: As we consider the secondary level at high school, one of the critical things is two shop areas specifically.

280
00:32:51,731 --> 00:32:52,731
[SPEAKER_14]: First, electrical.

281
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:56,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Electrical is one of our most popular chapter 74 programs.

282
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:11,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Chapter 4 programs are those career technical education programs that are critical for our students looking for post-secondary work or for that CTE experience prior to going on to college.

283
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:18,453
[SPEAKER_14]: The electrical program is well-subscribed and would benefit from having an additional electrical instructor.

284
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:29,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And space within the high school has already been identified and is currently being worked on to alleviate the current strains and stresses of that program.

285
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:39,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Another program, CCL, Construction and Craft Laborers, is one of only two of these Chapter 74 programs in the entire commonwealth.

286
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:47,311
[SPEAKER_14]: This positions Medford students to be highly marketable in this field when they leave Medford High School.

287
00:33:48,111 --> 00:34:02,636
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a very strong association with the trade association slash labor union in the state, and they are very invested in Medford students and hiring them once they have graduated from Medford High School.

288
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:04,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is this important?

289
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this position will actually offer our

290
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:31,197
[SPEAKER_14]: staff who are currently here, so starts branching out into other areas of CCO that I'll leave to Mr. Fallon to describe later, but it would be a tremendous opportunity for our students to be able to have these additional course offerings that would be available to them through this addition.

291
00:34:32,198 --> 00:34:34,939
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a social studies position that was cut last year.

292
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:43,032
[SPEAKER_14]: at the high school, and so what this does is it limits the amount of electives that we can offer.

293
00:34:43,172 --> 00:35:04,079
[SPEAKER_14]: For those of you who don't know, as I've mentioned before, the Mass Corps really locks up what students are able to do to a certain degree, and when they reach junior and senior year is when they start to have a little bit of flexibility in their schedule, which is where they want to start taking these exciting courses that are their electives, and social studies offers them some of these courses.

294
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:10,440
[SPEAKER_14]: So this position would allow us to start putting those courses back into place.

295
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:19,208
[SPEAKER_14]: One of our budget cuts was an ETL, an educational testing liaison at the Andrews Middle School.

296
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:27,636
[SPEAKER_14]: So the restoration of that position is fundamentally critical to support our students with special needs as we move forward from the pandemic.

297
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:29,778
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

298
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:36,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Another area that is really critical for us as we consider secondary education, and Ms.

299
00:35:36,808 --> 00:36:00,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Galussi spoke to this in elementary, but I want to make sure that you fully understand, giving principals fiscal resources to be able to support professional development within their buildings, and to be able to lead their staff with appropriate resources and appropriate supports to be able to make decisions in line with the district priorities

300
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:03,153
[SPEAKER_14]: around building-based professional development.

301
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:13,561
[SPEAKER_14]: It is really critical as a principal to be able to have these opportunities and to build staff capacity as we move out of the throes of this pandemic.

302
00:36:15,762 --> 00:36:17,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just look at my notes here real quick.

303
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:24,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the other big thing is,

304
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:37,303
[SPEAKER_14]: We hope moving forward, we'll be presenting curriculum initiatives and various assessments to be able to help support our students as we come out of the pandemic.

305
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:43,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Those we'll be discussing in future weeks with the committee larger.

306
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:48,348
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other critical piece is that we're doing sufficient work

307
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,263
[SPEAKER_14]: to support the social emotional needs and health services capacity of our students.

308
00:36:53,723 --> 00:37:11,453
[SPEAKER_14]: So that as we come out of the pandemic, the toll, the trauma that has been inflicted on our students, and to a certain degree, our teachers as well, that we have the supports in place to be able to support our students fully, both in the classroom and outside of the classroom.

309
00:37:12,394 --> 00:37:14,695
[SPEAKER_14]: And so at this time, those are the primary

310
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,635
[SPEAKER_14]: high-level priorities that we've identified at the secondary level.

311
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:25,577
[SPEAKER_14]: But these are critical needs as we move forward into FY22.

312
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Peter.

313
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:36,162
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm just going to put one, I'm going to advance one slide so folks can see an excerpt from, I'm going to try to advance one slide.

314
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:43,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully that says the Brooks because I can't really see it where my, how my windows are.

315
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:47,065
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an excerpt from the packet that you've received previously.

316
00:37:47,725 --> 00:38:10,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And this just goes to the point that we've been making that we are identifying both what we see as the most critical priorities that can have the most profound impact on student outcomes, and also attempting to bucket some of the pieces that we know have the strongest nexus between the impact of the pandemic and what it is that we're trying to do as an organization.

317
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:18,527
[SPEAKER_10]: By identifying those, we are in the process of essentially building our ESSER II and ESSER III budgets.

318
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:24,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Understanding that these are one-time funds, and we have to always keep that in mind.

319
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:32,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And also that the funding right now, it's a healthy amount of money, $7.6 million between ESSER II and ESSER III combined.

320
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:38,673
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's to extend over a very long period of time, at least from a budget cycle perspective.

321
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:40,754
[SPEAKER_10]: And so making sure that those

322
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:48,992
[SPEAKER_10]: are sustainable and are being prioritized accordingly is part of the strategy work that we are involved in right now.

323
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully through Dr. Cushing and Ms.

324
00:38:52,573 --> 00:39:02,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Galussi's presentations there, the committee and members of the community can see some of the common threads that are helping to inform the development of the FY22 budget.

325
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:07,420
[SPEAKER_10]: As I said before, that we are a heavily departmentalized organization.

326
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,062
[SPEAKER_10]: And so some of the funding priorities that you're seeing here

327
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:21,703
[SPEAKER_10]: are very much related to and hopefully congruent with some of the priorities you'll hear as our department leaders present over the course of the next two weeks.

328
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:41,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And our responsibility is to sew together these different priorities in a cohesive and coherent manner so that the FY22 budget advances those strategic goals of eliminating or reducing the learning and opportunity gaps that have been caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

329
00:39:41,994 --> 00:39:45,495
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the common thread, that's the narrative, that's what our objective is.

330
00:39:46,375 --> 00:40:01,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll be happy to field your questions and take your input as we continue this deliberative process of putting together a recommended budget that you could then approve and turn into the Medford Public Schools budgetary request.

331
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Member van der Kleef?

332
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:13,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

333
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question regarding the paraprofessionals.

334
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:26,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't quite sure whether the request was paraprofessionals at every grade level for every school, i.e.

335
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: 20-something paraprofessionals.

336
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:30,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you clarify, please?

337
00:40:31,537 --> 00:40:32,538
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great question.

338
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:35,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would say, to some degree, it's intentionally vague.

339
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:43,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Because as you probably could guess, there's a budgetary impact as to how many ultimately is requested.

340
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:55,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I don't think anyone thinks that there's anything feasible about funding an additional paraprofessional for every grade level at every elementary school or every school for that matter.

341
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:58,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Would that be a good investment?

342
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:02,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, but it's not something that, well, we have an obligation to identify priorities.

343
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:07,647
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have an obligation also to be pragmatic.

344
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:13,329
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you'll see that the bullets in the budget narratives that you've received

345
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:16,253
[SPEAKER_10]: are specific to two of the four elementary schools.

346
00:41:16,753 --> 00:41:24,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is reflective of the fact that there are existing grade level paraprofessional positions at the two in which it is not listed.

347
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:43,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And so progress, which is what this is really about, we're not gonna get to the promised land in this particular budget cycle or any other budget cycle, frankly, but progress would be represented in investing in grade level paraprofessional or paraprofessionals

348
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:48,424
[SPEAKER_10]: at the two elementary schools that currently do not have as many on staff.

349
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:59,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And for the community's benefit, I would just say that our paraprofessionals who, if you work in a school, if you've ever stepped foot in a school, if you went to school, you know that in many respects, they really are the lifeblood of the school.

350
00:41:59,107 --> 00:42:05,888
[SPEAKER_10]: They're individuals who are, in many cases, serving students of the highest need and some of the most vulnerability.

351
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:12,070
[SPEAKER_10]: They cultivate invaluable relationships with students.

352
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And they really make the school function in many ways as many of our other staff members do.

353
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:24,105
[SPEAKER_10]: But they are also frequently assigned to substantially separate special education programming.

354
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:42,473
[SPEAKER_10]: And what happens in when our entire paraprofessional staff is concentrated in those substantially separate environments, then there are instances in which it makes it more likely that a student may not be able to be in a general education classroom if that additional adult supervision and support might be what would be the thing

355
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:45,224
[SPEAKER_10]: that would open up the door to that less restrictive environment.

356
00:42:45,564 --> 00:43:04,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's why that's part of the pieces that is being prioritized here to make sure that we're structuring ourselves consistent with our obligations to students and families, and also making sure that we're giving flexibility to school communities where it's necessary and it currently maybe doesn't exist as much as we'd like it to.

357
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:07,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I have more questions, but I think we should rotate.

358
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin?

359
00:43:13,637 --> 00:43:14,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

360
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:17,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to actually expand on the last question as well.

361
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:28,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering about, first of all, I just want to sort of ensure that the community knows that least restrictive environment starts in a general education classroom and is only

362
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:35,211
[SPEAKER_09]: changed when the nature or the severity of the disability is such that the student is not able to be educated in general education.

363
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:39,193
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.

364
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:41,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should be starting there obviously first.

365
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:49,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that begs the bigger question of how many substantially separate classrooms we have and what that is for equity in our system as a whole.

366
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,442
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's another conversation that we'll have I'm sure over the course of the budget overall.

367
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:54,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that the departments themselves

368
00:43:55,563 --> 00:43:59,304
[SPEAKER_09]: we'll be speaking, I mean the, yeah, we'll be having this continued conversation.

369
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:12,869
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going into the, you know, bits and pieces of the schools themselves, but I would also ask of the schools that we're talking about for additional paraprofessionals, which I've seen the bulleted list, and I think you mean in the individual budgets, is that right?

370
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:13,449
[SPEAKER_09]: The bulleted list?

371
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:19,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm looking at the cover sheet and it's not the bulleted list that you mean, you mean within the individual budgets, correct?

372
00:44:19,471 --> 00:44:20,792
[SPEAKER_09]: For each of the elementary schools?

373
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:22,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. Murphy.

374
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:22,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

375
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:38,879
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I would also ask, you know what the special education programming looks like at those schools and again, you know, just for to sort of ask folks to start off on the appropriate mindset if you will is that you know there are.

376
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:46,712
[SPEAKER_09]: No special education students, as our special education director Kathy Medaglia would always say, who I really appreciated for saying that.

377
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Every student is a general education student.

378
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Some students receive special education services.

379
00:44:51,615 --> 00:44:52,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Same with English language, right?

380
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:55,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Every student is a general education student.

381
00:44:55,178 --> 00:44:58,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Some students receive English language services.

382
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So just that we can put it in that light would be super helpful.

383
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:24,707
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, as we're thinking about these additional paraprofessionals across these schools, I would like to know if there's an equitable distribution currently, and it doesn't have to be for tonight, we can have this for the next meeting in terms of the departmental, but within these schools, are there equitable special education programming in the schools?

384
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:29,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be something that I would want to, you know, know as well if we could.

385
00:45:30,983 --> 00:45:36,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just really briefly in response, I think, as Ms.

386
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:47,713
[SPEAKER_10]: McLaughlin mentioned, this will be a large focus of the budget presentation that we make this coming Thursday, May 6th, where the pupil services budget will be presented.

387
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:53,156
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will be talking about how the programs are currently aligned within each school.

388
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:54,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And the point that Ms.

389
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:54,677
[SPEAKER_10]: McLaughlin

390
00:45:55,202 --> 00:46:09,812
[SPEAKER_10]: makes is a really, really important one that making sure that there is an equitable distribution of programs is necessary if those programs are going to run and run well and serve the interests of students.

391
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:21,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And so to the point about every student is a general education student, I would say that this particular piece of the proposal that we're talking about right now with regard to the need to eventually

392
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:26,300
[SPEAKER_10]: investment power professionals is evidence of our recognition of that.

393
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:33,586
[SPEAKER_10]: If you were to ask me, do I think we're organized right now in the most equitable manner, frankly, I would say no.

394
00:46:34,186 --> 00:46:39,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that we are, which is part of why we have to start looking at this and looking at these staffing models.

395
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:44,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the information we've tried to provide for you, and I think this is just, I'll just make this point really quick.

396
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:50,620
[SPEAKER_10]: As we go through the budget process, the budget process is one of our most significant

397
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:54,449
[SPEAKER_10]: organizing processes of the school, of the year, right?

398
00:46:54,789 --> 00:47:05,511
[SPEAKER_10]: It's when we look at ourselves as an entire, as an organization and ask these types of questions are, are we being equitable in the way that students have both a right to, and I think families have a right to expect.

399
00:47:06,112 --> 00:47:12,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And are we organized in a way that is actually advancing the mission and being true to the types of values that Ms.

400
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:14,093
[SPEAKER_10]: McLaughlin was just speaking to.

401
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:19,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we do this process, there's a lot of sort of trying to kill multiple birds with,

402
00:47:21,195 --> 00:47:22,195
[SPEAKER_10]: as many stones as we have.

403
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:23,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wouldn't say one stone.

404
00:47:24,436 --> 00:47:31,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the things that we're taking a look at is you'll see in each of the budget narratives we've articulated what the staffing allocation is.

405
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:44,819
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that I've had questions from some members and some administrators who have said, what does it mean when we say we've budgeted 32 positions at a school, but there's 95 positions serving in that school?

406
00:47:45,419 --> 00:47:49,380
[SPEAKER_10]: What that means is we have a heavily departmentalized and siloed budget in which

407
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:55,994
[SPEAKER_10]: If just looking at a school budget, you are not going to really be able to tell exactly what's happening in that school.

408
00:47:56,315 --> 00:48:03,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to be clear, budget documents are not necessarily designed to tell every single bit of information about a school.

409
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:07,497
[SPEAKER_10]: So we should be realistic about what information we can convey in a spreadsheet, okay?

410
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:18,580
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will say that given the level of departmentalization of this budget, those types of questions, are we organizing our special ed services in an equitable way that serves the interests of all students?

411
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:25,758
[SPEAKER_10]: do our staffing models, are they consistent with our obligations to students with regard to the environments in which they're learning?

412
00:48:27,178 --> 00:48:33,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say at a minimum, there's not as much evidence of that in our current budget structure.

413
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would say there are reasonable inferences that could be drawn that there are improvements we have to make in that regard.

414
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

415
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:40,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

416
00:48:45,604 --> 00:48:47,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

417
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:49,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

418
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:59,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we assuming for this entire budget that elementary students will be coming back, all of them in the fall, since there probably won't be a vaccine for them yet?

419
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:11,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we are assuming that we will be fully in-person as a district with the exception of essentially exemptions for medical reasons.

420
00:49:12,197 --> 00:49:17,761
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the guidance we have more or less received from DESE that absent a medical exemption,

421
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:24,039
[SPEAKER_10]: the expectation will be that we will run school as we would in the before times.

422
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:32,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And are we planning to continue pool testing until vaccine is generally available to all students and grade levels?

423
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:35,022
[SPEAKER_10]: We're definitely planning to continue testing.

424
00:49:35,082 --> 00:49:36,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I expect it will be pool testing.

425
00:49:37,323 --> 00:49:45,206
[SPEAKER_10]: We have had some conversations in recent weeks about some potential, the technologies around testing are evolving.

426
00:49:45,806 --> 00:49:46,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And so,

427
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:49,586
[SPEAKER_10]: exactly what testing will look like by September.

428
00:49:49,626 --> 00:49:59,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know right now, but I don't, I think testing is unavoidable, inevitable, a certainty, at least for the beginning of the school year.

429
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:07,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a chance as the school year goes on, we will have to sort of measure that and determine, you know, what is it exactly we're testing.

430
00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:14,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully by, you know, some point that I'm not going to speculate about, but I hope it will be in the 21, 22 school year.

431
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:28,587
[SPEAKER_10]: we'll start to ask the questions about how do we move to a system in which we test when it's necessary, as opposed to our general surveillance testing of just by coming in the building, you're having your nose swabbed.

432
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:30,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

433
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:34,149
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll ask one more question before letting others ask questions.

434
00:50:35,129 --> 00:50:44,073
[SPEAKER_11]: In our June of 2020 budget, we created a document that was sourced from the department heads

435
00:50:45,283 --> 00:51:04,817
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, that document identified over 25 FTEs just at the elementary level, you know, nine tier two interventionists, literacy leaders, math leaders, lots and lots of staff at the elementary level.

436
00:51:06,178 --> 00:51:09,761
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know we restored, we have some people restored.

437
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:12,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess my question is, can we take that list

438
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:27,325
[SPEAKER_11]: which is only a few pages long and sort of create another column, indicate what of that has actually been included in this budget or restored through other methods between then and now so we can have a differential.

439
00:51:29,546 --> 00:51:38,874
[SPEAKER_11]: And then perhaps have a conversation around why did we just say we needed nine tier two interventionists at the elementary schools and we're adding one per school or none.

440
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:44,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that would be a useful conversation.

441
00:51:44,258 --> 00:51:45,118
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

442
00:51:45,498 --> 00:51:48,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree, Mr. So I'm happy to put that together and circulate that to the committee.

443
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:58,127
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly that document was informative in terms of sort of spelling out the universe of needs that had been identified during that budget process.

444
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:07,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say that when we provide that documentation to you in the coming days, one of the things you'll see as you suggested,

445
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:14,484
[SPEAKER_10]: a number of those positions were addressed or in some very few circumstances are in the process of being addressed.

446
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:30,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you'll see some of that list has been whittled down, not to, I don't wanna suggest to a enormous extent, but certainly some positions have come off the list and gone back onto the staff roster where they belong.

447
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:37,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say the other thing is that I do think the question that we posed to our staff members

448
00:52:37,927 --> 00:52:49,451
[SPEAKER_10]: in the course of this budget process was more narrowly tailored than as I've reviewed some of the language that was circulated in FY21 or in preparation for FY21.

449
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:59,034
[SPEAKER_10]: At least in some cases, what was communicated to department heads, not necessarily by the school committee, but what was communicated was to develop the list if there were no financial boundaries.

450
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:06,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have not posed that question in part because one, there are always financial boundaries

451
00:53:06,857 --> 00:53:15,200
[SPEAKER_10]: and also because we felt like we wanted to get a sense as to what people felt were the most pressing and most urgent.

452
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:35,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, at the same time, I think the principals and department heads would attest to the fact that there was strong encouragement to be ambitious with the idea being that without knowing what the restrictions were and when this really started, even the total number of ESSER funding, in some cases more so than ever,

453
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:39,419
[SPEAKER_10]: there was the opportunity to sort of dream big.

454
00:53:39,859 --> 00:53:55,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I don't think we did anything to sort of curtail those ambitions, but I do think that the questions were slightly more narrowly tailored to fit the objectives of the FY22 budget, which again, that is to eliminate or reduce learning and opportunity gaps caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

455
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:57,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

456
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have another question.

457
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:03,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to point out ambitious is what I hear parents want us to do.

458
00:54:05,194 --> 00:54:05,334
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

459
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:09,121
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, I think that's actually a good thing.

460
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:14,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm asking people, you know, how can we make something 0.1% better?

461
00:54:14,444 --> 00:54:20,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't think any of us on the school committee ran so we can make things 0.1% better.

462
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:27,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think people who, the voters are interested in that kind of level of incremental improvement.

463
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:33,314
[SPEAKER_11]: So ambitious to me is absolutely should be a pretty major goal.

464
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:34,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

465
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:36,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

466
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham, then Member Kreatz.

467
00:54:41,694 --> 00:54:45,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my first question is, are we going to talk about high school tonight?

468
00:54:45,097 --> 00:54:50,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I thought we were going through the whole presentation before we fielded questions.

469
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:51,622
[SPEAKER_10]: We did.

470
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:53,843
[SPEAKER_10]: That was included in the secondary.

471
00:54:53,864 --> 00:55:04,211
[SPEAKER_10]: So the reference to the Chapter 74 positions, the electrical position, the construction craft laborers, the humanities position on 12th grade, I think we can expand upon that.

472
00:55:05,543 --> 00:55:18,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I will say, as I mentioned, I think that departmentalization of the budget affects secondary and especially high school more so than the other levels and the other schools.

473
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:24,992
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of the initiatives, I think, that you would expect to be hearing, you'll probably hear more at the departmental level.

474
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:32,735
[SPEAKER_10]: But certainly, if there are any specific questions, I know Mr. DeLayber, Mr. Fallon, and Dr. Cushing and myself are happy to weigh in.

475
00:55:34,056 --> 00:55:34,276
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

476
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:39,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the main question I had about elementary.

477
00:55:39,148 --> 00:55:45,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think there's plenty of questions to be asked, but when we talk about this restoration of this special.

478
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:49,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand in concept.

479
00:55:50,690 --> 00:56:03,052
[SPEAKER_03]: What you described as the need, but I do not practically understand like what does that mean from a staffing perspective like I don't see a staffing ask associated with supporting this special.

480
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,792
[SPEAKER_03]: or like, I can't picture in my mind what it looks like.

481
00:56:07,892 --> 00:56:13,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just curious, like, is there a budget implication to what is being recommended?

482
00:56:15,656 --> 00:56:18,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll speak to the budget implication first and maybe Ms.

483
00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:26,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Glusk, you could speak more to the instructional component and why this is critical at this time, particularly.

484
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,483
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a few different elements to this.

485
00:56:31,461 --> 00:56:37,342
[SPEAKER_10]: One is we wanna, I'm sorry, I almost just dived into the instructional piece that I just said I wouldn't try to answer.

486
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:40,363
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll stick to the budgetary piece.

487
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:42,363
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be about three FTEs.

488
00:56:43,564 --> 00:56:54,226
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our estimation in order to be able to fund the positions across all four schools and have a staff member positioned to be able to logistically schedule this.

489
00:56:55,166 --> 00:57:00,007
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some contractual compliance issues related to this, although that's not what's driving it.

490
00:57:01,215 --> 00:57:03,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, we do see a nexus here with regard to COVID.

491
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:08,777
[SPEAKER_10]: So in terms of the just sort of basic question of a budgetary impact, you're looking at $180,000 to $190,000.

492
00:57:08,817 --> 00:57:12,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Suzanne, do you want to?

493
00:57:12,918 --> 00:57:15,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that represented in this packet somewhere?

494
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:16,519
[SPEAKER_10]: It is, yes.

495
00:57:18,419 --> 00:57:20,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say, and this brings up another point.

496
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:25,421
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of this, you know, there's no line item that doesn't have personnel implications.

497
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:30,322
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you can see, we are not coming before you today and saying that we have to prepare for

498
00:57:31,069 --> 00:57:32,550
[SPEAKER_10]: a substantial reduction in force.

499
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:48,139
[SPEAKER_10]: In my conversations with union leaders over the recent weeks, I've said that this is sort of where we are right now, but that, you know, we're not in a position now or really ever to make representations to say that there would never be any type of, you know, adjustments in that sense.

500
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:57,224
[SPEAKER_10]: But when we look at where there are, how we're going to, what we can do in sort of the existing budget and what is going to require our

501
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:10,768
[SPEAKER_10]: using other levers to free up funding, we typically are able to get to a place where we are able to say, this is the potential add on if we move in this direction, adding up everything else for the time being.

502
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:20,035
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now that would be about a net gain of three FTEs if we were to have a fifth special incorporated into the elementary schedule.

503
00:58:21,857 --> 00:58:23,238
[SPEAKER_10]: So it probably says something like,

504
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,489
[SPEAKER_10]: sufficient staffing for the equivalent of, or something like that.

505
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:33,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure it says explicitly a 3.0 FTE, but that is what that would amount to.

506
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:40,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

507
00:58:42,778 --> 00:58:45,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think my other question in general is,

508
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:49,995
[SPEAKER_03]: This is informative, but it's not a budget.

509
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:57,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not yet a document that says here's what we're asking for, or is it?

510
00:58:58,378 --> 00:59:04,801
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, this was like not, this is just a really different format and I'm fine with the format.

511
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:13,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to understand like, is everything on this list going to appear in a budget document on May 19th that we're gonna be asked to

512
00:59:15,057 --> 00:59:23,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, we're gonna take into account feedback from the school committee with regard to what ultimately is incorporated into a recommendation.

513
00:59:23,503 --> 00:59:27,567
[SPEAKER_10]: But I go back to sort of the two lanes in which that we have a budget developed.

514
00:59:27,787 --> 00:59:37,354
[SPEAKER_10]: One is we are looking at what the facts on the ground are and what the priorities are to develop for you a budget that authentically represents the needs of the district.

515
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:43,239
[SPEAKER_10]: As based on what we know so far after several months of these meetings, we forecasted for you on April 26th

516
00:59:44,217 --> 00:59:49,979
[SPEAKER_10]: that that would represent somewhere between a $3.4 and $5.8 million increase.

517
00:59:50,439 --> 00:59:54,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, the high end of that is a very, very substantial increase.

518
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,261
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you recall, we talked about the three buckets that represent that potential increase.

519
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:08,123
[SPEAKER_10]: And that includes fixed cost increases, things that are coming in this next budget, regardless of the strategic decisions that we make.

520
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,044
[SPEAKER_10]: That's contractual increases.

521
01:00:10,544 --> 01:00:13,965
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some fixed special education increases that we'll talk about on Thursday.

522
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:15,546
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about $2 million.

523
01:00:16,126 --> 01:00:21,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there are up to $4 million, which there are decisions to be made.

524
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:34,871
[SPEAKER_10]: But as we pointed out last week, with nine expiring CBAs, that is a significant variable that we will need to take into account one way or another.

525
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:43,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the third variable is this idea of the sort of collision between the COVID-related expenses and the operating expenses and the fact that

526
01:00:43,937 --> 01:00:46,578
[SPEAKER_10]: they can't be completely walled off from one another.

527
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:57,880
[SPEAKER_10]: We can trace them and we can sort of assign them as to say, this is the potential funding source for that, but there is inevitably some degree of overlap.

528
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:06,022
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you were to tell me right now, if you, for some reason said you wanted to take a vote tonight as to what the request should be, I mean, that's really up to the school committee.

529
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:12,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't necessarily based on the facts we have recommend requesting something in excess

530
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:30,998
[SPEAKER_10]: of $6 million over the FY21 budget because based on the facts that we have right now, again, as I said before, I think the way I put it was we would need some additional strategic planning to happen in very short order in order to make good on that investment.

531
01:01:31,398 --> 01:01:40,460
[SPEAKER_10]: But I certainly wouldn't suggest that you make a request that is less than the $3.4 million over the operating budget because

532
01:01:41,142 --> 01:01:49,344
[SPEAKER_10]: fixed costs and the bare minimum of the priorities that we've identified would represent a $3.4 million increase over your FY21 number.

533
01:01:50,725 --> 01:01:56,526
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think in terms of where do we land between 3.4 and 5.8, I think that's what these conversations are about.

534
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:04,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Understanding that, that everything I just said is in the first lane of you developing an authentic request reflective of the district's needs.

535
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:10,370
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand fully that the city, that the municipal government has

536
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:14,847
[SPEAKER_10]: budgetary priorities and needs that have to be addressed across the city.

537
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:19,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will be prepared to operate the schools based on the appropriation that is made.

538
01:02:20,451 --> 01:02:23,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will do so to the best of our ability.

539
01:02:23,653 --> 01:02:29,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And given these various funding sources are available, I'm confident we're gonna be able to do it well.

540
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:38,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say that because, as I said last time, it's sort of easier to live in a budget world where either we're pushing the panic button and saying,

541
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:45,854
[SPEAKER_10]: we're in a lot of trouble and we've got to call whatever the equivalent of the budget 911 line is.

542
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:51,078
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's the world in which we're flush with cash and it's just a matter of identifying priorities.

543
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:55,942
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not squarely within either of those two polarized camps right now.

544
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:07,212
[SPEAKER_10]: We have opportunities and we have some strategizing to do, but we understand that there are, given the economic conditions that we're living under, there are significant expenses

545
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,601
[SPEAKER_10]: within the school district and across the city.

546
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:14,706
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're cognizant of that as we go through this process.

547
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:29,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I would say, you know, just sort of comparing this to past budgets, this budget is more ambitious than any budget I've seen the district put forward before.

548
01:03:30,078 --> 01:03:31,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in part it's,

549
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:40,434
[SPEAKER_03]: due to sort of our alignment with the best practices and how budgeting should come together at the school level.

550
01:03:41,075 --> 01:03:46,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think when I read through this, I was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

551
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:47,797
[SPEAKER_03]: All these things are needed.

552
01:03:48,337 --> 01:03:50,958
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem on target with what

553
01:03:51,518 --> 01:04:04,993
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to do to restore the cuts that we incurred last year and to start to think about how to address students where they are when they come back.

554
01:04:05,093 --> 01:04:09,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think overall like there was not a single thing on this list that I said

555
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:11,920
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't need that.

556
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:13,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We could live without that.

557
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:20,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I frankly think the whole list is a yes, if we're saying what we like or what we think is needed.

558
01:04:22,689 --> 01:04:26,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciated the cohesive nature of this.

559
01:04:26,252 --> 01:04:35,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other question that I had in my mind is, when I think about the process, I'm sort of anticipating that come May 19th,

560
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:51,092
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to want to be in a position to send up a budget that is approved by this committee so that the city has adequate time to review and ask their questions and react.

561
01:04:52,233 --> 01:05:01,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And that there is time for the allocation to come back and for us to react to that number, whatever it may be.

562
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:03,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of like,

563
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:09,010
[SPEAKER_03]: How does this translate into the thing that we will be asked to approve on May 19th?

564
01:05:10,591 --> 01:05:27,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the priorities the superintendent has outlined are on point and do a pretty remarkable job actually of lending sort of moving forward with restoring damage in lots of different ways.

565
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:31,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for the hard work and I,

566
01:05:34,983 --> 01:05:36,824
[SPEAKER_03]: looking forward to seeing all these numbers come together.

567
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:37,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

568
01:05:38,785 --> 01:05:39,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Member Graham.

569
01:05:39,825 --> 01:05:44,047
[SPEAKER_07]: We have member Kreatz, member Stone, member Rousseau, member van de Kloot.

570
01:05:45,387 --> 01:05:45,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

571
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:50,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the reports, and it's been a great presentation so far.

572
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was looking at the details that we got in the draft recommendations for the elementary schools.

573
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:59,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just start with the elementary schools first.

574
01:05:59,974 --> 01:06:02,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And something that caught my attention was

575
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:13,722
[SPEAKER_04]: under the additional budgetary priorities, it was listed, three of the elementary schools have listed a water filling station.

576
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:21,124
[SPEAKER_04]: and procurement of additional playground equipment to coincide with plans for additional organized play and social engagement.

577
01:06:21,705 --> 01:06:28,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So my first question for the water filling station is I think that's a fantastic idea.

578
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely think it's more sanitary to have water filling stations where they can't go to the bubbler and they need to fill their bottles.

579
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:54,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that something that we are going to get funding from COVID funds and we could wait and we you know to get that funding and then maybe possibly install additional water filling stations at each of the schools in the entire district?

580
01:06:55,106 --> 01:06:56,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah that's a great question Ms.

581
01:06:56,627 --> 01:06:56,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Kreatz.

582
01:06:56,927 --> 01:06:58,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you raising it.

583
01:06:58,688 --> 01:07:06,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I hope that well so this is an example as I mentioned earlier about how some of the schools are are in different places and so

584
01:07:07,218 --> 01:07:17,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, it's going to be a key priority for us to make sure that sanitary, healthy, accessible, clean water stations are available at all schools.

585
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,061
[SPEAKER_10]: But it may be the case that some schools are for various reasons.

586
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:23,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it's PTO funding.

587
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:33,403
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, sometimes it's log sometimes it's there's a lot of reasons that sometimes schools get out ahead of each other from time to time on these types of expenses.

588
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,823
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'd want to look very carefully to make sure that

589
01:07:36,684 --> 01:07:39,605
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever we're doing, we're doing consistently across the board.

590
01:07:40,605 --> 01:07:48,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And in terms of whether that particular issue, and I think it's in the row of additional funding priorities that are worthy of consideration.

591
01:07:49,388 --> 01:07:54,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So what that essentially that category, if you remember the table, there are four rows.

592
01:07:54,990 --> 01:08:00,512
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the piece that says long term, which basically means we have to do this, but there's no sort of like,

593
01:08:01,135 --> 01:08:06,858
[SPEAKER_10]: practical plan to do it in FY22, although, again, we keep an open mind and we see what happens with regard to that.

594
01:08:07,118 --> 01:08:10,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And ultimately, it's the school committee that decides what you wanna ask for.

595
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:22,587
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the FY222 priorities that we say, from an operational perspective, and I'm using the term operationally broadly here, this is something that we have to, one way or another, figure out how to do in FY22.

596
01:08:23,168 --> 01:08:30,532
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's the COVID piece, which we say, this may not be realistic or practical absent that injection of federal funding,

597
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,711
[SPEAKER_10]: but we have the federal funding.

598
01:08:33,011 --> 01:08:36,794
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we have to build a strategy and a plan to use it and use it wisely.

599
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's the additional category.

600
01:08:39,075 --> 01:08:45,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one where a lot of times you'll see those are in most cases, they're lower dollar amounts.

601
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,920
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're ones that we do wanna prioritize.

602
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:52,343
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's either that we will determine sort of once the dust settles.

603
01:08:52,964 --> 01:08:58,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reality is, as you know, the dust settles throughout the course of the fiscal year.

604
01:08:58,918 --> 01:09:13,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can have a very, very precise budget of our 63 plus million dollars laid out and then reality hits and all of a sudden we have personnel needs we didn't anticipate, we have retirements that we didn't anticipate, it fluctuates.

605
01:09:14,088 --> 01:09:27,296
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is something that we'd want to do one way or another, but whether or not that was something that was ultimately an operating expense, something that we prioritize because from a health perspective, if there's a nexus with COVID and that's where there's funding available and we're

606
01:09:28,092 --> 01:09:43,976
[SPEAKER_10]: we're permitted to use that funding, so maybe we would, or maybe if it's got something that we're gonna do on a district-wide basis, we could probably potentially, not probably, potentially incorporate into one of our capital priorities, which would essentially be utilizing other funding that was available.

607
01:09:44,016 --> 01:09:50,498
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the answer to your question is we want everyone to have access to good, clean, healthy water.

608
01:09:50,898 --> 01:09:52,899
[SPEAKER_10]: We want it to be consistent across schools.

609
01:09:53,299 --> 01:09:56,660
[SPEAKER_10]: We want our method of water distribution to be

610
01:09:57,187 --> 01:10:02,070
[SPEAKER_10]: consistent with the times in which we're living, that speaks to a potential COVID nexus.

611
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:14,918
[SPEAKER_10]: And exactly how and when I think it's to be determined, because it's not, while it's important, it's not as important as restoring literacy intervention specialists or some of these other things.

612
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,419
[SPEAKER_10]: So it does need to happen.

613
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:25,244
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to happen consistently, but we would likely sort of wait to strategize around that when we have some of these other unanswered questions resolved.

614
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:31,700
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I know there was the water question, but was there a... Yeah, I just had another question.

615
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the same section.

616
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:41,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just curious what the additional playground equipment was that coincides with the play and social engagement.

617
01:10:42,082 --> 01:10:52,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something that stuck out that, is that something that we need to do for the playgrounds that's related to COVID so that the children can play

618
01:10:53,238 --> 01:10:54,699
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping socially distant.

619
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:58,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was just really curious about that where I have my upcoming school committee meeting.

620
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:12,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something we should be discussing where, you know, we are in COVID, if everybody's going back to school, I'm just very curious what is the additional playground equipment that would be needed for the social engagement?

621
01:11:12,828 --> 01:11:14,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keeping in mind.

622
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,130
[SPEAKER_10]: That's another great question.

623
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:20,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a great opportunity for some of our principals, without putting anyone on the spot,

624
01:11:21,362 --> 01:11:27,028
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially speak to some of the key educational implications of that type of investment.

625
01:11:27,509 --> 01:11:40,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And while Suzanne picks a name out of the hat to call on as to who's going to speak to that, I'll just say very briefly that this is another example of how something that can be clearly emphasized and necessary

626
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:56,797
[SPEAKER_10]: because we are coming out of the pandemic and we need to make sure that students are given the opportunity to re-engage socially in the way that you need to when your age is four to whatever, in your 40s maybe.

627
01:11:57,277 --> 01:12:07,983
[SPEAKER_10]: But in order to do that, while there is that nexus at the same time, it may be the case that we fund it through, it could be a capital priority, it could be an operational priority, but this is something that

628
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,511
[SPEAKER_10]: is always important.

629
01:12:09,671 --> 01:12:17,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Students will need to have playground equipment and engage in cooperative play long after COVID is well, well in the rear view mirror, but it's even more important now.

630
01:12:17,696 --> 01:12:18,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think maybe Ms.

631
01:12:18,577 --> 01:12:26,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Kay might want to, if that's okay with you, Mayor, speak very briefly to why this is not just a critical priority, but a critical priority right now in this context.

632
01:12:27,363 --> 01:12:29,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just make a quick point of information, Mayor?

633
01:12:30,498 --> 01:12:31,139
[SPEAKER_03]: of information.

634
01:12:33,643 --> 01:12:43,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kreatz, I just wanted to highlight for you that the four elementary schools intended to submit grant requests to the WIN.

635
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: for water filling stations.

636
01:12:47,092 --> 01:12:49,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one for each floor in each building.

637
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:58,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that some of the elementary schools were successful, but there was a problem with the application, which was due Friday.

638
01:12:58,682 --> 01:13:02,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It was shut down on Friday morning.

639
01:13:02,265 --> 01:13:07,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not clear that all of the elementary schools got their grant request in.

640
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the intent that they would all

641
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:17,517
[SPEAKER_03]: send the same thing and I'm just I'm not sure that they all got in because of the application issue.

642
01:13:18,878 --> 01:13:27,063
[SPEAKER_03]: But the intent was to to try to lever that grant funding to provide some support there across all four elementary schools.

643
01:13:28,144 --> 01:13:28,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

644
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for providing a question in that point of order.

645
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I it was a point of information.

646
01:13:33,347 --> 01:13:37,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to provide member credit information.

647
01:13:38,388 --> 01:13:40,990
[SPEAKER_07]: you just have to request information on a point of information.

648
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:45,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Just pointing that out, because I know I've got it confused in the past.

649
01:13:45,553 --> 01:13:47,334
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council used to do it wrong.

650
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:52,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if the request was whether or not that happened, we'll look into it and get back to you.

651
01:13:52,438 --> 01:13:53,318
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my request.

652
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:54,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

653
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:54,639
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

654
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:54,699
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

655
01:13:54,919 --> 01:13:56,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

656
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,481
[SPEAKER_10]: My request shall be granted.

657
01:13:57,521 --> 01:14:00,243
[SPEAKER_10]: But in this case, she's off my screen.

658
01:14:00,263 --> 01:14:01,284
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's still, did she leave?

659
01:14:01,304 --> 01:14:02,224
[SPEAKER_10]: She's ready.

660
01:14:02,965 --> 01:14:03,145
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

661
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,030
[SPEAKER_15]: My turn, yes?

662
01:14:11,592 --> 01:14:21,461
[SPEAKER_15]: So to the playground equipment piece of it, it was definitely noted that what we did at the Columbus was we had some things that the kids could structure play.

663
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:22,642
[SPEAKER_15]: So there were two

664
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:29,365
[SPEAKER_15]: curved handles with a beanbag that they could throw back and forth to each other.

665
01:14:30,225 --> 01:14:38,731
[SPEAKER_15]: We had some relay race areas that we were able to set up, hula hoops, jump ropes, those kinds of things that we sanitized between play.

666
01:14:39,451 --> 01:14:51,299
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I noticed was the kids were outside, they were actually arguing less, playing with one another more, getting a lot more exercise, a lot less injuries were taking place.

667
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:53,380
[SPEAKER_15]: when the kids were using these things.

668
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:59,503
[SPEAKER_15]: So oftentimes when they go outside, you know, the kids, I want to play ball and someone else wants to play something else.

669
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:06,587
[SPEAKER_15]: But if someone's a little bit more forceful, then there's a child who maybe doesn't get to play what they want to play on a regular basis.

670
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:17,579
[SPEAKER_15]: And arguments might ensue and, you know, this was just it was structured so they went out there the teachers took the kids to a station, and they rotated through it all.

671
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:24,387
[SPEAKER_15]: So like, like structure is the basic word there, rather than just okay it's recess time go outside and play.

672
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:30,692
[SPEAKER_15]: They could play on the playground equipment, and that was part of their rotation, but they had these other things available to them as well.

673
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:40,540
[SPEAKER_15]: And they just seemed to really be having a much better time, a much safer time, and they were playing with one another and arguments were less.

674
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:48,124
[SPEAKER_15]: I am talking with my gym teacher to find some equipment that would be best suited for that.

675
01:15:48,184 --> 01:15:51,966
[SPEAKER_15]: We did borrow a lot of things from the gym.

676
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,488
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I wanna make sure that he can get those back too.

677
01:15:55,508 --> 01:15:58,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you, Dr. Case.

678
01:15:58,269 --> 01:15:58,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

679
01:15:58,629 --> 01:16:08,354
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's a good, as we said at the beginning about this, behind all this sort of dollars and cents discussion, there are implications for how children are learning and I think

680
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,513
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very sort of real illustration for that.

681
01:16:11,553 --> 01:16:13,214
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that, okay.

682
01:16:13,614 --> 01:16:14,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Flushing that out for us.

683
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:15,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

684
01:16:15,954 --> 01:16:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Ms.

685
01:16:16,774 --> 01:16:16,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Kay.

686
01:16:16,934 --> 01:16:17,855
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really helpful.

687
01:16:18,015 --> 01:16:27,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that we can get some of these items so that the children, when they get back, you know, in the fall can, you know, participate in these different rotations.

688
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:36,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a lot of fun and I love that they're arguing less and they're getting more exercise and probably just enjoying their time out and getting the fresh air.

689
01:16:37,538 --> 01:16:38,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

690
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

691
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:39,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ms.

692
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:40,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Stone.

693
01:16:43,262 --> 01:16:43,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor.

694
01:16:44,883 --> 01:16:55,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Murphy, I don't know if it's possible for you to share one of the slide decks that talks, has the superintendent's draft recommendations, any school, anyone, just so people know what I'm referring to.

695
01:16:56,109 --> 01:16:57,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to do that.

696
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:57,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

697
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:04,693
[SPEAKER_16]: hard to get a visual or for me to explain it accurately.

698
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:08,737
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the cover sheet, and as we scroll through, you'll see that.

699
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:09,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

700
01:17:09,217 --> 01:17:13,902
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can just go to the first one you see that has the... Yeah, that's great.

701
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:15,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Where'd you go?

702
01:17:16,304 --> 01:17:17,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Down further.

703
01:17:17,405 --> 01:17:18,866
[SPEAKER_16]: The one that lists critical FY22.

704
01:17:18,906 --> 01:17:19,567
[SPEAKER_16]: There we have it.

705
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:21,688
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

706
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:30,252
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to talk about this slide or this part of the budget, because it's for all the schools.

707
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:41,976
[SPEAKER_16]: And as people can see, it says critical FY and the example of textbooks and the next one long term budgetary priorities, literacy and math coach positions, which we all know are necessary.

708
01:17:42,036 --> 01:17:43,597
[SPEAKER_16]: And then additional, like

709
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,702
[SPEAKER_16]: said, the water filling and playground equipment, which we know is important.

710
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:55,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Mr. Murphy, I'm just wondering, because I understand that everything is so departmentalized here.

711
01:17:56,492 --> 01:17:59,636
[SPEAKER_16]: So these numbers on the right were not in

712
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,311
[SPEAKER_16]: this school's budget at the end of this part of this school.

713
01:18:03,931 --> 01:18:16,916
[SPEAKER_16]: So are these line budget items going to be under a different department or are these something we would add to the end of this elementary ed budget?

714
01:18:17,957 --> 01:18:18,717
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good question.

715
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:28,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And there isn't really a uniform answer to that because I do think there are some decisions that should be made after this budget is adopted.

716
01:18:29,495 --> 01:18:31,176
[SPEAKER_10]: with regard to how the budget is organized.

717
01:18:31,997 --> 01:18:32,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

718
01:18:32,738 --> 01:18:50,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not necessarily suggesting at this time that we uproot every line item in the $63 million budget and align them with better practices in part because frankly, the departmentalization of this budget is reflective of the departmentalization of the district itself.

719
01:18:51,277 --> 01:18:54,179
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we have to make some strategic decisions about the district.

720
01:18:54,219 --> 01:18:56,000
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the budget has to reflect that.

721
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:01,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't suggest that we should redo the budget and then dictate from the, from this.

722
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,486
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a limitation as to what you can get out of a budget.

723
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:06,407
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not suggesting we uproot all that.

724
01:19:06,668 --> 01:19:16,374
[SPEAKER_10]: So in some cases, in some cases, these would be line items that are added to the school budgets, but there's very little, as you know, there's very little on the school budgets themselves.

725
01:19:16,975 --> 01:19:17,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And so.

726
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:29,517
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, as we went through, we did see some instances in which there was funding that was tucked away in particular line items at schools that didn't necessarily have the, well, I'll call it the most airtight rationale.

727
01:19:29,977 --> 01:19:31,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there's some shifting with regard to that.

728
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:46,808
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll see in the spreadsheets that you have that we've reduced the, and this is again, after consultation with everybody affected and understanding the history of some of these lines, but the, there was a supply line for the high school

729
01:19:47,337 --> 01:19:47,777
[SPEAKER_10]: that was like 35,000.

730
01:19:48,698 --> 01:19:52,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it was like 2000 at an elementary school, or maybe like 1000.

731
01:19:52,482 --> 01:19:59,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And so now there was a rationale to that, but it's not necessarily one that you would understand just by reading the line item.

732
01:19:59,668 --> 01:20:01,790
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you'll see some movement in those lines.

733
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:13,721
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you talk, if we're talking about personnel, in many cases, again, a little different at elementary versus at middle school, but that's if there was a personnel investment, it would typically land

734
01:20:14,194 --> 01:20:20,115
[SPEAKER_10]: in one of the department budgets, despite the impact really being felt within the school community.

735
01:20:20,475 --> 01:20:25,316
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's- Okay, just so I know how to move forward.

736
01:20:25,596 --> 01:20:25,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

737
01:20:26,296 --> 01:20:27,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Building-based literacy and math.

738
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:31,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Coaches are specialists or interventionists, whatever.

739
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Would that go under Ms.

740
01:20:34,978 --> 01:20:36,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Kahn and the math department?

741
01:20:36,558 --> 01:20:38,798
[SPEAKER_16]: So then I just have to make a mental note when Ms.

742
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:41,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Kahn presents to make sure there's math

743
01:20:42,835 --> 01:20:50,761
[SPEAKER_16]: specialist in there or do I just make a note when we go through it at the end to make sure there's literacy and math specialist?

744
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:54,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, I love the superintendent's recommendations.

745
01:20:54,283 --> 01:21:00,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the critical ones are a definite and the long-term budgetatory priorities are a definite.

746
01:21:00,628 --> 01:21:10,756
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanna figure out how I can work with everyone to make sure at least those two top portions of the recommendations make it at the end of this.

747
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:16,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so at the elementary level, they will be on the school budget.

748
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:22,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll like to, at the secondary level, they will be in the departmental budgets as well.

749
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:27,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's generally true with regard to personnel items.

750
01:21:29,893 --> 01:21:40,038
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that this brings up, and again, if I could just scroll down really quickly to show, I think this is a place.

751
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:46,175
[SPEAKER_10]: But wherever we talk about the grade level paraprofessionals.

752
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:56,041
[SPEAKER_10]: So the grade level paraprofessionals, right now, that would be budgeted within the pupil services budget in one of the special education linings.

753
01:21:56,841 --> 01:22:03,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And paraprofessional work is frequently, inextricably linked to work with students with disabilities.

754
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:06,447
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's not necessarily true.

755
01:22:06,887 --> 01:22:12,851
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, frankly, the fact that all of our paraprofessionals are currently budgeted within the special education umbrella,

756
01:22:13,736 --> 01:22:16,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I think is inconsistent with the points that Ms.

757
01:22:16,517 --> 01:22:21,679
[SPEAKER_10]: McLaughlin was making earlier about how we should be structured and what our priorities are.

758
01:22:21,699 --> 01:22:29,101
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't necessarily mean because we put something on one spreadsheet as opposed to another that we're not thinking of all students as general education students.

759
01:22:29,141 --> 01:22:31,042
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a gross exaggeration of this.

760
01:22:31,522 --> 01:22:38,124
[SPEAKER_10]: But the way the budget is structured is reflective of how we're currently organized.

761
01:22:38,304 --> 01:22:40,725
[SPEAKER_10]: It does manifest itself in ways that

762
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:45,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think our movie's driven entirely by student interests.

763
01:22:45,853 --> 01:23:01,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are pointing, we as an administrative team are pointing some of these things out to the school committee and to the community as a way of communicating to you that we have some changes that have to be made over time and they have to be done responsibly.

764
01:23:01,997 --> 01:23:08,598
[SPEAKER_10]: So the paraprofessionals, perhaps they would live on the elementary school budget if that was something that we were able to prioritize and invest in.

765
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:11,173
[SPEAKER_10]: But that would be a change from how we've done it in the past.

766
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:11,715
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

767
01:23:11,815 --> 01:23:12,396
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

768
01:23:12,597 --> 01:23:16,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you scroll up for a minute just to another slide above this one?

769
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:20,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Just, nope, one more up, sorry.

770
01:23:20,614 --> 01:23:33,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Just right here, just for parents and community members, because I was confused when I read this this morning, where you have grade levels pre-K to five, budget FTEs 28, actual FTEs 82.

771
01:23:34,006 --> 01:23:37,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you explain that to our community members?

772
01:23:37,148 --> 01:23:39,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I had no idea what the heck that meant.

773
01:23:39,751 --> 01:23:44,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, I appreciate you asking, and I will say that I think this is important information,

774
01:23:45,168 --> 01:23:47,309
[SPEAKER_10]: it's here in part in the book that someone would ask.

775
01:23:47,349 --> 01:23:48,370
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, thank you, Ms.

776
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Bichon for asking.

777
01:23:50,131 --> 01:23:59,677
[SPEAKER_10]: If you walk into the Columbus Elementary School, there are on any given day, 82 members of the Metro Public Schools community who are there serving the interests of Columbus School students.

778
01:24:00,438 --> 01:24:06,522
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at the Columbus School budget, there are 28 people who are budgeted to serve the interests of Columbus School students.

779
01:24:06,962 --> 01:24:12,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, some of those 82 don't spend 100% of their time at the Columbus.

780
01:24:12,706 --> 01:24:14,207
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of why it might make sense

781
01:24:14,603 --> 01:24:17,745
[SPEAKER_10]: to live in a departmental budget or a district-wide budget.

782
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:20,527
[SPEAKER_10]: But most of those 82 do.

783
01:24:21,568 --> 01:24:29,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if part of our objective with the budget is to be transparent as to what we're investing in, that is a little bit of a challenge.

784
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't say there's a right or a wrong way to do this.

785
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:43,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, again, if somebody really wants to understand the school, the spreadsheet that details how much everyone in the school is getting paid is probably not the best place to go to really absorb that information.

786
01:24:45,362 --> 01:24:48,403
[SPEAKER_10]: But 28 and 82 is a fairly sizable discrepancy.

787
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:55,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think that it's reflective of some of the things that we as an organization have to ponder.

788
01:24:56,585 --> 01:24:57,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

789
01:24:57,466 --> 01:24:57,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

790
01:24:57,646 --> 01:24:58,406
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

791
01:24:58,486 --> 01:24:58,946
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm good.

792
01:24:59,146 --> 01:25:00,026
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no more questions.

793
01:25:00,066 --> 01:25:01,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

794
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:01,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

795
01:25:03,367 --> 01:25:06,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, Member Van der Kloot, and then Member Kreatz.

796
01:25:08,509 --> 01:25:09,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

797
01:25:09,349 --> 01:25:13,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And I greatly appreciate the explanation about the discrepancy in those two numbers.

798
01:25:14,017 --> 01:25:19,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the middle school one is the most fascinating one, which appears to show four people working at each middle school.

799
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:29,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's different.

800
01:25:30,664 --> 01:25:37,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess my other question was around the elementary school and the need for an additional special, you know, the three FTEs,

801
01:25:40,007 --> 01:25:41,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that won't be free, of course.

802
01:25:41,688 --> 01:25:49,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like we can easily identify a nearly endless number of additional staff we want for other reasons.

803
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:55,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I know the answer to this question, but why are we not considering a second recess?

804
01:25:55,179 --> 01:26:01,845
[SPEAKER_11]: These kids, you know, as the learning loss is what Jesse wants to talk about day in and day out.

805
01:26:02,445 --> 01:26:06,108
[SPEAKER_11]: And the academic journals have sort of turned a bit towards,

806
01:26:07,952 --> 01:26:20,538
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe learning loss isn't actually the biggest issue and this need for social emotional learning and recess, which I've sort of been on for the last three and a half years, even before the pandemic.

807
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:31,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like, you know, DESE has time and learning requirements and, you know, we as a school committee could vote to add another recess.

808
01:26:31,924 --> 01:26:35,366
[SPEAKER_11]: But the only way to technically do that I understood was to make the day longer.

809
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:42,248
[SPEAKER_11]: because the number of hours, minutes of learning are restricted to what they are.

810
01:26:43,049 --> 01:27:03,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess my question is, has there been any conversation that you all are aware of with the Department of Ed around whether or not the time and learning requirements are going to remain the same for the upcoming year, or is there actually a chance we can add another recess?

811
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:05,364
[SPEAKER_11]: When I heard Dr. Kaye,

812
01:27:06,278 --> 01:27:08,580
[SPEAKER_11]: talk about the structured learning.

813
01:27:09,421 --> 01:27:24,413
[SPEAKER_11]: That all sounded really fun and interesting, but I mean, I don't have to tell the educators here that structured learning and unstructured free play are completely unrelated skills, and our kids are gonna need those unstructured free play as well.

814
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:33,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, adding some more academic time might sound like a good idea, but, you know,

815
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:41,504
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the teachers might really suffer, frankly, if their kids have yet more academic time when they really just need more recess time.

816
01:27:41,864 --> 01:27:45,667
[SPEAKER_11]: So has that been looked into as an actual option?

817
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:48,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'd like Ms.

818
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:56,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Galussi to again, speak to sort of the instructional implications and benefits of the programming as it's currently being developed.

819
01:27:56,535 --> 01:28:03,440
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll just say really quickly, first with regard to DESE, I would be shocked based on the information we've heard so far

820
01:28:03,893 --> 01:28:07,335
[SPEAKER_10]: if there was a loosening of any kind with regard to time and learning restrictions.

821
01:28:07,355 --> 01:28:09,236
[SPEAKER_10]: It's entirely possible.

822
01:28:09,656 --> 01:28:20,001
[SPEAKER_10]: They certainly, you know, on occasion they've been known to shift positions after articulating one policy during the pandemic and then moving to a different one.

823
01:28:20,381 --> 01:28:25,104
[SPEAKER_10]: So anything is possible, but that certainly wouldn't be an expectation I would have going into the school year.

824
01:28:25,604 --> 01:28:33,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also say with regard to the length of the day, as you make that point, I think one of the things that's important as we think about our ESSER budget

825
01:28:33,648 --> 01:28:43,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And as we think about combating some of the COVID-related challenges going into this next school year, we have to be open, I think, to looking at every single variable within our control.

826
01:28:44,632 --> 01:28:53,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that might mean that part of our NSERC funding, and this is articulated there if you look through the documents, that we're looking at some type of extended school day option.

827
01:28:54,296 --> 01:29:03,260
[SPEAKER_10]: But in extended school, that does not, just to be clear before I clean that mess up that I just created really quickly, that does not mean we're going to be going to extend the school day for all students every day at every school.

828
01:29:03,607 --> 01:29:05,047
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not at all what I'm suggesting.

829
01:29:05,067 --> 01:29:12,989
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I am suggesting is that the length of the school day for individual students is one of the variables that we potentially can control.

830
01:29:13,369 --> 01:29:17,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we might have to look at that to see what are the after school options that we're offering.

831
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:23,691
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we look at those options, we have to look at students' needs in their entirety.

832
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:28,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might mean free play within the safe confines of the school.

833
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:33,393
[SPEAKER_10]: It might mean additional academic support for students who have

834
01:29:34,573 --> 01:29:37,935
[SPEAKER_10]: are suffering from legitimate learning loss over the course of these two years.

835
01:29:38,295 --> 01:29:40,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And it could mean a variety of other things.

836
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:42,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And it might mean something different at different parts of the year.

837
01:29:43,238 --> 01:29:45,739
[SPEAKER_10]: These are all the variables that we have to think about.

838
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:58,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, as Suzanne can speak to much better than I can, that when we look at this fifth special, this is not a skill and drill type program that we're looking at.

839
01:29:58,606 --> 01:30:01,268
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at what are the comprehensive needs of students.

840
01:30:02,214 --> 01:30:04,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Pre-K is absolutely one of them, and we have to provide space for that.

841
01:30:05,097 --> 01:30:17,929
[SPEAKER_10]: But the multitude of needs that students are coming in at, and the varying levels of need, and the way in which the pandemic has affected students in different ways, is something that we have to try to take into account as we develop this.

842
01:30:17,969 --> 01:30:20,292
[SPEAKER_10]: So Suna, do you want to just expand upon that a little bit?

843
01:30:20,872 --> 01:30:23,134
[SPEAKER_18]: You're doing such a great job there, Mr. Murphy.

844
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:34,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, all I would say is that I think in listening to people speak this evening, the SEL thread starts in pre K and goes all the way through 12th grade.

845
01:30:37,805 --> 01:30:42,530
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the curriculums that we have at the elementary level is also zones of regulation.

846
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:49,957
[SPEAKER_18]: And if students aren't in the green zone and their social emotional needs are not taken care of, then they're not going to be ready to learn.

847
01:30:50,558 --> 01:30:56,003
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we know, I mean, I'm a mother myself, I have two very different students.

848
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:59,586
[SPEAKER_18]: And one fits very nicely inside the box and has done well.

849
01:31:00,787 --> 01:31:08,710
[SPEAKER_18]: the past year and a half and one of my children is not even anywhere near that box and has had, you know, her struggles.

850
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:13,312
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I think we know that when students come back to school, they're all going to be at different places.

851
01:31:13,672 --> 01:31:24,776
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of this special is going to focus on those social emotional needs, in addition to what teachers are doing on a daily basis, six hours that they have those students.

852
01:31:25,498 --> 01:31:32,540
[SPEAKER_18]: but also weave in some of the executive functioning skills that were missed and lost during children being at home.

853
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:38,681
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of those executive functioning skills are also social skills.

854
01:31:39,141 --> 01:31:42,782
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not just the executive functioning skills that relate to academics.

855
01:31:43,282 --> 01:31:49,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of those are the social skills that will also be worked and enhanced.

856
01:31:50,524 --> 01:31:54,925
[SPEAKER_18]: The other piece that I do wanna say where there is somewhat of an unknown for next year,

857
01:31:55,565 --> 01:32:05,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Currently right now, and you know the principals could speak to this as well, but I know many of the grades, especially on nice weather days, they're taking the students outside for a snack.

858
01:32:06,831 --> 01:32:09,152
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an opportunity to have another mask break.

859
01:32:09,452 --> 01:32:16,255
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also an opportunity to get some fresh air and after the recess run around for a little bit and get that kind of

860
01:32:17,836 --> 01:32:40,275
[SPEAKER_18]: second burst that you're talking about, member Ruseau, I would imagine that if we are, time and learning is very important, but if we're also returning next year with masks still in place, a similar schedule and requirement is still going to be happening where we're going to take those opportunities for lessons as well as snack to be outdoors.

861
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:46,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

862
01:32:47,345 --> 01:32:49,667
[SPEAKER_07]: member van de Kloot and then member Kreatz.

863
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:53,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

864
01:32:53,550 --> 01:33:01,677
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm listening to this discussion, I can't help but feel the word that Suzanne just used was opportunities.

865
01:33:01,837 --> 01:33:04,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is here an incredible opportunity.

866
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:10,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it will depend on how we structure it and how creative we can be.

867
01:33:12,606 --> 01:33:24,990
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of meeting the needs of our kids, but also providing that sort of what Paul suggests, extra outside time, extra time where social and emotional needs are met.

868
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:30,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really very interesting just to think about as this conversation has taken a place.

869
01:33:31,392 --> 01:33:35,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, that's gone a little bit far from the budget, but it's been worthwhile to

870
01:33:36,374 --> 01:33:48,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen into to think about going back to the budget, I just really many of my colleagues asked questions that I already had on my list, but I just wanted to be clear if before you were on.

871
01:33:49,439 --> 01:34:01,609
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, it happened to be the Columbus School, but there were other things listed, like replacing outdated Chromebooks so that we could maintain the pandemic purchases, or replacement tiles.

872
01:34:02,049 --> 01:34:08,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that we'll be discussing things like that in the particular, under different parts of the budget.

873
01:34:10,415 --> 01:34:14,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I mean, certainly, I mean,

874
01:34:17,463 --> 01:34:26,167
[SPEAKER_10]: The broken tiles is one of those ones that could really sit at the intersection of a maintenance and a capital budget, but it will be one way or another, it will be addressed.

875
01:34:27,308 --> 01:34:36,352
[SPEAKER_10]: The Chromebook question, we will have a discussion when we talk with the technology department about some of the priorities and some of the investments.

876
01:34:36,733 --> 01:34:41,975
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will say that you've all seen the slide of the $4.8 million put in as part of our FY

877
01:34:47,273 --> 01:34:49,435
[SPEAKER_10]: 21 COVID related allocation.

878
01:34:49,975 --> 01:34:56,139
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a, I believe either 2.3 or $2.7 million that have been put into our technology.

879
01:34:56,259 --> 01:35:06,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there's, I don't think there's effort for as long as there's a public school system, there's going to be technology investments and initiatives articulated as part of a budget.

880
01:35:07,266 --> 01:35:13,550
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be probably different and potentially fewer technology priorities listed

881
01:35:14,202 --> 01:35:24,447
[SPEAKER_10]: in this budget, at least in terms of sort of student usable devices and things of that nature, because we have made such a tremendous investment over the course of the last year.

882
01:35:24,467 --> 01:35:31,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've built up a reserve of Chromebooks and we have addressed some of our other technology needs.

883
01:35:31,171 --> 01:35:42,317
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are more capital related technology pieces, sharing up our Wi-Fi networks and making sure that our switches and our access points are all in place and our subscriptions are up to date.

884
01:35:43,052 --> 01:35:48,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are pieces that you would hear either on the technology side of the operating budget, or in some cases on the capital side.

885
01:35:49,695 --> 01:36:00,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so and also to follow up and I realized that Principal Kaye has been very detailed here, but she did mention in her pages replacement of walkie talkies for the TLP program.

886
01:36:01,301 --> 01:36:02,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's it.

887
01:36:03,322 --> 01:36:09,325
[SPEAKER_10]: That I believe we will update that we'll have when we do buildings and grounds we'll talk about the walkie talkies, but we are

888
01:36:10,488 --> 01:36:14,830
[SPEAKER_10]: To the best of my knowledge, we're in the process of addressing that in FY21.

889
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:27,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Chris, I would certainly be concerned that if there were broken equipment for that particular need, that it would not wait for next year, but it would, in fact, we would find a way to do it this year.

890
01:36:28,034 --> 01:36:31,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my understanding that it's happening now, but we'll confirm that prior to the next presentation.

891
01:36:31,895 --> 01:36:33,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you very much.

892
01:36:33,616 --> 01:36:39,058
[SPEAKER_18]: But could I also just add on that, um, Dr. K just let me know that the tiles actually were already fixed.

893
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:45,221
[SPEAKER_18]: That illustrates what Mr. Murphy was talking about when these things come up, they're just addressed.

894
01:36:45,621 --> 01:36:45,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

895
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:59,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's worth noting for the community's benefit to that, um, this, the presentation includes both the superintendent's draft recommendations to the school committee, but also the firsthand account of, uh, principals.

896
01:36:59,803 --> 01:37:16,175
[SPEAKER_10]: And so sometimes there'll be cases where the firsthand account can be updated because we've been able to address something, but we also want to provide the school committee with as much sort of authentic and raw data as possible from the people that are closest to the work.

897
01:37:16,696 --> 01:37:26,723
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, the table of the superintendent's draft recommendations are really sort of the critical part of the conversation because we have a responsibility to pull all of the priorities together

898
01:37:27,143 --> 01:37:35,407
[SPEAKER_10]: to factor in all of the various perspectives that are represented here and then put forth a coherent and a coordinated set of proposals to the school committee.

899
01:37:35,848 --> 01:37:37,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why both of those tables are there.

900
01:37:38,389 --> 01:37:42,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And I very much appreciate the coordinated presentation at the beginning.

901
01:37:44,012 --> 01:37:48,895
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just some of these details and it's actually quite good to hear that, yes, that's taken care of.

902
01:37:48,935 --> 01:37:49,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's taken care of.

903
01:37:49,955 --> 01:37:52,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate both.

904
01:37:53,777 --> 01:37:54,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

905
01:37:54,898 --> 01:37:56,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that Principal Kaye has her hand up.

906
01:37:59,211 --> 01:38:01,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Principal Kaye, is it on this or do you want to talk after member Kreatz?

907
01:38:04,196 --> 01:38:06,318
[SPEAKER_15]: It was in reference to the walkie talkies, if I may.

908
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:30,880
[SPEAKER_15]: sure so i think uh for for us in the tlp program the idea would be to kind of like um as the elementary principals we've all asked that we keep our chromebooks current so that the ones that are old and outdated we we constantly have enough for the children same thing with the walkie talkies batteries die sometimes they get broken so everybody who needs a walkie talkie uh has one right now

909
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:44,984
[SPEAKER_15]: we we did have um two in reserve and so that's helped us but I think I just want to make sure that we keep in mind that there needs to be a little bit of cushion money every year for me to be able to do that when those needs arise and that's that's why I put that in there just to clarify.

910
01:38:48,425 --> 01:38:48,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Kreatz.

911
01:38:49,997 --> 01:38:54,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I had a question and I know it's it's a personal priority.

912
01:38:55,042 --> 01:38:57,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in regards to the vocational school.

913
01:38:57,745 --> 01:39:00,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something that seemed concerning to me.

914
01:39:01,228 --> 01:39:06,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's noted here that the method vocational school is not currently part of the cleaning contract.

915
01:39:07,194 --> 01:39:17,700
[SPEAKER_04]: with the school and they are requesting additional allocation of funds to ensure that all the CTE vocational shop spaces are included.

916
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So that seemed concerning to me.

917
01:39:19,961 --> 01:39:27,586
[SPEAKER_04]: How are the other classrooms getting cleaned if they're not part of the cleaning contract?

918
01:39:29,927 --> 01:39:35,450
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good question and I'm happy to ask Mr. Fallon to provide an on-the-ground

919
01:39:36,305 --> 01:39:38,107
[SPEAKER_10]: very concise perspective on that.

920
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:45,094
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will say that when this was identified, it is something that we immediately looked into.

921
01:39:45,154 --> 01:39:53,081
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have reviewed in recent days, the current vendor contract that does the cleaning services.

922
01:39:54,462 --> 01:39:59,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are some ambiguities that I think we're going to have to address with the vendor.

923
01:40:00,642 --> 01:40:03,303
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a new contract, I believe it was renewed last year.

924
01:40:03,823 --> 01:40:11,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're going into, I believe, I may be mixing this, I believe it's on the same cycle as the transportation contract, but I can go back and look at that.

925
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:19,250
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's definitely, it is rolling into the next fiscal year and it is part of our fixed cost increases.

926
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:27,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if we are to expand the definition of the area that is covered by this, it is an issue that we have to address

927
01:40:28,243 --> 01:40:29,844
[SPEAKER_10]: with the ambiguity of that language.

928
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:55,238
[SPEAKER_10]: But in light of this being both a contractual issue with regard to the ambiguity with our agreement with the vendor and the labor implications of which certainly we would have to address, I'm happy for Chad to speak to sort of in a very concise way, the immediate impact of what he's seeing as the administrator, but just keeping in mind that we're likely to have discussions with two external entities

929
01:40:55,682 --> 01:41:01,126
[SPEAKER_10]: both the union representing our custodians and the vendor contract that we have.

930
01:41:01,146 --> 01:41:02,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, with some ambiguity.

931
01:41:02,207 --> 01:41:09,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So bearing in mind the sensitivity of those conversations, Chad, I would invite you to thread that needle and speak to it.

932
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:18,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we able to unmute, Mr. Fowne?

933
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:19,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking.

934
01:41:20,802 --> 01:41:21,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

935
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:23,267
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

936
01:41:25,468 --> 01:41:27,208
[SPEAKER_13]: The cleaning contract and specifics.

937
01:41:27,308 --> 01:41:34,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are several of our academic classrooms are included on that, but many of the CTE shops, if you will, are not.

938
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:35,950
[SPEAKER_13]: It's no one's fault.

939
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:40,211
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably years ago, back when we think of vocational ed, it was different.

940
01:41:40,431 --> 01:41:45,452
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe there was more involvement with students in the classroom doing the, things have changed over the years.

941
01:41:46,473 --> 01:41:47,333
[SPEAKER_13]: We need,

942
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:51,521
[SPEAKER_13]: better cleaning, we need the garbage emptied on a daily basis.

943
01:41:51,561 --> 01:41:54,922
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just, there's many reasons why we need this.

944
01:41:55,182 --> 01:41:58,963
[SPEAKER_13]: So I brought it up because I knew that it was going to be an issue and I knew that would have some financial implications.

945
01:41:59,743 --> 01:42:03,985
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not all the classes though, Cathy, it's just, it's really more of the shop.

946
01:42:04,025 --> 01:42:05,805
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I want the floors done each night.

947
01:42:05,845 --> 01:42:06,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I want things picked up.

948
01:42:06,905 --> 01:42:10,586
[SPEAKER_13]: I want, you know, above and beyond what the students will do each day during their own cleanup time.

949
01:42:10,606 --> 01:42:12,467
[SPEAKER_13]: This is more of a sanitary clean.

950
01:42:14,026 --> 01:42:14,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

951
01:42:14,287 --> 01:42:15,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like that too, Chad.

952
01:42:15,688 --> 01:42:15,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

953
01:42:15,928 --> 01:42:16,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

954
01:42:16,849 --> 01:42:23,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, I really, you know, I hope that we can allocate some additional funding so that we can, we can take care of that.

955
01:42:24,314 --> 01:42:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's very important that we do that, you know, especially during the COVID times, you know, we, we just need to make sure that, you know, the classrooms and the CT shops are getting just, you know, sanitized every day.

956
01:42:36,684 --> 01:42:38,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I completely agree with that.

957
01:42:38,785 --> 01:42:43,329
[SPEAKER_10]: The one thing I would say is it's not clear to me that we need to allocate additional funding for this.

958
01:42:43,369 --> 01:42:58,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it may be, I want to start with attempting to clarify for the external entities responsible for our custodial services, what the expectations are and to the degree that there is any type of change in what the previous expectations that have been articulated.

959
01:42:58,641 --> 01:43:03,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to make sure that we do that in an appropriate way with those external entities.

960
01:43:04,085 --> 01:43:05,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's no question that this has to be done.

961
01:43:06,314 --> 01:43:08,776
[SPEAKER_10]: it's not clear to me that it's going to require additional funding.

962
01:43:09,236 --> 01:43:13,180
[SPEAKER_10]: If it does, we will certainly advise the committee of that.

963
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:16,823
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the critical thing here is this is something that needs to get done.

964
01:43:17,603 --> 01:43:24,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and just so everybody knows, the sanitation part, the daily cleaning and the spraying by our buildings and grounds crew, that's being done.

965
01:43:24,429 --> 01:43:26,030
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want anyone to think that that's not being done.

966
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:27,031
[SPEAKER_13]: This is completely different.

967
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:32,095
[SPEAKER_13]: This is more in-depth surface cleaning and things above and beyond.

968
01:43:33,596 --> 01:43:34,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

969
01:43:34,877 --> 01:43:35,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you both.

970
01:43:35,518 --> 01:43:35,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

971
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:48,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

972
01:43:51,673 --> 01:44:13,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question about the, not necessarily budget related, but in a way, you mentioned the district and DESE's recommended fully back to school for all students, unless a medical exemption, but that wouldn't be, how would we, do we know how many we're expecting to potentially have a medical exemption?

973
01:44:14,148 --> 01:44:17,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And what does that look like per grade level and the cost too?

974
01:44:17,771 --> 01:44:22,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Or how will we manage that?

975
01:44:22,634 --> 01:44:26,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Will that be streaming from home while the teachers are in school?

976
01:44:27,098 --> 01:44:30,000
[SPEAKER_10]: For the students who are on a medical exemption?

977
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:31,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

978
01:44:31,461 --> 01:44:37,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the variable that you've identified there in terms of how many students is really the critical question.

979
01:44:37,545 --> 01:44:41,969
[SPEAKER_10]: And frankly, we don't know the exact number.

980
01:44:43,346 --> 01:44:48,849
[SPEAKER_10]: dramatically fewer than the students who are in cohort D right now and learning remotely.

981
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:56,012
[SPEAKER_10]: That's somewhat, I would be, they were confident of that.

982
01:44:56,612 --> 01:45:09,198
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, but what that number is and what services we potentially attempt to procure, certainly at the secondary level, there are options that we might want to explore.

983
01:45:09,778 --> 01:45:10,779
[SPEAKER_10]: There are districts,

984
01:45:11,841 --> 01:45:19,606
[SPEAKER_10]: that have discussed partnerships of some kind in an attempt to pool resources, depending on the size of those numbers.

985
01:45:20,087 --> 01:45:21,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are important questions.

986
01:45:22,749 --> 01:45:31,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly, there's a nexus there between the COVID-related expenses and virtual schools that would otherwise not exist.

987
01:45:31,555 --> 01:45:34,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't have a specific answer for you other than

988
01:45:35,161 --> 01:45:48,434
[SPEAKER_10]: If right now we're at, I believe, 36% or 37% or something like that, in terms of our students being in cohort D, it's going to be significantly fewer than that.

989
01:45:48,554 --> 01:45:54,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And the question becomes, do we have one approach at elementary level where we can essentially have a virtual academy?

990
01:45:54,940 --> 01:46:05,628
[SPEAKER_10]: the way we have this year at the secondary level, do we have to look at potential vendor options to service those students?

991
01:46:06,769 --> 01:46:22,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so are we ready to make that decision with regards to no remote, put the definition out and then kind of take a survey of our families for next year so that we can kind of get an idea before June 30th when we have to make the budget official?

992
01:46:22,767 --> 01:46:26,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're getting close to the surveying step in the sequence.

993
01:46:27,128 --> 01:46:47,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that there's, DESE has, I think, done a lot of foreshadowing of what the requirements are going to be, but I've not necessarily said definitively, you know, from a regulatory policy basis, what the sort of options, if any, will be.

994
01:46:47,906 --> 01:46:50,407
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think surveying is fine.

995
01:46:50,427 --> 01:47:07,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're ready to do that now, understanding that there'll be a non-binding element to it, and there'll be pieces of the communication and the survey that we're not necessarily well positioned to communicate, because it's better if we would be able to reference explicitly to exactly what Dessy has said.

996
01:47:07,611 --> 01:47:13,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they've been even to some degree ambiguous, we can't be as clear as we'd like to be, but I think you're right.

997
01:47:14,329 --> 01:47:23,332
[SPEAKER_10]: that even starting to sort of get a general sense as to what the magnitude of that would be, would probably be prudent at this point.

998
01:47:25,733 --> 01:47:27,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, did you want to say something?

999
01:47:27,514 --> 01:47:36,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I just was just, I think, piggybacking on what Mr. Murphy was just sharing with the way that

1000
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:40,651
[SPEAKER_17]: we returned to school very quickly.

1001
01:47:41,411 --> 01:47:58,417
[SPEAKER_17]: The guidance that we received as the data started to show that spread among students and in schools was more limited than what we thought it might have been, you know,

1002
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:17,468
[SPEAKER_17]: My preliminary feelings is that it definitely is not going to be strongly encouraged to have an identical model to what existed this year, and that it would function at a significantly lower rate or lower percentage.

1003
01:48:17,848 --> 01:48:20,029
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have not received official guidance.

1004
01:48:20,129 --> 01:48:26,752
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if DESE, I expect them to be saying something in the coming weeks.

1005
01:48:28,964 --> 01:48:38,911
[SPEAKER_17]: that we will be able to definitely present at a regular school committee meeting or another budget meeting to be able to provide a clearer update.

1006
01:48:39,492 --> 01:48:47,457
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was agreeing, we could definitely gather information, but we wanna be able to provide a clearer update.

1007
01:48:49,906 --> 01:49:00,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I think function differently for next school year and get back to some sense of normalcy where the majority of adults will have been vaccinated.

1008
01:49:01,428 --> 01:49:14,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, the mask mandate for outside was lifted as of last Friday, maintaining distance, but, you know, not having the requirement of the mask and the anticipation of

1009
01:49:15,762 --> 01:49:19,604
[SPEAKER_17]: more of the Commonwealth opening up over the course of the summer.

1010
01:49:20,225 --> 01:49:33,793
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do feel for some of the information we're gonna have to be on standby, but I can definitely try to start asking at DESE at that level to see when we may get guidance.

1011
01:49:34,354 --> 01:49:34,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1012
01:49:35,715 --> 01:49:36,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1013
01:49:36,055 --> 01:49:40,658
[SPEAKER_07]: No other questions from the committee.

1014
01:49:40,678 --> 01:49:42,299
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Andre.

1015
01:49:45,905 --> 01:49:46,705
[SPEAKER_07]: You have two minutes.

1016
01:49:53,067 --> 01:49:54,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, hi, can you hear me?

1017
01:49:57,189 --> 01:49:57,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we can.

1018
01:49:58,449 --> 01:49:59,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

1019
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:14,355
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanna start by thanking the school committee and city and superintendents for the work that's been done already in addressing some of the challenges that a number of parents are facing around afterschool care

1020
01:50:15,555 --> 01:50:32,459
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that we did here as we were investigating through the current and past situation was that the money that parents pay into the afterschool program goes into a revolving account.

1021
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:42,242
[SPEAKER_12]: And the funds from that revolving account traditionally have been used to offset some of the operational budget for the school system.

1022
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:57,907
[SPEAKER_12]: So one thing that we'd like to ask is that, you know, it feels like we have made steps forward in addressing this, this challenge and after school care, but that we keep in mind that, you know,

1023
01:50:59,408 --> 01:51:22,785
[SPEAKER_12]: allocating money from that revolving account that parents are paying in at an increased rate to try and provide after-school care that's available and accessible, that that's not used to offset operational budgets moving forward that are going to continue to leave us in this challenging situation.

1024
01:51:25,487 --> 01:51:26,909
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess that's my one request.

1025
01:51:27,029 --> 01:51:28,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't see sort of that covered here.

1026
01:51:28,650 --> 01:51:48,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's covered as part of other breakdowns, but kind of understanding sort of what funding is, like how much of the school budget is funded by the city and what's funded out of these revolving accounts where parents are paying in for afterschool care and that's being used for just the operational budget of the school system.

1027
01:51:52,445 --> 01:51:54,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, make a point of parliamentary procedure, please.

1028
01:51:56,187 --> 01:51:56,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Ma'am.

1029
01:51:57,987 --> 01:51:58,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1030
01:51:58,347 --> 01:52:03,550
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could just ask for name and address on the record for any speakers, please.

1031
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:04,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address, Andre, please.

1032
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:14,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Andre, if you could just give us your name and address.

1033
01:52:15,995 --> 01:52:17,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I think I did it muted.

1034
01:52:17,315 --> 01:52:19,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So Andre Quena, 19 Johnson Ave, Medford.

1035
01:52:20,176 --> 01:52:20,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1036
01:52:21,297 --> 01:52:21,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Murphy.

1037
01:52:22,491 --> 01:52:22,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mary.

1038
01:52:23,392 --> 01:52:30,836
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no intention to fund any of the priorities articulated this evening via the Before Next School revolving account.

1039
01:52:31,437 --> 01:52:51,710
[SPEAKER_10]: The Before Next School revolving account, as we discussed in the presentation on Before Next School programming, will be used to support the operations of that program, the intended expansion of that program, and also to ensure that there's sufficient funding to respond to any unanticipated personnel needs.

1040
01:52:52,425 --> 01:52:57,067
[SPEAKER_10]: that arise as a result of our obligation to service the needs of students.

1041
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:20,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we will, in time, touch upon the state of the revolving accounts and where they are and what our strategies are to make sure that they're both growing at a responsible rate, but also that funding is being allocated appropriately, consistent with the laws governing the use of revolving accounts.

1042
01:53:20,474 --> 01:53:22,095
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I don't anticipate

1043
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:34,206
[SPEAKER_10]: the operational or COVID-related expenses that have been discussed this evening being supported as a result of revenue generated via the performance school revolving account.

1044
01:53:38,829 --> 01:53:39,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1045
01:53:43,772 --> 01:53:48,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I know our next meeting is Thursday night, same time, 7 p.m., Thursday, May 6th.

1046
01:53:54,075 --> 01:53:56,677
[SPEAKER_07]: which has been posted, I believe already, if not.

1047
01:53:57,378 --> 01:53:58,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Mia has a question.

1048
01:53:59,139 --> 01:53:59,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone.

1049
01:54:02,962 --> 01:54:20,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because we're coming up, it's 8.56, I would, just because things move quickly and items are added or items are discarded, could I make a motion that at least the top two parts of the superintendent's recommendations are included

1050
01:54:20,735 --> 01:54:28,882
[SPEAKER_16]: in the right budget, whether it's under special education or transportation or math department or elementary.

1051
01:54:29,242 --> 01:54:37,930
[SPEAKER_16]: So under it would be the critical FY22 budgetary priorities, and then the next group, the long-term budgetary priorities.

1052
01:54:41,072 --> 01:54:41,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone want to second?

1053
01:54:42,469 --> 01:54:44,972
[SPEAKER_06]: What pages are you referencing?

1054
01:54:45,853 --> 01:54:54,143
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really, it's the summary at the end of each school that shows the superintendent's recommendations and it's by priority level.

1055
01:54:54,543 --> 01:54:58,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think the first two priority levels are definitely necessities.

1056
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:07,753
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a third that says additional budgetary priorities worthy of consideration that I think we can consider at a later time.

1057
01:55:07,793 --> 01:55:09,673
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it's COVID mitigation priorities.

1058
01:55:09,713 --> 01:55:14,575
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a recommendation for each school, but I would just

1059
01:55:15,595 --> 01:55:38,549
[SPEAKER_16]: like to see the top two levels included under the right department or grade level just because I think the superintendent has listened to us over the past year and knows this is what the community has shared with us and teachers have shared with us and these are things that are necessary to move our children forward in September.

1060
01:55:41,491 --> 01:55:44,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So your motion just states again is that it should

1061
01:55:44,761 --> 01:55:48,682
[SPEAKER_07]: be placed in the correct budget for then a final review at the end of the month?

1062
01:55:49,322 --> 01:55:49,882
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

1063
01:55:49,902 --> 01:55:50,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1064
01:55:50,902 --> 01:55:52,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by member McLaughlin.

1065
01:55:53,022 --> 01:55:54,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by member McLaughlin.

1066
01:55:54,723 --> 01:55:55,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

1067
01:55:56,043 --> 01:55:56,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1068
01:55:57,283 --> 01:55:57,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1069
01:55:58,483 --> 01:55:59,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1070
01:55:59,724 --> 01:55:59,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1071
01:56:01,484 --> 01:56:02,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1072
01:56:02,444 --> 01:56:03,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone.

1073
01:56:03,644 --> 01:56:03,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1074
01:56:04,604 --> 01:56:05,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1075
01:56:06,965 --> 01:56:07,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1076
01:56:08,485 --> 01:56:09,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Van der Kloot.

1077
01:56:09,625 --> 01:56:09,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1078
01:56:10,805 --> 01:56:11,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1079
01:56:12,206 --> 01:56:12,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1080
01:56:12,426 --> 01:56:14,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1081
01:56:14,762 --> 01:56:15,802
[SPEAKER_07]: the paper is approved.

1082
01:56:17,243 --> 01:56:27,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, with regards to, I don't know how much guidance you've got on ESSER 3, although I know you've got it on ESSER 2.

1083
01:56:28,028 --> 01:56:42,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you give us a breakdown of what would be covered for all four boxes through ESSER 2 and 3, such as the first thing I can think of is just the water filtration systems.

1084
01:56:43,208 --> 01:56:49,350
[SPEAKER_07]: to refill water bottles where you don't want kids touching this, you know, putting their mouth close.

1085
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:53,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you could give us a list of that for one of our upcoming budget meetings.

1086
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:55,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's sort of the point that I was gonna raise.

1087
01:56:55,971 --> 01:56:59,492
[SPEAKER_10]: We have guidance that we could provide tomorrow related to ESSER II.

1088
01:56:59,872 --> 01:57:00,772
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very broad.

1089
01:57:01,092 --> 01:57:04,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it could encompass most of what we're discussing here tonight.

1090
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:06,854
[SPEAKER_10]: ESSER III, we don't yet have guidance.

1091
01:57:07,234 --> 01:57:11,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Although from the conversations I've had with people from the state and other districts,

1092
01:57:11,748 --> 01:57:14,990
[SPEAKER_10]: doesn't appear as though the restrictions are going to become more narrow.

1093
01:57:15,810 --> 01:57:19,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And so most of this could be encompassed by the ESSER budgets.

1094
01:57:20,053 --> 01:57:28,777
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to go back to the point that we discussed at the beginning of tonight's presentation is that there's a tension here.

1095
01:57:29,338 --> 01:57:38,703
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a need to not adopt wholesale either the idea that ESSER is fully walled off or that it's fully integrated is somewhere in between.

1096
01:57:39,023 --> 01:57:41,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I take the committee's motion to say,

1097
01:57:41,631 --> 01:57:49,874
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that the committee wants to pay for, that it's a priority, that we have to make sure that we provide this service, fund this position, so on and so forth.

1098
01:57:50,234 --> 01:57:55,675
[SPEAKER_10]: We will return to you and the hope is we have more guidance on ESSER III by May 19th.

1099
01:57:56,176 --> 01:58:02,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this will be reflected in a budget based on the feedback we've received from the committee.

1100
01:58:03,098 --> 01:58:09,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the committee could then say, no, we want to hold off on funding source A, we want to request that it be in funding source B.

1101
01:58:10,268 --> 01:58:11,649
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the committee's prerogative.

1102
01:58:12,049 --> 01:58:14,371
[SPEAKER_10]: But the point is that it's gonna be included in a budget.

1103
01:58:14,651 --> 01:58:15,992
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna figure out a way to do it.

1104
01:58:16,432 --> 01:58:26,238
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when we figure out where there are some restrictions, but not in others, and as some of the other priorities get realized, there could be shifting in terms of the actual funding source.

1105
01:58:26,638 --> 01:58:38,065
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the conversation that we'll continue to have in this forum and with our counterparts at the city, as we begin to understand what is our capacity and what flexibility do we have

1106
01:58:38,469 --> 01:58:40,610
[SPEAKER_10]: regarding these various funding sources.

1107
01:58:40,670 --> 01:58:53,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So exactly which line item it sits in, I would ask that we defer on for the time being, but I take the committee's motion to say that you agree that this is in fact a legitimate priority.

1108
01:58:54,179 --> 01:58:59,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not surprised that you say that, because I know in some cases, these are things that you have been advocating for for some time.

1109
01:59:00,424 --> 01:59:06,808
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think in terms of the sort of technical piece of this, which I know people have very strong feelings about, and I think I understand why,

1110
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:11,351
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a conversation that will continue to unfold over the coming weeks.

1111
01:59:11,591 --> 01:59:12,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense to everyone?

1112
01:59:13,092 --> 01:59:13,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And Ms.

1113
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:16,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Buston, is that consistent with the intent of the motion that you offered?

1114
01:59:17,973 --> 01:59:18,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1115
01:59:18,533 --> 01:59:29,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I hear you loud and clearly about the ESSER money, and I think it's important that we don't overspend it, but that we do spend it before,

1116
01:59:30,967 --> 01:59:39,774
[SPEAKER_07]: 2025, so it would be beneficial to this committee over the next couple of weeks to have a list of what qualifies through ESSER.

1117
01:59:40,074 --> 01:59:41,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like I said, we can do that now for ESSER.

1118
01:59:42,135 --> 01:59:48,280
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot create a structural deficit, so I hear you loud and clear.

1119
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:54,324
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't put in 50 new positions and then come 2025, cannot be able to afford them.

1120
01:59:54,645 --> 01:59:57,727
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true, although as I said, it's also true

1121
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:08,608
[SPEAKER_10]: that we can't neglect the immediate and urgent needs, that there's a balance, there's an equilibrium that we are attempting to strike with these proposals, and hopefully we're doing it correctly.

1122
02:00:13,332 --> 02:00:15,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for- Mayor?

1123
02:00:15,293 --> 02:00:17,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

1124
02:00:18,296 --> 02:00:18,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1125
02:00:18,856 --> 02:00:27,202
[SPEAKER_03]: To that end, I just also wanted to make a motion that the COVID mitigation priorities outlined in this

1126
02:00:29,867 --> 02:00:32,589
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation are prioritized.

1127
02:00:32,689 --> 02:00:44,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sort of my assumption is that they would align well with ESSER funding, but would defer that to the administration in terms of how best to do that.

1128
02:00:44,216 --> 02:00:57,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, when I look at what the school year looks like next year, I would like to make a motion that we see these things in real life in our schools

1129
02:00:59,108 --> 02:00:59,969
[SPEAKER_03]: come September.

1130
02:01:00,049 --> 02:01:07,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to make a motion that these COVID mitigation priorities also be presented as part of the final budget for review and approval by this committee.

1131
02:01:20,045 --> 02:01:22,127
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could repeat that, Member Graham.

1132
02:01:23,869 --> 02:01:27,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, the COVID mitigation priorities outlined in the presentation

1133
02:01:28,178 --> 02:01:41,484
[SPEAKER_03]: will be presented as part of the FY22 spend, whether it's part of the main budget or our plans to spend against our ESSER grant.

1134
02:01:50,248 --> 02:01:51,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand what you mean.

1135
02:01:51,189 --> 02:01:53,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just, I'm sorry.

1136
02:01:54,887 --> 02:02:10,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that's listed in the COVID mitigation priority buckets is in, we can see it in real life at the beginning of September, which means we, as a committee, will have been presented with a budget that approves the spending of these items.

1137
02:02:14,761 --> 02:02:16,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, could I just ask another clarifying question?

1138
02:02:17,123 --> 02:02:19,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Murphy, Mr. Murphy.

1139
02:02:19,525 --> 02:02:20,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1140
02:02:21,246 --> 02:02:23,788
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically the same question I posed with regard to Ms.

1141
02:02:23,808 --> 02:02:24,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustone's

1142
02:02:26,351 --> 02:02:40,382
[SPEAKER_10]: motion that I take this to mean that this motion would indicate that the committee endorses the budgetary priorities, but whether that it's an operating budget priority or an ESSER budget, the point is that it gets realized.

1143
02:02:40,542 --> 02:02:44,525
[SPEAKER_10]: And to the mayor's point, we understand that the ESSER funds are one-time funds.

1144
02:02:44,945 --> 02:02:54,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the committee should know that prior to May 19th, when you take a final vote on what that budget request is, we will map out for you

1145
02:02:54,787 --> 02:03:18,759
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of everything in terms of what it is, what it means and what it's being charged to, so that if it's the case that we have six positions that are going to be charged to the ESSER account, we will know that we essentially have, depending on how many positions and what they cost and everything, we have a three-year runway that the particular funding source that are supporting these positions is not going to last in perpetuity.

1146
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:23,882
[SPEAKER_10]: To the mayor's point about structural deficits, that means, frankly, one of three things.

1147
02:03:24,583 --> 02:03:37,393
[SPEAKER_10]: either revenues recover and we can offset that charge as the COVID funds expiring, or we as a school district look, or revenues expanding.

1148
02:03:37,433 --> 02:03:40,375
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's sort of a one A, I guess, in terms of that path.

1149
02:03:41,496 --> 02:03:52,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Option two would be, we look within the school department and say, over the course of the time period in which we know we have the ESSER funds that are supporting these positions, that we have to identify the savings necessary to

1150
02:03:54,439 --> 02:03:57,020
[SPEAKER_10]: to offset that when those funds expire.

1151
02:03:57,580 --> 02:04:12,023
[SPEAKER_10]: The third option is that these are positions that we understand we may only have a three-year shelf life with, but understand that over the course of three years, there are other strategic decisions that can be made and positions can morph.

1152
02:04:12,103 --> 02:04:13,344
[SPEAKER_10]: We can look at roles differently.

1153
02:04:13,824 --> 02:04:23,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And so those are all the variables that we control, but understand that ESSER funds will not last in perpetuity, which means that

1154
02:04:24,508 --> 02:04:27,710
[SPEAKER_10]: we either need a different strategy to provide the services.

1155
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:33,193
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe it's the case, sometimes it's the case that we find ways to provide the services, but we don't need the positions.

1156
02:04:33,233 --> 02:04:37,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that is the reality of a budget year in and year out.

1157
02:04:37,656 --> 02:04:40,137
[SPEAKER_10]: We always have to take a fresh look at those needs.

1158
02:04:40,537 --> 02:04:45,220
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the point is that what you're saying is that these are the things that we need.

1159
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:52,224
[SPEAKER_10]: We identify now how to pay for them and understand that there are implications one way or another going forward.

1160
02:04:52,304 --> 02:04:53,885
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and also last thing,

1161
02:04:54,826 --> 02:05:09,098
[SPEAKER_10]: as we get guidance related to ESSER III, you know, it may be the case that we come back and say, you know, theoretically, we could go back and say, look, you said you wanted to do X, Y, and Z. Well, we now know in order to do X, Y, Z, our funding options are more limited.

1162
02:05:09,418 --> 02:05:17,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we would come back to the committee and the committee would have the opportunity to weigh in and understand that if you tell us to do this, it means that we're not doing something else.

1163
02:05:17,605 --> 02:05:21,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's, I think part, that's why this process is going to unfold over the next several weeks.

1164
02:05:22,489 --> 02:05:23,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And then ultimately, again,

1165
02:05:24,726 --> 02:05:29,187
[SPEAKER_10]: the appropriation will be what the appropriation is, and we will find a way to make it work.

1166
02:05:29,307 --> 02:05:35,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to make, I think the community owes, I think we owe it to the community to provide that message as well.

1167
02:05:37,649 --> 02:05:51,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so just like with member Mustone's motion, we would be saying that we are in support of the COVID mitigation priorities outlined here, and

1168
02:05:53,149 --> 02:06:01,474
[SPEAKER_03]: that you all will advise us about how to put them in the right category in the final budget.

1169
02:06:01,494 --> 02:06:03,315
[SPEAKER_10]: And what the implications of doing that would be.

1170
02:06:03,876 --> 02:06:04,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1171
02:06:04,676 --> 02:06:04,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1172
02:06:05,997 --> 02:06:07,098
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the motion.

1173
02:06:07,458 --> 02:06:07,978
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do that.

1174
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:11,720
Second.

1175
02:06:17,244 --> 02:06:19,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, member cuts his hands, I'm sorry.

1176
02:06:19,832 --> 02:06:20,472
[SPEAKER_07]: member.

1177
02:06:21,193 --> 02:06:23,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I couldn't remember Chris and member McLaughlin.

1178
02:06:24,714 --> 02:06:27,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so I just have a follow up question.

1179
02:06:27,956 --> 02:06:30,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, just looking at these numbers.

1180
02:06:30,657 --> 02:06:34,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if the motion that's put forth right now.

1181
02:06:35,619 --> 02:06:50,150
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to account for like let's say the Brooks has $140,000 here and then I go to the um I'm just going to quickly go to the other page one second here 140,000 so are we is this vote to allocate

1182
02:06:54,333 --> 02:07:18,590
[SPEAKER_04]: the total of the funds in all the different categories right now this evening not knowing what the appropriation is for this upcoming school year i guess i'm a little confused or or we already know that the covid mitigation funds are going to come out of the essar and mr murphy is going to identify

1183
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:46,452
[SPEAKER_04]: what's what we would be able to do so for example like support staff in transportation needs for the extended school day you know that's definitely something i want um i guess i'm a little confused about what we're voting on yeah i think i take the motion to mean that as we move toward may 19th the committee is endorsing the priorities that have been articulated to them this evening and so as we get to may 19th we have greater guidance with regard to the

1184
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:53,433
[SPEAKER_10]: the city's capacity, greater guidance with regard to the availability and use or restrictions on the federal funding.

1185
02:07:53,833 --> 02:08:04,878
[SPEAKER_10]: We will present a budget that reflects these priorities and explain to the committee what it means, if anything, in terms of other efficiencies that have to be identified.

1186
02:08:05,498 --> 02:08:14,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's the case that some of the funding, that we are restricted from use of the funding for some of the purposes articulated here, which I don't frankly expect,

1187
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:19,742
[SPEAKER_10]: But it might be the case that as we look at the budget in totality, we have to make some decisions.

1188
02:08:20,162 --> 02:08:25,903
[SPEAKER_10]: And for instance, the committee has endorsed multiple things for which there's only one funding source.

1189
02:08:26,243 --> 02:08:43,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at the timeline that the funding source is available for, we have to choose between option A or option B. In the subsequent budget meetings, particularly on May 18th and May 19th, we'll come back and we'll ask the committee and we'll say, look, you said you'd like both X and you like Y. If we do both, it means we can't do Z.

1190
02:08:44,838 --> 02:09:00,007
[SPEAKER_10]: which presumably we already know that we want to do Z, we would then ask the committee to weigh in on that and make that decision, both in terms of whether you want us to pursue that priority and whether you're comfortable with the funding source that's been identified.

1191
02:09:00,387 --> 02:09:03,429
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be up to the committee at that time.

1192
02:09:03,449 --> 02:09:10,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, keeping in mind that all of this is about, with regard to the operating budget, it is about the request that goes to the municipal government.

1193
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:24,523
[SPEAKER_10]: The ESSER funding, frankly, it's a slightly different process because those are district, those are, that's funding that is controlled by the school district with restrictions in place under federal legislation and most likely state regulation as well.

1194
02:09:25,083 --> 02:09:29,665
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we, you know, that will not necessarily be a request.

1195
02:09:29,745 --> 02:09:31,845
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be a decision that the school committee just has to make.

1196
02:09:32,305 --> 02:09:34,806
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the information that we'll present to you.

1197
02:09:34,846 --> 02:09:39,667
[SPEAKER_10]: With regards to the ESSER funding, those decisions may very well, they may extend beyond May 19th.

1198
02:09:40,590 --> 02:09:54,234
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the request certainly wouldn't go beyond that point, but there's gonna be a lot of movement when we, I mean, for instance, we're gonna have an influx of grant funding that will come in as it does every year related to special education.

1199
02:09:56,415 --> 02:10:02,536
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be a time where there will be shifting within the budget and we will have to go back and we'll have to continue to work with these decisions.

1200
02:10:02,596 --> 02:10:07,898
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now, this motion, as I understand it, and as has been confirmed by the folks that have offered it,

1201
02:10:08,810 --> 02:10:20,297
[SPEAKER_10]: is to endorse this set of priorities and for us to continue moving forward, building both an operating budget request and an ESSER budget in practice that is reflective of these priorities.

1202
02:10:23,419 --> 02:10:23,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1203
02:10:25,561 --> 02:10:26,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

1204
02:10:29,043 --> 02:10:34,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, my question is not related to the motion, so I don't know if you wanted to move that business forward first and then refer to me.

1205
02:10:35,943 --> 02:10:46,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the motion is to have the last COVID section in each department added into the budget for the final review at the end of the month.

1206
02:10:49,972 --> 02:10:50,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

1207
02:10:50,613 --> 02:10:55,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what I hear it saying is for it to be funded one way or another.

1208
02:10:55,276 --> 02:11:02,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And so as we get more information and as we clarify this, the subsequent presentations will continue along these lines of including these priorities.

1209
02:11:02,977 --> 02:11:14,862
[SPEAKER_10]: They may live in the ESSER budget and they may live in the operating budget, but the point is that these are the priorities that this motion states the committee would like to see put into practice and realized in the new school year.

1210
02:11:16,682 --> 02:11:20,184
[SPEAKER_06]: With the final review at the end of the month.

1211
02:11:20,564 --> 02:11:24,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll vote for that if it's just has that language, no problem.

1212
02:11:25,866 --> 02:11:30,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member Ruseau, roll call.

1213
02:11:35,050 --> 02:11:36,210
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I gotta get my spreadsheet.

1214
02:11:36,530 --> 02:11:39,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1215
02:11:39,811 --> 02:11:40,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1216
02:11:41,312 --> 02:11:41,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1217
02:11:42,492 --> 02:11:42,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1218
02:11:43,613 --> 02:11:44,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1219
02:11:44,693 --> 02:11:45,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone.

1220
02:11:45,793 --> 02:11:46,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1221
02:11:47,594 --> 02:11:48,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1222
02:11:49,834 --> 02:11:50,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1223
02:11:50,955 --> 02:11:51,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van der Kloot.

1224
02:11:52,135 --> 02:11:52,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1225
02:11:53,335 --> 02:11:54,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1226
02:11:54,676 --> 02:11:57,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1227
02:12:00,998 --> 02:12:01,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1228
02:12:02,107 --> 02:12:07,028
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Mary actually know would love to be referred if I can I have my hand up I deferred to the motion.

1229
02:12:09,049 --> 02:12:10,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, man.

1230
02:12:11,269 --> 02:12:13,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just wondering if for the in the.

1231
02:12:14,050 --> 02:12:22,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank everyone for all their hard work first of all the principles and everyone that put all this work together it's clearly a lot of work.

1232
02:12:23,106 --> 02:12:25,907
[SPEAKER_09]: and a lot for the community and all of us to digest, of course.

1233
02:12:26,407 --> 02:12:29,108
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that it gets smoother over the course of these meetings.

1234
02:12:29,148 --> 02:12:35,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want the community to be patient in the literacy aspect of it and understanding sort of what folks are talking about.

1235
02:12:35,529 --> 02:12:44,391
[SPEAKER_09]: But to that end, I would love it if we can have some definition, if we might, of some of the terminology that, again, the community might not know.

1236
02:12:45,392 --> 02:12:49,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll do this, obviously, next week with some of the special education programming.

1237
02:12:49,833 --> 02:12:50,473
[SPEAKER_09]: But for instance,

1238
02:12:51,726 --> 02:12:53,947
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the designation of instructional support staff?

1239
02:12:56,047 --> 02:12:57,268
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that defined as?

1240
02:12:57,888 --> 02:12:59,589
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of in the staffing table?

1241
02:13:00,049 --> 02:13:00,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1242
02:13:00,789 --> 02:13:02,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it non-instructional or instructional?

1243
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:03,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Instructional.

1244
02:13:05,191 --> 02:13:09,012
[SPEAKER_10]: It may be that it's supposed to say non-instructional, but it's the building.

1245
02:13:09,432 --> 02:13:10,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's the building substitutes.

1246
02:13:12,433 --> 02:13:15,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there about one per building and maybe one or two buildings for zero?

1247
02:13:16,167 --> 02:13:21,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I don't see any with, I don't think I see any with a one, but so far I've seen them with zero.

1248
02:13:22,492 --> 02:13:24,714
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I was wondering what they meant, but is that what they mean?

1249
02:13:24,774 --> 02:13:25,534
[SPEAKER_09]: It substitutes?

1250
02:13:26,875 --> 02:13:28,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Typically that would mean a building substitute.

1251
02:13:29,197 --> 02:13:36,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so it's not related to reading specialists because reading specialists, I don't see disaggregated in these.

1252
02:13:38,184 --> 02:13:43,068
[SPEAKER_10]: In those tables, they would be included as part of the teachers because they're in the teacher bargaining unit.

1253
02:13:43,789 --> 02:13:44,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1254
02:13:46,398 --> 02:13:47,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1255
02:13:47,098 --> 02:13:48,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a good point.

1256
02:13:48,779 --> 02:13:55,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned that we're trying to resolve a few organizational deficiencies in the course of building this budget.

1257
02:13:56,884 --> 02:14:05,108
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that is sort of a common experience is when we administrators say like, okay, we need to look at the staff rosters.

1258
02:14:05,569 --> 02:14:09,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have eight different schools and we get eight different staff rosters and eight different formats.

1259
02:14:10,311 --> 02:14:10,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And so

1260
02:14:12,051 --> 02:14:26,100
[SPEAKER_10]: We are, in the course of this budget process, developing uniform staff rosters to use as both a communication tool and also for purposes of just being able to identify where staff are and where they're supposed to be.

1261
02:14:27,081 --> 02:14:32,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And so those tables come from that in the expanded version of the staff rosters that we have.

1262
02:14:34,566 --> 02:14:36,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are delineated more specifically.

1263
02:14:36,367 --> 02:14:36,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1264
02:14:37,695 --> 02:14:41,957
[SPEAKER_10]: The tables are designed to be able to fit in the upper left-hand corner of those documents.

1265
02:14:42,298 --> 02:14:45,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I find them super helpful, and I want to thank you for that.

1266
02:14:45,079 --> 02:14:53,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm definitely a visual learner, and I find it to be very visual, so I appreciate that, and the disaggregated data in terms of breaking it out of the narrative.

1267
02:14:53,143 --> 02:14:57,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a nice sort of, what do you teachers call it, the graphic organizer, right?

1268
02:14:57,166 --> 02:14:59,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for those graphic organizing skills.

1269
02:14:59,407 --> 02:15:04,069
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also guess it would be helpful, and not obviously tonight, but moving forward.

1270
02:15:04,109 --> 02:15:06,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sort of building a spreadsheet right now

1271
02:15:07,211 --> 02:15:28,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Murphy that is doing sort of the comparisons between the schools based on those based on these items, but also delineating you know that teacher category because it's big right because it's like it would be good to know like how many special ed teachers how many gen ed teachers how many EL teachers how many reading professionals right so like how that breaks down and I know that

1272
02:15:28,623 --> 02:15:33,625
[SPEAKER_09]: That's again, a little bit more of a disaggregation of the data, but I just wanna be able to compare apples to apples.

1273
02:15:34,526 --> 02:15:37,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if we could do that, that would be super helpful.

1274
02:15:37,647 --> 02:15:51,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that just even working on the spreadsheet as we're talking tonight has been really helpful for me again, as a visual learner to get a macro picture of the district, which is what you're really, if I'm not mistaken, asking us to do because we've been so departmentalized.

1275
02:15:51,634 --> 02:15:54,455
[SPEAKER_09]: So how are we looking at this from a macro perspective?

1276
02:15:54,515 --> 02:15:57,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanna say, I really appreciate that tonight.

1277
02:15:57,116 --> 02:15:57,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1278
02:15:59,265 --> 02:16:00,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

1279
02:16:01,208 --> 02:16:03,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

1280
02:16:03,872 --> 02:16:05,674
