00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:05,577
Hey, Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:09,598
This episode is being released on the day we're observing Juneteenth.

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:23,402
To give a brief summary of the day, Juneteenth, short for June 19th, marks the day when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas in 1865 to take control of the state and ensure that all enslaved people be freed.

4
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:29,264
The troops arrival came a full two and a half years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.

5
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:36,372
Juneteenth honors the end to slavery in the United States and is considered the longest-running African American holiday.

6
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:40,876
On June 17, 2021, it officially became a federal holiday.

7
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:44,239
Information for this intro came from History.com.

8
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:55,742
Today's episode includes an interview with Sophia Hall, the attorney representing the Medford residents who have submitted a complaint against the Medford Police Department following an incident in July of 2021.

9
00:00:56,062 --> 00:01:00,745
This was summarized by David McKenna in a previous episode's introduction.

10
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:11,632
Drawing a connection between Juneteenth and today's topic, I hope to illustrate the ways in which the legal definitions of freedom can be very different than how freedom is experienced across races.

11
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:12,593
I hope you enjoy.

12
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:21,767
All right, thank you all for being here with me today.

13
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:28,536
We're just going to do some quick introductions so folks could say their name, pronouns, and just who they are.

14
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,999
Hi all, it's Chelly.

15
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:37,606
I am chair of the Human Rights Commission, VP at WMCC, and I sit on the board at Method Health Matters.

16
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:38,828
Happy to be here.

17
00:01:42,502 --> 00:02:01,767
Hi everyone, my name is Sophia Hall, I am the Deputy Litigation Director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, which is a nonprofit legal organization that provides free legal representation and education to victims of race discrimination and immigrants in the sort of Boston and greater Boston area, and I use pronouns she and her.

18
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,100
Thank you.

19
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,341
And thanks for being here, Sophia.

20
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:09,823
A couple weeks ago, one of our introductions, we talked a little bit about this case, kind of what we knew about it.

21
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:15,865
But I'm wondering if you could just summarize what, you know, what's going on with the basis is for this complaint against the Medford police.

22
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:17,626
Sure.

23
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:26,690
So, you know, unfortunately, this is not the first complaint or lawsuit that Lawyers for Civil Rights has had to bring in recent years against

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,581
local municipalities or towns in Massachusetts.

25
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:43,783
You know, one thing I'll share is that despite feeling like a fairly progressive location, despite feeling like somehow we are above and different from groups like Ferguson or St.

26
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:53,205
Paul or other cities and towns on a long list of having a spotlight because of the killing of Black people at the hands of law enforcement,

27
00:02:53,565 --> 00:03:10,153
You know, I really would encourage people to reject that notion, and to recognize that in the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, we still have failed to have any sort of standardized policies and procedures that prioritize and protect black lives.

28
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,093
We simply don't.

29
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,955
And we have a lot of work to do here, despite the fact that

30
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:21,038
We talk quite a bit at the state level and the local level about being different from other jurisdictions.

31
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:38,326
And so unfortunately, the case here on behalf of two black teens, young people who are originally from the Medford area, are graduates of Medford High School, who are current college attendees, who for all intents and purposes

32
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:42,109
We shouldn't have to say this, but I will, who are just good people, right?

33
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,170
They weren't criminals.

34
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,213
They weren't engaging in any criminality at the time that they were stopped.

35
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:48,875
They weren't stealing a car.

36
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:51,177
They weren't firing off firearms.

37
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:55,961
There was nothing indicative of criminal behavior when they were stopped.

38
00:03:56,241 --> 00:04:02,647
There were two young black people out in the afternoon driving in a car, okay?

39
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,648
And so, as some of you may know,

40
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:23,197
Last summer, the two my two clients were stopped by a number of police cars, while driving through the Medford area near the Medford Rotary on High Street and I apologize I'm not from Medford so I don't know exactly what the name of that Rotary might be but the Rotary that's near High Street.

41
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:33,469
And, you know, Jeremiah probably says it best in his complaint where he says, you know, I'm just casually driving down the street and I just start to notice police cars making U-turns.

42
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:41,318
Like, that's the level of attention that law enforcement were placing on these two young people driving down the street doing nothing wrong in their car.

43
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:46,373
Inevitably, as you likely can imagine, they are stopped by a number of cars.

44
00:04:46,753 --> 00:05:05,036
They are like roughly instructed to lower your window, you know, open your vehicle from outside your window, exit your vehicle, walk backwards to the back of your vehicle, you know, then handcuffed, held at gunpoint, questioned without any explanation of what's going on.

45
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,536
Like, what did we do wrong?

46
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:11,677
So despite a number of comments and questions from my clients about what's happening here,

47
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,218
They don't get that information.

48
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:22,187
Instead, they get this behavior that's highly militarized, that is not, in my opinion, community driven, and that is indicative of criminals.

49
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:27,271
You know, you'd almost thought they had just been observed robbing a bank, which they did not, just to be clear.

50
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:30,654
You know, and so, unfortunately, these are two young people.

51
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:56,363
the Black young man is sort of brought out of the car first, again with this behavior of like, you know, walk backwards and walk slowly and keep your hands in sight and things of that nature, while his partner, the young lady in the car, Habak, is told, as she kind of looks back fearfully for her friend, she's told, face forward, keep your eyes straight, don't turn your head, and all of the time remember that there are guns, there are guns,

52
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,945
pointed at my clients, these two young people.

53
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:08,452
And so for multiple moments, both these young people are held, they're detained unlawfully, the vehicle is searched, their person is searched.

54
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,835
And again, they are very much treated as criminals.

55
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:29,214
After all of this, after a number of attempts to get information when they're not given any information, after the car is searched sort of under duress by Jeremiah, who's like, I mean, I'm standing here in cuffs with guns pointed at me and you want to search my car, I suppose, what else do you say?

56
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:30,674
But yes, you may search my car.

57
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:32,955
The car is searched.

58
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:41,138
And when ultimately all of this fanfare by the police department results in nothing, results in finding no weapons, results in finding nothing illegal,

59
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:51,720
Finally, our clients are removed from the handcuffs and it's explained to them, allegedly, that this is policy, this is procedure, right?

60
00:06:52,761 --> 00:07:02,192
There's a brief information given about something related to an anonymous tip, and maybe the vehicle being related to that tip, and eventually my clients are asked,

61
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,201
do you think your friend is paying a joke on you?

62
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:17,588
And again, my clients who are, to be quite honest, who are traumatized by this, who are still traumatized to this day, and for people who don't know it, when we're talking about last summer, what we're talking about is not just the wake of George Floyd.

63
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:23,271
At the time that my clients were stopped, we're talking about just about the three-month window after

64
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:31,878
the trial of the murder of George Floyd, which if many people remember happened, the verdict came down on the exact same day that another black man was shot and killed.

65
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:42,207
And shortly in that same week I believe the young boy the Latino boy in New York had been shot in the back of the head so I mean, we're talking about the timing of this incident.

66
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:55,838
despite how any department may call this something that was innocent, was happening in a highly, highly polarized and highly traumatic time for people of color, at least anybody, to be frank, who's watching the news right now.

67
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:07,727
What I like to tell people is that it's very hard to believe as a person of color that officer friendly exists anymore in America, because that is not the lived experience of most people of color when they engage with police.

68
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:12,631
So ultimately, as my clients did nothing wrong, they're, they're like, go.

69
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,835
And unfortunately, that's not the end of the story.

70
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:28,187
What follows is then quite a bit of difficulty in terms of gathering any additional information, trying to get documentation of this experience, trying to understand why it happened and what they can do in response to it.

71
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:46,319
And as they sort of struggle to try to do that on their own, they're eventually referred to lawyers for civil rights where I work and so then we with the assistance of a pro bono firm started to sit down with them and put the pieces together and gather documents and information to produce what you guys have now seen which is this complaint that was

72
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:55,282
late last month to support them and to ensure that there's some transparency and some accountability around what my clients experienced.

73
00:08:55,562 --> 00:09:03,664
And then to think about what can the, what can the sort of referration material, like steps be, what can we do to ensure that this doesn't happen to other people?

74
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:08,726
And we are curious to hear more about that.

75
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:14,148
I wonder if you could also summarize what is being asked for from your clients, from the city.

76
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:20,398
Sure, so I mean, I would categorize it in basically in two ways.

77
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:22,820
So there's some dignity asked here, right?

78
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,381
They're looking for an apology.

79
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:30,624
At the end of the day, they're looking to be told or acknowledged that their experience was wrong, right?

80
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:36,508
And as simplistic as that seems, you'd find it, it's a very rare thing, unfortunately, for people to receive that.

81
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:43,953
So that's sort of front and foremost for them is that desire to just be treated like a dignified individual.

82
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:54,337
Then they have multiple asks that are related to reforming this process going forward, ensuring that there's structural changes so that other individuals don't have the experience they did.

83
00:09:54,877 --> 00:10:08,739
We're looking for some changes to the policies and procedures that are existing that simply did not go far enough to assist the clients, and then the creation of new policies and procedures to ensure that this sort of behavior doesn't continue going forward.

84
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,060
And we'd be looking for that to be done in

85
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,202
in concert with an expert that we could recommend.

86
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:25,811
So somebody who has the cultural competence to recognize sort of the racial lens that has to be used when thinking through the development of this practice, this practice or this policy or this procedure.

87
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:48,156
Coupled with that, we're also looking for ongoing mandatory implicit bias sort of training to ensure that, again, these officers have some awareness about the context of American history and present day in terms of stopping two young black people at gunpoint with, you know, a dozen cops or half a dozen cops.

88
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:59,101
So thinking through ongoing training that isn't just one-off, you know, because we know that implicit bias training does not do anything unless it's repeated, unless it's mandatory.

89
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:03,643
So not looking for voluntary training and not looking for one-off training, but something that's going to be repeated.

90
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:09,666
And then we're looking for compensation for the clients themselves, for the emotional distress that they've experienced.

91
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:11,307
Thank you.

92
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:20,542
So what does one clarifying question is I'd heard about like a request for so or like when they investigate what happened.

93
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:28,007
How does that like I would imagine it's like who does that, how does that in a way that's like unbiased or impartial.

94
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:35,152
A good question to be quite frank, we don't have good structures in America to ensure that the.

95
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:43,865
that the fact finders and the decision makers for holding people, particularly police departments accountable are very impartial.

96
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:54,257
So in Massachusetts, when, for example, there's a excessive force complaint or a shooting death case even, so a wrongful death case, the officers are typically looked at by the

97
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:07,576
The district attorney's office, but the district attorney's office as you can imagine work day in and day out with police departments, you know with police so I think one would really have to beg the question how impartial that investigator could be.

98
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:21,404
Here we don't even have that strenuous of an investigation occurring because this is not something at this point that has raised the specter of sort of criminal liability, which is why the DA's office would normally look into it.

99
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:28,910
And so as it's just a civil matter, it is being reviewed by the equivalent of the internal affairs division of the police department.

100
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:36,015
And so basically the police are policing themselves, which as you can see, likely would lead to a problem.

101
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,832
That was my fear.

102
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:40,959
I think Shelly has a couple of questions.

103
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:45,118
Yeah, I mean, thank you so much for what you're sharing.

104
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:49,300
And while you're speaking, I am reflecting on a speech I gave to the city of Medford.

105
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,903
And for this, this is both so Medford centered and also so global.

106
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:07,209
I gave a speech on policing coming out of slave patrol and coming out of the control and the management of the black body and the sort of inherent fear of sort of resistance and uprising.

107
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:09,870
I'm wondering you were you

108
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,994
touched on reviewing existing policies, reform, creating new policy.

109
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:27,123
I'm wondering if you have thoughts on other municipalities that are pursuing this in a really intentional way that's feeling like, you know, folks are making progress and it's strong.

110
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:31,947
Are there places where things are being done well, room for improvement, that kind of thing?

111
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:42,477
And then I also think I'm wondering about, like we mentioned earlier, what can folks be doing to support and at what sort of level of conversation?

112
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:55,886
I think there's a lot of like community handholding, but how are we accessing discussion of actual policy that should be in place to kind of mitigate officer friendly or the narrative of officer friendly?

113
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,781
Yeah, so good question.

114
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:03,886
So let's talk about sort of what we're seeing across the state and what lessons that can be learned there.

115
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:08,409
I try really hard despite my job, right, to be optimistic.

116
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,452
And so the hope is there is somebody out there doing it right.

117
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:17,316
And I don't know about it because those community members are not coming to me in fear and seeking help through a legal process.

118
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:18,897
That's going to be my hope, right?

119
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,759
And I believe that exists.

120
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,720
It has to exist somewhere.

121
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:29,763
However, what I know for certain is that Massachusetts is very slowly making headway.

122
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,324
And what do I mean by that?

123
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:42,289
You know, I don't think we went nearly far enough with our sort of police reform legislation and all the commissions that created, or even the post commission to think about decertification.

124
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:48,952
We were the last, we're literally one of the last four states in the United States to have any sort of decertification process.

125
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:50,092
That's horrendous.

126
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:55,315
We should never have a reputation for being the last of the states to do something right.

127
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:57,897
But we have finally done that, right?

128
00:14:57,937 --> 00:15:08,022
We finally now created some oversight through government action to ensure that police officers are held to some standard, the way we do doctors, the way we do barbers, the way we do lawyers, right?

129
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,824
So that, I think, is a promising sign.

130
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:17,868
I think that the ideas of accountability are becoming more widely accepted and more widely discussed.

131
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:33,745
I also think the ideas of transparency are becoming more widely accepted you know for years there has been so much debate around public records requests, even something as simple as getting your own incident report about something where you're the victim, and how challenging that's been.

132
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:43,488
For us who are practitioners in this field, it's been so challenging to try to get internal affairs and disciplinary records, like personnel records of officers.

133
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:45,849
Like, you want to know if there's smoke, there's fire, right?

134
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:51,490
If my client's accusing somebody of doing something who's done it 10 times before, that is an institutional problem.

135
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,751
And we deserve and should know that information.

136
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:56,151
And we shouldn't have to sue you to get that information.

137
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,932
But that has been an ongoing battle for so many years.

138
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:09,876
But, you know, steps have been taken to ensure that more transparency is occurring, just by even producing those internal affair records at the state level, so they're more accessible to people.

139
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,818
So I think we are going in the right direction.

140
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:16,879
You know, the reality is that nothing good in life happens quickly.

141
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:17,620
That's just true.

142
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:27,827
I think that in, for myself, when I think about the role I hope to play in the overall community through my work is that I hope I just make things a little less bad.

143
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:46,573
And I hope, you know, that doesn't sound bad, but I think for me, that really, that's a success story, to give people a little more power, a little more accountability, a little more agency in their lives, a little more belief that the law applies to them, that jurisprudence can be something that reflects their real lived experience, it can be something that can help them,

144
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:49,735
that's just never going to happen in my lifetime.

145
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:53,916
But if I make it a little less bad, then that means that I've done something.

146
00:16:54,397 --> 00:17:06,239
So, I mean, that's a long-winded way to say we're not there yet anywhere, to be quite honest, because if we were, we wouldn't be turning on the news, looking at the countless number of Black bodies that are constantly being victimized, period.

147
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:12,641
And I just don't think we can pat ourselves on the back anywhere if one little place is doing it right, but the rest of the cities and towns aren't in a state.

148
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,614
But I think as a collective, people are starting to get it.

149
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:19,196
People are starting to figure out the vocab and the jargon.

150
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:21,277
They are starting to see where the pressure points are.

151
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:26,100
And they're starting to realize if they don't do this work, people like us are going to continue to sue them.

152
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:27,982
We're going to continue to drain their coffers.

153
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:31,304
We're going to continue to blast them out in the media, just like you guys are.

154
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:37,808
We are not going to sit idly by while people continue to decide that this is going to be policing as usual, because policing as usual is over.

155
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:38,729
It's over.

156
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:44,959
And if it means we have to take down every bad cop through every lawsuit for the rest of my career, then so be it.

157
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,322
But it's over.

158
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:47,464
Getting a pass is over.

159
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,165
Thank you.

160
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:55,806
Oh, you asked me about what you guys could do.

161
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,668
So maybe we switch to that.

162
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:57,948
Sorry.

163
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:02,394
You see, like you get me fired up and then I'll go off on a tangent.

164
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,600
So one thing I'll tell you is I didn't really know much about Medford before this case, to be quite honest.

165
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,344
I had not had any clients from the area before.

166
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:13,587
I've not worked on any cases against the city or town.

167
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:34,364
I have literally been floored by the outreach from the community, just by people reaching out and calling my office and emailing and phone calls and letters about how much they support the improvements we're seeking to the police department, how much they want to be a place that better reflects sort of progressive ideals.

168
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:45,077
I mean we have been reached out to by city council officials, you know, activists on the ground, just concerned folks, I've gotten to legal events and lawyers and walked up to me and been like,

169
00:18:46,123 --> 00:19:02,180
I live in Medford, tell me what I can do to help you know so I think there is really a desire on the ground there, and I think that is a really powerful thing and I think the police department should be really afraid of that, because at the end of the day, you guys are taxpayers, you guys make the decisions about the community that you pay for.

170
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,806
And so if they have to respond to you, even in a way that they don't always have to respond to me, you know.

171
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:12,649
And so I think continue to do what you're doing, you know, reaching out at city council meetings.

172
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:14,910
There are people sending letters to the mayor.

173
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:32,101
I understand that you guys recently had a diversity officer that was hired for Medford, and that she's not been there very long but I think really encouraging and pressuring her to do the good work to actually move the needle and ensuring that your city and town is giving her the resources and agency to do that good work.

174
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:33,883
I think that is really important.

175
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:53,888
It may not be a role yet that you guys can see dividends paying from, but the fact that you have that role is such a powerful thing because there's so many cities and towns that don't even have it yet, you know, and so I think there are a lot of pieces on the ground that you like tools you guys have to work with to try to get this message moving forward, but more so than anything you just can't allow complacency.

176
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,349
Right, like you can't let the conversation die.

177
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,030
Because if you do, then they win.

178
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,411
Because that's what they're waiting for.

179
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:04,794
They're waiting for us to, they're waiting for us to sit back and get quiet or move on to the next thing.

180
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,755
And that's what we just can't afford to do.

181
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:10,717
It's really helpful.

182
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:13,099
Shelly, I'm wondering if you have any follow up questions.

183
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,970
I mean, I'm loving it.

184
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:31,076
I think we're all having a discussion of lockdown led to a certain level of energy and reflection on everybody's current moment, irrespective of where your politics sit by nature of the experience.

185
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:35,158
And I think I've been part of conversations that say, well, what happened to all that energy?

186
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:36,238
We were all fired up.

187
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,339
We were all stuck in the house.

188
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:38,539
We were all thinking.

189
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:42,061
And now we're bleeding back into whatever post-COVID looks like.

190
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,342
And I've already felt.

191
00:20:45,202 --> 00:21:01,890
kind of a diminishment of that kind of collective energy and how to how to keep on keeping on how to maintain how to capitalize on what was discussed and turn into action, I think are all worthwhile discussions.

192
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:15,566
I'm also not used to hearing lawyers speak so passionately about their work I was worried this might be kind of a dry conversation but I've taken away so much from this conversation, and like I really appreciate your perspective and it's been really helpful to listen to.

193
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:18,012
Like, thank you so much.

194
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:19,572
I really appreciate that.

195
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,813
And I appreciate that, like, at least I try.

196
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:26,394
I try very hard to live that I'm Sophia first, the lawyer second, because I'm a first gen.

197
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:29,274
I grew up in a family of people that look like the people I represent.

198
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:33,275
You know, I get their lived experience because I lived it, and the people who raised me lived it.

199
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:36,395
And at the end of the day, me being a lawyer is the tool.

200
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:39,716
Like, it happens to be the role I play, but we're all playing a role here.

201
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:43,057
And to be quite honest, we need to stop worrying about fanfare.

202
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:45,177
Like, we need to stop worrying about having this,

203
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:49,099
look a certain way or sound a certain way, because the reality is it just is.

204
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:50,420
And it just is wrong.

205
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,782
And so we have to think about, I want this to be accessible to normal people.

206
00:21:54,942 --> 00:22:02,307
I want what I do as a lawyer, as legal work, to be accessible to normal people, because I want them to know that they count too, that these laws are for them.

207
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:08,230
And so I think that just remembering I'm one of them when I do this every day, for me, is really critical.

208
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,932
I believe that I'm here because my clients brought me here.

209
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,614
I believe that I followed their leads and not the other way around.

210
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:22,601
So, you know, I hope that we get to a place where they can see their effort payoff.

211
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:32,770
I hope that we get to a place where Medford recognize they have an opportunity right now, the department has an opportunity right this minute to recognize that this could be a catalyst for change, and they could take it.

212
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:33,871
And if they don't.

213
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:36,113
Then we pursue other options.

214
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:37,573
Then we think about dragging people to court.

215
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:39,134
Then we think about making this dirty.

216
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:44,717
But what I hope is that they use this as a moment in time to realize that they could be better.

217
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:46,338
And they have a shot.

218
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:47,898
And so they should take it.

219
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:49,959
I have the same hope.

220
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,140
Yeah.

221
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:53,329
Well, thank you.

222
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:57,331
I know you want to be mindful of Sophia, the attorney and your time.

223
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:00,513
So thank you so much for spending time with us today.

224
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:04,155
And we wish you luck on this case and everything else.

225
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:05,396
Thank you.

226
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,036
I appreciate it.

227
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:06,677
Thank you.

228
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:16,497
Thanks so much to Sophia.

229
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:19,078
