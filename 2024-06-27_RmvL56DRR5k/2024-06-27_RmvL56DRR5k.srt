1
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:21,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

2
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:24,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I'm here.

3
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:25,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

4
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,978
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

5
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and get started here.

[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear that you call me.

[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting is called to order.

21
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:14,047
[SPEAKER_00]: First item that we're just, that we're going to discuss is

22
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:20,070
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-354, the resolution to publish a City Council newsletter.

23
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:28,194
[SPEAKER_00]: A draft of the newsletter was forwarded to everybody in the agenda packet.

24
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:34,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, earlier today, forwarded a copy, an updated

25
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:42,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy of the newsletter with some suggestions to reflect events from the meeting last night.

26
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:47,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callahan, you have a?

27
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you're done, I just, I have two very small changes.

28
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:51,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yep, yep.

29
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:56,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to share my screen really quickly, one moment.

30
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Okey dokey.

31
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:14,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So this newsletter, as per the.

32
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:26,009
[SPEAKER_00]: As per the schedule that we voted on earlier, was drafted by Council President Bears.

33
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:38,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I submitted, I forwarded the link to everybody here, made a couple of suggestions, and then Councilor Bears earlier today also edited those to provide his own suggestions.

34
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:45,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So if folks have anything that they'd like to add to the newsletter,

35
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:47,324
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free.

36
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:48,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with Councilor Callahan.

37
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:57,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm having trouble with my mute button.

38
00:05:58,276 --> 00:05:58,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

39
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:02,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Just two very small things in the very first paragraph.

40
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:03,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I would

41
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have us use a word other than elected.

42
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:08,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I tripped over it when I read it.

43
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:18,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if we can say we voted to place or, you know, there's other ways to put that I would just use a different word than elected.

44
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's easy to read, like, we were elected to place these, you know what I'm saying?

45
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just another word.

46
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other one is... Sorry, can you, wait, sorry.

47
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find exactly where.

48
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:37,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you said elected with voted, sorry.

49
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:42,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just change it to voted and then people won't be, they won't trip over it.

50
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:45,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready for my second one?

51
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:57,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, okay, so it looks like that was our in the latest updates from Council President Bears.

52
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,784
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like he already struck that out and replaced it with.

53
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:05,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going off the one that you sent out today, which I thought was the latest.

54
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:07,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

55
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:13,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I mention my only other thing, and then if you guys already fixed it, then great.

56
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that okay?

57
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:14,456
Okay.

58
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,898
[SPEAKER_03]: It's under general business.

59
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:20,646
[SPEAKER_03]: The first bullet point should be two sentences.

60
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:25,948
[SPEAKER_03]: One about the budget and the second one about the school system.

61
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,609
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a little confusing and kind of run on.

62
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:29,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

63
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

64
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,868
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you seeing the changes that I made?

65
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:12,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this fine with you?

66
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great.

67
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:13,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

68
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:14,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

69
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:15,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

70
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:21,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone else have any suggestions for the current draft of the newsletter?

71
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:22,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Tseng.

72
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:35,569
[SPEAKER_01]: The three points we put one and then like parentheses, two parentheses, three parentheses.

73
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

74
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:51,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we could also break it down into smaller little points, but I don't know if that will fit on the page.

75
00:08:52,283 --> 00:09:03,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with the final PDF, why it would end up being formatted, I'm not 100% sure about that.

76
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:09,656
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do agree, this generally does make it more readable.

77
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:14,453
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helpful.

78
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:28,107
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one thing that I wanted to, substance-wise, I think you and Councilor Callaghan had met with the Brazilian population, right, and had a listening group session.

79
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:32,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be worth mentioning in resident services.

80
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:42,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if we covered the senior center listing session in the last newsletter, but if we didn't, then this would be a good place to mention it as well.

81
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,057
[SPEAKER_00]: What date was that?

82
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,719
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah.

83
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:28,227
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do remember what exactly the date was that we met with the.

84
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:30,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Friday.

85
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Friday, so it was a week ago Friday.

86
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the 19th.

87
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a good idea to just briefly summarize what was discussed or just state that we did it.

88
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I think either would work.

89
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:30,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if- I would just state that we did it, honestly.

90
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:39,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we- because otherwise, like, some people might be offended that their thing didn't get mentioned, and I think it's easier to just say that we met with them and had a fruitful discussion.

91
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.

92
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I always write things in a very boring way, so let me know if-

93
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:49,143
[SPEAKER_00]: like these two are, you know, sufficiently descriptive.

94
00:11:54,184 --> 00:12:10,647
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on this topic, would, Carolyn, would you be comfortable summarizing some of what you did here from the two listening sessions?

95
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:25,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was actually, and and I were kind of talking about how to present how to present that so I was, I mean, we like I did take notes from them, I was kind of thinking that maybe.

96
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:36,861
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of a quarterly report on it, but we were sort of thinking like, okay, you know, do residents see these listening sessions as being semi-confidential?

97
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:40,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do they not want notes of what they talked about to be public record?

98
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:44,244
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that those things would need to be discussed.

99
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:50,727
[SPEAKER_00]: It would definitely be a good agenda item to bring up formally for the next resident services meeting.

100
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:54,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if we would have time or be able to discuss it extensively

101
00:12:55,612 --> 00:13:01,718
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular meeting because it's not on the agenda, but maybe we could.

102
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:02,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

103
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:09,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think, I mean, my interpretation of laws, it's fine because we're already talking about it.

104
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:13,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a natural place for discussion, but I also don't want to step on anyone's toes.

105
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it makes sense to have a formal paper number if you want that or a formal

106
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:22,992
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have that be on the agenda for sure.

107
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just chime in very quickly?

108
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:27,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Calderon.

109
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:29,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

110
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:43,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say that I think an easy way to make it okay for the populations that we're talking to is to have the person who organized it just send them a draft.

111
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:46,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we're gonna say anything super personal.

112
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:47,378
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not gonna mention anybody.

113
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,200
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we send them a draft and be like, hey, this is what we're gonna say.

114
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,562
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't let us know by next week, we'll go ahead with it.

115
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That at least gives us, you know,

116
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:05,343
[SPEAKER_03]: like allows them to say, oh, you know, they prefer that they that we don't mention that one thing.

117
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:08,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.

118
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if we're worried about, um,

119
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:13,718
[SPEAKER_01]: , I think it's a good point.

120
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:14,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point.

121
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point.

122
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point.

123
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point.

124
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point.

[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point.

131
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:28,710

139
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:35,896

[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good point

147
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:59,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I mean this, it is it is definitely something and I was also kind of thinking like that this would actually come up in the next agenda item because some of the stuff that we did here at the listening sessions would be relevant to the city guide that we're talking about, but I do agree that having it.

148
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:13,242
[SPEAKER_00]: be discussed and sort of like the ideas like sort of codified and shared with the rest of the council is definitely gets to the spirit of those listening sessions.

149
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:14,783
[SPEAKER_00]: To the

150
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,029
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.

151
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:29,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other, and again, I apologize for some of the last minute updates, but the goal with these is to summarize the most recent events leading up to the current meeting.

152
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:37,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other feedback that individual, that Councilors have about the current draft of the newsletter that you'd like to see?

153
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:45,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it looks fine, but if you could just keep the edits up on the screen for me to, the new stuff up on the screen for me to quickly look through.

154
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a link to the?

155
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:53,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the link, but it doesn't show, because we don't have edit access, it doesn't show these recommendations.

156
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:55,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, oh, oh.

157
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:56,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why we've been kind of.

158
00:15:56,797 --> 00:16:00,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, okay, I did not, sorry, I didn't know that, okay, so.

159
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:09,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was so to be clear about the process for doing this.

160
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:18,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Google documents that I share with the individual Councilors who need to who are drafting that current one.

161
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:23,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know that people who just view these things don't actually see the current edits Councilor Lazzaro.

162
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:32,282
[SPEAKER_04]: One suggestion, the pink above where your cursor is, can you change the word suffering?

163
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:43,067
[SPEAKER_04]: At the June 11th meeting, we passed a resolution to recognize and discuss the Stop the Stigma campaign, which humanizes our neighbors with substance use disorder, please.

164
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:47,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, sorry.

165
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Strike out suffering from and just change it to with.

166
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:53,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffering from.

167
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

168
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:17,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also just kind of scroll through this and very slowly to give everybody, I will fix, I will address this issue the next time so that, I'm just gonna start from the top, okay?

169
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:23,591
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, again, apologies that I didn't know that it was invisible to people who just had view access to this.

170
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:47,501
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sort of summarizing the updates, Council President Baird has added the resolutions commemorating individuals at the last meeting, Sylvia Janis, Don Alasky, as well as Tom Lincoln, and the passing of former Medford Police Department Detective Lauren Kane.

171
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added those to commemorations and acknowledgements.

172
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,367
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the acknowledgement of the Stop the Stigma campaign from a June 11th meeting.

173
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:58,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I added in...

174
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:12,689
[SPEAKER_00]: The appointments from the June 25th meeting to the Affordable Housing Trust, the Community Preservation Committee, and the free cash allocation to the study for the new Medford High School.

175
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:22,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Council President Bears has added details about the stabilization funds that we also allocated free cash to right here.

176
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:33,606
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just kind of detailing what happened later on last night in the meeting.

177
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:44,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And we approved the new South Street historic district ordinance for its first reading.

178
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:47,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just summarizing what happened yesterday.

179
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:56,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Some edits to the Public Works and Facilities Committee, which recognize the fact that

180
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:05,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro's resolution to host a discussion of MassDOT plans for the Medford Square Main Street intersection.

181
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:16,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Planning and Permitting Committee, the zoning related recommendations of both Medford's comprehensive climate plan and how they can best be incorporated into the zoning update project.

182
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:23,202
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the May 28th regular meeting, first round of zoning updates from the zoning update project.

183
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:36,328
[SPEAKER_00]: June 12th committee meetings, zoning up the project, council's priorities, policies and plan recommendations implement, and a draft timeline of what elements of the project should be started first.

184
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:53,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, the licensing of the methadone clinic that we referred to committee yesterday, as well as the planning, the,

185
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:59,304
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning update projects, timeline, and maps from the planning and permitting committee.

186
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:00,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, yep.

187
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:05,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a small grammar point in the methadone point.

188
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:10,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of saying it, because the thing's plural.

189
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So the third line, it says to account for it.

190
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:17,089
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about licenses, permits, and zoning.

191
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:20,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Them or these factors, yeah.

192
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:25,477
[SPEAKER_00]: features.

193
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:28,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

194
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:29,019
[SPEAKER_00]: 25th point.

195
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's about all.

196
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Does do any Councilors have any suggestions for further edits to this draft?

197
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:46,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, my apologies for the fact that most most people here couldn't see the updates until just now.

198
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:48,987
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.

199
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pending any further remarks.

200
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to move to approve this for distribution.

201
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:55,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Move.

202
00:20:56,018 --> 00:21:02,467
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a motion on the floor on the motion by Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

203
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll.

204
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

205
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

206
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:14,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming?

207
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:14,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

208
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

209
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

210
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,542
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 in the affirmative, 1 absent.

211
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:24,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion passes.

212
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:26,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on.

213
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:32,429
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-370 offered by Councilor Tseng.

214
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:39,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Resolution to create a residence guide to City Council's procedures and processes.

215
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:54,955
[SPEAKER_00]: be it resolved that the Resident Services Public Engagement Committee create and publish a short guide in English and commonly spoken non-English languages to the City Council for residents to understand the City Council's procedures and processes.

216
00:21:56,397 --> 00:22:01,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine this could just be a general discussion of our ideas of what this should contain.

217
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:04,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any comments on the floor?

218
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:05,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Tseng.

219
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:07,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.

220
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for putting this on the agenda for this meeting, Chair Leming.

221
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:16,334
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my resolution, so I feel like I should introduce it real quick.

222
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:22,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we generally know what I'm talking about here, but I was thinking we could make a short one pager where

223
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,979
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing what we do and how we work as a city council to residents.

224
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,819
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that we've heard in public participation over the last few meetings.

225
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:38,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people get a little confused about, you know, when we take a vote, why can't we have public participation after that?

226
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:46,882
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it's disposed of, you know, basic things like that, the order of a meeting, what Robert's rules are, you know, what it means to talk through the chair.

227
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:52,883
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some, you know, big basic frequently asked questions that we get that we could find a way to organize

228
00:22:54,324 --> 00:23:04,732
[SPEAKER_01]: on to a one pager that we put out in the audience and we leave some copies up here with Larry during the meetings for residents to access and that we can post on the city website.

229
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:15,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our rules document is very comprehensive, but also very, you know, I don't think residents have the time or nor the energy to read through our whole rules document.

230
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:15,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

231
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:19,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking that we could put together something short.

232
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:28,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also thinking that for the translations, we can work with community liaisons and translators in our community to create that doc.

233
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:44,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to be the one to put this together, but I wanted to make sure that this was put on the agenda tonight so I could solicit feedback from all my fellow Councilors about what are some important points to put on this document.

234
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:47,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Callahan.

235
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:49,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

236
00:23:49,507 --> 00:23:50,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I love the idea.

237
00:23:53,772 --> 00:24:07,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in addition to what we hear from people who already attend the meetings, I would hope that maybe at the top, we put some information for people who have never attended a meeting that simply says, hey, here's how to find out what we're going to talk about.

238
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:08,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how to come.

239
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what will happen when you come to City Hall.

240
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:21,089
[SPEAKER_03]: You will have the opportunity to speak for three minutes on any topic, like letting people who've never been know that they are welcome and how they can begin participating.

241
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:23,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

242
00:24:23,843 --> 00:24:26,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

243
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

244
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:30,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a great idea.

245
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:38,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, I like the concept of the one pager as a really accessible length.

246
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:48,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think that maybe if we started, maybe if we had an online document that was a one pager with maybe click through FAQs, because I think it could very quickly

247
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:51,344
[SPEAKER_04]: turn into a longer document.

248
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:58,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get into Robert's rules, when you get into what does it mean to speak through the chair, I think those answers are gonna get longer.

249
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:09,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think like just the basic information about what our city council based on our charter has under its purview.

250
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:16,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the city council is in charge of zoning, approving the budget and ordinances.

251
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are like the big things that we do.

252
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:25,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are different from what the mayor's administration does and different from what the school committee does.

253
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:30,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the three biggest branches of our local government.

254
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:37,346
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, maybe working in conjunction with the mayor's office and the school committee to help

255
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,657
[SPEAKER_04]: residents understand what those differences are.

256
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:51,841
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they need to do something that doesn't fall under the umbrella of the city council, that they can go to one of those different departments to figure that out.

257
00:25:53,142 --> 00:26:08,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I find often that people will come to city council for something that might be a mayor's administration issue or a city issue that's under like public works or something like that, or a school committee issue, really it's something about like,

258
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's being taught in the schools or something to do with a teacher or something to do with the school administration that's really a school committee issue.

259
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:27,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So that being said, I do think a one-pager is great, but that maybe there can be something that's like a longer thing that we can go to, whether that's online or on paper.

260
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:57,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize what I've heard, people generally like the idea of having a short one page for people to go through, but with the possibility of having supplementary documents that explain in more detail what the different rules and processes are, the having something just right at the top for people who've literally never been to city council meetings before, and just like very quick,

261
00:26:58,592 --> 00:27:18,849
[SPEAKER_00]: like quick and dirty sort of points like, you know, when we take a vote, why there's not necessarily public participation there, as well as basic info about what the city council is in charge of and what falls under purview of other departments.

262
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:30,407
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of format, I mean, I, I think it would be a good idea to have a one pager and like you see that little plastic thing right there where they have agendas out.

263
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:32,529
[SPEAKER_00]: So just have something like that sitting out there.

264
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:37,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be a good idea since this will be printed to have everything in black and white.

265
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:45,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to not like, and this is just my initial take, try not like indulge too much in like super colorful graphics, but just kind of keep like a very

266
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,069
[SPEAKER_00]: basic presentation.

267
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:53,034
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing would be to have it done in multiple languages.

268
00:27:54,035 --> 00:28:01,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we don't have to have graphics or anything, but just make it so that it looks reasonable when you print it off on a laser printer.

269
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,503
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other piece of feedback I have.

270
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:12,950
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do agree that a nice one pager for people who come in here have never attended a meeting before and can just kind of like take that as something to hold would be

271
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:15,905
[SPEAKER_00]: very, would be a very nice thing.

272
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:20,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

273
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:23,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you be, I'm just thinking about the drafting.

274
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:32,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be reasonable to have something like, not way too colorful, but a little color for the digital version and then something that prints well on black and white?

275
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:36,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my,

276
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:47,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading up to this meeting, I actually was thinking that having a nice, colorful graphics-based thing would be a really cool product to show people.

277
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,974
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also thinking about practicality.

278
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:53,537
[SPEAKER_00]: When people come to a city council meeting, it's often in person.

279
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:56,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard a lot of people say, this is my first city council meeting.

280
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what's going on.

281
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:01,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get these agenda packets,

282
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:14,352
[SPEAKER_00]: very often, and this is something that I even mentioned last night, the PDFs are sort of like very nice looking, very presentable, very colorful.

283
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:21,976
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they're printed, and again, this is just like a super practical issue, it just doesn't translate well into black and white.

284
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:26,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be the reality of residents that are actually holding this guide.

285
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,259
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think simplicity is

286
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:55,237
[SPEAKER_01]: name of the game here it doesn't necessarily have to be pretty but it does have to be like okay if a person is holding this piece of paper they can kind of get the gist of what's going on yeah i would agree i don't think they're mutually exclusive so i guess what if you're comfortable with it what i could do is create a digital version one that's designed for digital and one that's designed for um

287
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:59,079
[SPEAKER_01]: in-person use, they wouldn't be very different.

288
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:10,466
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, maybe the digital one has hyperlinks to like an FAQ or something, whereas the printed one is just the bare basics of what we're trying to express.

289
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:16,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, with the digital, maybe you'd have blue for hyperlinks or something.

290
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:29,714
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a movie that I saw a clip of one time as well, where it discussed the process of designing a new type of tank within the Pentagon.

291
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:37,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout the design process, different generals kept on giving their different pieces of input to the design of this thing.

292
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:45,644
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end product was something that had been completely designed by committee and was like, like totally impractical.

293
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,406
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that

294
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:52,227
[SPEAKER_00]: there is that element of that in making this as well.

295
00:30:52,307 --> 00:31:03,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally, I think you're, I think you may be expecting that I'm going to create something masterful and colorful and I assure you, I do not have that.

296
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:14,391
[SPEAKER_00]: My point in saying that is that we are giving these suggestions and I have my own opinions on this, but you know, you know, you're the, you're the artist, so.

297
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,992
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's important.

298
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,292
[SPEAKER_03]: You're confusing him with Kit.

299
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,093
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Kit.

300
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:27,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be sitting in Kit's seat right now.

301
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:29,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

302
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:30,736
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.

303
00:31:30,776 --> 00:31:36,078
[SPEAKER_00]: We're discussing what's essentially an artistic project and we don't have the one artist on city council on this committee.

304
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:40,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, I could see some issues with that.

305
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:55,284
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, that is to say we are making these suggestions, but it is important to filter through what is the most essential information for someone who has no idea what's going on, try to put that front and center.

306
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:58,546
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this is that if somebody's entering these chambers,

307
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:01,978
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know anything.

308
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:15,330
[SPEAKER_00]: They can read this piece of paper and get the 411 and oftentimes having too much information in one place could end up not being beneficial for that.

309
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

310
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:19,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I do also wonder if we

311
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:39,972
[SPEAKER_04]: This may not be what we're talking about tonight, but I think that there might be a benefit to a guide for people who are coming in for their first council meeting, hoping to speak on an agenda item, and they don't know how or when or how to go about that.

312
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:49,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can be really intimidating, not knowing where to sit, not knowing who everybody is, what is a clerk,

313
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:54,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like genuinely, these are confusing processes.

314
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:57,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of me wonders about like,

315
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:01,163
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe it's a second, oh, sorry, maybe it's a second one pager.

316
00:33:01,183 --> 00:33:10,588
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like, so this is your first council meeting and you would like to speak on an agenda item.

317
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:12,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the process.

318
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:27,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would, if that's like more than you would wanna do, I would be happy to draft something if we end up wanting to maybe address that, because I think it would be separate from an introduction to the work of the council, what the council does.

319
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,686
[SPEAKER_04]: because that might be a separate thing.

320
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:31,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

321
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:32,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

322
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:36,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a color printer in this building?

323
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:37,589
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

324
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:38,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

325
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,551
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we should definitely design for black and white printing.

326
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:42,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

327
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:43,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair?

328
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:43,732
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.

329
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:45,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Callahan.

330
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:45,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

331
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:58,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm now that I'm hearing all these things, I'm envisioning like a table at the front of the hall, the minute people walk in the door, and there's one that says, so it's your first council meeting.

332
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,028
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one, like the green one says, so it's your first council meeting.

333
00:34:01,328 --> 00:34:04,189
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue one says, here's the purview of the city council.

334
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:09,730
[SPEAKER_03]: The yellow one says, frequently asked questions from people who have attended council meetings.

335
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:15,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're all like separate pages that just cover a sort of one topic.

336
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:27,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's going overboard, but that's what once councilors are starting speaking, then I was like, Oh, like, this could be something that people can be like, Oh, which of these is the right, you know, one for me, if we can't put everything on one page.

337
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:30,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

338
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:52,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the goal should, I think we should set the goal of still trying to put everything on one page, but I guess, it seems like we're in agreement that if it becomes unwieldy, then creating a second one-pager might make sense, and separating out, like, if this is your first time at a city council meeting versus, like, maybe something along the lines of, like, purview and stuff like that.

339
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes sense.

340
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:57,843
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do, with Anna's suggestion,

341
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:07,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I am inclined to think so having, starting out with like a city council guide that looks clean, smooth, one pager would be great.

342
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:23,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably expanding to having something out front for that, you know, if we have like a nice city council one, we could also then do a general city hall one, which may be, okay, this is your first time in city hall, if you are a,

343
00:35:24,716 --> 00:35:29,941
[SPEAKER_00]: small business owner, go to this department on this floor, you can talk to this person and something like that.

344
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:45,655
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, so there should be room to be able to scale it to other departments, but the initial model, just to keep the project simple, I feel like, you know,

345
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:54,190
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, you know, we just started out by knowing what our scope is and just getting the first guide right.

346
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, after that, expanding to that, that's my opinion.

347
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:00,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

348
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:01,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good idea.

349
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:09,122
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned earlier on in the meeting that this is something that

350
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:17,992
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard a little bit about in your listening sessions that sometimes folks come to City Hall and they don't really know which office to go to.

351
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:20,013
[SPEAKER_01]: They find it a little confusing.

352
00:36:20,153 --> 00:36:21,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes a lot of sense.

353
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:33,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in terms of workflow, it might make sense for us to start with the City Council first, and then whether it's a new paper number or it's continued on this paper number, it might have to be a new paper number.

354
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:37,387
[SPEAKER_01]: that we create something for City Hall as well.

355
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:38,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that makes sense.

356
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:48,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to ask the committee whether you all thought that there was an organized way to solicit feedback.

357
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:53,894
[SPEAKER_01]: or solicit requests from the public about what they would like to see on the one pager.

358
00:36:53,914 --> 00:37:08,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking as an individual Councilor, I could post on my social media or on Reddit or something, a Google form asking for, you know, what would you be interested in seeing?

359
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:11,964
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if that's the most accessible way or the most, the best way to solicit.

360
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:13,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Lazzaro.

361
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:24,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we went through the social media guidelines for City Council social account, so we could post from that.

362
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:41,967
[SPEAKER_04]: if we wanted into, you know, Facebook groups or Reddit and just solicit using maybe a Google form, like what of the following would you be interested in learning about first, what would be the most important and present it like a survey.

363
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:49,350
[SPEAKER_04]: We could even have it attached to the newsletter when that goes out, like a link to the survey, if we want.

364
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:51,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, makes sense.

365
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:51,992
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

366
00:37:53,271 --> 00:38:05,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, with the survey, I think having a draft first, I think it would be more effective to have a draft and then put that out and ask for feedback on it.

367
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:08,321
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of my initial thoughts on it.

368
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:10,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And then say, is this helpful to you?

369
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:11,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give us feedback.

370
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:15,366
[SPEAKER_00]: And then update it from there just so that people sort of have an idea of what you're talking about.

371
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:20,209
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my thinking on that though.

372
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:23,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would, again, you're the artist.

373
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:33,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let me, I'm not gonna tell Van Gogh what shade of yellow to use in the process.

374
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:43,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, earlier on this in this meeting, I thought you were trying to do some big government regulation on the colors that we could use for the guy.

375
00:38:44,144 --> 00:38:44,624
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

376
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:50,247
[SPEAKER_01]: But um, but I think, I think both.

377
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,528
[SPEAKER_01]: comments have been said make a lot of sense.

378
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:56,570
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do that on like a city council social media account.

379
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I could just individually solicit feedback as well.

380
00:39:00,812 --> 00:39:06,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it does make sense to have something first and then to ask for feedback on it.

381
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:09,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm thinking about procedure.

382
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:11,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that approach makes more sense.

383
00:39:12,138 --> 00:39:15,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking about procedurally in city council, how that would go about.

384
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we would probably vote this

385
00:39:17,581 --> 00:39:21,663
[SPEAKER_01]: out favorably and then get the city council to approve it.

386
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:24,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what would have to happen.

387
00:39:26,144 --> 00:39:32,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for us to edit it, then I'd have to present a new paper number, which seems a little bit cumbersome of a process.

388
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:38,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I am curious if Councilor Callaghan has any thoughts about this.

389
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callaghan, tell us your thoughts right now.

390
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:48,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm just talking for just a second.

391
00:39:48,477 --> 00:39:49,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me tell me again.

392
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:51,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me.

393
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in this packed room is waiting for your thoughts.

394
00:40:02,622 --> 00:40:03,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear me just ask you?

395
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:08,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was too busy making jokes.

396
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:19,692
[SPEAKER_00]: On the best way to get feedback for the guide from residents, the discussion was... No, that's cool.

397
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:20,193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

398
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:22,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great question.

399
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:24,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Your guess is as good as mine.

400
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:35,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what we could do is we could try to do both.

401
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:45,526
[SPEAKER_01]: We could try to put out like an initial ask for requests for input, and then try to incorporate that over the next month, and then

402
00:40:46,807 --> 00:41:03,951
[SPEAKER_01]: after let's say a few months, instead of maybe doing a formal request for feedback on the doc, just generally see organically if there's any feedback for edits and then revisit in a few months if we need to and create a new paper number for it.

403
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:11,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we're kind of looking at, I don't think that there would be much of an issue with

404
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:38,436
[SPEAKER_00]: you as an individual, as you're coming up with like an initial draft for this, posting this to one of your accounts just to get some feedback from folks and then bringing it to the body, which, and I'm mainly saying that just because that possibly would be a way to

405
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:50,353
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up the process and not have to like, you know, vote a vote, a draft of something out of a meeting and then get approval from the general body.

406
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:57,676
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just trying to think of ways to kind of simplify the process of drafting a one pager here.

407
00:41:57,696 --> 00:42:07,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think streamlining this simplifying us is

408
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:08,869
[SPEAKER_04]: in our interest.

409
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:16,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I would fall on the side of, like I suggested the other way, but I would fall on the side of drafting something and then asking.

410
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:18,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes a lot of sense.

411
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:24,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm down for it.

412
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:30,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is more streamlined in terms of like the, in a whole perspective view of it.

413
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:35,360
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just maybe a few more steps on the city council side of introducing paper numbers and stuff like that.

414
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,001
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not a problem with me either.

415
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:40,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cool.

416
00:42:41,795 --> 00:43:03,031
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of future directions, we did receive a, I mean, just because we said we were going to talk about this on the last agenda item, we did receive some feedback from some folks that are listening sessions who are saying that, you know, they go into city hall, they don't know

417
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:05,444
[SPEAKER_00]: like where to go from there.

418
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:31,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that we're talking about solely a city council, one pager guide for residents, but scaling, like moving forward, it would be good to have, it would be good to, you know, at least start thinking about, you know, if somebody literally enters the building and they wanna talk to someone about getting a license, then having something right there for them to,

419
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:49,785
[SPEAKER_00]: look at maybe having a greeter if that's a thing that City Hall has capacity for like I don't know the equivalent of a receptionist just right in the middle of City Hall would be a nice nice thing to have as soon as we

420
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:53,042
[SPEAKER_00]: get the funding for something like that.

421
00:43:53,062 --> 00:44:03,366
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, those are just some informal notes from our listening sessions.

422
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:09,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any further discussion on this agenda item?

423
00:44:10,886 --> 00:44:23,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just motion to let this committee authorize that I create a draft and that I present the draft before the next committee meeting.

424
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:44,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking timeline, it might make sense workload wise for me to have a draft on attached to the agenda for the next meeting and to have councilors send feedback through the chair or to me or through the clerk to me before that meeting so I can incorporate it into a draft.

425
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:49,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So Annie, did you get the entirety of that motion?

426
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally ready.

427
00:44:52,032 --> 00:44:52,713
[SPEAKER_01]: We can just say

428
00:44:56,492 --> 00:45:16,887
[SPEAKER_01]: have the committee authorize Councilor Tseng to create a draft before the next committee meeting and to solicit feedback through the clerk's office before that meeting as well.

429
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:18,028
[SPEAKER_02]: One pager.

430
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:20,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, on the one pager.

431
00:45:23,308 --> 00:45:28,630
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very controversial motion Councilor Tseng, do we have a, do we have a second on that?

432
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:33,731
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two.

433
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:40,753
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

434
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:50,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before we vote, do we have any public participation?

435
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:52,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody interested in public participation?

436
00:45:55,657 --> 00:46:03,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, seeing none in the chambers and none on Zoom, we'll go ahead and call the vote.
