1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:06,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome everyone to the Charter Study Committee Article 8 Subcommittee.

2
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:09,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Article 8 is Citizen Participation Mechanisms.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first item on the agenda is to review and accept the minutes from the last meeting.

4
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:20,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anyone had a chance to look at them?

5
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was March 13, was that right?

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:26,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

8
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:27,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

9
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:29,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

10
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:30,344
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor.

11
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:31,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:31,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

13
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:33,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

14
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So the minutes are accepted.

15
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:36,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:46,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, um, I think what I'll do is I'm just going to share the screen so we can just dive right into article eight.

17
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:53,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I, okay, hang on.

18
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:58,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, here, let me make it bigger because I know some people like it bigger.

19
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:23,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you were correct in, I put, I was supposed to find examples for free petition and then I put initiative petitions under free petitions, so I moved those down, but I did find a few other examples, Lawrence, Fall River, and Framingham.

20
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:28,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that they were relatively similar to what we have.

21
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:40,624
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference that I noticed was that they, a couple of them put in a distinction between individual petitions and group petitions.

22
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that.

23
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

24
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:49,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't feel a great need to do that, but I don't know how you guys feel.

25
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:54,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't either.

26
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:56,298
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the purpose?

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, exactly.

28
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically, yeah, exactly.

29
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:01,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I feel about it.

30
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:13,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess what it's saying is that if there's a petition that's signed by one or more voters, then it's up to their discretion whether they respond to them.

31
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like, why do you need to say that in the charter?

32
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:26,153
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the important part is to say what they do need to respond to, right?

33
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:43,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I thought the interesting part was that it seemed with the free petition, you know, the singular, that they could sort of dispose of it as they wish.

34
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:47,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess thinking about it a little bit now too,

35
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:55,204
[SPEAKER_02]: You can at city council, you can get up and.

36
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:59,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, during citizen participation.

37
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak about anything that's on your mind.

38
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:08,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and and they will address it in some fashion or another.

39
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They may do something or they may.

40
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:18,377
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a more involved topic because of open meeting law, sometimes they will.

41
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:27,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Defer and say, and 1 of them will put this on the agenda for the next regular meeting and then.

42
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:33,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Get into it more, so I don't see free petition being particularly helpful there.

43
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,261
[SPEAKER_02]: On school committee, though, now that I think a little bit about it.

44
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:39,442
[SPEAKER_02]: There.

45
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:57,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a big concern of mine with public participation in general, is that they seem to follow a whole different set of rules in regards to how they interpret open meeting law.

46
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't quite understand that.

47
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to go through a whole lot of hoops.

48
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:08,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't feel that something is, you know,

49
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,912
[SPEAKER_02]: worthy of their time or whatever, they disregard it.

50
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:22,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering, but then again, I'm wondering if free petition might be helpful in that regard.

51
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:33,601
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, it seemed to me like with the group petition, the bodies are forced to act in a way that

52
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: other than just receive and place on file.

53
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:44,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I think we're trying to avoid.

54
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:52,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and we've already, I think we've already agreed that we think recommending a free petition is a good idea.

55
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a question of the language.

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And we wanted to look at how it is in a few other charters, which is why I came up with these other examples.

57
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:10,837
[SPEAKER_00]: The only question I have is, is this school committee piece something that should be covered under the school committee subcommittee?

58
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

59
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:22,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Only in terms of what Eunice is referring to in terms of protocol and changing the way they do business.

60
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:32,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much leverage the charter will even have to dictate the roles of the school committee.

61
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:39,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's probably not really part of the charter's purview, but this is more about

62
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:48,992
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about what citizen partition mechanisms would be available to the citizenry in all branches of government, right?

63
00:05:49,092 --> 00:06:02,676
[SPEAKER_00]: So, or- That's why I'm only making the distinction because I don't want it to be a debate over, yes, free partition is good for city council, but not for school committee if we haven't made that decision.

64
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:04,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

65
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:05,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

66
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we have them both mentioned.

67
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,358
[SPEAKER_06]: But Gene, did you want to speak?

68
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:14,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess I didn't see the individual versus group.

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess individual is just you don't need all those signatures.

70
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, just one person.

71
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:28,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I. I don't know.

72
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:32,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that the 50 voters isn't like a big.

73
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:35,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Barrier or is it?

74
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:38,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it does require you have to get signatures, but.

75
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:49,853
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember too, Jean, is that the best way to do this is to go to a city councilor to get it put on ticket for discussion.

76
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:54,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the exception when somebody denies you from that point.

77
00:06:54,117 --> 00:07:05,807
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if one person has, I think you do need a set of signatures only because your first line of defense is going to the seven councilors to see which one would,

78
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:10,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they all deny you, then you probably have something that's a little controversial.

79
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:19,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree that maybe it's just a group petition that we don't need the individual.

80
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's how I feel because I feel like people could already do this.

81
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:27,605
[SPEAKER_06]: They could write to a city council or the city council and the school committee.

82
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,469
[SPEAKER_06]: pick 10 neighbors and have 10 neighbors sign it.

83
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:34,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the city council, it's just the way it is now.

84
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:38,013
[SPEAKER_06]: The city council, it's up to their discretion what they do about it, right?

85
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So why would we need to put that in the charter?

86
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:55,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like the important part is to say, these are the circumstances under which the citizenry can petition the bodies of government and be guaranteed a response.

87
00:07:57,135 --> 00:08:14,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me under the individual petition, it says in the last line there, take such action in regard to such petitions as they deem to be necessary or advisable.

88
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:15,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

89
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:16,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

90
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

91
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown.

92
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,761
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it in place on file.

93
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is the way it is now.

94
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, this is the first layer of a citizen presentation.

95
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:36,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have further initiatives that they can go through.

96
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:39,006
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is absolutely right, Eunice.

97
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:44,969
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all in the purview of the city council to say thank you and not talk or talk.

98
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:47,730
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the fact of law.

99
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, are we, I mean, we wanted to look at the petition.

100
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,327
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't they have to take it up.

101
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:58,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

102
00:08:58,589 --> 00:08:58,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

103
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:07,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, with the group petition with the group petition, it seems like they have to actually listen and they actually have to do something.

104
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:11,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Right as opposed to even place on file.

105
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:15,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted to look at examples from other charters.

106
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:27,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I haven't heard a big argument for trying to include this distinction between, or to include the discretionary action.

107
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:35,460
[SPEAKER_06]: But looking under the group petitions, 150, Lawrence gives a threshold of 150, Newton gives,

108
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:44,572
[SPEAKER_06]: what does noon give, 50, and Fall River gives 100.

109
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had settled on 50.

110
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:53,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, do we still feel okay?

111
00:09:54,534 --> 00:10:04,516
[SPEAKER_02]: In my research, and I went through, I used the, for all of my research, I used the Medford Comparables spreadsheet.

112
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:09,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this Free Petition 8-1, I looked at all,

113
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:19,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's 58 or 59, so let's call it 60, all 60 communities that were there.

114
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:27,435
[SPEAKER_02]: About a third of them had the free petition and this threshold ranged anywhere from 25 to 150.

115
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:27,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

116
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifty is right in there.

117
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:32,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean, did you want to speak?

118
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:33,778
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

119
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:41,626
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, Jean.

120
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, sorry, since I'm not on camera, I'm just going to raise my hand.

121
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

122
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:49,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine with 50.

123
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:58,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I do really want to keep in the one subject matter once a year, just because I feel like

124
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:11,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be abused and people could just keep putting, if they don't get the result they want, they could just keep submitting it and make city council put it on the agenda.

125
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if city council can then say, well, we already addressed this.

126
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:15,361
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to hear it.

127
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:16,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

128
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:22,547
[SPEAKER_04]: But it just seems like if we don't have that, this could be a way to make city government less efficient.

129
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

130
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:27,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with what Jean just said.

131
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:31,833
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be a stalling tactic that we keep throwing it every other month up there.

132
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:32,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

133
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:34,295
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be some kind of.

134
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:36,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you enforce it, though.

135
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:38,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you, Jean.

136
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I think there should be a I don't want to see this again for a year.

137
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,925
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about.

138
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:51,258
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're talking about a complaint about crosswalks.

139
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:55,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in two months, I'm talking about a complaint about streetlights.

140
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:57,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same subject?

141
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,326
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to, you know, but I agree with you.

142
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:08,153
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I fall back on the fact that I think, in my experience, that getting something on the agenda is not as difficult as we think.

143
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:10,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, I agree with you.

144
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:11,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so too.

145
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:15,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at it in sort of a different way.

146
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:19,505
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I'll say, I believe that there's a rule.

147
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:29,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's part of the council rules or an ordinance or what, where the same topic can't come up more than once in 90 days.

148
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,852
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we should take a look at.

149
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm looking at this from a different way.

150
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:44,959
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, I was in line with what you guys were saying, but I thought about it a little bit differently.

151
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's use Ron's example of a crosswalk.

152
00:12:53,432 --> 00:13:05,561
[SPEAKER_02]: you get 50 of your neighbors together to put in a crosswalk and you petition to be heard at a council meeting and so forth.

153
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:18,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you're talking about the safety of the intersection of Georgia and Maine or something, and they do something but they don't

154
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they don't put in the crosswalk at all, or maybe they put that in, but they don't do much else.

155
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:29,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And then three months later, you have a bad accident.

156
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:36,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Why couldn't you bring it back to the council for

157
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,569
[SPEAKER_02]: more relief.

158
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:48,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking specifically of some of the issues that have befallen the schools in the past year or so.

159
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:58,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And when there was a terrible assault of a young woman, you know, a year and a half ago, had they, you know,

160
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:04,220
[SPEAKER_02]: they had been petitioned to do something and they didn't do much of anything.

161
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a couple of months later, there was a stabbing.

162
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:22,328
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't get satisfactory relief and the situation grows worse, whatever that is, then why couldn't you bring it back?

163
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:24,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

164
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:24,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that

165
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:31,897
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going beyond the simplicity of what this is, is to get it on the agenda.

166
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:36,218
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna be able to regulate how they act or how they judge or what they predict.

167
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:47,220
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, Eunice, there is, again, there's initiatives and referendums that go a lot deeper than, you know, just crosswalk.

168
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,101
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really, all this really the free petition does is it says, agenda item 93-7,

169
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:59,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, who wants to speak on it done any counselors want to speak done?

170
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:01,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay done.

171
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:08,408
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean It's not really i'm looking at it from a Get it on the agenda.

172
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:19,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily what the results are and uh how we react and no question in three months something else could be up there, but um I I have faith that the

173
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:29,961
[SPEAKER_00]: the council would be able to, we're not tying up the council, we're just tying up this petitioner to do this every three months.

174
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:33,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Jean?

175
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:37,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the way I was thinking of it is,

176
00:15:39,465 --> 00:16:04,510
[SPEAKER_04]: this is your one chance you're petitioning school committee, city council on your issue, they don't act on it, then you have other levers like going to the media or then you have your citizens petition if it's something pretty substantive that you want to bring to the voters then.

177
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:12,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is like the first step in you trying to get this addressed, but you have other mechanisms if it doesn't work.

178
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that makes sense.

179
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:16,874
[SPEAKER_06]: It does, I think, and that does make sense.

180
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:26,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess one thing I'm just thinking is let's approach, so what we want to do with this last sentence of this

181
00:16:28,273 --> 00:16:42,198
[SPEAKER_06]: section is we want to make sure that this provision is not used by somebody to just clog things up and you know we don't want it to be used frivolously.

182
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:52,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe if we just think about and I think we all agree on that so how do we how do we do that without

183
00:16:54,667 --> 00:17:00,409
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, maybe creating a situation where people can't be heard on things they want to be heard on.

184
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:06,231
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I was just looking at, you know, this is where you have to be really careful with language, right?

185
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:11,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now it says no hearing shall be required on any one subject.

186
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:17,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So just taking the crosswalks again, maybe crosswalks

187
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:29,774
[SPEAKER_06]: is discussed and then a crosswalk in another neighborhood happens six weeks later and it's considered to be the same subject so they don't have to address it.

188
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:41,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying I think this would happen, but I'm thinking maybe we should make it a little more specific than any one subject.

189
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:42,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see what I'm saying?

190
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:59,765
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to bring up the subject, a crosswalk on US Street, Melva, and you go before them for that, then you couldn't discuss a crosswalk in Medford Square six months later.

191
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not saying that would happen, but I'm saying that subject is general.

192
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:15,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking at the same petition, but that doesn't really work either because then you just make a new petition.

193
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:20,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see what this, is this point coming through?

194
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:21,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Gene.

195
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:30,893
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're saying is that if somebody on High Street complains about a crosswalk, in three months somebody on Main Street complains about a crosswalk,

196
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:33,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the point is that this is more of a, not a.

197
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:49,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they call it in the agenda, Eunice, you know, where council has put things on, I need a tree cut down on Elm Street.

198
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:52,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the, you know, there's all kinds of, because of that stuff.

199
00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:06,979
[SPEAKER_00]: These are petitions that, this is why you need 50 people signing it, because if I had a tree that needed to be cut in front, it wouldn't fall under this free petition, because I'd have a very hard time to find 50 people.

200
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,962
[SPEAKER_00]: the sign about my tree in my front yard or the crosswalk on my one street.

201
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:19,667
[SPEAKER_00]: But I maybe want to go to Main Street, Elm Street, Mystic Ave, and then I gather my 50, and we're all talking about the same subject matter.

202
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:32,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not so much no hearings on the same subject, but no single petitioner can?

203
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:33,916
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would definitely not.

204
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:36,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a single petitioner.

205
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:37,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Jean, did you have a comment?

206
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:45,941
[SPEAKER_04]: What if he said, no hearing shall be required on the same subject of the petition?

207
00:19:45,961 --> 00:20:00,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're, to address Eunice's concern, you could say six months or something instead of one year.

208
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:03,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess subjects just is what feels very,

209
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:12,199
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we determine that, I mean, there has to be somebody who declares it right or wrong.

210
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,601
[SPEAKER_00]: So isn't that the city clerk based on the decision of the city clerk?

211
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:17,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we just say that?

212
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:24,886
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us some kind of, somebody has to say, somebody has to step up and say, well, we just did this six months ago.

213
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is that person?

214
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I'm just trying to be more specific with the language.

215
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,211
[SPEAKER_06]: What about content of any particular petition?

216
00:20:35,975 --> 00:21:03,450
[SPEAKER_04]: sure and you don't want to be too specific because then it's um this is like a constitution not an ordinance right exactly but subject seems seems broad to me yeah the content is fine can we just can we not just say as determined by the city clerk's office um i think that isn't it the president um that decides the agenda well i don't know

217
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:07,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the city clerk has some control over.

218
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:26,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you'll see that sort of common thread go through the other two, you know, citizen, the initiative and the referendum, where, you know, they have to sort of determine if it's, you know, within the purview of the council.

219
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:33,679
[SPEAKER_00]: But also to that point, Jean, is that this is going to be used when the city council refuses to put it on.

220
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the president decide what is right or wrong is probably, that's why I don't want

221
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,863
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already gone through process one.

222
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:56,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It might also be used when somebody wants to show that their issue isn't just with them, that it's weighty enough that 50 people signed this to get it on the agenda.

223
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:57,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be used for that too.

224
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:01,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

225
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:06,397
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, Ron, that the clerk is mentioned in the other pieces of the process.

226
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:08,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine with that.

227
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking of a neutral source.

228
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:12,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this okay?

229
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:16,340
[SPEAKER_06]: No hearing shall be required on the same specific content more than one time a year?

230
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:18,025
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

231
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:22,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe I just... We can't drop that down to once every six months?

232
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the same content.

233
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,755
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's... Eunice, hang on a minute.

234
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just thinking.

235
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:39,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's better than the same subject because content is more specific to, you know, material that was in the petition.

236
00:22:39,163 --> 00:22:40,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

237
00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:42,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't maybe don't have to say specific.

238
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:44,728
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

239
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:47,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Same content is fine.

240
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:48,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

241
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:49,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

242
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:50,808
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

243
00:22:51,548 --> 00:23:01,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we fixed that word that was bothering me, and Eunice, you said you would prefer to drop it down to more than twice a year?

244
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:01,712
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

245
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:04,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

246
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:05,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

247
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:14,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I think twice a year, and you could actually, if you brought up

248
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:24,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Or twice in a calendar year, or twice every, or no more than once every six months, maybe.

249
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:30,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Twice in a calendar year, you could do it in February and June.

250
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:46,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally, I agree with the points that Ron and Jean made earlier that, you know, one year is good enough because it's not like there are, it's not, there are other avenues that a person can pursue.

251
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:53,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they don't like the way they, the response they got, they can go to the next level.

252
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:53,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So I,

253
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:58,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we need to do that.

254
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:06,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's something that we want to put in blue and run it by the whole committee, we can do that.

255
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:09,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

256
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:12,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to get a little bit more feedback on that.

257
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm thinking even if we do it,

258
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:24,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, you can't do once every six months.

259
00:24:25,134 --> 00:24:35,297
[SPEAKER_02]: You could feasibly, you know, if this were next year, 2025, you could, well, no, actually, well.

260
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:38,018
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying 12 months, not a calendar year.

261
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:48,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking of when the council turns over, you might get a different response with a different, if there were some turnover on the council.

262
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:55,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this doesn't say that you can't put another petition in.

263
00:24:55,576 --> 00:25:04,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It just says that they're not required to have a hearing on the petition more than one time, right?

264
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:08,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what the whole group does.

265
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we can put yeah, I mean we can discuss it.

266
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:20,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a it's a This is a very small This is the first entry into a citizen doing this on their own.

267
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:35,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean if you had an issue that uh, you got 50 signatures for and it did not Hit the the council seriously enough that at least they put it into a subcommittee Then i'm thinking that it probably could wait a year the other point.

268
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:37,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I I want to just come back to the point of

269
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:44,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there has to be some kind of judge who decides what is relevant in these issues.

270
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:57,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just... You mean you're saying... Who decides the content is not eligible to be done again in the same year?

271
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:04,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

272
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's keep that in our minds as we go down.

273
00:26:09,222 --> 00:26:15,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like we can get rid of this stuff because it served its purpose.

274
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:20,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were, I did want to just make sure we look at those questions in the margin.

275
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

276
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:23,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you make it a little bit bigger again?

277
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:24,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

278
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:25,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.

279
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

280
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:27,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there, are there,

281
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to, those questions in the margins, is there anything we need to review?

282
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:45,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to remember what I wrote, because I wrote the lion's share of them.

283
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to tighten this up?

284
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:50,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what this was.

285
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:57,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We said that the action shall be taken not later than six weeks after the petition was filed.

286
00:27:03,738 --> 00:27:04,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.

287
00:27:04,598 --> 00:27:15,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think my, uh, let's see, uh, hearing should be held by the city councils or by committee and the action by the council should be taken not later than six weeks after the petition was filed.

288
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:25,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think my thought process there was by the next regular meeting of the body or within the regular meetings of the body.

289
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:30,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, by the next regular meeting could be like two days later, right?

290
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Theoretically.

291
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:44,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the way I look at it is they meet as a body at the entire, well, the school committee meets every week, right?

292
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:45,893
[SPEAKER_06]: But the city council is every other week.

293
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:50,154
[SPEAKER_06]: But it can also be a subcommittee.

294
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It can also be a subcommittee.

295
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:59,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like six weeks is reasonable because they probably have,

296
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:30,046
[SPEAKER_04]: other agenda you know it's it's something that they're going to have to add on to their agendas right jean go ahead um well i worked on an ordinance recently um i the process was it had to be put on the full city council agenda then they vote to refer it to committee then the committee worked on it then it went to committee the whole i'm just thinking through the process and whether that impacts us at all usually that's how

297
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:34,800
[SPEAKER_04]: The ordinances get crafted, so.

298
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,286
[SPEAKER_04]: This wouldn't necessarily have to result in an ordinance, though.

299
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:41,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, but right.

300
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:44,073
[SPEAKER_04]: That's often what people want.

301
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:45,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

302
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:47,018
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

303
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:54,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it has to be introduced at the, I don't know that they can just put it in a committee without the whole city.

304
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a procedural question based on their rules.

305
00:28:58,189 --> 00:29:05,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they can put it into a committee without the full city council approving it going to the committee.

306
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:06,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

307
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:17,258
[SPEAKER_02]: They, both the city council and the school committee, their rules state that the entire body has to, it has to then

308
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:23,907
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the issue, the paper, the whatever has to be referred from the.

309
00:29:24,587 --> 00:29:27,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Entire body to the relevant.

310
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:32,370
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, subcommittee, but you mean by a majority vote.

311
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, by a majority.

312
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:42,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jean, you said that the other example said nine weeks or three months.

313
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So six weeks is on the short end of other charters.

314
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:49,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

315
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:57,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the summer, I was just, Eunice brought up the summer city council meets once.

316
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:03,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, do you want to give me a little more time?

317
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:06,378
[SPEAKER_04]: To write this summer, the summer city.

318
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,243
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council, their last meeting is.

319
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:39,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Toward the end of June, and now that they've gone to biweekly over the last year or so, it could be the third Tuesday in June as opposed to the fourth Tuesday, and then they'll have a meeting the middle of July somewhere, usually roughly around the 20th or so of July, and then they meet again roughly around the 20th of August.

320
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:51,937
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the September meeting gets a little bit mucked up because there's always

321
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:57,334
[SPEAKER_02]: There's generally an election in September.

322
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:08,460
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's primary for the local stuff, it could be state office or even presidential.

323
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't usually meet again until the third week of September.

324
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:15,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking at one meeting in July, one meeting in August, one meeting in September.

325
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And the school committee does not meet all in the summer.

326
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:24,435
[SPEAKER_02]: They go out in June and you don't see them again until September.

327
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:27,777
[SPEAKER_04]: What about nine weeks?

328
00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:28,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like?

329
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:45,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, given the summer, this charter would mean that the school committee, if they got a petition at the end of June, would have to regroup in August.

330
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:49,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not right.

331
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:50,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So three months?

332
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:56,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, yeah, I think we'd have to do nine weeks.

333
00:31:58,189 --> 00:32:01,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nine weeks is still, is that a whole summer?

334
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,590
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

335
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,070
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're right.

336
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:04,650
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

337
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,211
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like 12 weeks.

338
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:10,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd ask them to come back, and that would be the first thing in September they would do instead.

339
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:12,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they take three months off or two months?

340
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:16,992
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually... I'm sorry, you just said this, but...

341
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:21,644
[SPEAKER_00]: July and August.

342
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:23,245
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't take August off.

343
00:32:23,345 --> 00:32:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do.

344
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:27,808
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't meet in August?

345
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,130
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't meet until after Labor Day.

346
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,991
[SPEAKER_00]: After the budget, they're out.

347
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:34,032
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't come back until Labor Day?

348
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:35,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

349
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,096
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be, let's say that's nine weeks.

350
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:48,342
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that's saying is, when you come back in September, during the start of the school year, you must take up this petition.

351
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:49,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

352
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:55,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all they have to do is have a hearing on it.

353
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,868
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, it's... Move it.

354
00:32:58,968 --> 00:32:59,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, move it.

355
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:01,029
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move it to some place.

356
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:02,470
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we think about 10?

357
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:06,393
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems good to me.

358
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:07,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

359
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:12,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's not tightening it up, Eunice, the way you were talking about.

360
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:13,478
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

361
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I considered the factors.

362
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,462
[SPEAKER_02]: My view was that

363
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:30,228
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they, I don't know, maybe I'm, you know, more of a, can I say hard ass on Zoom?

364
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:41,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But if, you know, if it's important enough, they should be, you know, coming back and listening to their constituents, you know?

365
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,054
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm a firm believer they work for us.

366
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:50,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so are you saying you think it should be less than 10 weeks?

367
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:59,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying, yeah, because for most of the year, it works well.

368
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:03,360
[SPEAKER_02]: From September to the end of June, it works fine.

369
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the July and August piece that

370
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,842
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly with the school committee is the challenge.

371
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:17,505
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council could, if they got something in June, they could address it in July.

372
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:20,447
[SPEAKER_02]: They got something in July, they can address it in August.

373
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:25,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the school committee that's the problem, but they should be listening to the constituents.

374
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:30,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it means them coming back and holding a meeting, so be it.

375
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:35,397
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them to come out of their school vacation to come to listen to a petition?

376
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:36,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

377
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:37,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

378
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:38,679
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

379
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I don't know because there's no level.

380
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:44,743
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is this.

381
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:46,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's way too much to ask.

382
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:47,705
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no level.

383
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,046
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the petition's for.

384
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not like it could be for anything.

385
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could say I don't know.

386
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,291
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they call it when they're on vacation?

387
00:34:56,331 --> 00:35:00,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they call the school committees in session from September to June?

388
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:03,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they call it anything.

389
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:08,600
[SPEAKER_02]: They just they their last meeting is somewhere in the middle of June and

390
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:14,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them come back very sporadically.

391
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:19,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly during the height of COVID, they met all that summer.

392
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:24,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a rule, you don't see them until after Labor Day.

393
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:33,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to put this in blue as well because we have to move on to the other sections.

394
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,331
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll, maybe we can just see what the rest of the committee thinks about this too.

395
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound okay?

396
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:53,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and what, and are we good with the rest of the content of this particular section?

397
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:56,956
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some questions.

398
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:11,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, are we, do we feel satisfied or do we want to address any other questions on this section?

399
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:21,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, you know, what I was saying in the, in my top comment up there is, you know, who decides whether or not it's relevant.

400
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:30,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, we were talking about that and then, um, you know, what, what is the, you know, what,

401
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,860
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of action do they take?

402
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,441
[SPEAKER_01]: This just says they have a hearing.

403
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:42,582
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't determine the action that they need to take.

404
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:54,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only actions of just letting it, putting on a file, maybe go to subcommittee, but we can't, I don't know how we would dictate each individual petition where it should go.

405
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:58,928
[SPEAKER_06]: This just says the action that has to be taken is they have a hearing.

406
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:11,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and whatever comes out of that hearing comes out of the hearing, but yeah, so hold the public hearing and act on every petition so that it could hold the public hearing and.

407
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:14,591
[SPEAKER_02]: The action could be a non action.

408
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:18,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, well, yeah, it can.

409
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

410
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:26,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can't force them to do what you want with 50 voters on your sick.

411
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:32,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's why we have the citizens petition if you don't get.

412
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:36,980
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have to review it.

413
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

414
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:57,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So then basically, if you don't get a satisfactory result, if their action with a petition signed by 50 voters is basically a non-action, which is entirely possible, then you escalate.

415
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:03,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we need to just take out and act, because it's vague.

416
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:04,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know what it means.

417
00:38:05,307 --> 00:38:08,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to say they're just going to hold a public hearing, right?

418
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:15,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could define the action as not doing anything as their action, but I would take it out.

419
00:38:16,306 --> 00:38:17,287
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Gene?

420
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:20,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it adds anything?

421
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:23,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

422
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:25,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should hold a public hearing.

423
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:26,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's fine.

424
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:27,978
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

425
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:30,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

426
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:31,840
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

427
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we come to the next level, which is the citizen initiative measures.

428
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:40,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we just go back one second?

429
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:48,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I said there is who should receive petitions directed to the school committee.

430
00:38:49,732 --> 00:38:53,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So the petition was filed with the city clerk or the school committee.

431
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:55,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to define who

432
00:38:59,745 --> 00:39:03,489
[SPEAKER_02]: gets it on the school committee or just saying school committee is sufficient?

433
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:08,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the chairman is the person who determines the agenda.

434
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,916
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd imagine that's the person.

435
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:17,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it does say that this is the petition filed with the city clerk or the school committee.

436
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:26,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay with that being general because it means that, you know, depending on the school committee, maybe it would be the secretary.

437
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:32,997
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe that's who would receive it on behalf of the school committee.

438
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:40,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't feel a need to specify it, but I don't know.

439
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Do others?

440
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,621
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.

441
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:46,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to be honest, I think we need to

442
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:52,402
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that this is going to be edited a thousand times down the road, even to our next committee of the whole.

443
00:39:52,482 --> 00:40:03,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we need to make our decisions and just, you know, let's get, let's get through it because it's, it's gotta go, it's going to go to the council and it's going to go, the school committee is going to have their input.

444
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:09,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So to worry about who's going to get it, like you say, it's their decision to who gets it.

445
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:10,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

446
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:11,737
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

447
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:14,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So next level citizen initiative measures, um,

448
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:22,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one is much more meaty.

449
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:30,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, I'm just going down because there's all these other examples.

450
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:35,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Did anybody have time to compare how our current text looks compared to these others?

451
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:42,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Eunice did a nice job of listing them all in the comments.

452
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:44,445
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let's look at that.

453
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:45,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

454
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:47,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm moving my little boxes.

455
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

456
00:40:54,049 --> 00:41:00,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started by saying the things that we had to decide were the thresholds, right?

457
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:04,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And the initiative petitions are for the passage of a particular measure.

458
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:12,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is actually asking a policy or a measure, like an ordinance to be passed, right?

459
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:20,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So we put 250 and not less than 25 from each ward.

460
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.

461
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:26,642
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly the same as Everett.

462
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:30,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, Malden is not just three.

463
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:32,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Malden is three?

464
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:32,258
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

465
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:34,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

466
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was.

467
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can tell you that.

468
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Malden down here.

469
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:40,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what it says.

470
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:42,105
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hard to believe.

471
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:43,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're right.

472
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:44,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It is three.

473
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:45,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

474
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I thought so as well, Sam.

475
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:49,830
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

476
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,133
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that Malden is going through the same thing we're going through.

477
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:58,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Their charter has not been reviewed in 20 years.

478
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:00,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

479
00:42:00,491 --> 00:42:00,871
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

480
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:03,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So Malden and Waltham are out.

481
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:06,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And Peabody are, well, there are a few that have three.

482
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:10,775
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strange that you would allow that to start the process.

483
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:11,956
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strange to me.

484
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand what.

485
00:42:13,076 --> 00:42:16,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it doesn't seem like enough, right?

486
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:16,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean.

487
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:18,139
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it just seems like everybody.

488
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:31,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Everett, Fall River, Taunton, and Weymouth are exactly where we are talking.

489
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:34,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Framingham is more with 500.

490
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:36,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Newton is less with 50.

491
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:40,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have the percentages, which I believe is even more.

492
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm comfortable with where we're at.

493
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:50,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's not that hard to get 250 signatures, I don't think.

494
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:52,126
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy either.

495
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:55,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it does represent some work, right?

496
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:56,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, right.

497
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:57,169
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it should be.

498
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Three signatures is ridiculous.

499
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:00,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

500
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:03,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

501
00:43:03,654 --> 00:43:04,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a bit stunned.

502
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:09,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you okay with the numbers units or do we want to?

503
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:12,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 250 is fine.

504
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:12,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

505
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:19,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have to consider, because we're proposing what representation, we have to consider that.

506
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:23,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and we have the not less than 25 from each board.

507
00:43:23,593 --> 00:43:23,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

508
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:25,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

509
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:32,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

510
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:34,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just looking at the comments about

511
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:36,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was for the public.

512
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:39,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

513
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next question we had was, wait, is this, I can take this.

514
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:49,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this in the highlighted?

515
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:51,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, that's just from the comment.

516
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

517
00:43:52,826 --> 00:43:55,487
[SPEAKER_06]: The next threshold is the time.

518
00:43:57,728 --> 00:44:00,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now we are, you know what, they're all 15, right?

519
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But not applicable, but the others were.

520
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,272
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean?

521
00:44:09,352 --> 00:44:10,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Not applicable?

522
00:44:10,172 --> 00:44:13,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that mean they don't have an initiative petition process in their charter?

523
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:23,157
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that meant that they didn't have a particular time frame of when the number of days for the solicitor to approve it.

524
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:23,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just.

525
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:33,059
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm guessing is because this initiative petition is in mass general law.

526
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:39,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if we're in line with other charters, we're probably okay.

527
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:44,528
[SPEAKER_06]: But probably checking it against the, because we don't want to put anything that conflicts.

528
00:44:44,588 --> 00:44:47,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wouldn't be surprised if the 15 business spaces,

529
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:54,408
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Mass General Law, which I should just find it right now.

530
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:55,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had it.

531
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

532
00:44:58,192 --> 00:45:05,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to go poking around all over my desktop while I'm on the share screen, but we could call it up and just look.

533
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:10,682
[SPEAKER_06]: But did the others say 15 business days or 15 days years?

534
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:11,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember?

535
00:45:11,323 --> 00:45:14,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

536
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what I think about the

537
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:28,493
[SPEAKER_02]: the day piece because days comes up an awful lot within the entire charter.

538
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:40,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if when we do Article 1 definitions that we should define day as business day and that just gets it out of the way.

539
00:45:41,002 --> 00:45:46,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere the word day is mentioned in the charter is business day.

540
00:45:47,857 --> 00:45:53,221
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm going to leave this in blue because it's possible that it's extraneous and we don't need it.

541
00:45:54,442 --> 00:45:55,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

542
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:57,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just say go back to the Malden thing?

543
00:45:57,244 --> 00:45:59,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading the actual charter.

544
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:04,509
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there might be, it's very confusing the way they write it.

545
00:46:04,649 --> 00:46:05,310
[SPEAKER_00]: It says

546
00:46:06,322 --> 00:46:15,893
[SPEAKER_00]: The papers that are filed at the city clerk and shall include the names and addresses of three persons designated as having filed the same with each signature on the petition.

547
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:19,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think that I think it means that.

548
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:25,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what it means, you know, we say that in our, we say that in our charter somewhere.

549
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:26,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

550
00:46:27,628 --> 00:46:37,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It says here within five days after the filing of a petition, the registrars of voters shall determine by what number of voters the petition has been signed and the percentage that number is of the total number of voters.

551
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:39,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think it's three.

552
00:46:39,718 --> 00:46:40,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you.

553
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:44,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just those are the captains that will get the paper signed.

554
00:46:45,523 --> 00:46:47,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to clarify.

555
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:51,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this language is actually from math general law.

556
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:52,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.

557
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:53,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

558
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:55,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of their stuff is.

559
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

560
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:10,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty apparent when we did a lot of the charters, which ones were fairly updated and which ones hadn't seen the light of day in quite some time.

561
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:11,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

562
00:47:12,098 --> 00:47:12,718
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.

563
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:13,959
[SPEAKER_06]: See, here's where we go.

564
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:16,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 20 percent of the total number of voters.

565
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

566
00:47:18,842 --> 00:47:19,542
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

567
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:20,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not three.

568
00:47:20,643 --> 00:47:21,363
No.

569
00:47:21,483 --> 00:47:21,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

570
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:32,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, Claire, it just looks so, it looks like three people to get that started is just impossible to believe.

571
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,168
[SPEAKER_00]: But the wording is strange.

572
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:55,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if this is from mass general law, what this says is that if you get an initiative petition signed by at least 20% of the total number of voters, they pass the measure without alteration within 20 days or call a special election to put it on the ballot.

573
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:57,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

574
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:11,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's really... So, our task is to figure out numbers, time, and then just follow the mass law, but we're not going to be able to change that.

575
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:13,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we'll be able to change that law.

576
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:16,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know that we should repeat it either.

577
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

578
00:48:20,185 --> 00:48:27,947
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I looked at section 8-2 and I think section 8-3 as well, I was looking for four data points.

579
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:42,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Section A was how many signatures are required to file with the clerk, and then section B, the number of days for the solicitor to approve, and then section C,

580
00:48:44,748 --> 00:48:48,591
[SPEAKER_02]: the total number of signatures of registered voters.

581
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:52,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where your percentages generally came in.

582
00:48:52,093 --> 00:49:00,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also I think section C, how long do they have to do the signature collection?

583
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:04,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were kind of four data points that I was looking at.

584
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:13,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and those are the things, that's the analysis that we needed to decide the answer to our question is what should we decide from it?

585
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:19,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Jean, did you want to say something?

586
00:49:19,862 --> 00:49:26,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I thought that there wasn't a state law that allowed for local.

587
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:31,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Citizen petition, but there's a state law that allows for state.

588
00:49:32,745 --> 00:49:34,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Wide citizen petition.

589
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:42,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought if you wanted a local citizen petition, it had to be in your charter, and if it wasn't in your charter.

590
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:42,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Then.

591
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:47,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just try to find it.

592
00:49:48,427 --> 00:49:49,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.

593
00:49:50,428 --> 00:49:52,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's just take a let's let's take a look.

594
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:53,509
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't be right.

595
00:49:53,569 --> 00:49:57,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're gonna look right here at the but I thought it was in our charter.

596
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,410
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna look right.

597
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not in our charter.

598
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:06,613
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Massachusetts general laws does not address only statewide.

599
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:11,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the this

600
00:50:14,432 --> 00:50:19,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this says the papers constituting a petition shall be filed in the office of the city clerk.

601
00:50:21,997 --> 00:50:28,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And the city clerk shall transmit to the city council or school committee.

602
00:50:30,463 --> 00:50:31,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you look at these laws.

603
00:50:32,124 --> 00:50:36,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've read laws before, and then I've been told, oh, no, that doesn't apply.

604
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:37,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

605
00:50:38,108 --> 00:50:40,130
[SPEAKER_06]: But this does sound like it's...

606
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:42,792
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.

607
00:50:43,013 --> 00:50:46,675
[SPEAKER_06]: It's describing... I'm confused.

608
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:49,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would they send this to the school committee?

609
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:53,080
[SPEAKER_00]: What would the school committee do with it?

610
00:50:54,481 --> 00:50:57,663
[SPEAKER_06]: A policy, a school policy, maybe.

611
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:59,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

612
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:09,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but... Yeah, I don't know because... The school committee is like a legislative body, technically, right?

613
00:51:09,812 --> 00:51:10,673
[SPEAKER_06]: They make policy.

614
00:51:11,689 --> 00:51:18,992
[SPEAKER_00]: they do, but they have to go through the city council to make it a ordinance or actual legislation.

615
00:51:20,173 --> 00:51:29,717
[SPEAKER_00]: The city, the school committee can, the school committee can determine, uh, they can make their own policy, but this isn't policy.

616
00:51:29,777 --> 00:51:35,960
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a, this is a different, I thought school committee doesn't make ordinances.

617
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,380
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know.

618
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,542
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm curious why it says city council or school committee.

619
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand the process that they would go through if it went to the school committee.

620
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:51,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, Jean, did you want to speak?

621
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:55,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I left my hand up.

622
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:58,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at the law that you know.

623
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:07,992
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're doing here, this citizen initiative measure, does this or does this not apply to the school committee as well?

624
00:52:09,972 --> 00:52:11,933
[SPEAKER_06]: We have it as applying to the school committee, yes.

625
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:17,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it said.

626
00:52:17,703 --> 00:52:19,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

627
00:52:20,545 --> 00:52:25,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're okay with our 15 days because we see that that's pretty standard.

628
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:34,458
[SPEAKER_06]: In the next session, we're going to 60 or 90 days, and then we have the percentage of voters.

629
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:35,258
[SPEAKER_06]: So 60 or 90,

630
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:43,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, why do 60 or 90 was because we didn't decide which one we wanted.

631
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:44,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

632
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:45,840
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we have both there.

633
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:48,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

634
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:54,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have some of them have 30 days.

635
00:52:55,027 --> 00:52:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

636
00:52:55,487 --> 00:52:58,950
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 and then fall river had 120 and Newton had 180.

637
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:18,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, this is the amount of days that the petition shall be returned and filed with the city clerk.

638
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:28,899
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how much time you have to get your whatever percentage we put in to the city clerk.

639
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,100
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought 30 seemed pretty quick.

640
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:32,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

641
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Although plenty of communities have 30.

642
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:39,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

643
00:53:39,432 --> 00:53:43,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of it, I think we need to couple these two things together.

644
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: How many signatures are we asking them to get?

645
00:53:51,138 --> 00:53:58,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what is a achievable timeframe in which they can do it?

646
00:53:59,674 --> 00:54:05,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Well, if you look at, let's say, Everett is 10% and they give people 30 days.

647
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:09,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Newton is 10% and they give people 180 days.

648
00:54:10,402 --> 00:54:13,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Newton, I don't know if it's bigger than Everett or not, population-wise.

649
00:54:15,145 --> 00:54:24,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Waltham, well... Yeah, Newton is way bigger than Everett.

650
00:54:24,452 --> 00:54:28,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so... What do we say the registered voters are in Massachusetts? 40?

651
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:30,307
[SPEAKER_06]: about 40,000.

652
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:35,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I personally, I think 10%.

653
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:43,497
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think 90 days because I don't want to exclude somebody who missed something on the 63rd day.

654
00:54:43,537 --> 00:54:49,321
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also says to these folks, anybody who's trying to do this, you'd think they'd get it done in 30 days.

655
00:54:49,601 --> 00:54:52,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think the 90 day thing is giving them a cushion.

656
00:54:52,243 --> 00:54:52,484
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% is about 4000.

657
00:54:56,278 --> 00:54:57,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a lot of us.

658
00:54:58,139 --> 00:54:58,599
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot.

659
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,259
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we thought 5%.

660
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:10,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But... Lawrence says 5%, and Lawrence is a way bigger community than we are.

661
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:13,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're the only ones that say 5%.

662
00:55:13,804 --> 00:55:16,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but their 5% is 8,000 people.

663
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:21,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm looking.

664
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:22,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to remember.

665
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Weymouth is about the same size as we are.

666
00:55:25,998 --> 00:55:27,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Taunton is probably comparable.

667
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are 10%.

668
00:55:32,682 --> 00:55:35,144
[SPEAKER_06]: And Fall River might be bigger, actually.

669
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're kind of in the order.

670
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:44,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you Everett has just under 50,000 people.

671
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:48,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And Fall River, they're kind of in population order.

672
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:53,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're somewhere between Weymouth and Malden.

673
00:55:53,723 --> 00:55:58,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you a question, Eunice?

674
00:55:59,265 --> 00:56:05,066
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the recent school committee in Tapa?

675
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:06,206
[SPEAKER_00]: What was his total votes?

676
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:07,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?

677
00:56:08,187 --> 00:56:09,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the top of your head.

678
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:13,648
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't, that's fine.

679
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:15,249
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,600, I think, because I think Nicole had maybe 58.

680
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:16,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

681
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:17,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

682
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:22,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I didn't, I mean, so 4,000 is not crazy to think about.

683
00:56:23,824 --> 00:56:29,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just thinking about just, you know, the one time, you know.

684
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you did it.

685
00:56:30,126 --> 00:56:33,827
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have a lot of people getting signatures.

686
00:56:34,027 --> 00:56:35,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that easy.

687
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:38,068
[SPEAKER_00]: You did this, Melva, so you would know.

688
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,289
[SPEAKER_00]: How many did you get when you were doing the charter?

689
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:49,814
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't really even get it going that we used the signatures that had been collected and people were doing that for years and they never got over 3,000.

690
00:56:50,234 --> 00:56:50,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

691
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, several efforts.

692
00:56:57,078 --> 00:57:01,440
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I mean, if most charters say 10%, I mean, 10%.

693
00:57:04,162 --> 00:57:06,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody brought this up to me.

694
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:19,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody brought up to me yesterday in a conversation and it was more having to do with recalls, which the individual felt very strongly needed to be a part of the charter.

695
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:24,459
[SPEAKER_02]: But rather than and maybe we can't do this with state law.

696
00:57:24,499 --> 00:57:25,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

697
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,781
[SPEAKER_02]: But rather than.

698
00:57:28,522 --> 00:57:44,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting 10% of the registered voters from the last election or whatever, what about 10% of the people who voted, who actually came out and voted?

699
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:46,337
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that won't be legal.

700
00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:49,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't even know how you could figure that out.

701
00:57:49,379 --> 00:57:50,460
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be really hard.

702
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,061
[SPEAKER_08]: You could just total up.

703
00:57:52,322 --> 00:57:54,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, the elections office knows how many people voted.

704
00:57:55,908 --> 00:57:59,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but, oh, you're saying the number, not the individuals.

705
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

706
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:05,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, let me see.

707
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:09,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Jean, did you want to say something?

708
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:17,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm with Ron, because it seems like a lot of the cities do 10%, but I would,

709
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:21,433
[SPEAKER_04]: air on the side of giving people more time, like 90 days.

710
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:28,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we're going to do 10% because it seems 5% is too much of an outlier.

711
00:58:32,103 --> 00:58:40,411
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, too, you would know this, Melva, too, is when they're vetting the signatures,

712
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:49,487
[SPEAKER_00]: there's that percentage too that gets tossed out because somebody didn't sign properly or somebody, there's that part too.

713
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:50,388
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes 4,000.

714
00:58:50,428 --> 00:58:50,908
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,000 is a big number.

715
00:58:53,914 --> 00:59:12,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and if you knew you needed 4,000, I mean, I think it's actually a little more than 40,000 now and the population's increased, so maybe it's going to be up to 45, but well, let's say you thought you needed 4,500, you would collect at least 5,000 just because you would, you know.

716
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:15,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.

717
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:28,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The presidential primary, which was held just three weeks ago, according to the city of Medford official results, the number of registered voters in Medford is 42,439.

718
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:31,166
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of people who actually came out and voted was 10,740.

719
00:59:31,226 --> 00:59:33,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody do the math?

720
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:51,997
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quarter, 25% ish.

721
00:59:53,619 --> 01:00:06,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're going with the 10% of the last, so if we were doing this now and somebody were putting this petition together three months from now, they would need to get 10% of 42,439.

722
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

723
01:00:06,649 --> 01:00:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

724
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:20,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, this is like, this should, initiative petitions like this should not be normal.

725
01:00:20,515 --> 01:00:27,019
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be exceptions based on some very, you know, it should not be a normal thing.

726
01:00:27,479 --> 01:00:34,364
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you got to find the, you got to find the, to make it doable but not make it impossible.

727
01:00:36,185 --> 01:00:38,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not make it, yeah, okay.

728
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:39,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think we're good.

729
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:39,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do 7.78%.

730
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:53,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, no, seriously though, it's just, it either is five, 10, 15, 20, I mean, I don't know.

731
01:00:53,577 --> 01:00:55,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Lawrence has 5%.

732
01:00:56,539 --> 01:01:04,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Lawrence has their 2020 population, which, you know, well, that's their population.

733
01:01:04,904 --> 01:01:09,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how many of them vote, what their voting is, so.

734
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:11,388
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their population?

735
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:13,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Just under 90,000.

736
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:18,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's bigger than us, yeah.

737
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:23,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying it's curious, nobody does 8%, for instance.

738
01:01:25,393 --> 01:01:26,434
[SPEAKER_00]: I was serious when I said 7%.

739
01:01:27,054 --> 01:01:28,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a reasonable number.

740
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:29,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

741
01:01:30,457 --> 01:01:35,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we can make it whatever we want to make it, can't we?

742
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:39,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems like people like the round numbers.

743
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:42,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're Medford, we're not normal.

744
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:47,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Jean, what do you think?

745
01:01:48,093 --> 01:01:53,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they like round numbers because it's easy for organizers to figure out how many signatures.

746
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:55,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

747
01:01:55,756 --> 01:01:58,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be disappointed more.

748
01:01:58,497 --> 01:01:58,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

749
01:01:59,037 --> 01:02:02,038
[SPEAKER_04]: But if people really want to do eight, that's OK with me.

750
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:10,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the way I would do it is I would go, okay, 1% is 420 and then multiply it by 8.

751
01:02:11,513 --> 01:02:12,654
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I would figure it out.

752
01:02:12,674 --> 01:02:13,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 3,200 people you'd need.

753
01:02:13,915 --> 01:02:14,235
[SPEAKER_00]: At 8%, you need 3,200.

754
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:16,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in 10 years, you're going to need 6,000 or 7,000 as we continue to grow.

755
01:02:16,237 --> 01:02:16,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

756
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:34,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious, I'm looking up Lawrence to see what their election results from three weeks ago was.

757
01:02:38,183 --> 01:02:38,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if it.

758
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:50,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're just going to put this in blue and when we present this to the whole committee, we'll just tell them that we settled on 10 because,

759
01:02:56,638 --> 01:03:08,961
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't find any communities except for one that were less than 10, but we also talked about how many signatures that is and just see what people think.

760
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:10,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound good?

761
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:12,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

762
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:13,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

763
01:03:13,202 --> 01:03:17,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for me.

764
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:22,164
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any numbers in this section that are in

765
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:29,215
[SPEAKER_02]: We must be okay with these numbers.

766
01:03:29,295 --> 01:03:39,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of the numbers that are in there seem to be like action on petitions, not more than 30 days following the date of the petitions.

767
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:44,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of those are probably pretty standard fare.

768
01:03:45,432 --> 01:03:45,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

769
01:03:46,841 --> 01:03:52,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, and I don't see any questions in the margins here, which is kind of awesome.

770
01:03:52,347 --> 01:03:55,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this, so we don't need this anymore.

771
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:56,491
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need all this.

772
01:03:56,511 --> 01:03:57,492
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of it here.

773
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:03,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what's after this section?

774
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:07,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get into the referendum.

775
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we're in the referendum.

776
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a question.

777
01:04:12,899 --> 01:04:14,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

778
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:16,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we just review?

779
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:19,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you go back up?

780
01:04:19,804 --> 01:04:28,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you get your 10%, 90 days, you submit it to the clerk, right?

781
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to review the process.

782
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:34,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Then city council votes on it, right?

783
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:47,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Action on petitions not more than 30 days, the city council shall act by passing, so this is what is pretty much from mass general law that we saw, right?

784
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:54,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Passing without change, passing a measure stated to be in lieu of the initiative measure or rejecting it.

785
01:04:54,612 --> 01:04:56,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is actually different than what we saw in the law.

786
01:04:57,613 --> 01:05:02,636
[SPEAKER_06]: The passage of a measure in lieu shall be a rejection of the initiative measure.

787
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:06,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So then say they reject it.

788
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So then what's the process?

789
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:12,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to be reminded.

790
01:05:12,803 --> 01:05:19,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a supplemental initiative petition may be filed.

791
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have to get more signatures.

792
01:05:25,105 --> 01:05:26,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Different signatures.

793
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:27,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're down to 5%.

794
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:29,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Additional.

795
01:05:29,867 --> 01:05:30,767
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other thing.

796
01:05:31,107 --> 01:05:40,011
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like we have to, whatever we put, I should put this in Bluetooth because this has to be less than, like, let's say people said, yeah, let's make it 8%.

797
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:41,172
[SPEAKER_06]: We would make this 4%.

798
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:56,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, really, because this is you have you got 10% and now you're getting five additional percent for a total of 15% registered voters to get on the ballot right I just want to review them.

799
01:05:58,707 --> 01:06:01,548
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's, because there's another number down here.

800
01:06:01,668 --> 01:06:08,570
[SPEAKER_06]: The signatures on the initial petition filed and the signatures on the supplemental shall contain the signatures of not, yeah.

801
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: So this number has to equal, this number has to equal, so this right now has to equal 15, because we have five.

802
01:06:16,632 --> 01:06:18,293
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's rejected, correct?

803
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:19,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

804
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:20,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

805
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:26,823
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the point of this section is to say that it can't be the same people who signed, right?

806
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:28,044
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.

807
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:33,026
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, which is like a bear to keep track.

808
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:42,711
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have to go and do it again, then you have to trust people to remember whether they signed it or the major process.

809
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:44,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.

810
01:06:45,592 --> 01:06:46,313
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bear.

811
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:48,574
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to be by wards.

812
01:06:50,482 --> 01:06:52,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's no, that was just for the beginning.

813
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:54,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we wouldn't do that.

814
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:54,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

815
01:06:55,588 --> 01:06:56,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

816
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:00,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So, then then then there's a special election.

817
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:08,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do we want a special election or can it just be put on the next?

818
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:22,087
[SPEAKER_04]: election cycle, because special elections, we already get low voter turnout, and then you hold a special election, it's gonna be super low turnout, depending on the issue.

819
01:07:22,107 --> 01:07:23,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So can it just-?

820
01:07:25,468 --> 01:07:26,528
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question.

821
01:07:27,789 --> 01:07:37,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I saw the special election thing in the Mass General Lobb, but yeah, see, that's where it talks about it.

822
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:44,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we, so that's what we, cause we can't just say like we do for the state ballot initiative.

823
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:49,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just in the next general election.

824
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

825
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:53,611
[SPEAKER_00]: But does that mean you would have to wait a year to get it on the ballot?

826
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:56,112
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases you would.

827
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:58,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why that's there.

828
01:07:59,273 --> 01:08:07,055
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we keep in that provision that you need a certain amount of turnout, it might be really hard to.

829
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:18,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I would prefer that it just go on the next ballot when there's more people turning out at a special election.

830
01:08:18,276 --> 01:08:21,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems like you're not going to get a lot of people turning out for that.

831
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:23,179
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, Jean.

832
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:33,867
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking at a calendar, and let's say it's the elections in November, and you are just starting getting signatures, and you've got your signatures finished in December,

833
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,010
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you went through this process.

834
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:40,351
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually talking two years before that would be voted on in a ballot.

835
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:42,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

836
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,152
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

837
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:45,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on how... Wait a minute.

838
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:59,216
[SPEAKER_06]: This does say, provided that if another city election is to be held not more than 120 days after the petition is certified, then the city council doesn't have to call a special election.

839
01:08:59,296 --> 01:09:02,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe what we want to do is look at 120 days.

840
01:09:02,457 --> 01:09:03,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to make that...

841
01:09:04,669 --> 01:09:07,512
[SPEAKER_06]: 180.

842
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:07,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Longer, right?

843
01:09:08,212 --> 01:09:08,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

844
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:11,955
[SPEAKER_00]: If we made it 180, that would be reasonable.

845
01:09:11,975 --> 01:09:17,899
[SPEAKER_04]: 180 is, is that six months, more or less?

846
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:18,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

847
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

848
01:09:20,341 --> 01:09:28,867
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, Jean, that would mean that if there was an election coming in the next six months, then it would be on the public, on the election ballot.

849
01:09:28,967 --> 01:09:31,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we'd have to look at a special election.

850
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has to be a city election.

851
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:35,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

852
01:09:35,611 --> 01:09:35,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

853
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:36,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

854
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:37,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

855
01:09:38,534 --> 01:09:40,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you okay with 180 days, Eunice?

856
01:09:41,437 --> 01:09:41,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

857
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:42,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

858
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,101
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing- Can you put that in blue?

859
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:46,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put that in blue too?

860
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:49,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's something we want to tell everybody that that's what we thought of.

861
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:50,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

862
01:09:52,408 --> 01:09:55,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just also just looking again at this

863
01:09:59,122 --> 01:10:12,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are gonna try to redo it, then you have to get your other 5% and it has to equal, because we have 10 and five and this number has to equal those two, that's why it's 15 now.

864
01:10:13,986 --> 01:10:18,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're giving people 60 days to get that.

865
01:10:19,027 --> 01:10:22,207
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave them 90 days to get the 10%, right?

866
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:23,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they have 60 days to get 5% more.

867
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:27,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

868
01:10:28,646 --> 01:10:33,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking that if they got the 10%, they know what they're doing and they probably don't need 90 days.

869
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

870
01:10:35,951 --> 01:10:46,297
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, the biggest problem if you're going to go this far is trying to figure out how to get 5% of people that didn't already sign.

871
01:10:46,777 --> 01:10:47,678
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be hard.

872
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:53,061
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing that you would hope we never have to do.

873
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:54,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

874
01:10:54,775 --> 01:11:08,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be curious, next time the Collins Center joins us, to ask them how often these measures get used.

875
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing that it's not very often.

876
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we'll see what they say.

877
01:11:13,693 --> 01:11:14,494
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be interesting.

878
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:16,496
[SPEAKER_06]: But my guess is it would not be very often.

879
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:25,137
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I don't think, I mean, we're eating and breathing this thing now for months.

880
01:11:25,898 --> 01:11:37,947
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would think even once we're done and this becomes the city Bible, most people are not going to know that this is even an option.

881
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:49,064
[SPEAKER_02]: to utilize these tools to affect some change.

882
01:11:50,325 --> 01:12:02,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I think that anybody who does actually take the time to research the charter and discover that these are tools that they can use,

883
01:12:06,851 --> 01:12:14,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that it's only going to be the most passionate and diehard that will actually go and do this.

884
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:20,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would have to be to get this level of, to do this kind of campaign, I would say.

885
01:12:22,603 --> 01:12:22,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

886
01:12:23,023 --> 01:12:29,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just, I wonder how often these, these things are used and under what circumstances.

887
01:12:29,468 --> 01:12:29,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

888
01:12:29,848 --> 01:12:32,830
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think the goal is to make it not the norm.

889
01:12:33,611 --> 01:12:35,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

890
01:12:38,594 --> 01:12:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a news publication that we talked about.

891
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:49,601
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the difficulty is that we don't have a news publication, technically.

892
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:53,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a patch would count now, I would think.

893
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:55,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

894
01:12:55,284 --> 01:13:01,848
[SPEAKER_02]: But... Well, I mean, every, you know, any time that the city council

895
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:08,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Works on an ordinance and, um, for example, um.

896
01:13:09,339 --> 01:13:14,422
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaf blower ordinance, I think is, I think I explained a couple of our last meeting.

897
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:19,946
[SPEAKER_02]: They've completed that and, um.

898
01:13:20,766 --> 01:13:27,892
[SPEAKER_02]: They had what's called their 1st reading of it in the last city election or the last.

899
01:13:28,673 --> 01:13:37,680
[SPEAKER_02]: City council meeting a couple of weeks ago from there, it goes to what's called a 2nd reading and the clerk is required to put it in a newspaper.

900
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:38,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

901
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:39,642
[SPEAKER_02]: What is he doing?

902
01:13:41,336 --> 01:13:47,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Medford, that Somerville paper that's theoretically part of the Somerville journal.

903
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Somerville journal, Medford something or other.

904
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:54,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes to its third reading, which comes back to the council and they pass it.

905
01:13:54,664 --> 01:14:01,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will assume that any of this that has to go in a newspaper will go in the same place.

906
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:11,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's that's I think a state issue because the only community that does know.

907
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:11,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

908
01:14:13,052 --> 01:14:14,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have to address this at state level.

909
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:21,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how they do that because they can't force newspapers to go into business, but.

910
01:14:24,415 --> 01:14:26,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we don't have the paper anymore.

911
01:14:26,716 --> 01:14:29,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they might have to, yeah, I don't know.

912
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:33,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they might have to take it out, make the requirement different or something.

913
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so citizen referendum procedures.

914
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:49,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this, just to get clear on what this is, how it's different from the initiative, this is to

915
01:14:52,767 --> 01:14:57,335
[SPEAKER_06]: basically kind of try to overturn an ordinance, right?

916
01:14:59,760 --> 01:14:59,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

917
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:00,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that?

918
01:15:00,421 --> 01:15:00,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

919
01:15:00,942 --> 01:15:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we thought.

920
01:15:02,888 --> 01:15:14,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if not more than 21 days, and Eunice, you, these are the numbers that you saw, and they're all 20 to 30 days.

921
01:15:14,455 --> 01:15:18,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, there's some 21 days, yeah, three weeks, but.

922
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:20,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're right where we need to be.

923
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,122
[SPEAKER_06]: But it gets away from the round number, but okay.

924
01:15:25,883 --> 01:15:26,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So, 21 is in the ballpark.

925
01:15:26,843 --> 01:15:27,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that calendar days?

926
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:38,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what we're talking about, that we're going to try to address the days issue in the definitions.

927
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:47,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's possible that days means something in a document like this already without us having to specify it.

928
01:15:50,206 --> 01:15:53,908
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering how they're listed in those other cities and towns.

929
01:15:55,662 --> 01:15:58,423
[SPEAKER_02]: To tell you the truth, I didn't pay attention to that, so I don't know.

930
01:15:58,983 --> 01:16:00,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing it just says days.

931
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:01,704
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.

932
01:16:01,764 --> 01:16:07,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that the 20 folks are saying business days, and the 21s are saying calendar days.

933
01:16:08,686 --> 01:16:09,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

934
01:16:09,026 --> 01:16:13,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it may well be defined in their definition sections as well.

935
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:17,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it just said 20 days, it could be.

936
01:16:21,587 --> 01:16:29,331
[SPEAKER_06]: The days thing is a good question for the Collins Center.

937
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:39,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we have this number here as, you know, highlighted because we were not sure.

938
01:16:39,597 --> 01:16:42,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like 12 is pretty common.

939
01:16:46,257 --> 01:16:54,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we're saying is the threshold for overturning an ordinance is gonna be higher than trying to pass one, right?

940
01:16:56,743 --> 01:17:00,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we said for that one, 10%, and now we're saying 12.

941
01:17:04,107 --> 01:17:06,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and maybe that's how we want it.

942
01:17:08,169 --> 01:17:09,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we can just stick with 10.

943
01:17:10,895 --> 01:17:11,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

944
01:17:12,576 --> 01:17:17,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the only ones that have 10 are Methuen and Framingham.

945
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And Framingham, I think, is bigger.

946
01:17:19,421 --> 01:17:27,866
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense to me that it would be a little higher for this.

947
01:17:28,326 --> 01:17:31,689
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why it's a 12, is because it's more difficult than a 10.

948
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:41,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you know, if you want to sort of overturn something that your elected officials have passed, I think it should have a higher threshold.

949
01:17:41,861 --> 01:17:43,622
[SPEAKER_06]: You agree, Gene?

950
01:17:44,462 --> 01:17:47,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the question is, do we want to go to 15 or keep it at 12?

951
01:17:48,104 --> 01:17:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: 12 seems pretty... Okay, so we're going to keep it at 12.

952
01:17:52,205 --> 01:17:55,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we also want to put that in blue just because we're going to put everything?

953
01:17:55,386 --> 01:17:55,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

954
01:17:56,027 --> 01:17:56,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think so.

955
01:17:56,807 --> 01:17:58,728
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to just put the...

956
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:06,406
[SPEAKER_06]: put the thresholds just to draw attention, committee's attention to the thresholds issue.

957
01:18:06,927 --> 01:18:07,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.

958
01:18:09,688 --> 01:18:10,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and.

959
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:14,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was it for this.

960
01:18:15,712 --> 01:18:19,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So this actually says you can, you're protesting the measure or any part of it.

961
01:18:20,754 --> 01:18:22,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, does not necessarily the whole thing.

962
01:18:24,576 --> 01:18:28,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it can either be rescinded or submitted to the voters.

963
01:18:29,675 --> 01:18:32,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask a question?

964
01:18:32,657 --> 01:18:47,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this, and I apologize for missing this, is this a city, this Commonwealth of Massachusetts law goes through this to see if it's legal or not?

965
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:53,812
[SPEAKER_00]: They would scrub a referendum against school committee policy if it was general laws.

966
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:58,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure, I know the initiative

967
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:04,109
[SPEAKER_06]: The petition made reference to the city solicitor and it's probably in here too, right?

968
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:10,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this refers you back to the citizen petition and you follow that process.

969
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:13,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that go to the state first?

970
01:19:14,591 --> 01:19:16,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes to the city solicitor.

971
01:19:16,192 --> 01:19:16,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

972
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:19,032
[SPEAKER_00]: The city solicitor, not the state.

973
01:19:19,632 --> 01:19:21,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, the city solicitor.

974
01:19:21,973 --> 01:19:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

975
01:19:23,785 --> 01:19:34,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that different than saying that it has to, do we trust that the city solicitor has to go to the state and get it approved?

976
01:19:36,373 --> 01:19:36,694
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

977
01:19:38,955 --> 01:19:45,940
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think the city solicitor just looks at it and the job is to decide, is this legal?

978
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this in violation of city or state law?

979
01:19:52,226 --> 01:19:56,129
[SPEAKER_00]: The city solicitor is the responsible person for that.

980
01:19:56,489 --> 01:20:02,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking the way we look at how this charter goes through, it does get washed at the state level for legality.

981
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:05,815
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because it's a home rule petition, a special act.

982
01:20:06,475 --> 01:20:14,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it could be that you could do all this work and then the city solicitor will say this has to be a special act, right?

983
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,021
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't be an initiative.

984
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:17,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

985
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:17,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

986
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing.

987
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:26,771
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you'd want to really do your homework on that one before you went to get all the signatures.

988
01:20:28,132 --> 01:20:28,932
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.

989
01:20:30,773 --> 01:20:31,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

990
01:20:31,253 --> 01:20:40,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So this certain initiative position provisions is basically just a section that says it refers back to 8-2 and all those steps, right?

991
01:20:40,897 --> 01:20:41,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

992
01:20:41,297 --> 01:20:41,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

993
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:42,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

994
01:20:42,818 --> 01:20:42,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

995
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

996
01:20:46,044 --> 01:20:58,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, ineligible measures, well, I forgot to take out Melrose, but this, I think that we determined this was pretty standard language, right?

997
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:04,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, weren't we working with Pittsfields, which seemed to delineate it pretty well?

998
01:21:04,913 --> 01:21:05,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

999
01:21:05,933 --> 01:21:07,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we come to recall.

1000
01:21:08,594 --> 01:21:08,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1001
01:21:10,778 --> 01:21:27,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as I recall, last meeting, there was agreement that a recall provision would be, you know, something that we would seriously consider including, but we were talking about some of the details, right?

1002
01:21:28,402 --> 01:21:34,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So, any thoughts or questions on the issue of recall since we've just met?

1003
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:42,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, around the grounds for, oh, nevermind.

1004
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:49,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most cities don't seem to require a grounds for recall.

1005
01:21:50,462 --> 01:21:50,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1006
01:21:51,202 --> 01:21:55,904
[SPEAKER_04]: But this, what we have written here isn't requiring grounds.

1007
01:21:55,984 --> 01:22:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just when you do the recall, you make a statement for the reason.

1008
01:22:00,745 --> 01:22:01,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what that means?

1009
01:22:02,425 --> 01:22:04,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, personally, I would take that out.

1010
01:22:06,025 --> 01:22:06,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

1011
01:22:06,445 --> 01:22:12,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think because it almost implies that someone will say, yes, that's a valid grounds.

1012
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:17,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are some states that do recalls for cause.

1013
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:21,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we could consider that.

1014
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:35,441
[SPEAKER_06]: What I was told at a call-in center is that in Massachusetts, the trend, communities, municipalities are trending towards including recalls, but they're not really doing them for cause.

1015
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:40,065
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just you get the signatures and that's, you know, you don't have to, it's not for cause.

1016
01:22:40,305 --> 01:22:45,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't mean we can't do that, but Jean.

1017
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:51,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you had asked like overall for a recall, so I'm going to move on from that.

1018
01:22:51,532 --> 01:22:54,953
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree, maybe we should take that out.

1019
01:22:55,314 --> 01:23:00,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's like just letting people know why you want the recall.

1020
01:23:00,996 --> 01:23:02,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1021
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:12,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine if you're going out and getting signatures for a recall, you're going to have to tell a person why, you know, why they should sign, right?

1022
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:13,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1023
01:23:13,582 --> 01:23:14,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with the vote too.

1024
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:35,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So the two main concerns I have with recall, I'll just restate them here, is that it should not be a process where fewer voters, a small minority of voters, can recall someone and kind of undo the will of the voters.

1025
01:23:35,985 --> 01:23:38,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the concerns I have with how we word it.

1026
01:23:39,028 --> 01:23:40,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in favor of recall overall.

1027
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:47,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the 2nd is we just don't want to repeat what fall river to which was.

1028
01:23:47,945 --> 01:23:53,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I had a question in there about what's the process if someone is recalled.

1029
01:23:55,037 --> 01:23:57,538
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that position filled?

1030
01:23:57,838 --> 01:24:02,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't tell if we had anything on that or if that's in a different section.

1031
01:24:02,339 --> 01:24:03,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my- I think it's in there.

1032
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I read it.

1033
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's in there.

1034
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:12,322
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gets us to a recall vote that says yes, recall, no recall.

1035
01:24:12,483 --> 01:24:17,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't say who is the person.

1036
01:24:17,384 --> 01:24:20,145
[SPEAKER_00]: When that is accomplished, then you have an election.

1037
01:24:21,049 --> 01:24:31,451
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there are other sections of the charter, I know in articles two and three, that address a vacancy in the office of the mayor of the city council.

1038
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:35,132
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would imagine that this would count as a vacancy, right?

1039
01:24:35,972 --> 01:24:37,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1040
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:43,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's different, Nova, in the fact that it's a- It's a recall.

1041
01:24:44,114 --> 01:24:47,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's recall, I think you have to have an election.

1042
01:24:50,205 --> 01:24:52,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1043
01:24:53,227 --> 01:24:55,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if it says anything here.

1044
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:57,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see anything.

1045
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:00,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The petition shall be found and certified by the council.

1046
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:04,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you just go back.

1047
01:25:04,603 --> 01:25:06,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's up a little higher.

1048
01:25:06,145 --> 01:25:13,794
[SPEAKER_06]: The person here, the vacancy created thereby shall be filled under Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Charter for Fulfilling Vacancies.

1049
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:16,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1050
01:25:16,617 --> 01:25:17,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So it will be.

1051
01:25:17,718 --> 01:25:22,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So what it means is that when we review Articles 2 and 3 and when we get to 4,

1052
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:27,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Five, I think would not apply for us.

1053
01:25:27,325 --> 01:25:36,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna put that in yellow because I'm pretty sure five is like for communities that elect like the city clerk and things like that.

1054
01:25:36,829 --> 01:25:45,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that, yeah, in which case we would just, yeah.

1055
01:25:46,034 --> 01:25:48,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So we might be taking out five because it, yeah.

1056
01:25:50,419 --> 01:25:58,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're only talking about, we're only talking about, actually, I think we really can take him out, because we're only talking about city council, mayor, or school committee.

1057
01:25:58,785 --> 01:26:00,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the only people we elect.

1058
01:26:00,866 --> 01:26:10,833
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we not, do we not have the ability, do we not have the ability in the charter to state that if a recall is passed, an election will be held?

1059
01:26:13,214 --> 01:26:14,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I suppose, yeah.

1060
01:26:14,895 --> 01:26:16,637
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason why I say that is because

1061
01:26:19,053 --> 01:26:33,727
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason why I say that, if we have a process in place that, like in the school committee, the next person up gets the job, that will influence the fact whether this person gets recalled or not by judging by who the person that would automatically be replacing that person.

1062
01:26:33,887 --> 01:26:38,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it would depend on what the charter, what

1063
01:26:39,845 --> 01:26:42,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this would be a new charter, right?

1064
01:26:42,548 --> 01:26:48,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So Article 4 might say that there's a different process to replace a school committee member.

1065
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:49,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1066
01:26:49,936 --> 01:26:50,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeanne?

1067
01:26:52,199 --> 01:27:00,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened in Fall River, just so we don't repeat it, is that the election was at the same time as the recall.

1068
01:27:01,148 --> 01:27:01,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1069
01:27:01,848 --> 01:27:10,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he got, the mayor got recalled, but then was reelected because five people ran for mayor and he got the highest vote.

1070
01:27:10,573 --> 01:27:24,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just don't want to have, I don't think we should have the election at the same time as the recall, or we should have a provision that the recalled person cannot run in that election.

1071
01:27:24,461 --> 01:27:25,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Agree 100%.

1072
01:27:26,963 --> 01:27:28,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Just while we're here,

1073
01:27:31,215 --> 01:27:33,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to somewhere find it here.

1074
01:27:33,036 --> 01:27:34,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to search for it.

1075
01:27:36,898 --> 01:27:37,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Two and three.

1076
01:27:38,199 --> 01:27:41,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Just look, let's just see what we put in.

1077
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on this, so I should remember.

1078
01:27:42,821 --> 01:27:45,442
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a long time ago.

1079
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:46,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1080
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:51,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I do vaguely remember the discussion of vacancies, but.

1081
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:56,884
[SPEAKER_06]: just to see what filling of vacancies.

1082
01:27:56,964 --> 01:27:59,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So right, so this is what's been proposed.

1083
01:27:59,466 --> 01:28:05,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the committee still has to vote on it, but if a vacancy shall occur, the vacancy shall be filled.

1084
01:28:06,432 --> 01:28:09,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so it's a saying in descending order of votes received.

1085
01:28:09,374 --> 01:28:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's keeping things in the same as we have it now, right?

1086
01:28:15,038 --> 01:28:20,883
[SPEAKER_06]: But it says they have to receive not less than 40% of the total votes cast for the highest vote getter.

1087
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:26,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if, okay, then same with the ward.

1088
01:28:26,533 --> 01:28:36,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if a vacancy shall occur and there is no available candidate, the remaining members of the city council shall elect a person to fill the vacancy.

1089
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:41,999
[SPEAKER_00]: So- The point in this one is voluntary vacancy versus a recall.

1090
01:28:42,839 --> 01:28:43,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1091
01:28:44,423 --> 01:28:56,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we just saw, well, the text we're working on right now says that the vacancy, if a person is recalled, the vacancy is filled in this way.

1092
01:28:58,915 --> 01:29:01,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is how the vacancy would be filled.

1093
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:03,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how it's written now.

1094
01:29:03,696 --> 01:29:05,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying to me there's a distinction.

1095
01:29:05,877 --> 01:29:07,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You're saying we could add something.

1096
01:29:07,837 --> 01:29:18,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying there's a distinction between somebody getting ill, somebody leaving the state, somebody moving out of the ward versus somebody being pulled out of their position for some reason.

1097
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:23,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a distinction that says this is a big deal.

1098
01:29:23,601 --> 01:29:24,542
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have an election.

1099
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:25,542
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.

1100
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:38,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That means when we talk about Articles 2 and 3, you're going to say, I think we should add a provision in the case of recall.

1101
01:29:39,384 --> 01:29:48,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Or under the recall, say, recall officials will, number one, not be eligible for election.

1102
01:29:49,428 --> 01:29:51,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it makes sense to put it under filling of vacancies.

1103
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:52,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Gene.

1104
01:29:55,356 --> 01:30:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like it might be different for city council and school committee because they're voted every two years, but the mayor is four years.

1105
01:30:07,186 --> 01:30:13,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the backup for the mayor?

1106
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:20,717
[SPEAKER_06]: For the mayor, if I remember correctly, the city council president,

1107
01:30:22,815 --> 01:30:23,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1108
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:44,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if a vacancy occurs during the first three years, the city council shall, oh yeah, because we hadn't done the election section yet, so we're going to have to look back at this, order a special election to be held within 90 days following the date the vacancy is created.

1109
01:30:46,503 --> 01:30:55,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, that seems like run, you know, if you're recalled all the process that people go through and it's every 2 years.

1110
01:30:55,086 --> 01:31:01,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just seems like recalling a city counselor is maybe wasted effort, but maybe not.

1111
01:31:01,988 --> 01:31:02,888
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I hear you.

1112
01:31:02,908 --> 01:31:04,189
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more on the mayor side.

1113
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:04,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree 100%.

1114
01:31:05,673 --> 01:31:08,394
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so with that, it's a special election.

1115
01:31:08,434 --> 01:31:17,916
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jean, do you think the recalled candidate, the recalled mayor, should be on the ballot to be elected again in the special election?

1116
01:31:18,716 --> 01:31:20,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1117
01:31:20,897 --> 01:31:26,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was, I saw somewhere someone had a provision like, if you're recalled, you have to wait a year.

1118
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:30,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we even have that, where you have to repeat a recall.

1119
01:31:32,139 --> 01:31:32,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1120
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:44,512
[SPEAKER_06]: No person who has been recalled shall be appointed to any city office within two years after such recall.

1121
01:31:44,872 --> 01:31:46,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's OK?

1122
01:31:47,092 --> 01:31:49,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can run again after two years?

1123
01:31:50,493 --> 01:31:50,553
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1124
01:31:50,614 --> 01:31:57,136
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go back to that recall section, though, when you go to section C, it talks about an election.

1125
01:31:57,156 --> 01:32:04,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's the election to decide whether to recall the person or not.

1126
01:32:07,969 --> 01:32:16,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so going back to, I think we decided to take out this grounds, right?

1127
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:18,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that.

1128
01:32:18,061 --> 01:32:22,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because as I said in my comment, define grounds, I mean.

1129
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:22,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1130
01:32:26,278 --> 01:32:28,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now, Everett.

1131
01:32:28,818 --> 01:32:29,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1132
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:32,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The threat these thresholds are low in my opinion, but.

1133
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:40,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just I don't I personally don't think it should be easier to recall to get a recall going and then to get a.

1134
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:45,222
[SPEAKER_06]: ordinance, but whatever, that sort of seems how it is.

1135
01:32:45,743 --> 01:32:49,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but just to that point, Mildred, this is only to get a ballot question.

1136
01:32:49,786 --> 01:32:52,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll have thousands of voters.

1137
01:32:52,668 --> 01:33:01,194
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in essence, in the final result, you will have more than, hopefully, 7,000 voters voting on it.

1138
01:33:01,214 --> 01:33:06,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, 500 is the top threshold, but are we okay with it?

1139
01:33:08,328 --> 01:33:11,370
[SPEAKER_04]: We can we want to lower it so.

1140
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:16,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Comparing this as citizens petition, this is 2.

1141
01:33:16,053 --> 01:33:22,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then there's the 20% below to get it to get the recall to happen.

1142
01:33:23,758 --> 01:33:24,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's true.

1143
01:33:24,818 --> 01:33:25,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what's next?

1144
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:26,039
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the 500?

1145
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:26,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I guess.

1146
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:27,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1147
01:33:36,307 --> 01:33:39,589
[SPEAKER_06]: This is to initiate a recall petition.

1148
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to get this number of signatures to start the process.

1149
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:48,213
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 20%.

1150
01:33:50,116 --> 01:33:54,198
[SPEAKER_06]: to get the city clerk to generate the recall petition, right?

1151
01:33:54,859 --> 01:33:58,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's not lower than... That's a lot.

1152
01:33:58,641 --> 01:33:59,922
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, it's higher.

1153
01:34:00,162 --> 01:34:01,463
[SPEAKER_04]: 20% is higher than the citizens.

1154
01:34:01,483 --> 01:34:05,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have an analysis of what other cities and towns do with that 20% number?

1155
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:06,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1156
01:34:07,107 --> 01:34:10,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It just went away.

1157
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:12,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I made it go away.

1158
01:34:12,451 --> 01:34:16,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, let me do my... I'll try it one more time so I can do this.

1159
01:34:19,257 --> 01:34:19,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1160
01:34:20,118 --> 01:34:20,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there it is.

1161
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:23,299
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the signatures.

1162
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:24,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go lower?

1163
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:25,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has the percentages.

1164
01:34:26,901 --> 01:34:27,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1165
01:34:27,322 --> 01:34:35,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then there's the days and then there's the percentages, which is anywhere from 5 to 25.

1166
01:34:35,526 --> 01:34:37,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So starting with...

1167
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,221
[SPEAKER_06]: 50.

1168
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:48,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Methuen.

1169
01:34:48,301 --> 01:34:49,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

1170
01:34:49,082 --> 01:34:49,062
50.

1171
01:34:49,522 --> 01:34:49,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1172
01:34:49,922 --> 01:34:51,263
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.

1173
01:34:51,283 --> 01:34:52,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was a typo.

1174
01:34:52,744 --> 01:34:53,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's an error.

1175
01:34:54,525 --> 01:34:55,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.

1176
01:34:56,026 --> 01:34:56,466
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.

1177
01:34:56,486 --> 01:34:57,286
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be 50.

1178
01:34:57,767 --> 01:34:59,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to keep 500?

1179
01:35:00,788 --> 01:35:03,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to keep 500 for this, or do we want to lower it?

1180
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:04,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I like 500.

1181
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:04,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with 500.

1182
01:35:05,131 --> 01:35:06,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with 500 too.

1183
01:35:06,231 --> 01:35:06,271
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1184
01:35:12,444 --> 01:35:20,509
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the, oh, that's for mayor or counselor at large, and then the school committee members and ward would be 300.

1185
01:35:21,589 --> 01:35:30,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just throw this in too, now that we're gonna go to ward representation, do you think that changes who will have say, whether the ward rep will be recalled?

1186
01:35:35,357 --> 01:35:40,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it says that the signatures have to be from the ward.

1187
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:47,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to recall a ward counselor, you have to get signatures from people who are living in the ward.

1188
01:35:47,135 --> 01:35:47,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

1189
01:35:48,236 --> 01:35:50,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

1190
01:35:51,558 --> 01:35:59,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Everett has 500 for the at-large, so that would be mayor and any at-large counselors, and school committee, and 300 for the ward.

1191
01:35:59,484 --> 01:36:03,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Weymouth- That's what we have.

1192
01:36:04,908 --> 01:36:05,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.

1193
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:06,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Weymouth- 400 and 100.

1194
01:36:09,232 --> 01:36:09,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1195
01:36:10,273 --> 01:36:11,333
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have 500 and 300.

1196
01:36:11,374 --> 01:36:14,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying you think it should be lower, Eunice?

1197
01:36:15,696 --> 01:36:17,358
[SPEAKER_06]: In the ward, maybe, yeah.

1198
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:26,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe we need to put these in blue, just like we're doing all the numbers, right?

1199
01:36:29,726 --> 01:36:30,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1200
01:36:30,607 --> 01:36:36,631
[SPEAKER_02]: As I've said multiple times, I think it doesn't need to be

1201
01:36:38,097 --> 01:36:55,678
[SPEAKER_02]: easy-peasy per se needs to be achievable, but I would want to make it slanted more towards making it quite achievable.

1202
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:58,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1203
01:36:59,581 --> 01:37:02,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Not onerous.

1204
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:24,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Both from the point of view of the affidavit and getting things started and from the total signatures required, I think it should be biased towards the community being able to do this with some reasonable amount of effort.

1205
01:37:25,902 --> 01:37:29,325
[SPEAKER_02]: But okay, yeah, no, that makes sense.

1206
01:37:29,606 --> 01:37:32,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it needs to be favored in terms of the community.

1207
01:37:33,970 --> 01:37:34,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1208
01:37:35,412 --> 01:37:40,997
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just suggest that we move to it because of the committee of the whole decide the number of minutes.

1209
01:37:41,778 --> 01:37:45,182
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna have so I know but let's Yeah.

1210
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:51,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, every time I retype one of these numbers, Eunice's notes go away.

1211
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:53,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would be good if we had them for the.

1212
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:53,807
.

1213
01:37:53,847 --> 01:37:53,807
.

1214
01:37:54,067 --> 01:37:56,069
[SPEAKER_02]: .

1215
01:37:54,087 --> 01:37:56,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have them right in front of me here, so.

1216
01:37:56,089 --> 01:37:56,069
.

1217
01:37:56,109 --> 01:37:57,250
[SPEAKER_06]: .

1218
01:37:56,650 --> 01:37:57,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1219
01:37:57,350 --> 01:38:03,636
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we send this and when we talk about it with the whole committee, it might be good to show them.

1220
01:38:04,216 --> 01:38:05,798
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like it in the margin, though.

1221
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:07,059
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually really helpful.

1222
01:38:07,579 --> 01:38:08,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, everybody can see it.

1223
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting inside here.

1224
01:38:11,101 --> 01:38:11,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see it.

1225
01:38:11,602 --> 01:38:12,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't help.

1226
01:38:12,502 --> 01:38:19,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but every time I, like we, we decide, okay, we're good with this number and I take it out of yellow, then the comment, the comment goes away.

1227
01:38:19,787 --> 01:38:21,028
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm realizing.

1228
01:38:21,488 --> 01:38:28,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, and you do the line through it, you know, like the, the edit line, keep it in there.

1229
01:38:28,192 --> 01:38:29,873
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1230
01:38:29,893 --> 01:38:31,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder why does it go away?

1231
01:38:31,915 --> 01:38:33,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can build on Unisys.

1232
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,756
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw more.

1233
01:38:34,776 --> 01:38:37,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't understand that whole thing.

1234
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:41,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to do the track changes stuff.

1235
01:38:42,642 --> 01:38:45,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all the rest of them have disappeared so far.

1236
01:38:46,424 --> 01:38:47,365
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1237
01:38:47,825 --> 01:38:52,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Eunice, if you just send me your notes, I'll just add them in as comments before the meeting that we're going to do.

1238
01:38:52,968 --> 01:38:53,648
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

1239
01:38:54,588 --> 01:38:54,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1240
01:38:54,808 --> 01:38:56,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make sure everyone's not 50 percent.

1241
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:58,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1242
01:38:58,861 --> 01:39:11,490
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, if we are talking about the numbers, so we're talking about 20% of the voters, which is pretty much right in there, and 28 days to get those.

1243
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:14,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So 20% would be at least between 4,000 and 4,500.

1244
01:39:27,257 --> 01:39:28,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a big issue.

1245
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:31,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it shouldn't be.

1246
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:34,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So we think 20 is okay, because we said 10 for the initiative petition.

1247
01:39:35,263 --> 01:39:37,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 15 for the initiative petition.

1248
01:39:37,464 --> 01:39:38,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It is 15.

1249
01:39:38,325 --> 01:39:38,745
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

1250
01:39:38,785 --> 01:39:39,165
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1251
01:39:39,185 --> 01:39:40,066
[SPEAKER_04]: We bumped it up.

1252
01:39:40,106 --> 01:39:41,327
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

1253
01:39:41,347 --> 01:39:42,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So 20 makes.

1254
01:39:44,009 --> 01:39:44,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's do it.

1255
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:46,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So 20% would be 8,000 signatures?

1256
01:39:46,771 --> 01:39:46,811
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1257
01:39:53,565 --> 01:39:54,025
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be 8,000.

1258
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:56,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it would be.

1259
01:39:56,347 --> 01:39:56,728
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be.

1260
01:39:56,888 --> 01:39:57,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1261
01:39:57,629 --> 01:39:58,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's ridiculous.

1262
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:01,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it should be exceptional.

1263
01:40:01,952 --> 01:40:03,854
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pull a mirror out of the office.

1264
01:40:03,874 --> 01:40:09,039
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, I don't think it needs to be that high.

1265
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:12,401
[SPEAKER_06]: But do we want to make it less for warrants?

1266
01:40:14,368 --> 01:40:17,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is 20% of, it's a smaller group.

1267
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:21,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a smaller group, you're right, so it makes sense.

1268
01:40:21,612 --> 01:40:23,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Is 28 days enough or do we want to give them more?

1269
01:40:24,574 --> 01:40:25,534
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to give them more.

1270
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:27,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

1271
01:40:28,416 --> 01:40:29,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Methuen does 60.

1272
01:40:31,518 --> 01:40:32,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go with 60.

1273
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:33,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1274
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:40,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to believe that if there was ever a situation where we're recalling somebody, the entire city will be awake on this one.

1275
01:40:40,943 --> 01:40:41,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1276
01:40:42,224 --> 01:40:42,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.

1277
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:44,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1278
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:50,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the next numbers, I wanted to put all these in blue, though.

1279
01:40:51,724 --> 01:40:52,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1280
01:40:52,025 --> 01:40:54,306
[SPEAKER_06]: While I put these in blue, you guys look at the next numbers.

1281
01:40:55,366 --> 01:40:58,768
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we looking at?

1282
01:40:58,889 --> 01:41:01,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Recall election?

1283
01:41:03,011 --> 01:41:04,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what comes after this section.

1284
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:11,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So the time frame for the election date to be scheduled after the petition is certified.

1285
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:18,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks, it's anywhere from, you know, 45 to 90 days.

1286
01:41:19,028 --> 01:41:25,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Thuin is a little bit shorter.

1287
01:41:29,655 --> 01:41:33,898
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems about what other cities are doing.

1288
01:41:35,988 --> 01:41:39,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I think giving the city more time to have this election is probably 64.

1289
01:41:41,152 --> 01:41:46,255
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're good with 64, not less than 64 and not more than 90.

1290
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:47,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it 64?

1291
01:41:47,696 --> 01:41:51,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know why it's 64.

1292
01:41:51,959 --> 01:41:53,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Everett is 64.

1293
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:54,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's because Everett is 60.

1294
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:56,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Lawrence is 65 to 90.

1295
01:41:56,683 --> 01:41:57,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Fall River is 65 plus.

1296
01:42:05,156 --> 01:42:06,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1297
01:42:06,597 --> 01:42:07,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go 60 to 90.

1298
01:42:08,878 --> 01:42:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1299
01:42:09,919 --> 01:42:10,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Me.

1300
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:10,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1301
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1302
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting blue, so.

1303
01:42:13,661 --> 01:42:15,202
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stuck on the even numbers, so.

1304
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:17,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going 60.

1305
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:20,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1306
01:42:22,507 --> 01:42:25,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this 120, we are not.

1307
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's if there's another election.

1308
01:42:36,867 --> 01:42:43,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so then this just says that they're going to continue to perform their duties until the recall election.

1309
01:42:45,351 --> 01:42:55,896
[SPEAKER_06]: If recalled, the office shall be deemed vacant, and then we have the vacancies, which, you know, we're going to have to look at those procedures pretty carefully.

1310
01:42:55,936 --> 01:42:59,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We just looked at what we have in Articles 2 and 3, and they look okay to me.

1311
01:43:03,012 --> 01:43:08,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh, does this conflict with what we had at the bottom?

1312
01:43:08,574 --> 01:43:16,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Should the person be a candidate in the subsequent election, that person will not be allowed to have candidate for re-election appear on the ballot at such election.

1313
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:26,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have no person can be appointed to any city office within two years.

1314
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So I suppose this could happen

1315
01:43:31,042 --> 01:43:45,068
[SPEAKER_06]: to a mayor, because a mayor could get recalled, let's say, after a year and a half, and then they could run for mayor next time, but they could not say candidate for re-election.

1316
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:49,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a city council would have to wait two years, they'd skip an election.

1317
01:43:53,272 --> 01:43:57,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but then they wouldn't be in the subsequent election, right?

1318
01:43:58,275 --> 01:43:59,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah.

1319
01:43:59,965 --> 01:44:05,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't necessarily conflict because we'll have a four-year term for mayors.

1320
01:44:05,928 --> 01:44:09,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're okay.

1321
01:44:09,809 --> 01:44:17,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there's a number in yellow.

1322
01:44:17,092 --> 01:44:23,495
[SPEAKER_06]: This just means someone would try to recall somebody twice?

1323
01:44:24,273 --> 01:44:30,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why I like the 270 days because that it's, again, this should be a super exception to the rule.

1324
01:44:30,455 --> 01:44:34,055
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start tossing this out as a policy, it'd be ridiculous.

1325
01:44:34,696 --> 01:44:36,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I agree.

1326
01:44:36,456 --> 01:44:41,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And 270 is Everett and Taunton and Lawrence is the last.

1327
01:44:41,477 --> 01:44:48,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a law that says when you're a convicted felon, if you do some felony, you're out automatically?

1328
01:44:49,788 --> 01:44:50,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1329
01:44:50,969 --> 01:44:54,732
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but you know, there should be the.

1330
01:44:56,053 --> 01:45:01,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Section 9 of this or whatever we're calling these Article 9 has something about.

1331
01:45:04,119 --> 01:45:06,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, we talked about this.

1332
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:07,521
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about.

1333
01:45:07,541 --> 01:45:10,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember Melva if you're?

1334
01:45:12,165 --> 01:45:15,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Found guilty of a felony while in office, right?

1335
01:45:16,707 --> 01:45:17,848
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember talking about that.

1336
01:45:17,868 --> 01:45:18,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I talked about it.

1337
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:21,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at the model policy.

1338
01:45:22,754 --> 01:45:24,195
[SPEAKER_04]: While in office, yeah.

1339
01:45:27,339 --> 01:45:27,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1340
01:45:29,061 --> 01:45:31,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think it prevents you from running for office.

1341
01:45:32,865 --> 01:45:36,429
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just if you do a felony while in office.

1342
01:45:37,049 --> 01:45:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1343
01:45:38,037 --> 01:45:41,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you automatically removed or is it the recall has to happen?

1344
01:45:41,959 --> 01:45:46,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I mean, we haven't worked on the, let me pull up the model chart.

1345
01:45:46,661 --> 01:45:47,302
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.

1346
01:45:48,262 --> 01:45:49,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Just curious.

1347
01:45:49,383 --> 01:45:51,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1348
01:45:52,264 --> 01:45:53,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this we already looked at.

1349
01:45:53,825 --> 01:45:54,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1350
01:45:54,365 --> 01:45:56,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this was the other.

1351
01:46:00,469 --> 01:46:03,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Equal to the turnout of the last local election.

1352
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:07,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is voting.

1353
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:13,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so this is a part I've been struggling about.

1354
01:46:13,591 --> 01:46:16,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's not a big no.

1355
01:46:18,552 --> 01:46:28,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because like, for instance, if a thousand people show up to vote, they can get rid of an ordinance, right?

1356
01:46:28,274 --> 01:46:30,015
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we want to avoid, right?

1357
01:46:30,035 --> 01:46:31,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, it's like a small group.

1358
01:46:35,036 --> 01:46:40,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Recalling elected officials that, you know, got 10,000 votes and 1,000 removes them.

1359
01:46:40,821 --> 01:46:41,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1360
01:46:42,042 --> 01:46:47,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this says at least 20%, which is actually...

1361
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:56,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's actually 8,000, right?

1362
01:46:56,021 --> 01:46:57,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that our turnout?

1363
01:46:57,662 --> 01:47:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that about- The last election turnout was just over 10,000, almost 11,000.

1364
01:47:00,645 --> 01:47:04,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but this says 20% of the voters as of the most recent regular city election.

1365
01:47:04,407 --> 01:47:06,189
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say it's not related to the turnout.

1366
01:47:18,393 --> 01:47:19,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, you're right.

1367
01:47:19,955 --> 01:47:29,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So this says that if this many people don't vote on this referendum, it's just automatically failed, right?

1368
01:47:29,946 --> 01:47:33,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think 8,000 is a reasonable number.

1369
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:37,255
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get 8,000 votes, then that person should not be recalled because nobody cares.

1370
01:47:37,819 --> 01:47:39,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this isn't about recall.

1371
01:47:40,061 --> 01:47:42,764
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about not just recall.

1372
01:47:43,445 --> 01:47:45,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about all of them, right?

1373
01:47:45,267 --> 01:47:47,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the citizens.

1374
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:51,574
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 8,000 is the right number.

1375
01:47:53,236 --> 01:47:56,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would actually be closer to 8,500.

1376
01:47:58,842 --> 01:48:03,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, how many do we get turnout in the municipal election?

1377
01:48:03,743 --> 01:48:05,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more than that.

1378
01:48:06,184 --> 01:48:07,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Unicef.

1379
01:48:07,844 --> 01:48:07,824
25%.

1380
01:48:08,384 --> 01:48:09,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't we say 25%?

1381
01:48:09,504 --> 01:48:13,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1382
01:48:13,665 --> 01:48:16,266
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2023 municipal election results.

1383
01:48:18,586 --> 01:48:19,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, to UNICEF.

1384
01:48:21,407 --> 01:48:23,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, oh no, it's not upside down.

1385
01:48:30,647 --> 01:48:33,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and of course it doesn't give me a percentage.

1386
01:48:35,169 --> 01:48:41,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I thought it was like, uh, 11,000 and there were 42,000 total.

1387
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:42,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

1388
01:48:42,893 --> 01:48:43,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

1389
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:44,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.

1390
01:48:44,033 --> 01:48:50,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So for many, uh, uh, care of yellow local kind of goals.

1391
01:48:54,018 --> 01:48:58,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, well, maybe not everybody voted from there, but

1392
01:48:59,161 --> 01:48:59,902
[SPEAKER_02]: There were 13,371 votes for mayor.

1393
01:48:59,922 --> 01:49:01,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of 425, did we say?

1394
01:49:01,103 --> 01:49:01,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1395
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:01,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the 30%.

1396
01:49:16,585 --> 01:49:26,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's going to be interesting is if we do go to four-year terms for mayor and we still have two-year terms for council and school committee is to see what the turnout, you know, how the turnout is different.

1397
01:49:26,756 --> 01:49:29,038
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point because the numbers will be different.

1398
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:29,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1399
01:49:30,019 --> 01:49:30,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1400
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:33,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to say from the last mayoral election?

1401
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:44,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't, I feel like that gets a little, I feel like it's just cleaner if we just keep it the same, you know, the voters act of the most recent regular city election.

1402
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:49,779
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only reason why I say that is because that's also a presidential election year, the mayor.

1403
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:53,481
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's not.

1404
01:49:54,701 --> 01:50:02,106
[SPEAKER_00]: If the mayor is every four years, it will still be on an off year.

1405
01:50:02,126 --> 01:50:03,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it doesn't have to be.

1406
01:50:05,385 --> 01:50:14,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then we've run into, it kind of does have to be.

1407
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:19,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in Massachusetts, cities have elections on off years.

1408
01:50:19,318 --> 01:50:27,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Because by Massachusetts law, the municipal candidates and state and national candidates can't be on the same ballot.

1409
01:50:27,727 --> 01:50:28,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1410
01:50:28,979 --> 01:50:29,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1411
01:50:29,879 --> 01:50:37,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you did try to have them at the same year, then you would have- Maximize the voters?

1412
01:50:39,224 --> 01:50:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you would also, the elections department would have a big job of trying to, and they'd have to decide how to handle it, whether they would send people out,

1413
01:50:54,268 --> 01:51:00,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would say, here's your federal and state ballot, and you have to come back for your municipal ballot, or that's why it's not.

1414
01:51:00,472 --> 01:51:02,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure it's complicated, for sure.

1415
01:51:02,694 --> 01:51:08,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to maximize the... What do other communities do?

1416
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:12,680
[SPEAKER_06]: They have municipal elections on off years.

1417
01:51:14,902 --> 01:51:21,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if anybody finds a community that doesn't do that, we could talk to them, but I haven't been able to find one.

1418
01:51:26,235 --> 01:51:29,516
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I mean, given the fact, you know, I mean.

1419
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:34,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not always be like this, but our elections commission is it.

1420
01:51:34,937 --> 01:51:39,638
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, our elections offices that less than bare bones staff right now.

1421
01:51:41,898 --> 01:51:45,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to the city council spent 2 hours talking about.

1422
01:51:46,819 --> 01:51:52,101
[SPEAKER_02]: The election report last night and assuming we'll get an elections manager soon.

1423
01:51:52,121 --> 01:51:52,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But.

1424
01:51:54,380 --> 01:52:12,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, given fiscal constraints here and in many communities, that's got to be quite a challenge for an elected office to manage.

1425
01:52:13,967 --> 01:52:16,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we would want to steer away from something like that.

1426
01:52:19,229 --> 01:52:20,069
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so the 20% would

1427
01:52:23,381 --> 01:52:32,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, 20% is about between 8,000 and 8,500, which is less than the turnout at the last municipal election.

1428
01:52:32,223 --> 01:52:37,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, too, the vote's going to be 5,000 to 4,000.

1429
01:52:37,444 --> 01:52:37,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 9,000 votes.

1430
01:52:38,044 --> 01:52:39,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not unlikely that it can happen.

1431
01:52:52,409 --> 01:52:52,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1432
01:52:53,089 --> 01:52:56,070
[SPEAKER_06]: But do we want to make the threshold higher than that?

1433
01:52:57,651 --> 01:52:58,051
[SPEAKER_06]: What about 25%?

1434
01:53:00,692 --> 01:53:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: So 25% would be about... 10,000.

1435
01:53:04,233 --> 01:53:06,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1436
01:53:07,073 --> 01:53:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're getting closer to the turnout.

1437
01:53:09,614 --> 01:53:14,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So this could theoretically be a special election, right?

1438
01:53:14,816 --> 01:53:18,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you would expect less turnout, right?

1439
01:53:20,272 --> 01:53:22,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this would be a monumental election.

1440
01:53:22,154 --> 01:53:24,455
[SPEAKER_00]: A recall election is a monumental election.

1441
01:53:24,716 --> 01:53:27,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but we're talking initiatives and recalls.

1442
01:53:27,898 --> 01:53:29,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1443
01:53:29,339 --> 01:53:42,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless we want to differentiate, we could differentiate and take 20% for initiative or referendum and 25 or 30 for recall.

1444
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:45,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be okay with that.

1445
01:53:45,971 --> 01:53:47,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd say 25 for recall and 24.

1446
01:53:50,618 --> 01:53:51,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1447
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:53,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.

1448
01:53:54,801 --> 01:53:55,101
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1449
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:55,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see how to.

1450
01:53:57,043 --> 01:53:57,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see.

1451
01:53:57,623 --> 01:53:58,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1452
01:53:59,784 --> 01:54:04,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And 30, did we take 30% or 25?

1453
01:54:05,028 --> 01:54:05,969
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 is what we said.

1454
01:54:05,989 --> 01:54:06,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1455
01:54:06,429 --> 01:54:06,689
[SPEAKER_06]: The voters.

1456
01:54:14,946 --> 01:54:19,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the challenge is to make it hard to do, but not impossible to do.

1457
01:54:19,348 --> 01:54:20,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a tough number to find.

1458
01:54:21,909 --> 01:54:22,149
Cool.

1459
01:54:22,689 --> 01:54:22,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1460
01:54:23,029 --> 01:54:24,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess for me, it's more fairness.

1461
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:27,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Can a smaller group recall someone?

1462
01:54:27,351 --> 01:54:27,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1463
01:54:28,172 --> 01:54:28,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1464
01:54:28,552 --> 01:54:28,532
100%.

1465
01:54:28,692 --> 01:54:29,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1466
01:54:29,552 --> 01:54:29,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1467
01:54:30,913 --> 01:54:33,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be a hard thing to do.

1468
01:54:34,434 --> 01:54:40,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It occurs to me, listening to some of the dialogue around Medford the last

1469
01:54:41,865 --> 01:54:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of months, I've heard many, many people tossing around the word recall.

1470
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:51,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we recall this person, that person, et cetera, et cetera.

1471
01:54:52,173 --> 01:55:03,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think the vast majority of people have any concept of what it takes.

1472
01:55:03,702 --> 01:55:06,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they think it's easy to do.

1473
01:55:06,744 --> 01:55:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: You would just get it on the ballot if we had it.

1474
01:55:12,896 --> 01:55:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think they realize how much actual work it's going to take.

1475
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:18,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1476
01:55:19,281 --> 01:55:20,742
[SPEAKER_06]: So, are we okay with this then?

1477
01:55:20,802 --> 01:55:32,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I put them in blue because, you know, that's what we've been doing with 20% for initiative or referendum and 25% for recall question.

1478
01:55:32,851 --> 01:55:35,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just got to move that where it says recall election.

1479
01:55:38,996 --> 01:55:40,017
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think so.

1480
01:55:42,145 --> 01:55:46,609
[SPEAKER_00]: where it says at least 20%?

1481
01:55:46,749 --> 01:55:54,916
[SPEAKER_06]: At least 20% of the voters must vote at an election that includes on the ballot submission to the voters of one or more initiative or referendum questions.

1482
01:55:56,697 --> 01:55:57,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute.

1483
01:55:58,159 --> 01:55:58,819
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one.

1484
01:56:11,457 --> 01:56:17,282
[SPEAKER_06]: must vote at an election that includes on the ballot submission to the voters of a recall list.

1485
01:56:18,844 --> 01:56:19,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that good?

1486
01:56:19,765 --> 01:56:20,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got it.

1487
01:56:21,386 --> 01:56:24,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question, just terminology.

1488
01:56:27,151 --> 01:56:33,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not saying 25% of the registered voters, it's saying 25% of the voters.

1489
01:56:34,033 --> 01:56:38,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So does that mean if you had 10,000 vote, then you only need 25% of 10,000?

1490
01:56:39,034 --> 01:56:39,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1491
01:56:40,935 --> 01:56:45,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's- The moment of the election, how many people were eligible to vote?

1492
01:56:46,537 --> 01:56:48,617
[SPEAKER_04]: For registered voters.

1493
01:56:49,858 --> 01:56:52,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So you wanna say of the registered voters?

1494
01:56:52,538 --> 01:56:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, because otherwise it reads,

1495
01:56:55,099 --> 01:56:56,400
[SPEAKER_00]: of voters, yeah.

1496
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:57,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Who voted?

1497
01:56:57,981 --> 01:56:59,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, who showed up to vote?

1498
01:57:00,402 --> 01:57:12,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm up here when we talked about voters as of the last, I'm trying to remember if we had registered, 20% of the voters of the city.

1499
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:16,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not, that doesn't meant in the last election, so it's more clear.

1500
01:57:17,312 --> 01:57:17,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1501
01:57:17,833 --> 01:57:18,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1502
01:57:20,398 --> 01:57:20,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1503
01:57:21,439 --> 01:57:32,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And the next, Submission of Other Matters, that was just a standard language thing that we saw, and then Conflict Encouragement.

1504
01:57:32,025 --> 01:57:33,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are pretty standard.

1505
01:57:34,226 --> 01:57:37,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's 8.29, and I think we finished.

1506
01:57:38,228 --> 01:57:38,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

1507
01:57:38,809 --> 01:57:40,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good.

1508
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:45,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm going to do is I will share this with the whole committee,

1509
01:57:47,267 --> 01:57:53,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, we're going to do two and three and seven, but if we have time, we'll do this too.

1510
01:57:53,617 --> 01:57:55,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I will send it out and put it on the agenda.

1511
01:57:57,223 --> 01:58:00,188
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have to table it, following meeting, we'll table it.

1512
01:58:01,982 --> 01:58:13,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as I've mentioned a couple of times before, because I was working on these numbers and stuff like that, I didn't have a chance to go through the National Civic League too closely.

1513
01:58:13,246 --> 01:58:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I've talked about before, the idea of public engagement, to me, means making it as easy and as transparent as possible for people

1514
01:58:32,218 --> 01:58:34,199
[SPEAKER_02]: engage with our elected officials.

1515
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:44,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I have some ideas and concerns for things that I think need to happen.

1516
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:48,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they can go in the charter or not, I don't know.

1517
01:58:50,388 --> 01:59:00,273
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not feeling like, I have some grave concerns about our elected officials not

1518
01:59:03,423 --> 01:59:08,690
[SPEAKER_02]: being inviting towards public engagement and listening.

1519
01:59:09,571 --> 01:59:14,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's a way that the charter can solve that, I would certainly like to look at it.

1520
01:59:14,938 --> 01:59:19,744
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best we can do is have the preamble say what it says.

1521
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:33,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can put those values in the preamble, which says, but I guess the thing, Eunice, if you could like look at the different sections of the charter and see where you think something like that would fit.

1522
01:59:36,765 --> 01:59:39,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, the charter is.

1523
01:59:42,674 --> 01:59:46,975
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a general document.

1524
01:59:47,215 --> 01:59:51,377
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't tend to go into that level of specificity.

1525
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:53,878
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe there's a way that it can.

1526
01:59:53,958 --> 01:59:59,300
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to try to think about it and propose it, then that's OK.

1527
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:05,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sort of of a mind that as long as it doesn't

1528
02:00:06,871 --> 02:00:13,763
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, contradict or go against federal or state law, why not?

1529
02:00:14,983 --> 02:00:17,285
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only issue is how to write it.

1530
02:00:17,825 --> 02:00:18,506
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?

1531
02:00:18,566 --> 02:00:25,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every month they must produce a newsletter or every, you know, I think that's the details of that.

1532
02:00:25,731 --> 02:00:26,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear what you're saying.

1533
02:00:26,551 --> 02:00:27,272
[SPEAKER_00]: They should do it.

1534
02:00:27,832 --> 02:00:28,793
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know how you can.

1535
02:00:28,833 --> 02:00:40,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I think, you know, when we've all, you know, well, some of us, I have, I think, Ron, your experience with the Columbus, you know, and having coming in front of council even just recently,

1536
02:00:42,243 --> 02:00:46,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I have found it very uninviting, unwelcoming.

1537
02:00:46,305 --> 02:00:58,613
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you because I've experienced it, but there's nothing I can write that says, hey, you must be nice to me and this is how you must be nice to me.

1538
02:00:59,354 --> 02:01:03,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the details of that are really, really difficult.

1539
02:01:06,028 --> 02:01:06,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1540
02:01:07,089 --> 02:01:24,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Eunice, I would encourage you to think about what is it that you would want the charter or some other document, if not the charter, to say that might address what you're worried about.

1541
02:01:24,539 --> 02:01:27,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I put in our drive under the Article 8,

1542
02:01:33,513 --> 02:01:39,999
[SPEAKER_02]: subcommittee, some suggestions, and I know it's after 8.30, and I know we all want to wrap it up.

1543
02:01:40,659 --> 02:01:42,841
[SPEAKER_02]: People can look at it if they're convenient.

1544
02:01:43,542 --> 02:01:44,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So where did you put them?

1545
02:01:46,524 --> 02:01:49,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in our drive subcommittee's article eight.

1546
02:01:51,449 --> 02:01:51,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1547
02:01:51,809 --> 02:01:54,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just get that.

1548
02:01:55,052 --> 02:01:56,253
[SPEAKER_01]: In the main folder?

1549
02:01:56,353 --> 02:01:56,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1550
02:01:57,194 --> 02:01:58,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1551
02:01:58,735 --> 02:02:00,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Citizen participation suggestions.

1552
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:04,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Eunice, have you seen this in any other charter?

1553
02:02:07,504 --> 02:02:10,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only started glancing at some of the other charters.

1554
02:02:10,126 --> 02:02:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at a lot of charters over the past few days, but it's mostly looking at.

1555
02:02:14,328 --> 02:02:17,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to see if somebody has done it and what they have done.

1556
02:02:17,891 --> 02:02:21,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a major, it's a great thing to do.

1557
02:02:22,114 --> 02:02:24,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing it is very, I think it's very difficult.

1558
02:02:26,156 --> 02:02:26,737
[SPEAKER_02]: My opinion.

1559
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:32,738
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I spent my weekend looking at this, these, you know, petition stuff.

1560
02:02:32,818 --> 02:02:36,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to go back and look at, you know, some other parts.

1561
02:02:37,463 --> 02:02:48,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So just looking at this kind of thing, first of all, I think requiring an annual state of the schools address from the superintendent would probably, if it were in the charter, would go under article four.

1562
02:02:51,136 --> 02:02:57,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that the school committee is in charge of the superintendent.

1563
02:02:57,038 --> 02:02:57,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

1564
02:02:58,019 --> 02:02:59,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's interesting to think about.

1565
02:02:59,819 --> 02:03:11,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure that the charter could, I don't know, unless it said require the school committee to require any, you know what I'm saying?

1566
02:03:11,103 --> 02:03:11,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1567
02:03:12,984 --> 02:03:14,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to think about though.

1568
02:03:15,705 --> 02:03:20,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And a state of the city address by the mayor, don't we get that?

1569
02:03:23,459 --> 02:03:26,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she does it sometimes and sometimes not.

1570
02:03:27,462 --> 02:03:29,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that it's a consistent thing.

1571
02:03:29,703 --> 02:03:37,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like there was things in Article 2 and 3 that might be similar to that.

1572
02:03:38,087 --> 02:03:39,908
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I said, it's been a while.

1573
02:03:39,928 --> 02:03:48,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we can write time and place of meetings into the charter.

1574
02:03:49,928 --> 02:03:51,949
[SPEAKER_06]: place could be different, right?

1575
02:03:52,629 --> 02:04:04,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, as I said, I mean, they're doing things for their convenience and they should be doing things for the convenience of the public who pays them.

1576
02:04:05,656 --> 02:04:06,537
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my feeling.

1577
02:04:09,758 --> 02:04:14,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would really hesitate to put something like a schedule into the charter because

1578
02:04:15,227 --> 02:04:22,053
[SPEAKER_06]: The charter is, I mean, we've seen how it's not an easy document to change.

1579
02:04:23,534 --> 02:04:28,117
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like minutiae and I feel like minutiae shouldn't be in the charter, but I don't know.

1580
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:35,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see this in an ordinance for sure.

1581
02:04:35,043 --> 02:04:37,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1582
02:04:37,225 --> 02:04:41,929
[SPEAKER_02]: But the city council writes ordinances and they're going to write them for what they want.

1583
02:04:44,848 --> 02:04:48,689
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only thing I'll say to this is, this is why we have elections.

1584
02:04:49,369 --> 02:04:57,171
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not happy with the way they're communicating or not listening or doing things that you don't like, we're all there.

1585
02:04:58,651 --> 02:05:05,513
[SPEAKER_00]: It means, you know, on election day, that's when you say, you've got to change this by making your choices.

1586
02:05:07,468 --> 02:05:15,842
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I would suggest, I mean, the call-in center is very busy and they don't always get back that quickly, but I can give this document.

1587
02:05:16,601 --> 02:05:29,427
[SPEAKER_06]: to the call-in center or maybe next time I talk to the call-in center, which I don't know when that will be, I can share this document and just get their feedback on where these things might fit in the local government.

1588
02:05:29,447 --> 02:05:34,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see another charter that, if another charter's doing it, I'd love to read what they're doing.

1589
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:34,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1590
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:37,091
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'd appreciate it if you'd reach out to them, Melva.

1591
02:05:37,111 --> 02:05:37,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1592
02:05:37,751 --> 02:05:38,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1593
02:05:38,391 --> 02:05:38,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1594
02:05:39,212 --> 02:05:39,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Gene?

1595
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:45,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you looking at the National Civic Charter, Eunice?

1596
02:05:45,542 --> 02:05:47,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the National Civic?

1597
02:05:47,102 --> 02:05:51,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, the things that I came up with were my own thoughts.

1598
02:05:52,965 --> 02:06:02,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to look at the National Civic League Charter and see if there was anything in there that might be helpful.

1599
02:06:03,129 --> 02:06:09,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get a chance to finish reading through the half a dozen pages that are applicable.

1600
02:06:12,755 --> 02:06:17,379
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just highlighting, you know, certain parts, you know.

1601
02:06:17,399 --> 02:06:29,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they do have like, I'm just looking at it, they have like, the city shall treat public engagement as an integral part of effective and trusted government.

1602
02:06:31,051 --> 02:06:31,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1603
02:06:31,671 --> 02:06:39,278
[SPEAKER_04]: They have principles like that, that I think a lot of people would be in favor of it's the

1604
02:06:40,571 --> 02:06:48,836
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, get into the nitty gritty, but they also have establishing structures.

1605
02:06:52,082 --> 02:07:11,768
[SPEAKER_02]: The term public engagement is understood to include public involvement, public participation, citizen engagement, community engagement, and includes robust forms of in-person technology or online communication to provide opportunities for public input, dialogue, or deliberations, et cetera, et cetera.

1606
02:07:12,468 --> 02:07:15,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's a meet people where they are,

1607
02:07:16,403 --> 02:07:19,646
[SPEAKER_02]: geographically holding meetings in many different locations.

1608
02:07:20,206 --> 02:07:23,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We evolved in chambers and that's quite central.

1609
02:07:24,650 --> 02:07:27,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Digitally using different tools and platforms.

1610
02:07:29,474 --> 02:07:40,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to me it's reading through it quickly is the spirit of it is wanting and inviting the public.

1611
02:07:45,977 --> 02:08:01,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty clear that, to me at least, and I think to some members of the community, that the elected officials are not interested in inviting public input.

1612
02:08:02,553 --> 02:08:05,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they were required to, that might be different.

1613
02:08:07,942 --> 02:08:15,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to wrap up, but I'm going to share that document with the call-in center units and get their thoughts on it.

1614
02:08:16,107 --> 02:08:30,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I made a note to put in the minutes that some of these concepts could conceivably be added to the preamble, like the statement that you just read, Jean, a few minutes ago, or so that's something else we can think about.

1615
02:08:30,897 --> 02:08:36,801
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can add some, you know, we can propose to the committee that we add something to the preamble about public engagement.

1616
02:08:38,555 --> 02:08:39,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound like?

1617
02:08:41,976 --> 02:08:42,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1618
02:08:42,276 --> 02:08:48,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll also look into some of those specifics and see what the feedback we get from the call-in center on that.

1619
02:08:50,399 --> 02:08:50,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1620
02:08:51,039 --> 02:08:51,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

1621
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:51,980
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1622
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:53,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

1623
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody.

1624
02:08:55,361 --> 02:08:57,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to do 2, 3, and 7 next week?

1625
02:08:58,962 --> 02:09:06,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, 2, 3, and 7, and I'm going to send 8, and I don't know that we'll get to it, but it'll be on the agenda anyway, just in case.

1626
02:09:07,428 --> 02:09:13,539
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm guessing we'll maybe do that at the following meeting, although we're going to maybe do school committee at the following meeting.

1627
02:09:13,579 --> 02:09:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have two meetings in April and two in May.

1628
02:09:16,163 --> 02:09:21,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get through all of those by the end of May, one way or another.

1629
02:09:21,593 --> 02:09:22,254
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1630
02:09:22,294 --> 02:09:23,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, everybody.

1631
02:09:23,496 --> 02:09:24,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
