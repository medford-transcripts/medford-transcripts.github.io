52
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:47,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Adequate alternative means of public access shall mean measures that provide transparency

53
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,973
[SPEAKER_10]: and permit timely and effective public access to the deliberations of public body.

54

55
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:32,528
[SPEAKER_10]: While allowance for active real participation by members of the public is a specific requirement of the general or special law or regulation or a local ordinance or bylaw, pursuant to which the proceedings is conducted in alternative means, a public access must provide for such participation.

56
00:06:33,308 --> 00:07:01,571
[SPEAKER_10]: a municipal public body that for reasons of economic hardship and despite best efforts is unable to provide alternative means of public access that will enable the public to follow the proceedings of the municipal public body as those activities are occurring in real time may instead post on its municipal website a full and complete transcript reporting or other comprehensive record of the proceedings as soon as practicable upon the conclusion of the proceedings.

57
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:13,482
[SPEAKER_10]: This paragraph shall not apply to the proceedings that are concluded pursuant to a general or special law or regulation or a local ordinance or bylaw that requires allowance for active participation by members of the public.

58
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:24,352
[SPEAKER_10]: A public body must offer its selected alternative means of access to its proceedings without subscription toll or similar charge to be public.

59
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:24,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two,

60
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,995
[SPEAKER_10]: public bodies are hereby authorized to allow remote participation by all members in any meeting of the public body.

[SPEAKER_10]: Three, a public body that elects to conduct its proceedings under the relief provided in sections one or two above shall ensure that any party entitled or required to appear before it shall be able to do so through remote means as if the party were a member of the public body and participating remotely as provided in section two.

64
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:26,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Number four, all other provisions of sections 18 to 25 of chapter 30A in the attorney general's implementing regulations shall otherwise remain unchanged if fully applicable to the activities of public bodies.

65
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:37,324
[SPEAKER_10]: This order is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until rescinded or until the state of emergency is terminated, whichever happens first.

66
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you for listening to that.

67
00:08:43,213 --> 00:09:03,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we move forward, and I open up the meeting tonight, I'd like to, before we move forward with the meeting, this week, the city lost one of our, someone actually very special to our city, and that is Joe McGonigal.

68
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,986
[SPEAKER_10]: For those of you that don't know Joe McGonigal,

69
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:09,476
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a city clerk from 1967 to 1996.

70
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:22,063
[SPEAKER_10]: That spans four decades, almost 30 years of service to our community in that one capacity.

71
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:26,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those that knew Joe, he was a pretty

72
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,200
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, you know, pretty amazing guy.

73
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:36,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I didn't get to know him till after he retired his clerk, but, uh, very nice man, uh, active in the community.

74
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:42,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I think we should, uh, start this meeting, uh, you know, by having a moment of silence for him.

75
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:47,684
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just think that he should be recognized for someone who served as long as he did.

76
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:56,327
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, you know, from 1967 to 1996 is a very long time and he was very committed to our community.

77
00:09:56,628 --> 00:10:00,449
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think we should start off by having a moment of silence for him.

78
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:05,991
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would first also like to recognize Vice President Caballero.

79
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:08,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:11,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew Joe for many years, both as a friend and

81
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,679
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time visitor to the Malden Catholic community.

82
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:20,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe was a fixture at all the Malden Catholic games, a good friend to have in the community.

83
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that 30 years of service is a long time to dedicate your life to the city of Medford.

84
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:34,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joe will be missed in our community and our prayers go out to his family.

85
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Vice President Caraviello.

86
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

87
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:51,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Joe, if many people were not aware, Joe was an avid singer, uh, as well as an historian.

88
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:56,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So he had a lot of man of many hats, a real Renaissance type man.

89
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, he will be sorely missed.

90
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

91
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:05,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we, uh, we have, uh, let's see, uh, councilor Peters.

92
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I, um, I didn't get to know Joe very well.

93
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

94
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:31,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I was three years old when he stopped serving as a city clerk, but we were really lucky to get in one of our first meetings, some materials delivered, I think, through Chris Donovan from Joe McGonigal, History of the Lawrence Light Guard, which I know that he was an avid, very knowledgeable about as well.

95
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:39,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So while I didn't get to know him very personally at all, but it's been really good to have some connection and I know

96
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,729
[SPEAKER_04]: just send condolences to his family.

97
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Councilor Bears.

98
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:45,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other councilors?

99
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

100
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:48,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Councilor Knight.

101
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:53,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

102
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:59,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to echo my colleague's sentiments relative to Mr. McGonigal.

103
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,220
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a great gentleman.

104
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the opportunity over the past decade or so to get to know him rather well.

105
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was a really good guy.

106
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:13,682
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a great sense of humor, a great sense of wit, and a great understanding of how government is supposed to work.

107
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:18,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wasn't afraid to tell you if he felt as though you were doing a good job.

108
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:21,685
[SPEAKER_03]: and more so if you were doing a bad job.

109
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:23,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Joe was a great guy.

110
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:28,668
[SPEAKER_03]: He was certainly a gentleman who had a great way and a great approach to life.

111
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:35,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And his memory will live on down in the city clerk's office with his portrait.

112
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:40,376
[SPEAKER_03]: commemorating the years of service that he had dedicated to the city of Medford.

113
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:52,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I'd like to join my colleagues in extending my deepest and sincerest condolences to his family and for the gratitude for lending him to us for the better part of five decades.

114
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:54,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

115
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

116
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:57,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:13,742
[SPEAKER_08]: As I get up there in age and 50 years old, you start seeing the backbone of our community, those people that just gave to our community day in and day out, that made Medford how great it is today.

118
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:17,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And losing somebody like Joe Hurts, he was a great guy.

119
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw him at one of the debates.

120
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: him and his son, a great family man, and will surely be missed.

121
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:30,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So our prayers go out to his family and we'll miss him.

122
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:31,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

123
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:33,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

124
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:37,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the clerk would like to say a few words.

125
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:39,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Hurtubise.

126
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:43,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to say something on a personal note if you will indulge me.

127
00:13:56,321 --> 00:14:00,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can tell you that he was one of the first people who called me when I started the job.

128
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:03,483
[SPEAKER_09]: He called me fairly frequently.

129
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,884
[SPEAKER_09]: He checked in fairly frequently.

130
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:09,025
[SPEAKER_09]: He was very often visiting in the Registrar's of Voters Office.

131
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:17,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw him as recently as the beginning of March at the presidential primary, and I've always welcomed his in-person visits to the office.

132
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really nice to meet him in person.

133
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,149
[SPEAKER_09]: It was nice to talk to him on the phone.

134
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,731
[SPEAKER_09]: He became a nice, a trusted mentor to me.

135
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:30,772
[SPEAKER_09]: was very, very good to me in terms of telling me what I needed to know.

136
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:34,093
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of his records are actually still down in the vault in the basement.

137
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,233
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty incredible.

138
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:39,154
[SPEAKER_09]: As many of you know, he was a butcher while he was putting himself through Boston College.

139
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:45,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And his records are very tightly and carefully wrapped up in butcher paper down in the basement.

140
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:46,375
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty amazing.

141
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:52,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also know that Joe was very, very proud to be the first of three successive Boston College graduates to serve as city clerk.

142
00:14:54,597 --> 00:15:01,982
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, the last conversation I had with him in March was about how proud he was to be the first of three in a row from BC.

143
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:09,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to extend my own condolences to his family as well and thank them for sharing him with the city for so long.

144
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, City Clerk Hurtubise.

145
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, at this point, if you could please rise for a brief moment of silence.

146
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:38,378
Thank you.

147
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:49,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take paper 20314 out of order.

148
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:55,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

149
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:56,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, please call the roll.

150
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:01,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

151
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:02,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

152
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello?

153
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

154
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:05,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

155
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:06,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

156
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:07,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

157
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:08,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

158
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:09,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell?

159
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:10,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

160
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:11,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

161
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:12,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

162
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:13,394
[SPEAKER_09]: President Fevelko?

163
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:14,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

164
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:16,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Signing the affirmative, zeroing the negative, the motion passes.

165
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:21,797
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-314 offered by Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Marks.

166
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:31,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council get a response from the city engineer regarding the council mandated curb-to-curb paving of all streets opened by any utility or private company.

167
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President Caraviello.

168
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, I'll refer to my senior councilor, Councilor Marks on this.

169
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:41,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Marks.

170
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:42,002
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the co-author.

171
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:43,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

172
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll refer to the Vice President of the Method City Council, Councilor Caraviello.

173
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:48,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

174
00:16:50,721 --> 00:17:06,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, about a year and a half ago, Councilor Marks offered this motion to all utilities and private contractors that opened the street up to make sure that they were paved curve to curve.

175
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:19,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Because over the years, shoddy work was done by many subcontractors and left our streets in the condition you see them with now, with shoddy patch jobs.

176
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:20,810
[SPEAKER_01]: sinking hole.

177
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:30,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So Council Marks introduced this resolution to make sure that all street openings now come with a curb-to-curb paving.

178
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:42,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I brought this up this week is because driving around the city right now, there's many, many companies out there doing gas work and all kinds of street work.

179
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:46,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to see if the resolution that was passed,

180
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:56,617
[SPEAKER_01]: These companies are doing the curb-to-curb paving that has been required by all street openings.

181
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

182
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe we actually have the city engineer with us.

183
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:04,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, just if I could.

184
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

185
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:12,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the city engineer, I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for co-sponsoring this with me.

186
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think we realize all too often

187
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:26,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, when utility work is being done in the community, first of all, uh, the utility companies will do their very best not to do curb to curb and explain the reasoning why.

188
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:40,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and secondly, uh, they'll come out depending on what time of year it is and say that, uh, this is only the initial patch job and, uh, the curb to curb restoration will take place at a later date.

189
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:49,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's important that we as a council get follow-up on our request to make sure that curb-to-curb is done.

190
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:56,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if it takes six to eight months to have it done, that this work truly gets done by the utility companies.

191
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for co-authoring this.

192
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

193
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

194
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:09,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

195
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:25,754
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I've looked into quite a bit since my election to the Medford City Council, and I do understand that there are certain state laws and state parameters that guide public utility companies and what is required of them and what is not.

196
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:37,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I, earlier in the day, had forwarded an email to the city clerk proposing a B paper amendment to this proposal that's before us, Mr. President.

197
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:51,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And that B paper amendment would be that, be it resolved, the Medford City Council request the city administration establish a policy requiring that all street opening permits, my phone just shut off, so I lost it.

198
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology's great.

199
00:19:57,116 --> 00:20:09,557
[SPEAKER_03]: All street opening permits to be accompanied by a neighborhood mitigation agreement that will adequately adequately and reasonably offset the negative impact on the quality of life caused during street opening construction and city neighborhoods.

200
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:27,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mr. President, what we see here, if you look around the city of Metro right now, Garfield Ave, Sheridan Ave, Golden Ave, Main Street, Central Street, Woburn Street, National Grid or other public utility providers have ripped up our streets.

201
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:29,794
[SPEAKER_03]: They're storing their equipment on our roadways.

202
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,935
[SPEAKER_03]: They're storing their supplies on our roadways.

203
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:34,476
[SPEAKER_03]: They're causing detours in neighborhoods.

204
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:38,218
[SPEAKER_03]: They're putting parking restrictions in for three and four weeks at a time, Mr. President.

205
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's causing an impact to the quality of life of residents in the neighborhood.

206
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,200
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll take Golden Ave, for example.

207
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:54,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I've probably put forward 25 to 30 resolutions asking for Golden Ave to be repaved, resurfaced, potholes fixed over the course of the last four years.

208
00:20:55,365 --> 00:21:01,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, just recently, Devereux Corporation, on behalf of National Grid, closed down Golden Ave for a month.

209
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:02,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a week, rather.

210
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:06,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did the work that they had to do in the trenches.

211
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:20,322
[SPEAKER_03]: and did a great job Mr. President they run quite an operation actually they're very efficient, but the potholes on the street is still there there is still broken sidewalk panels on the, on the sidewalks there is still tree stumps that need to be removed.

212
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:24,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that it might be reasonable for us to request

213
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:34,353
[SPEAKER_03]: a mitigation agreement to address some of these concerns in the neighborhood to offset some of the quality of life issues that come with these street construction permits.

214
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:46,321
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Mr. President, if they're asphalting the whole entire stretch of Golden Ave, is it too much to ask for them to take out a couple of broken sidewalk panels and replace those panels with asphalt until we can get to them with concrete?

215
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really think it is, Mr. President.

216
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:55,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mitigation agreement can be reflective to the scope of work that's being done.

217
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:59,606
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's a small project that's being done, we can only ask for a little bit.

218
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:02,767
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a big project that's being done, we can ask for a lot.

219
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,829
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that this is something we really need to look at long and hard, Mr. President.

220
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:11,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all been talking now for the better part of a decade about

221
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:16,355
[SPEAKER_03]: what we can do to hold public utility providers accountable.

222
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:18,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is one way we can do it.

223
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I commend Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Marks for bringing this resolution forward.

224
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:26,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also thank the city engineer for being here this evening.

225
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:35,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I motioned for this paper to be taken out of order because I saw that he was here and I really am looking forward to some of the comments that he has to make relative to this proposal.

226
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:40,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I would make a motion to join that as a B paper.

227
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:43,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already forwarded the language to the city clerk and all the members.

228
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:54,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I rest.

229
00:22:55,764 --> 00:22:56,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

230
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:00,287
[SPEAKER_10]: On the B paper, is the B paper a second?

231
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:08,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President, the B paper seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli, you can speak next.

232
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:13,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, I think Council marks and Councilor Caraviello bring this forward.

233
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:23,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that what we saw to assist the these new city engineer was one of the biggest concerns we had when I started four years ago was the

234
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:31,539
[SPEAKER_08]: the issues of our streets deteriorating, we realized it was mostly the patchwork that was done by utilities.

235
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:43,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe it was at the high school, at one of our meetings, where the meetings were held at the high school, and we held, I believe it was Comcast to the fire, and said that we wanted curb to curb.

236
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:48,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And the question we asked, we said, has that ever been approached by the city engineer at the time?

237
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:49,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, no.

238
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:55,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I believe they went to a side table, came back and decided to do it.

239
00:23:55,708 --> 00:24:00,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think since that day, we've actually tried everything we could to move that initiative forward.

240
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:16,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, you know, I, I think that, uh, as we move forward, we have so many streets that would need to be repaired, but going forward, unless we get ahead of this, I think this is the beginning of what deteriorates our roads and streets and our community.

241
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:22,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It starts with this, this patchwork, and then the neglect of them afterwards.

242
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:25,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank you again, and I fully support both papers.

243
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:26,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

244
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

245
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:29,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

246
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:30,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

247
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:33,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I strongly support both papers.

248
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to all of the previous councilors who just spoke.

249
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:41,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Really support the mitigation agreement and B paper presented by Councilor Knight.

250
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to draw attention to a larger question.

251
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:51,707
[SPEAKER_04]: We call them public utilities, but the fact is that they have been privatized and deregulated over the past several decades.

252
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: We call them public utilities.

253
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,031
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying not to spend the money to keep our roads safe.

254
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: They make significant profits.

255
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: National Grid made $4 billion in profit last year.

256
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:04,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Comcast made $41 billion in profit last year.

257
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:07,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they can afford to fix our roads.

258
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:10,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

259
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:11,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell.

260
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:12,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

261
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:16,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want to echo my colleagues and thanking my other colleagues for bringing this forward.

262
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:28,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli made a really good point that, you know, we do have potholes and we have deterioration on our streets, but so much of this is this patchwork, and it really becomes a public safety issue.

263
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:38,253
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times, say, bike riders, walkers, runners are dodging this patchwork, and now they're in traffic, and now there's a car swerving around them, or we're going up farther, or it's just

264
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,321
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great way, it's a trip hazard.

265
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:45,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is really a public safety issue that needs to be addressed and be addressed by the people.

266
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:51,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to supporting this and I thank my Councilors for raising the issue in such a way.

267
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

268
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, Vice President Caraviello.

269
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:06,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, if I can make a seat paper that we move to make this ordinance a city law now.

270
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so basically, so the ordinance will be the law.

271
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:21,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to formulate an ordinance to, do you want to formulate the ordinance, Councilor?

272
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:23,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello?

273
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:25,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry?

274
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:32,272
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to basically make an official ordinance with regard to this, to curb-to-curb paving?

275
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:33,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, to make it law.

276
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:35,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

277
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the seat name.

278
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:39,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight?

279
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:46,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe state law dictates the requirements that are necessary and mandated for these public utility companies.

280
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:54,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it would be important for us before we take a vote on this to hear further from our city engineer relative to those scope and specifications.

281
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,693
[SPEAKER_03]: But from what I understand, I think I want to say the project is like

282
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:07,592
[SPEAKER_03]: SWOP or something like that would be the acronym that was used to, I'm going to mush this, get out of here.

283
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:10,415
[SPEAKER_03]: The acronym that would be used.

284
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:18,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look it up in the meantime, but I think we should allow the city engineer an opportunity to speak on this before moving further.

285
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

286
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:20,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, why don't we do that?

287
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:21,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

288
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:24,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the city engineer with us, Tim McGibbon.

289
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm unmuted.

290
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:32,648
[SPEAKER_10]: You're unmuted.

291
00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:34,069
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't hear you.

292
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:34,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

293
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

294
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everybody.

295
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:39,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot was said.

296
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:43,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I jotted some notes down, but I'm happy to, if I, if I miss something, then

297
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:45,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to address it.

298
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:54,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to zoom out big picture, I've been the city engineer for a couple months past a year now.

299
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,614
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know being a resident of Medford and watching city council, I know this has been an issue.

300
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:13,084
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we're doing actually right now that Mayor Lungo-Koehn is very active on and is pushing hard

301
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:26,612
[SPEAKER_00]: is establishing a payment management plan, which is an asset management program, which we are going to be coupling with our utility asset management program, which I briefed the council on prior.

302
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:34,858
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of at the near the end of our utility asset management program, and we're going to be starting up hopefully soon.

303
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:37,380
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get a consultant on board for payment management program.

304
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:53,083
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges is that, and I know Councilor Marks has talked about this quite a bit, is the mileage of road we have and the budget that we use to repave and resurface, and then the timelines associated with that don't line up.

305
00:28:53,623 --> 00:29:13,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically pavement's one of the city's largest assets and we are spending money to repave and resurface and we're asking utility companies to do curb-to-curb and full overlays when they're within the five-year moratorium.

306
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:23,641
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have special projects when things like Eversource and National Grid are coming in, we have them do curb to curb.

307
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:32,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's lagging, and I'll talk about that in a second, which is why some of the roads may seem like that they are just in terrible shape.

308
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:34,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about Golden Avenue as well.

309
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:49,594
[SPEAKER_00]: So that pavement management plan is gonna help us budget and allocate resources that we have, and then do capital planning for future years, so we are actually addressing our pavement in a logical, scientific way.

310
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:57,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're repairing and crack sealing on the years we're supposed to, and we're repaving roads on the years we're supposed to be repaving.

311
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:00,857
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my perspective, that's very exciting, from an engineering perspective.

312
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:04,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just sort of the big picture zooming out, that's coming.

313
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:25,371
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, just the way that utility installation works is we don't, it would be bad practice to have, say, for example, National Grid to install a gas line and then do curb to curb if we need to come back a year or two later and redo the water line.

314
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:31,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if Eversource is coming through, which they did on Mystic Avenue,

315
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:36,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And National Grid also needs to come through there.

316
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:40,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the Water Department needs to come through there.

317
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:49,117
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, we also have sewer repairs that we're trying to make, casting repairs that we're trying to make, curbing and ramp repairs we're trying to make.

318
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:58,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as simple as, I wish it was, as saying as National Grid's gonna replace that gas line in the street, so when they're done, they should do curb to curb.

319
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:07,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't want them to do curb to curb because we want them to do a, depending on the timing, either a temporary patch or a permanent patch.

320
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:15,370
[SPEAKER_00]: A permanent patch is usually about half the road to somewhere between a quarter and a half of the road, usually, depending on where the line is.

321
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:20,226
[SPEAKER_00]: because we need to come through and replace the water line, like the things I was talking about.

322
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:24,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a logical progression to the work.

323
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,111
[SPEAKER_00]: A good example is actually Golden Avenue.

324
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,553
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wasn't on my radar actually until...

325
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:30,847
[SPEAKER_00]: The council brought it to my radar.

326
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:32,928
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of streets at Golden Avenue.

327
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Golden Avenue right now in the queue.

328
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:40,611
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the work that you're seeing on Golden Avenue is because of the council.

329
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked National Grid to do the gas line.

330
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:49,916
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna see if the water line needs to be replaced and replace the water line if needed.

331
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:59,079
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once all that work is done, we then come through and do a final repave of Golden Avenue Which is supposed to last five years.

332
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ordinance says Five-year moratorium on any new pavement.

333
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:09,523
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we don't let companies Do any work in the street for a five-year period now?

334
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:13,565
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes we do have to let them do work whether it's an emergency whether it's a

335
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:16,765
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, providing a much-needed service, something like that.

336
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:21,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime that happens, we do require curb-to-curb.

337
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:36,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, any new grant allocations, you know, I know the council requires curb-to-curb, but that's something I want to try to do more often as well if we don't have a new utility and we don't have other repairs to make over time.

338
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:48,260
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I started implementing very shortly after I started this position was what's called a moratorium special exception.

339
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:55,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year we have a winter moratorium that lasts from November 15th to somewhere in the middle of April, sometimes the first of April.

340
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:03,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I started, there was just exceptions.

341
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:10,585
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the city engineer and the DPW commissioner may or may not allow work during that moratorium.

342
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,806
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer is gonna die, one second.

343
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:15,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna plug it in.

344
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:18,889
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't working out well because there was no way to hold the contractors accountable.

345
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:24,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the last year, and it worked well over the first winter I was in this position,

346
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:38,590
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the contractors basically fill out a form and we create a log so we can track them and they come back in the springtime, which is supposed to be around now, to put permanent patches in.

347
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:47,055
[SPEAKER_00]: or do curb to curb or do whatever they need to do based off of our judgment when they come back in the spring.

348
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:49,336
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fairly successful last year.

349
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:51,458
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to track the contract, just hold them accountable.

350
00:33:51,498 --> 00:34:00,845
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't give them, we don't give them any new permits until they go back and fix the work or do the permanent patch that they created over the winter.

351
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,547
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually would do a temporary patch over the winter and we didn't do that.

352
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:08,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going towards the goal here.

353
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:17,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mechanisms that we use for street opening permits are basically three simple mechanisms.

354
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,391
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a temporary patch.

355
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:27,853
[SPEAKER_00]: We have them put that in if we know that we're going to immediately follow with some other work or another utility company is going to immediately follow with some other work.

356
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:31,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Then permanent patches, which are more permanent, obviously.

357
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:44,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And then curb-to-curb, which we do on all moratoriums, or if pavement's in really good condition, we say, yeah, that pavement's going to last another 20 years, and you don't have any other work proposed, so do curb-to-curb.

358
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:46,348
[SPEAKER_00]: That does happen.

359
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:48,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you don't notice it because it's in good condition.

360
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:52,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody notices the bad condition on the potholes, and I understand that.

361
00:34:54,338 --> 00:35:02,353
[SPEAKER_00]: National Grid has a program that we've worked out with them over the years because they do so much work and because they're always working in the city.

362
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:07,247
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to keep a close eye on what they're doing.

363
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:12,050
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to react to any mistakes or settlement in the trenching.

364
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,792
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very good at fixing those things when we see them.

365
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:27,118
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're always telling folks if there's an issue, residents are calling, whatever, and it's because of national grid, they usually react to it within a day or two and fix it.

366
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:29,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all utility companies do that.

367
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,227
[SPEAKER_00]: National is pretty good.

368
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:42,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we are planning on paving that street, for example, I'm trying to think of a, Golden Avenue might be an example, but there are other ones, a lot of them actually.

369
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:51,597
[SPEAKER_00]: When we know that we are going to pave that road or we are gonna install a water line in that road or repair something, we don't have them do a permanent patch.

370
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:57,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We have them do a temporary patch and then they reimburse us the money that they normally would have spent

371
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,741
[SPEAKER_00]: on a full permanent patch.

372
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:04,147
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can take that money and use it for paving other roads.

373
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:09,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the mayor will want to use it for paving private ways.

374
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:14,957
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of bank account, that balance accumulates over time.

375
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:19,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually going to talk to them about

376
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,553
[SPEAKER_00]: cashing in basically.

377
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:23,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Mr. President.

378
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

379
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:45,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim, that process where the public utility contractor, or as Councilor Bears, the quasi-public utility contractor, when they do a temporary patch

380
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:49,008
[SPEAKER_03]: and then contribute the funds to the city.

381
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:51,868
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a program that's outlined by state law, correct?

382
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:58,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have to, yeah, they're supposed to spend a certain amount of money and pay a certain amount.

383
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there is some state statute involved, but I don't know if it gets that specific.

384
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,071
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically it's money that they were going to spend and they didn't.

385
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:12,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what statute applies.

386
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:19,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that it's a program that we have been working with National Grid and using it for many years before me.

387
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

388
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just don't know what statue it is, but I don't know.

389
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:33,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of curb to curb, that's one aspect of the proposal.

390
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:41,585
[SPEAKER_03]: The B paper, when a utility contractor is working on a street like Olden Avenue,

391
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:54,554
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's been a lot of people that have been killed 15 times over the... Sorry, Councilor Knight, you're breaking up.

392
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:57,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's anything... I can't hear Councilor Knight.

393
00:37:58,635 --> 00:37:59,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can't hear him either.

394
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

395
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:03,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see him.

396
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:06,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he's trying to figure out his connection.

397
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:09,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello, comment, Councilor Marks.

398
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

399
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,602
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest complaints we get from the neighbors is the utilities rip up the streets, and they leave them in poor condition.

400
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:27,565
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tim, you didn't answer the question that was posed to you this evening, is that we passed this about a year ago.

401
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:36,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And have any of the utility companies done the curb-to-curb paving that was in the resolution that was passed some time ago?

402
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:53,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on the road, and it depends on if we have work that needs to get done, additional work.

403
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:59,005
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want, well, it's my opinion, I suppose, but it's also, I think, standard practice.

404
00:38:59,825 --> 00:39:07,089
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want a utility company necessarily to pave curve to curve if we have additional work to do in that street, say, the next year.

405
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:33,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're planning on installing a water line after National Grid does their gas line, and National Grid paves curb to curb, then not only are we ripping up brand new pavement to install a water line, which to me is bad practice, also a bit of a waste of asphalt materials, which is a petroleum product.

406
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:39,442
[SPEAKER_01]: have we done any streets under the curb, the curb that was proposed a year ago?

407
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean- Can you give me one street that was done?

408
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:46,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Not off the top of my head.

409
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:49,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not off the top of my head.

410
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:57,493
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess of not, we've been just going by standard practice.

411
00:39:57,533 --> 00:40:02,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know if that resolution is baked into our process.

412
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:09,486
[SPEAKER_00]: If the resolution is that simple, I don't think it should be baked into the process like that.

413
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:12,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it needs to be a little bit more detailed.

414
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the idea of an ordinance may be helpful here.

415
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:24,968
[SPEAKER_00]: But it needs to be more detailed because, like I said, Eversource is a good example, right?

416
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:27,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're operating under a granite location.

417
00:40:27,749 --> 00:40:29,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Eversource is paving curb-to-curb when they're done.

418
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,291
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three miles plus from one end of the city to the other.

419
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:37,233
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not going to happen for a little bit of time here.

420
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:40,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, they're going to be pulling cable and doing manhole work.

421
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:43,315
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the year after that is when they're going to be doing the curb-to-curb pavement.

422
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,696
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example.

423
00:40:46,996 --> 00:41:00,963
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, through Eversource's route through the city, where we've asked National Grid to replace all their gas mains in that route, and we've asked the water department what water mains need to be replaced.

424
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:09,066
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to get all that work done before Eversource comes in a year and a half from now or whatever and paves curb to curb.

425
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:17,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my response is that I can't list a street that we've done that to.

426
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:39,423
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I think there needs to be some more thought into the logical steps on going from street that needs lots of utility work, subsurface work, and surface work, and final paving, so we can put a bow on it for five years.

427
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think it's as simple as- Five years?

428
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, five years, yeah.

429
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,403
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our moratorium.

430
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:49,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, once we pay, we don't dig it again for five years.

431
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:50,606
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it's supposed to work.

432
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to say, Mr. President.

433
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:07,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I thought we had passed something, and again, it's just gone by the wayside.

434
00:42:10,052 --> 00:42:11,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's gone by the wayside.

435
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:28,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the standard practice that we use, when we're done with our work on streets, we pave curb to curb, that we do the full pavement once all the work that needs to get done, that's gonna last another 20, 30, 40, 50 years, and then pave.

436
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:43,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, somebody better tell the people on all these streets off of Main Street that this street's not getting paved, being paved crib to crib, because they all think the streets are getting paved after all this gas work is done.

437
00:42:45,048 --> 00:42:47,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody better let all these residents know that.

438
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:59,131
[SPEAKER_00]: If the road is in bad shape, and we're evaluating the street open and private application, we'll usually have them do a permanent patch.

439
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:01,613
[SPEAKER_00]: which is better than a temporary patch.

440
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,674
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full depth rebuild of the pavement.

441
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:10,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim, in all due respect, there's permanent patches that are sinking all over the city.

442
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:21,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting some feedback.

443
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:28,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if I could ask everyone, if you're not speaking, if you could just put yourself on mute, and then we'll see if that helps out.

444
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:36,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello, I don't know if the city engineer heard your question.

445
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:43,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, I can show you dozens of permanent patches that are sinking throughout the whole city.

446
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:46,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

447
00:43:46,712 --> 00:43:48,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not your fault, Tim.

448
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:50,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is before you came on.

449
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:51,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.

450
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:52,776
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all over the place.

451
00:43:53,336 --> 00:43:54,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I want to know about them.

452
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:57,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do identify them, we do try to hold the contractors accountable.

453
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,020
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've been pushing

454
00:43:59,911 --> 00:44:07,975
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a tags installed which are just little tags so we know which utility company before I came no one was doing that I Agree with that.

455
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:08,796
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good program.

456
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:11,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so so trying to hold them accountable.

457
00:44:11,497 --> 00:44:13,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be

458
00:44:17,395 --> 00:44:18,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be cautious here.

459
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:23,640
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be doing things, standard practice and good practice, good protocol.

460
00:44:23,981 --> 00:44:38,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the pavement management plan that I talked about, one of the big things that this, the reasons that our streets are sort of in poor shape has to do with the capital planning, the lack of pavement management program, the lack of,

461
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:44,238
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to help.

462
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:45,599
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take some time.

463
00:44:45,619 --> 00:45:03,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be careful when we are talking about this resolution to make sure that all of the Councils understand the logical process that we go through from street is in bad condition to street is done and in good condition.

464
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:16,947
[SPEAKER_00]: the utility companies contribute more towards that resurfacing.

465
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:26,751
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to do it, like I was saying, through ordinance where there may be some requirement where they have to put money into an account.

466
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:33,634
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a SPOF that was done quite a number of years back that is an ordinance, something like that.

467
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:35,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have it, but

468
00:45:36,389 --> 00:45:39,190
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't been staffed and it hasn't been administered.

469
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:45,352
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we could staff and administer that's existing right now in the ordinance.

470
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:48,693
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are things that we can do.

471
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:59,937
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now when we issue street opening permits, we have to balance having National Grid replace their leaky gas lines with

472
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:28,687
[SPEAKER_00]: My one permit officer and inspector in my office and making sure that we can oversee their work while at the same time Having national grid operate five crews at once in the city so they can replace the leaky gas lines so, you know More inspectors would be helpful for that in my office that to hold the contractors accountable make sure that we're putting our eyeballs on all the trench work that happens and

473
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:32,433
[SPEAKER_00]: and making sure that it's done right.

474
00:46:34,174 --> 00:46:37,075
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is work to be done here, for sure.

475
00:46:37,515 --> 00:46:38,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to pick away at it.

476
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:53,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to implement programs to make it so we're following a little bit better standard practice out there and we're not just status quo that it has been for years and years.

477
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:54,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think

478
00:46:57,366 --> 00:46:59,447
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's some work to be done here, for sure.

479
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:00,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I acknowledge that 100%.

480
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:07,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave it up to my other council.

481
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:08,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to say, Mr. President.

482
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:11,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

483
00:47:11,793 --> 00:47:13,233
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a number of members that wanna speak.

484
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:19,216
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have Councilor Marks, and then we're gonna loop back to Councilor Knight, who had started and we lost his connection.

485
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:23,618
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go Councilor Marks, Councilor Knight, and then Councilor Bears.

486
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:25,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

487
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:36,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank Tim because, uh, over the past year, he has done a lot of work in trying to pull everything together in the engineer's office.

489
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:53,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the medallion program that he's talking about, uh, I'd like to see that implemented citywide where temporary and permanent patches utility company puts a small medallion with their name, uh, what they're doing there and contact information.

490
00:47:54,069 --> 00:48:00,893
[SPEAKER_05]: That way, anyone in the city, not just someone from the city engineer's office, can walk down their street and say, you know what, I see a sinking hole there.

491
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the name of this particular company on it.

492
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:09,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at least city hall knows what you're referring to and so forth and can get on top of it.

493
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:13,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that work that Tim's done on that.

494
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim mentioned about a capital plan.

495
00:48:17,301 --> 00:48:20,683
[SPEAKER_05]: This council has been calling for a capital plan for 20 years.

496
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:32,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad to hear that we will have a pavement capital plan because there's $0 allocated in the city's budget for total street repavement.

497
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:37,721
[SPEAKER_05]: The money that we get for street repavement comes from chapter 90 money, which is about $980,000 a year.

498
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:45,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're talking maybe if you can get through a street or two with that amount of money, you're lucky.

499
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have over 760 streets in the city.

500
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:54,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so you can see we're never going to get ahead of it by just following chapter 90 money.

501
00:48:55,053 --> 00:49:00,495
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to do some type of capital plan or put money on a yearly appropriation and the budget.

502
00:49:01,675 --> 00:49:09,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, part of the frustration I think councilor Caraviello was talking about is every time a utility company appeared before the council.

503
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:17,276
[SPEAKER_05]: The city engineer, and in this case it was the previous city engineer, would put all the agreements within the paper.

504
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:22,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could bet your bottom dollar, it never said curb to curb restoration.

505
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:26,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always permanent patch or restored as they found it.

506
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the council that took a stance back a year or two ago saying, you know what?

507
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:34,005
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to tolerate this anymore.

508
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:35,086
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like the condition.

509
00:49:35,446 --> 00:49:43,192
[SPEAKER_05]: The subcontractors and utility companies are leaving our streets and we're going to require pavement curb to curb.

510
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:49,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of them kicked back at us and we kicked back at them saying, well, maybe you won't get it approved if you're looking to get it approved.

511
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:55,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure enough, each one over time committed to doing curb to curb restoration.

512
00:49:56,328 --> 00:50:08,894
[SPEAKER_05]: So part of the, uh, request, I think by councilor Caraviello myself, and I won't speak for him was to go back over the last year and a half, two years on all the council votes that requested curb to curb.

513
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:16,437
[SPEAKER_05]: As a condition, not as just, Hey, will you please do this as a condition of approval, whether or not that got done.

514
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:21,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized it could be in the stages of getting done because Tim mentioned

515
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:26,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a temporary patch because there's other utility work being done there.

516
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:27,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's fine.

517
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:35,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in regards to, uh, creating an ordinance, this definitely needs to go to the public works subcommittee.

518
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:38,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's not a black and white issue.

519
00:50:38,878 --> 00:50:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of other circumstances that play a factor.

520
00:50:42,421 --> 00:50:48,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I would personally like to know that my city engineer is backing what we think should be done.

521
00:50:49,286 --> 00:50:50,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that would be the case.

522
00:50:51,277 --> 00:51:04,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if we create an ordinance that gave direction to the city engineer saying, this is how we would like to operate as a city and as a city council, knowing that you have to use your expertise and so forth and your judgment.

523
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, I don't think you can create a cookie cutter.

524
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We want curb to curb on every project.

525
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:13,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I, I think we need to craft something.

526
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: that's meaningful that allows the city engineer to do his work and not tie his hands.

527
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:24,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to see that be sent to the public works subcommittee.

528
00:51:24,947 --> 00:51:32,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And just my last point, as the city engineer just referred to, you'll have the same utility company, they outnumber us.

529
00:51:32,974 --> 00:51:38,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So they might have five trucks in the city and all aspects of the community doing work.

530
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:43,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And we may have one clerk of the work that's out there overseeing all these projects.

531
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:45,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unrealistic.

532
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:48,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just one utility company.

533
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,879
[SPEAKER_05]: There are several out there that may be doing work.

534
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,100
[SPEAKER_05]: There are subcontractors that are doing work.

535
00:51:53,620 --> 00:52:00,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think in order to get on this, you know, get our hands around this problem, we do have to look and Tim, I'll say it.

536
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:02,202
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't want, you don't want to say it.

537
00:52:02,882 --> 00:52:07,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to look at the budget and I think his office needs additional staff.

538
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:10,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we have to take a look at this.

539
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:18,374
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if we're going to talk about it, we was just talking last week about putting our money where our mouth is on a different subject.

540
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to our streets and our roads.

541
00:52:23,237 --> 00:52:26,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as Councilor Scarpelli says all the time, that's probably

542
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:38,878
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not the number one, it's the number two call I get regarding potholes, regarding sidewalks, regarding manholes that are sinking, regarding catch basins that are sinking all around the community.

543
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:41,520
[SPEAKER_05]: We really have an old infrastructure.

544
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:46,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to take a look at this and, uh, you know, we have to be smart about it.

545
00:52:46,523 --> 00:52:48,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate everything Tim's done.

546
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:52,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he's been very attentive over the last year and several months.

547
00:52:53,448 --> 00:52:56,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I think he has us on the right track to moving forward.

548
00:52:57,414 --> 00:53:01,398
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this is a larger issue rather than just voting on something tonight.

549
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:10,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move something to subcommittee on public works and have them sit down and put something together meaningful that addresses all our concerns.

550
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:13,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we share all the same concerns.

551
00:53:13,409 --> 00:53:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make sure someone's safeguarding our city.

552
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:18,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make sure that whatever the utility companies are doing,

553
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:28,972
[SPEAKER_05]: They're held accountable, and that's to make sure we have a plan that's endorsed by not just the city engineer, but by the mayor's office and by the city council.

554
00:53:29,912 --> 00:53:30,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

555
00:53:30,712 --> 00:53:31,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

556
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:37,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, if I'm correct, you'd like to move the main paper to the public works subcommittee?

557
00:53:38,293 --> 00:53:41,134
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's amendable to my other colleagues, yes.

558
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:44,414
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, on that motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by?

559
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:45,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

560
00:53:46,215 --> 00:53:46,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

561
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight, you have the floor.

562
00:53:53,752 --> 00:53:54,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Where was I?

563
00:53:57,155 --> 00:53:58,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Before you lost me.

564
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:02,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the longest point of information on record.

565
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:06,682
[SPEAKER_05]: You attacked the information or was it muted?

566
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:08,604
[SPEAKER_10]: We lost you at 745.

567
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:09,885
[SPEAKER_10]: In that case, call me tomorrow.

568
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:23,068
[SPEAKER_03]: No, on the paper Mr. President, and speaking with the city engineer.

569
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:32,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel as though this is something that's feasible and something that's attainable that you can work out a neighborhood mitigation agreement with these contractors that are seeking a street opening permit.

570
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:39,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the ones that do regular business in the city, yes, I do think so.

571
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:42,599
[SPEAKER_00]: The one-offs and the mom-and-pops, that's gonna be tougher.

572
00:54:42,919 --> 00:54:58,583
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually doing service work anyway, but the national grids and the Comcasts and the, I would say this is kind of one and done type of project, but yeah, yes, the utility companies that do lots of work in the city.

573
00:54:58,643 --> 00:55:00,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And National Grid probably does the most out of anybody.

574
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:03,444
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that's a very feasible idea.

575
00:55:04,236 --> 00:55:04,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

576
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:08,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you know, ultimately we have to look at it both ways.

577
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,280
[SPEAKER_03]: The work that they're doing in our community is work to improve our underground infrastructure.

578
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

579
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have gas leaks going on all over the community.

580
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:21,423
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have national grid come in and take the steps that they need to prevent these gas leaks from continuing.

581
00:55:21,783 --> 00:55:26,525
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've all gone on record saying we don't want any level two and level three gas leaks in the city of Medford.

582
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:29,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want a plan.

583
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:30,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say it out again.

584
00:55:34,507 --> 00:55:35,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're losing you.

585
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:41,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing you.

586
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not going to beat the dead horse, Mr. President.

587
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:47,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the bee paper to go forward to the administration.

588
00:55:47,451 --> 00:55:48,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask my council.

589
00:55:52,873 --> 00:55:53,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

590
00:55:53,973 --> 00:55:55,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

591
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:58,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

592
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:06,173
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get that Councilor net a Wi-Fi booster or something.

593
00:56:07,753 --> 00:56:11,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I say that because I agree with him on this one.

594
00:56:12,374 --> 00:56:16,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think, Tim, I want to first say thank you.

595
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you are moving us in the right direction.

596
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:21,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, there's kind of two issues here.

597
00:56:21,737 --> 00:56:26,398
[SPEAKER_04]: There's capital asset management, and it seems like we're getting our house in order around that.

598
00:56:26,878 --> 00:56:28,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's this question of quality of life.

599
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:33,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems, you know, you said you're amenable to some sort of mitigation because I think

600
00:56:33,836 --> 00:56:35,037
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we want to get everything done.

601
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:46,987
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get everything in order, but I think the points about machines being stored on the street and roads being, you know, or parking being restricted for weeks at a time, it is a balancing act, as the other Councilors have said.

602
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:57,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, it sounds like at this point in the conversation, we, um, should work on a mitigation type approach and put that into ordinance.

603
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, what,

604
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:07,434
[SPEAKER_04]: either what clarity, I guess two questions, what, what have you been doing on the quality of life side of this problem?

605
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:12,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, and what clarity would be helpful from us on that?

606
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:22,584
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality of life as in storage of equipment and yeah, just general use of the road use of parking, you know, I mean,

607
00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:24,895
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's, yeah.

608
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:35,638
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to review what the plan is, and we try to comment on the plan and we try to make sure that what they're doing makes sense.

609
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:40,239
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, you know, I think it's obviously do need to store something somewhere.

610
00:57:40,279 --> 00:57:47,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, if the project is large enough, we'll have them do an offsite yard and not store on the street.

611
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,451
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a case-by-case approach, usually.

612
00:57:50,471 --> 00:58:00,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And the DPW commissioner, myself, and my staff will review it, comment, make a judgment call.

613
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:05,134
[SPEAKER_00]: And the commissioner usually has a final say.

614
00:58:06,314 --> 00:58:16,577
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they need to store equipment, for example, longer than a day or so, then they need to have a street occupancy permit, which is

615
00:58:17,772 --> 00:58:19,253
[SPEAKER_00]: another type of permit that we give up.

616
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:22,855
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will have conditions associated with it.

617
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:33,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, and this goes to the accountability sort of oversight piece, sometimes they are not permitted and they're not paying attention to requirements.

618
00:58:34,903 --> 00:58:44,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get a call and the call will be, you know, they're storing a machine or equipment on the side of the road and no one issued a permit for that.

619
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,390
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens quite a lot.

620
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:52,973
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we take action and we have them either move it or issue a warning, something like that.

621
00:58:53,773 --> 00:59:00,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So my office also does the enforcement on street occupancy and street opening and trench permits.

622
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:15,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it goes back to how many eyes and ears we have in the field and how that compares to the work that's happening in the city and striking that balance.

623
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:30,462
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the occupancy permits usually have, you know, if someone wants to keep a machine in a series of parking spaces for example, then there's usually a traffic management plan associated with that.

624
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:35,953
[SPEAKER_00]: If they need to occupy the sidewalk, there's a pedestrian management plan that they need to submit along with that.

625
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:40,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of contractors do it the right way and get their permits.

626
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:46,158
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are obviously contractors who don't do it the right way and don't get the proper permits.

627
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:54,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if the police may not know, the police have a lot of eyes and ears in the field, they may not know whether or not

628
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:57,714
[SPEAKER_00]: A contractor is doing the right thing or the wrong thing.

629
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:06,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the only people that would know are people in my office or people in the DPW office or the field crews.

630
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't be everywhere all at once.

631
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:18,566
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that addresses your question, but that's how we deal with equipment storage and stockpile storage in the streets.

632
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:19,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

633
01:00:19,547 --> 01:00:20,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of just gives me two more questions.

634
01:00:20,968 --> 01:00:22,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to belabor the point that much.

635
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:31,204
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's not, there's not a general guideline of like we would like to limit, you know, the disruption to a certain period of time like a week or two weeks.

636
01:00:31,224 --> 01:00:38,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you following some sort of guideline or is it really just all based on the project, case by case, it's usually case by case we don't want to.

637
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:44,434
[SPEAKER_00]: If parking is highly utilized parking we don't want them to take it for more than a couple days if they need to.

638
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:44,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

639
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:53,940
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a situation recently on Winthrop Street where Eversource needed to use parking for weeks.

640
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,583
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's talked about and discussed, and we had multiple meetings on it.

641
01:00:59,663 --> 01:01:01,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the plan?

642
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,826
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you accommodating pedestrians?

643
01:01:04,866 --> 01:01:06,287
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you accommodating crossings?

644
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:06,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.

645
01:01:07,448 --> 01:01:10,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's usually discussed ad nauseum, and then

646
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:16,796
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of set the bar and then they almost always every contractor is sort of someone under the bar a little bit.

647
01:01:17,296 --> 01:01:22,180
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to set expectations as high as possible and then stay on them as best we can.

648
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:25,062
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically how we operate.

649
01:01:25,763 --> 01:01:26,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

650
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:27,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one other question.

651
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:32,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you able to give any information to officers, police officers who might be on a detail

652
01:01:33,562 --> 01:01:39,705
[SPEAKER_04]: do you share information on this project, kind of trying to provide some of that information so they know what's right and what's wrong?

653
01:01:40,265 --> 01:01:40,846
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.

654
01:01:40,986 --> 01:01:49,270
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we've been doing more recently is trying to, I don't know if coagulate is the right word, but

655
01:01:49,550 --> 01:02:04,259
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting the traffic sergeants in the same room with the engineers, Todd Blake, who most of you know, I think, all of you probably know, they're basically meeting more often, especially in the last year.

656
01:02:04,279 --> 01:02:05,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been encouraging it.

657
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:10,823
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really good thing to have police details and traffic sergeants meeting with

658
01:02:11,443 --> 01:02:23,507
[SPEAKER_00]: the folks in my office who are reviewing traffic management plans and pedestrian detours, vehicle detours, and things like that, for that very reason, Councilor Bears, because sometimes there's a disconnect.

659
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:29,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And to try to put those wires back together and keep that connection, I think is really important.

660
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:39,973
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had the detours going on in South Medford, still going on in South Medford, sometimes the detail officers wouldn't even know what plan

661
01:02:40,893 --> 01:02:42,774
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were operating under.

662
01:02:43,575 --> 01:02:48,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason is because it was constantly changing and the detail officer wouldn't necessarily be completely up to speed.

663
01:02:49,799 --> 01:03:05,731
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that, you know, as a result of that is we wanted to make sure that the folks in my office who are reviewing and approving traffic management plans are also touching base with and communicating with on a regular basis with our traffic sergeants.

664
01:03:06,151 --> 01:03:07,973
[SPEAKER_00]: who oversee the details out there.

665
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:10,134
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a constant battle.

666
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:19,001
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always different officers and, you know, just like any other human being, some are better than others.

667
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:21,623
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of staying in tune with what's going on.

668
01:03:22,404 --> 01:03:27,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, again, it's one of those constant things that we're picking at and trying to make sure that those connections

669
01:03:27,968 --> 01:03:28,549
[SPEAKER_00]: stay made.

670
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:38,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that with Chief Buckley, we're making a lot of progress in that area.

671
01:03:38,578 --> 01:03:41,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know he wants to, he's on board just like I am.

672
01:03:41,341 --> 01:03:46,766
[SPEAKER_00]: He has the same sort of opinion in this matter as me, which is good.

673
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,788
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we still have work to do there as well.

674
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:50,649
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

675
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Tim.

676
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:52,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and I would just add that I

677
01:03:52,839 --> 01:04:06,429
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely support Councilor Mark's both on the conversation about the budget and make sure we have the resources for enforcement and also talking about neighborhood mitigation, quality of life, other ordinance work in the public works subcommittee.

678
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:08,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.

679
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:11,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

680
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:16,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a note for the Vice President Caraviello.

681
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:29,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to be laying the point, Mr. President, but I'd like to make another paper of this that the administration review the street opening fees before the budget season comes up.

682
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:37,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And if necessary, we raise the fees so that Tim can go out and hire one or two more guys to work with him.

683
01:04:38,645 --> 01:04:39,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And also,

684
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:52,938
[SPEAKER_01]: President Falco and myself offered the city a pilot program with a company that would pave the street for a third to a half of the cost of what normally we're paying now.

685
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:56,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't seen anything come about of that.

686
01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:04,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can get together with two or three of the utility companies, and maybe they could pay for this pilot program to see if it works or not.

687
01:05:07,457 --> 01:05:09,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you Councilor, Vice President Caraviello.

688
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a number of papers in front of us.

689
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:21,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the C paper offered by Vice President Caraviello that the city administration review the street opening fees.

690
01:05:24,346 --> 01:05:24,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerk, how do we?

691
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:33,351
[SPEAKER_09]: There was actually a C paper that the city, that the council draft a city ordinance on this, but I need a little help with the wording on that.

692
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:34,872
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the C paper.

693
01:05:34,892 --> 01:05:36,373
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this may actually be a D paper.

694
01:05:36,972 --> 01:05:45,116
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think on the original C paper about the city ordinance, is that something that, it sounds like that maybe would be something that's discussed further in subcommittee, am I correct?

695
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:46,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

696
01:05:46,796 --> 01:05:50,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that's what was mentioned, that that goes to subcommittee like council Marks mentioned.

697
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:58,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so then that there- Is that a deep, so is vice president Caraviello's latest amendment, is that an amendment to the main paper or is that a deep paper?

698
01:06:00,617 --> 01:06:10,805
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm correct, one second, if I'm correct, the original C paper offered by Vice President Caraviello, is that being withdrawn because that's gonna be discussed in- Yes, I will withdraw that.

699
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:12,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so that's withdrawn.

700
01:06:12,286 --> 01:06:21,594
[SPEAKER_10]: So the new C paper would be that the city administration review the street opening fees that are currently in place?

701
01:06:22,274 --> 01:06:29,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in an effort to possibly hire another inspector to help Tim and his office out.

702
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:33,838
[SPEAKER_10]: So in an effort to hire an additional inspector.

703
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:41,300
[SPEAKER_10]: So on that seat, or two, on that seat paper offered by vice president Caraviello, seconded by?

704
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, Mr. President.

705
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

706
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:46,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Hurtubise, would you please call the roll?

707
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:48,522
[SPEAKER_09]: On the seat paper.

708
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:50,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

709
01:06:50,642 --> 01:06:50,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

710
01:06:51,843 --> 01:06:52,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice president Caraviello.

711
01:06:53,123 --> 01:06:53,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

712
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:54,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

713
01:06:59,605 --> 01:07:00,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

714
01:07:00,823 --> 01:07:02,084
[SPEAKER_10]: become a lady in a while.

715
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:03,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he dropped off.

716
01:07:04,225 --> 01:07:07,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited him to my house to do this.

717
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:09,609
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been trying to text him.

718
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:11,310
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Councilor Marks?

719
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:12,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

720
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:14,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Councilor Morell?

721
01:07:14,852 --> 01:07:15,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

722
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

723
01:07:16,893 --> 01:07:17,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

724
01:07:17,854 --> 01:07:18,675
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco?

725
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:19,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

726
01:07:20,716 --> 01:07:23,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And I still don't see I still don't see Councilor Knight.

727
01:07:26,996 --> 01:07:31,937
[SPEAKER_09]: We can come back to him and have him vote on that, or I can mark him as absent because of technology errors.

728
01:07:32,978 --> 01:07:34,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you do that?

729
01:07:35,158 --> 01:07:36,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Absent due to technology.

730
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:38,739
[SPEAKER_10]: He was here for most of the conversation.

731
01:07:39,339 --> 01:07:43,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent?

732
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,380
[SPEAKER_10]: That motion passes.

733
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:50,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So the B paper, which was originally offered by Council on 9th,

734
01:07:53,095 --> 01:07:54,676
[SPEAKER_10]: unexpectedly dropped from the call.

735
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:57,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

736
01:07:58,837 --> 01:08:04,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight is no longer present, so I think, would someone else have to make that motion, Clerk Hurtubise?

737
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make that motion, Mr. President.

738
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:15,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so on the motion of Vice President Caraviello in place of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

739
01:08:16,865 --> 01:08:19,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you read back the language on the beat paper, Clerk Hurtubise?

740
01:08:19,886 --> 01:08:21,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to open it up in my email.

741
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:22,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me a quick second.

742
01:08:23,581 --> 01:08:24,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Or actually not, I think I might have an idea.

743
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:51,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it, Mr. President.

744
01:08:51,463 --> 01:08:51,924
[SPEAKER_10]: You have it?

745
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:53,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, review it in my council affairs.

746
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:54,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

747
01:08:55,046 --> 01:09:10,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved, the Medford City Council requests the city administration establish a policy requiring all street opening permits to be accompanied by a neighborhood mitigation agreement that will adequately and reasonably offset the negative impacts on the quality of life caused during street opening construction in city neighborhoods.

748
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:11,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

749
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:13,282
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion.

750
01:09:13,302 --> 01:09:14,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

751
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:17,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, Council Member.

752
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:33,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so now, now that, uh, consular beers, rent it back all street openings, uh, this, this would also include as the city engineer mentioned, the one-offs, uh, a resident that's trying to get, uh, you know, some utility to their home.

753
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:43,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, that would be a huge hardship, uh, financially to some of that may be trying to do some work on their home, uh, to, to do some type of mitigation.

754
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:49,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I'm not quite sure if I can support that at this present time.

755
01:09:49,790 --> 01:10:00,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, if we're talking about national grid or the larger utility companies that are here doing work all the time and not the mom and pop one-offs, then I could support it.

756
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

757
01:10:03,723 --> 01:10:06,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the original.

758
01:10:06,975 --> 01:10:11,438
[SPEAKER_10]: The original sponsor of the bee papers has dropped off the call, so I'm not sure where he is.

759
01:10:12,519 --> 01:10:13,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I could.

760
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:14,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

761
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,862
[SPEAKER_05]: We remember when Craddock Bridge was done.

762
01:10:17,002 --> 01:10:18,804
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a four-year project.

763
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:27,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I offered the resolution before the council that they pay mitigation to the business owners, to area residents, and so forth.

764
01:10:27,938 --> 01:10:35,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And the state came back to us unequivocally and stated they do not pay any mitigation on their projects.

765
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:38,902
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a four-year hardship for the businesses in the square.

766
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:56,849
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we have to be mindful too that, you know, there may be projects in the community that won't pay any mitigation at all, but Mrs. Smith on Warren Street that's trying to do a utility to her house to improve something may be paying mitigation to get something done.

767
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:02,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we have to be very mindful if we do support this here tonight, Mr. President.

768
01:11:02,315 --> 01:11:06,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to table this, Mr. President, so the sponsor is available.

769
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:11,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what, Vice President Caraviello, it's currently in your hands.

770
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:14,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you want to move that to subcommittee as well, or if you want to table it.

771
01:11:14,848 --> 01:11:16,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move it to subcommittee.

772
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:17,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's move it to subcommittee.

773
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:19,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang on.

774
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the chair?

775
01:11:22,974 --> 01:11:24,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Knight isn't here.

776
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:32,521
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to, I don't have a problem table until next week, or if you want to move it to subcommittee, whatever the council wants to do.

777
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:37,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a general consensus from the council as to where we want this to go?

778
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:39,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move it to subcommittee.

779
01:11:39,746 --> 01:11:40,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

780
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:40,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

781
01:11:40,927 --> 01:11:46,011
[SPEAKER_10]: On the B paper offered by Vice President Caraviello, seconded by... Second.

782
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:50,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, that that go to subcommittee.

783
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:52,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Hervey, please call the roll.

784
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:54,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you sending it to the subcommittee on public works?

785
01:11:55,064 --> 01:12:03,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, public works, which is chaired by Councilor Bears, and the subcommittee members are Councilor Marks and Vice President Caraviello.

786
01:12:04,232 --> 01:12:06,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's send it somewhere else then, one second.

787
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:10,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Transportation again?

788
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:12,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Transportation.

789
01:12:12,419 --> 01:12:13,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on that.

790
01:12:15,849 --> 01:12:16,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Here comes the roll call.

791
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:17,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

792
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:18,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

793
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:20,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello?

794
01:12:20,812 --> 01:12:21,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

795
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:25,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, who I don't think is on the call, but I'm calling his name anyway.

796
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:27,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

797
01:12:27,775 --> 01:12:28,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

798
01:12:28,615 --> 01:12:29,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell?

799
01:12:29,816 --> 01:12:30,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

800
01:12:30,897 --> 01:12:31,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

801
01:12:31,957 --> 01:12:32,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

802
01:12:32,717 --> 01:12:33,418
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco?

803
01:12:33,872 --> 01:12:40,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes, and that paper will go to subcommittee.

804
01:12:40,976 --> 01:12:54,422
[SPEAKER_10]: On the original resolution offered by Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Marks, and Councilor Marks had a motion to move that to the Subcommittee on Public Works, and that was seconded by Councilor Bears.

805
01:12:56,483 --> 01:12:59,725
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, would you please call the roll?

806
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:03,535
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to the Public Works Subcommittee as well.

807
01:13:03,575 --> 01:13:06,016
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Bears on the main paper?

808
01:13:06,636 --> 01:13:07,076
[SPEAKER_10]: You are correct.

809
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:07,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

810
01:13:12,298 --> 01:13:12,818
