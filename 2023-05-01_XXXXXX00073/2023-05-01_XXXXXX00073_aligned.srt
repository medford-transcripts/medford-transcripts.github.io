00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:44,946
All right, Charlie and I are here today.

10
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:48,827
If you don't mind just introducing yourself, just your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,908
Hey, thanks for having me.

12
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:51,928
My name's Brian McAusland.

13
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,730
I'm the owner of Eventham and Ticket Union here in Medford, Mass.

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,050
Great.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:04,293
So Brian, every podcast we start off with the same question, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

16
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:13,361
Well, we are still, I'm still exploring the neighborhood here, and so we're kind of stopping by, we've stopped by the more, our neighbors first.

17
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,702
So there's Eddie's up the street, there's Nappy's, there's Alfredo's.

18
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:19,244
So we've kind of stopped by those places.

19
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:25,146
I'd probably say right now, I love them all, but Nappy's is a quick walk right up the street here.

20
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,270
really friendly environment.

21
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:32,452
The owners are really lovely, and so we're supporting them right now.

22
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:35,333
I'll give them my top, my number one of the week.

23
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:39,254
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Nappy's is famous for not having a menu?

24
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:41,094
Is that, you just sort of ask for what you want?

25
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,255
Kind of, yeah.

26
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,136
So I learned about Nappy, I think it's Nappy, right?

27
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:47,256
Yeah.

28
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:52,338
And I was trying to order from them one day, and I couldn't find a menu.

29
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,418
And I was like, what's going on?

30
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,779
So I walked up there, and they're like, what do you want?

31
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,259
What do you need?

32
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:57,884
Chicken parm?

33
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:58,665
Does that work?

34
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,667
She's like, that sounds great.

35
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:00,287
Okay.

36
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,689
So yeah, I don't think they do.

37
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:08,899
And I think, um, I think, uh, they have a really great local, fun, family oriented.

38
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:10,363
five over there.

39
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,523
So that's kind of our thing.

40
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:12,844
So definitely dig it.

41
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:14,806
That might be the first not being mentioned.

42
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:16,207
I think it is.

43
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:16,747
Is it really?

44
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,529
It's definitely a new way of making the menu work.

45
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:21,971
Great.

46
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:22,412
Well, thank you.

47
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:25,174
So we're here in your space on Salem Street.

48
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:27,556
So I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your business.

49
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:28,953
Absolutely.

50
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:32,355
So Event Them is the company.

51
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:41,639
I started that early 2000s when out of college I realized that it was really hard to get shows and play.

52
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:42,559
I was in different bands.

53
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:45,961
I went to school for music and business and photography actually too.

54
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,062
So I was really tied in with like music and art.

55
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,721
And it was really hard to get in anywhere.

56
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:58,342
It was really hard to book a band or pick your artist because it would always be, how many people can you bring?

57
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:03,744
Or it was very much about how can the venue benefit the most.

58
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:07,225
And I understood that, but it was really hard

59
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:11,346
to be able to give them exact numbers.

60
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,927
You know, you never know who's going to show up.

61
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,168
So I started kind of booking venues myself.

62
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:19,530
So I basically was like, will you tell me how much it'll cost for the room?

63
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,172
So I kind of accepted responsibility for it, didn't have to answer those questions and just started

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,642
creating my own shows and booking some bands, some artists, and kind of creating these events.

65
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,864
So it was an event that was created.

66
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:43,129
And yeah, it was just about giving people an opportunity to have a place to participate in or go to an event.

67
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,712
And yeah, we've been in Somerville for a bunch of years now.

68
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:53,495
And we decided to keep our location, our presence in Somerville.

69
00:03:54,235 --> 00:04:08,070
but opening up the Eventham Studios here in Medford, which kind of not only gives us an opportunity to continue what we're doing in creating events and opportunity at local businesses, but we actually can do it here now too.

70
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:15,811
So this is an events, I think when we first met you told me about the ticketing, the ticket concierge services.

71
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:16,291
Yeah.

72
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:20,474
Which I had never heard of, but I might be, I might be like not too hip.

73
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:22,076
So could you describe what that is?

74
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,136
You're very hip.

75
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:23,737
I think you're hip.

76
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:24,097
Thanks.

77
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:37,067
Um, so yeah, so I'd say it was around like 2007, uh, I was doing events and, um, a gentleman who owned a local ticketing company,

78
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,908
knew that I was doing events and was like, hey, I need help.

79
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:41,590
I own a ticketing business.

80
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,033
And basically, you know, we buy and sell tickets to local events.

81
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:50,718
And so, you know, I was still getting off my feet wet and still kind of getting going.

82
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,159
So I was like, all right, extra work is great.

83
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,501
And so I started getting into ticketing.

84
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,605
And it was, it was really, it was exciting.

85
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:01,268
It was, it was fun because I get to go to

86
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:09,157
Cool shows and have really good seats, but it was really interesting to learn about that element of event stuff, right?

87
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:14,361
and You know people spend a lot of money on tickets.

88
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:18,844
They don't understand I mean I can talk about dynamic pricing.

89
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:23,447
I can talk about all the things the Taylor Swift thing We could probably do another podcast about that.

90
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,729
I can tell you a little bit more but

91
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,373
You know, what it really comes down to is I really enjoyed giving people that experience.

92
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:41,939
You know, somebody wants to take their dad to one more Red Sox game while they're still mobile, or a mother wants to take her daughter to their first concert, you know.

93
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,143
And so that was really enjoyable because I could watch the markets, I could really dig and do that work for them.

94
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:52,105
And yeah, so was doing that for a bunch.

95
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,868
And then when the original owner retired, I kind of

96
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:04,625
Took the ticket business, I rebranded it as Ticket Union because it's more of uniting all the elements of ticketing.

97
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:11,388
Buying, selling, requesting, market analysis, really trying to keep it in the community.

98
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:22,975
In theory, you could have two neighbors and one person is selling tickets online to a company that's based in California.

99
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:28,627
and then their neighbor could be buying those exact same tickets online for a company in California.

100
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:39,878
So what's happening is that the person selling it is making less because they have to pay online seller fees, and the person buying it has to pay more because they have to pay for online selling fees.

101
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:55,069
Essentially, what you're doing is people are making less on what they have, people are paying more for what they want to get, and then the taxable income is double time going to a different state, so you're leaving your community.

102
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,294
My goal is to try to keep that in a hub.

103
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:02,035
Very cool.

104
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:22,061
I think while you're talking and thinking about outside looking in at the very least what it might require for artists to sort of practice and commit to their craft but also commit to sort of the marketing and kind of lifting their own profile and

105
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:33,704
putting my mind to how much work that takes and maybe if that's a new perspective for folks or if there are maybe older artists who aren't kind of leveraging maybe social spaces like younger folks are.

106
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:47,227
Just while you're talking, I'm thinking about how places and spaces like yours might be so valuable in kind of connecting folks and creating pipelines.

107
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,067
Yeah.

108
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,748
I mean, it's kind of tough, right?

109
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,512
You're a musician or artist, like your passion is in your art, right?

110
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:58,293
I would assume.

111
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:03,457
I mean, it's kind of like, I don't know, it's a comparison.

112
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:06,459
If you liked riding your bike, you would ride your bike all day.

113
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:11,783
You wouldn't jump on a skateboard and then ride on your bike and then walk and then, you know, take a parachute.

114
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:12,624
You know what I mean?

115
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:19,509
It's just like you're on that trajectory and you have you and you have your art, your harnessing, right?

116
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,072
So when you add these other elements that are important, people need to know about you.

117
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:32,095
And it's really hard to connect, especially with original music more than anything.

118
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:41,039
People, for the most part, they just want to dance or have familiarity when they hear stuff.

119
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,480
Many people do.

120
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:47,682
Their ability to escape through music or listeners

121
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,945
the fact that they connect so easily.

122
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:57,048
And so when you have original music, it's a hard selling point.

123
00:08:57,128 --> 00:09:04,974
So yeah, so when you have social media and advertising and promoting, it's really hard.

124
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:15,542
And so yeah, what we do here is that we try to promote shows that we have, but we promote other people's shows, and we try to create connections and bonds.

125
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,373
It's really hard to do anything on your own these days, right?

126
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:25,960
And so we try to create the ability so people don't have to do that.

127
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:32,155
you know, we do, we have a Common Roots is something we started for local business owners.

128
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,276
And it's like a local business connection group.

129
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:44,179
And it's no stress, you can miss meetings, you can, you don't have to do the referral things and all this stuff.

130
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,740
It's encouraged, but it's really about just

131
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:57,268
meeting people and then knowing that, you know, you've got somebody in your corner if you need an electrician or if you need somebody that does computers and stuff.

132
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:06,516
And the same thing applies to artists and musicians as we're trying to make those connections here and at shows and events that we're doing.

133
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:07,657
That's great.

134
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:18,078
Yeah and so you said you have you've been working in Somerville for a while right and you're newer to Medford you guys are hoping hoping to like like really open this space soon.

135
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:26,088
What are your hopes for like for what you're like kind of hoping to bring to Medford or hope to see in in Medford as you kind of begin your work here?

136
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:33,632
Well, you know, just like a lot of cities and towns in, you know, the greater Boston area, it's changing.

137
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:34,672
It's changing rapidly.

138
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:43,617
You know, it's in good ways and in ways that maybe aren't good or just different rather.

139
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:48,319
For here in Medford, we just always felt

140
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,220
that there's a need out here.

141
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,002
Somerville's great.

142
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:52,563
It's our home.

143
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:56,027
We do a lot out there, and that's where our base is still.

144
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,230
But there's a lot of competition.

145
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,152
There's a lot going on out there.

146
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:01,833
You have an event.

147
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:02,454
You have a show.

148
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:07,980
And, you know, I remember when I'd be promoting a show or telling people, this is a really good show.

149
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,566
You should check this out if you want, like, you know, and there would be, I'll try to make it.

150
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:15,189
I already said I was going to two other things.

151
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,573
And, you know, where do you, where do you go with that?

152
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:19,834
Do you, you know, you want.

153
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:25,518
I don't know these other shows per se, but I want people to be able to go to these other shows.

154
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:32,223
I want them to support it if I want them to come to the ones I'm doing, but at the same time, I'm not going to be like, skip theirs and come to this one instead.

155
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:32,783
It'll be better.

156
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:35,145
That's not the right thing.

157
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:41,409
But, you know, we felt that here in Medford doesn't have that as much, right?

158
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,032
And so it felt like it was a community that we could really support.

159
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:57,542
And that's kind of what we were hoping to do without having too much, not necessarily competition, but conflicts.

160
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:01,789
But still be able to promote and encourage other things that are going on.

161
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:04,759
But this just being another opportunity.

162
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,323
Hosting shows, helping to plan shows and other events.

163
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,466
You shared with me, I think before recording, some of the other stuff that you guys do.

164
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:18,830
Birthday parties, other events that you support, ticketing for events, anything else?

165
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,971
Yeah, absolutely.

166
00:12:22,953 --> 00:12:28,458
For the event stuff, typically up to about this point, everything's been

167
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,287
out of, not in-house, right?

168
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:38,209
So we do an event at a park or we do it in public, so we do a lot.

169
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,470
We help Union Square Main Streets with Fluff Festival in Somerville.

170
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,711
Very big event, like 15,000 people in like six hours.

171
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:49,972
So we do the booking and the staging and stuff like that.

172
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,793
We do the Chandler Street Block Party for Pride in Boston.

173
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:59,794
We assisted on some other events for Pride in June as well.

174
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:16,848
But a lot of those are typically, you know, not are not in-house so When we're talking about like doing other events and stuff like that, like now we can do stuff here so we can do ticketing form So let's say you wanted to throw it on an event.

175
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:24,014
We can do ticketing like a bent bright at a local level Our strong suit when it comes to ticketing is more

176
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:27,337
Already existing events like hey, I want to go to this.

177
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:28,058
It's sold out.

178
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,059
How can I get to them?

179
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:45,613
But you know, we can facilitate Those other elements to ticketing but then like here You know we can we want to have this podcast room so, you know, we can people can talk about events or they can talk about whatever they can It's their craft.

180
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:46,574
It's their interest right?

181
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:47,895
You don't have to paint a picture.

182
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:51,559
You don't have to play an instrument you can I still think that

183
00:13:52,437 --> 00:14:03,667
honest and open discussions and also other elements to recording that we want to put the recording studio downstairs.

184
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:07,030
So I hope to have that done by our opening in May.

185
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:15,597
So we'll be able to basically host other events on a grander scheme, you know, like, you know, this is an event, right?

186
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:17,119
It's kind of like,

187
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:32,175
Event them is really, I guess the best way I can put it is that what is a common, the most common word that's used for search, search for something online.

188
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:52,722
Google right so Google is a name of a company it doesn't mean search for something online it means the company but people have gotten just so accustomed to Google it Google that right it's the same thing as event them so we want to kind of almost like

189
00:14:53,322 --> 00:15:01,448
You know, life is full of events, good and bad, it really is, but we're trying to give that impression where event is a verb.

190
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:06,151
So, you want to take your daughter to their first concert, event them, go get tickets.

191
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:13,516
Do you want to have a birthday party or show some art in our gallery here, a small thing, right, we can do that.

192
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,477
We'll event them.

193
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:20,340
If you want to do a podcast, a recording, this is an event.

194
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:30,524
Events are always considered like concerts and stuff, but events are moments of your life that you want to hold with you, that you want to take with you where you go.

195
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:36,547
And so that's kind of what we're trying to show and give people that experience.

196
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,107
It's incredible.

197
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:43,650
To a certain extent, it feels like you're pushing for a level of culture shift or consciousness shift around how

198
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:52,200
You can think about different moments or literally different events or parties and re-figure out what can be.

199
00:15:53,939 --> 00:16:01,282
Maybe I mean that's that's that's so that's a very positive Awesome way to put it.

200
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,722
Um, you know, I don't know.

201
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:17,168
I I the intent was never to create a culture shifter or anything like that, but I think oh my goodness, it's more about awareness and Just people recognizing, you know, I guess I

202
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,604
Event is a very big word, right?

203
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:23,225
It can be.

204
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:26,728
It can be, oh, you're going to put on an event, and everybody's like, oh.

205
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:36,177
Even the smallest things, like somebody's putting, like my daughter is 10 months old this week, and so she's a little firecracker.

206
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:36,717
She's awesome.

207
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:42,323
We're gonna do like a first birthday party and for a lot of people that's like pull your hair out.

208
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:50,011
Oh my god There's gonna be little kids running around like it's a whole thing and it can really stress people out but like there's different

209
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,523
there's a spectrum of that, right?

210
00:16:53,583 --> 00:17:03,554
Like, yeah, it can be, but it also can be a very, we can have like a small party or literally an event can just be a moment.

211
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,317
Like it doesn't have to be a big thing.

212
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:08,260
And so I think

213
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:30,217
Instead of being afraid about if somebody was putting on a one-year-old birthday party, instead of being afraid because it's a lot to do and the cake and the kids and all this stuff, just realizing that there is a wide range of what an event could be and it could literally just being

214
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,514
having two friends over, and just having a moment.

215
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:35,515
And that is an event.

216
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:42,805
Or it can be, hey, we're going to throw on a bash with 20,000 people to celebrate my daughter's one-year-old birthday.

217
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,847
Which, I don't know.

218
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:45,608
I don't think we'd get 20.

219
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:45,809
Maybe 10.

220
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,261
My experience is those one-year-old birthdays are more for the parents.

221
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:05,905
I also feel like in my experience of Medford, I haven't been here as long as Shelly has, but people really like

222
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:22,259
to be sort of like I have like critical lovers of the city so like if they find something that's gonna like make them feel connected to the city and like is local and is something that's like a space like yours people get really into it right.

223
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:32,169
I think that they like to do things that support the kind of community-centered vibe of the city and so I feel like when places like this kind of come up people get really excited and they get

224
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:37,538
It feels like the kind of vibe of your business fits well with I think what I've experienced sort of the

225
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,432
We're a city, but also kind of like a small town feel sometimes.

226
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:41,832
Yeah.

227
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,373
No, absolutely.

228
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:48,237
I think we also have neighborhoods in Medford that very much have their own cultures.

229
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:57,863
And so this might be a space that has a capacity to unify in ways that we may not have other pieces that are doing that right now.

230
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:01,286
And we have some strong cultures in neighboring towns.

231
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,469
So I think Medford's often concerned with who we can be.

232
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:07,110
So this might be a platform.

233
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:31,597
well, I think it can be a platform, but it's also I just You know we tell people we can fill in the gaps like just you know reach out to us and in other words somebody is like We just need a cornhole or a game for a day or something like that We have like like 20 something of them in the shadow back, you know but it's kind of like

234
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,185
We don't have to put on an event for them.

235
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:42,516
We've been working on this one element, and it's not ready yet, but it's called Eventlopedia.

236
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,123
And what it is, it's a combination, it's just content.

237
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:57,672
And the original idea is that, you know, people reach out to us and it's kind of like we can, I'm more than happy to talk to people all day long about how to help them.

238
00:19:57,712 --> 00:20:04,097
But sometimes they just want to like be sitting on their couch, look on their phone and just have a place that they can find out information.

239
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:13,401
We started writing, you know, articles and reviews and top 10 places to get an ice cream on a Friday night in the area.

240
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:20,523
We have like, you know, top five things to not forget for a Super Bowl party, right?

241
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,724
Now you think, well, I think it was a top 10, right?

242
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,025
But you think like the things that

243
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:32,134
for a Super Bowl party that you would want is obviously, oh, like food and TVs, right?

244
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:34,757
Some sports memorabilia stuff, right?

245
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:40,682
But you don't think about, you need a whole bunch of napkins, right?

246
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:44,184
You need a whole bunch of toilet paper, right?

247
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:46,386
You have a Super Bowl party, you forget about toilet paper?

248
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:53,852
I mean, the thing is all about like, you know, there's eating and sitting around like let's just, you know, so there's things like those type of things.

249
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:59,456
So Eventlopedia, we'll have it probably by the end of the year done and out on the site.

250
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:01,198
But if people

251
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:05,409
want to do something, they can just go to the Eventfulpedia.

252
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:10,771
If there's an article or some information or some references and resources for them, then that's great.

253
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:13,613
We can provide that, and they don't have to call us.

254
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:16,775
They can just kind of do it themselves.

255
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:20,336
You can do stuff yourself.

256
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:21,537
You just need to know how to do it.

257
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:30,422
Are you guys having an event of your own to sort of introduce yourself to the community?

258
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:32,459
We are, yes.

259
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,921
So the May 6th, it's a Saturday.

260
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:44,247
So yeah, the awning will be all up and the inside will be finally done, I hope.

261
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:45,848
Knock on foam.

262
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:48,070
Get some foam table.

263
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,694
Yeah, it should be done, at least for the most part.

264
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,816
We'll have some singer-songwriter kind of music stuff.

265
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:00,458
Likely some games in the lot out back here.

266
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:01,978
And yeah, it just be kind of an open house.

267
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:12,760
We'll do giveaways for some upcoming events probably do Definitely Red Sox Bruins and maybe a country or I say country but like a like a concert rather.

268
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:19,762
Yeah, so we'll do some ticket giveaways We're open if anybody has local vendors that they want to have here.

269
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:25,143
We have some space for that our first local artists will be featured at that as well and

270
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:32,827
And so yeah, just kind of come down all day, kind of see what we're doing here, and yeah, I don't know, play some games, eat some food, hang out.

271
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,687
So put it on the calendar.

272
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:34,968
Yeah.

273
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:35,328
Be here.

274
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:40,910
The sports tickets, we were driving, my son goes to school right around here.

275
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:46,393
We were driving and he was like, he must have been noticing like a lot of people wearing Bruins jerseys or like their flags.

276
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:49,375
Why does everybody like sports around here?

277
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:49,855
Yeah.

278
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,918
Well, this is the place.

279
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,303
This is Boston.

280
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:56,027
It really is.

281
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,292
But now he wants jerseys of all kinds.

282
00:22:58,612 --> 00:22:59,494
Oh, does he really?

283
00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, yeah sports is a thing around here.

284
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:18,732
Yeah, it really is people go crazy Mm-hmm, and they spent a lot of money on it, too It's a big there's a reason There's some you know, some big stadiums and arenas and build-outs around here, you know, people are supporting it and that's great.

285
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:22,015
Yeah It's their getaway.

286
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,957
It's a they're interested in yeah, it's an event, right and

287
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:30,527
We're excited about the potential of a new soccer stadium coming to Everett, I heard, and a women's soccer team.

288
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:31,508
That would be awesome.

289
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:32,949
That's our trip for this weekend.

290
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:37,234
We're going to New York to watch women's soccer because that's the closest team to Boston at this point.

291
00:23:37,254 --> 00:23:38,155
No kidding.

292
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:43,581
I've heard that they've been trying to get it in the Boston area for a long time just because

293
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:52,971
At least for the local professional team, it's located too far outside of the city.

294
00:23:53,591 --> 00:24:00,913
And I think that a majority of its fan base, its followers, its interests are going to be more in the city.

295
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,275
And so I think if they would be able to provide

296
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:14,947
you know, a stadium for soccer slash football here, I think it would be great for the community.

297
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:15,507
I really do.

298
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:20,750
And it's also just another place that, you know, you can't, I'm sure you can't have professional sports games there all the time.

299
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,993
It would be probably stuff you could, you know, your kids could play their championship game there or something.

300
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,334
Maybe that's something that they do.

301
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:28,215
And so I think that that's

302
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:40,903
those are the moments you hold on to right like ten-year-old is in there's last you know championship game or something of their do you call it Little League?

303
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:45,646
I don't even know what you would call it.

304
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:46,306
I'm not sure.

305
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,468
Football team just played there.

306
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:48,848
Fenway.

307
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:49,388
Was it Fenway?

308
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,169
Yeah they played it for the Thanksgiving game.

309
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,251
I don't know my son's like guys chess is a sport.

310
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:54,792
Oh really?

311
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,928
Yeah, we did use to have a professional women's soccer team in the Boston Breakers.

312
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:06,356
I thought they played at the Harvard Stadium, but new league, no team in the, well, new, it's been eight years.

313
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:08,520
So hopefully, I have a lot of hope.

314
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,104
I'll definitely buy season tickets to that team.

315
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,546
It's the breakers or the soccer team?

316
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:17,048
They were, yeah.

317
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:18,389
MLS is the revolution.

318
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:20,070
They play in Foxborough.

319
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,210
You're right, it's too far to drive.

320
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,291
It is too far.

321
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:22,951
There's a train.

322
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:23,011
No.

323
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,653
But still, it takes a while.

324
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:27,654
People are busy.

325
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:29,515
It's a long time.

326
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:32,757
Logistics of events certainly are a thing, yeah.

327
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,358
What's the lacrosse teams?

328
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:35,778
Lacrosse is like... The Canons.

329
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:37,639
The Canons, that's what I was thinking of.

330
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:38,580
Right, it's men's lacrosse.

331
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:44,462
I played women's lacrosse in college and high school, so I have a lot of opinions about it.

332
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:46,583
We can cut this out.

333
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,984
I think it's the Boston Canons.

334
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:52,165
There isn't a women's one?

335
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:53,205
Are you surprised?

336
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:54,185
What is it?

337
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:55,306
No, there's not.

338
00:25:55,866 --> 00:26:02,909
I think lacrosse is such a small-time sport to begin with, and then there's never a women's counterpart to anything.

339
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,170
For there to be a women's lacrosse team.

340
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,851
We do have a national team.

341
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:09,854
I need some flashcards for this sports lingo.

342
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:12,197
I know who crosses that weird net on the sticks.

343
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,118
Yes, yes.

344
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:13,839
I need to catch up.

345
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,743
Yeah.

346
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:17,163
Great.

347
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:19,647
Well, is there anything else you want to mention before we wrap up for today?

348
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:21,493
I don't know.

349
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,174
What do you guys got going on this weekend?

350
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,115
What's happening?

351
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:25,196
Talk to me.

352
00:26:25,236 --> 00:26:26,638
Going to New York for shopping.

353
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:27,138
Going to New York.

354
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,984
I am actually headed to the Black Policy Conference at the Harvard Kennedy School.

355
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:32,444
Okay.

356
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:36,228
So like, you know, fancy breakfast and some good policy talk.

357
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:38,110
I'm down.

358
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,610
Yeah.

359
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:38,871
Right?

360
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:39,852
Like one bus ride away.

361
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:40,993
That's awesome.

362
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:42,694
I wonder if Jen's going to that.

363
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:45,936
My partner, Jen, she's very active.

364
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:55,062
She's an executive director of a foundation, too, in Boston, so she's always got something that she wants to support and go to.

365
00:26:55,122 --> 00:27:01,666
Well, there are very few Chellies, so I just kind of... In all ways, very few Chellies, yeah.

366
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:08,708
Yeah, no, I do think that's something about Medford that we don't talk enough about is the amount of education.

367
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:09,609
Tufts is right here.

368
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:14,410
I think our schools don't utilize that enough, but the community for sure, right?

369
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,470
Oh, absolutely.

370
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,631
And Tufts is like, they've got a green line stop now, right?

371
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:19,112
Yeah.

372
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:20,692
It's no joke.

373
00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:21,232
Yeah.

374
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:22,033
Tufts is great.

375
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:22,593
It's very fancy.

376
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:23,173
We're making it.

377
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:29,615
We actually did, I used to do, I used to go to a couple different shows over it.

378
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:33,668
Not J-U-L, J-U-L is U-L-L, M-F-O, right?

379
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,434
That's the Tufts station, radio station over there?

380
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:38,636
Do you guys remember that?

381
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,041
Oh, so Tufts radio, they have like a...

382
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,675
like a radio station over there.

383
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:48,518
And it's actually really, it's really good, actually.

384
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:49,799
It was actually really good.

385
00:27:50,420 --> 00:28:03,412
And so I remember I used to do some stuff over there and just kind of, I think I played on a couple of different, yeah, played on a couple of different shows and just kind of, you know, talked a little bit about just, you know, things, whatever's going on in the world.

386
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:05,294
But that was a great spot.

387
00:28:05,314 --> 00:28:05,874
But Tufts,

388
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:12,378
We've actually, we've had, we've worked with some, their internship program.

389
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:18,742
So we've supported Tufts in that way and tried to, we did, we've done Northeastern as well.

390
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:22,224
But yeah, we'll be doing that again too.

391
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:29,027
We tried to, the one that we did last year,

392
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:38,510
for Northeastern was that we took on two interns and kind of

393
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:46,440
not only like, it wasn't about like, you know, getting coffee and mailing, licking envelopes, right?

394
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,001
Although, who licks an envelope now anyways, right?

395
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,462
I don't even know if that's a thing.

396
00:28:51,742 --> 00:29:00,207
But we kind of, we curated a quote-unquote, a course, if you will, about how to put on an event, right?

397
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:01,788
And so we kind of touched the basis about

398
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:17,233
know basic just like research and contacting and reaching out to artists and bands and then preparing um you know outreach to venues but also we got into like permits so when you're dealing with um

399
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:23,318
you know, different cities and their regulations and stuff like that.

400
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:27,321
Like, you know, the permit process is different, you know, in a lot of different places.

401
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:28,762
So kind of touching a base upon that.

402
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:34,726
But in addition to it, while we were doing that, they were curating their own event at the same time.

403
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:41,071
So the last day of the internship, or at least the last week, was their event that they put on.

404
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,252
So, like, that was super fun.

405
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:46,634
So we'll probably do that again with Tufts and they can do it here.

406
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:49,316
It's fun, man.

407
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:52,498
It's fun to kind of show people stuff.

408
00:29:52,538 --> 00:30:04,046
But it's also like, I don't know, if you're a good teacher, you're a good learner and good listener because it's not about just what you're putting out.

409
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:05,267
It's what you can take from it.

410
00:30:06,368 --> 00:30:07,128
I learned a lot.

411
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:08,750
So that was super fun.

412
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:21,663
Sounds like a similar vibe to our podcast, like kind of learning what's happening in the community, trying to connect to those folks and then connect people to each other, which seems like will happen naturally with your space as well.

413
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:22,424
I hope so.

414
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:24,526
And again, it doesn't all have to happen here.

415
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,376
You know, reach out and say, hey, I have a question.

416
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:29,237
How would you do this?

417
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,979
This is how you should do it.

418
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,860
Contact this or do this or just buy this.

419
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,481
You'll be all set.

420
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:34,981
You're fine.

421
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:38,043
Or if they want to do something here, then that's great.

422
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:43,827
Again, we're a large, small space, right?

423
00:30:45,168 --> 00:30:55,391
Our footprint is a decent size, but it's not like we can host events for 500 people or anything like that.

424
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,771
But that's the point.

425
00:30:58,212 --> 00:30:59,532
We don't want to be.

426
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:02,933
We want to be a place that people know where to go.

427
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:12,940
that if they want to do something here, they can, or if they want to do something at their home, they can, or if they're like, I want to put on a gala, you know, you're like, all right, let's do this.

428
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,101
Where can we do that locally?

429
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,443
Like, where do you think we can do that?

430
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:18,345
And like, that's the point is that

431
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:26,063
We want to be able to help people put on things and support other local businesses and other establishments.

432
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:28,445
Not be competitive.

433
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:33,709
We don't have to worry about some of the elements either.

434
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:36,612
I'm running through my head about what party I have up next.

435
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:36,812
I know.

436
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:38,653
I was going to say, do we have any oversized chests?

437
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:45,238
things.

438
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:48,000
You mentioned your son, right?

439
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,361
He is actually an avid skier, but he will not be found playing basketball.

440
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:52,762
No?

441
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:54,622
Soccer.

442
00:31:55,423 --> 00:32:01,986
Okay, I'm a snowboarder, but I am ashamed on the lack there of time I've spent on the slopes this year.

443
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:05,587
I mean, have you not been slightly dizzy?

444
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:11,371
Yeah, I did bring up my bag, my snowboard with my boots and everything.

445
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:17,817
I had it up here and I was like, alright, I'm going to go to work, I'm going to see it and be like, I'm going to work really hard today and tomorrow.

446
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:21,423
but I stop by, pick it up, going north.

447
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:24,644
But that hasn't really happened yet.

448
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:27,665
But you know, can't get bummed about it.

449
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,705
Things change.

450
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:30,645
Last year I did a lot.

451
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,005
The season's not over yet.

452
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:36,186
We still have a good Nor'easter coming, don't we?

453
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:38,406
It's been three feet of snow.

454
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,267
Cool.

455
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:43,227
Well, Ryan, thank you so much.

456
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:43,767
Thank you.

457
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,188
I look forward to seeing you in May.

458
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:45,608
Yeah.

459
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:46,688
Yeah, May 6, guys.

460
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:47,388
Make sure you're here.

461
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,591
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

462
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:03,471
And Shelley.

463
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,853
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

464
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,895
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

465
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:12,236
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

466
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:20,461
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

467
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:24,323
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

468
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:26,805
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

469
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:36,188
Guys, what's the name of the podcast?

470
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,197
Never Bites.

471
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,075
Never Bites.

472
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:39,519
Good job.
