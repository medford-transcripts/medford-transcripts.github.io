00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:06,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening everyone, welcome to the October 24th meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:10,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your patience and waiting for the start of the meeting.

3
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,720
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to get started now.

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, if you could re-read the first case.

5
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:23,848
[SPEAKER_02]: 32 Jimpkins Road, case number A-2024-22, athlete and owner Kimberley and John Roper,

6
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:36,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I installed a garage at 32 Jenkins Road on the Woodside Road side of the property within the front yard setback, which is not allowed for the City of Mecklensdorf and Williams Chapter 94 Table B Table of Dimensional Requirements.

7
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:40,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dennis.

8
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And do we have a representative for the applicant?

9
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Amy, don't we have to take a roll call?

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

13
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:50,843
[SPEAKER_09]: My script is... Let's take a roll call of attendance.

14
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:52,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the procedural.

15
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:54,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Caldera?

16
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:55,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

17
00:00:58,607 --> 00:00:59,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim Tarani?

18
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

19
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:02,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary Lee?

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

21
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:04,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy Aveda?

22
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:06,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

23
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:08,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jamie Thompson, present.

24
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:10,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mike.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And do we have a representative for the applicant?

26
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Kimberly Rupert.

27
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:38,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So, do you have a anything you can go ahead and if you will present to the board.

28
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:41,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

29
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:46,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis, were you able to show the slides for me?

30
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:47,233
Yep.

31
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:54,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the volume on my side is really low and I can't get it any higher.

32
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:55,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully you can hear me.

33
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:55,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

34
00:01:59,245 --> 00:01:59,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

35
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so thank you.

36
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:10,829
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Kimberly Rupert, my husband's also on the call here john Rupert, and we're at 32 Jenkins road.

37
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:18,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to say thank you to the board for all your time and expertise and reviewing our application and also being here tonight.

38
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:25,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So this first slide is a picture of our addition.

39
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:31,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the left side of our house adjacent to Woodside Road.

40
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:40,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We are hoping it will be a garage on the first floor and then above the garage is a bedroom, bathroom, and laundry room.

41
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the work also includes backfilling our existing driveway, which is on the right side of the house, which I'll talk about in a little bit.

42
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis, okay, you can go to the next slide there.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,383
[SPEAKER_03]: The next slide just shows the rear views of what the proposed addition would look like.

44
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So the back on the left is the back is the backyard is the view from the backyard and on the right side there is the view from Woodside Road.

45
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it's on the right side.

46
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:27,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So our proposed garage would be 16 feet wide to accommodate one car.

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And it provides a setback of 9 feet.

48
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So my husband and I are here tonight seeking a variance of 6 feet from the required 15 feet side yard setback on a corner lot.

49
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:49,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can jump ahead, Dennis, to the plot plant, there's a simplified plot.

50
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:51,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So that just shows what variants we're looking for.

51
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:53,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a simplified plot plan.

52
00:03:54,728 --> 00:04:01,109
[SPEAKER_03]: If you click again, there'll be a little red circle that shows the addition that we're proposing.

53
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 16 feet wide there and 24 feet long.

54
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:17,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the little red box there shows that the setback that the addition allows is nine feet when it should be, or what's required is 15 feet.

55
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:23,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just wanted to point out on this line, I mean, I know you guys are probably used to looking at

56
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,619
[SPEAKER_03]: plot plot lines, but the lines are the property line.

57
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:36,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like another almost eight and eight and a half, nine feet beyond our property line to the road.

58
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:42,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like nine feet of grass there, which I understand, you know, is an easement.

59
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:52,560
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to point out how much space is on that piece of our property lot and kind of the only buildable space on our property.

60
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,123
[SPEAKER_03]: If you click forward to the next slide.

61
00:04:55,143 --> 00:05:09,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So our hardship here is that our property is unique, and the strict adherence to the side yard setback will not allow us to fix our existing driveway and garage and expand our home.

62
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:22,730
[SPEAKER_03]: our lot is not only a corner lot with three 15 feet setbacks, but it's also a very different shape, size, and topography when compared to other corner lots in our neighborhood.

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:29,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at other corner lots, there are these beautiful, nice rectangles with the house nicely centered in the middle of the lot.

64
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:39,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours is a reverse pie shape lot and our house, and so we have angled property lines.

65
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:43,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And our house is set back in that kind of like a slight angle, too.

66
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And additionally, you can go to the next slide.

67
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:52,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, the topography of our existing driveway plays into this.

68
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:53,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also unique.

69
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:59,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's what we're aiming to fix by filling it in and building a new garage.

70
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:04,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So our driveway on the other side of the house, on the right hand side of the house, is this very steep slope.

71
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:08,864
[SPEAKER_03]: directly into our garage that's under our first floor of the house.

72
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:13,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it rains, the water just flows right into our garage.

73
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:22,771
[SPEAKER_03]: We have installed a trench drain and a sump pump, but unfortunately it doesn't keep all the water out and it still fails occasionally.

74
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:30,814
[SPEAKER_03]: So what this means is that we can't really use our garage for cars and storage because of the water damage, mold and rust.

75
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:37,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And also in the winter, it's just a complete sheet of ice because the house blocks the sun.

76
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:43,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unsafe, I've fallen a few times, and just everything about this driveway is stressful.

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,543
[SPEAKER_03]: If you click to the next slide, we just have a couple pictures of the driveway.

78
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,449
[SPEAKER_03]: This just shows it.

79
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,393
[SPEAKER_03]: The height of this wall right by the garage door is a little over six feet.

80
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:11,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's hard to tell how much of a slope of it is, but when it rains, the water is definitely a river that goes right into our garage.

81
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:18,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Right at the bottom there, you can see the trench drain, and then that picture on the right is the sump pump that we installed.

82
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:22,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go to the next picture.

83
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:32,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I, you know I haven't taken a lot of pictures when we've had flooding so this, this is an old one before we installed the trench train in some pump.

84
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,377
[SPEAKER_03]: but it has looked like this since then.

85
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:47,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It just shows that the water comes in and it also shows just how gross it is because all the dirt and everything comes with it.

86
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,603
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mess.

87
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:52,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the next slide.

88
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,165
[SPEAKER_03]: These next pictures,

89
00:07:56,348 --> 00:08:03,654
[SPEAKER_03]: demonstrate how our proposal does not nullify the intent and purposes of the 15 foot setback on a corner lot.

90
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:11,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So the positioning of our house on our lot does leave a lot of space to the intersection.

91
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:20,666
[SPEAKER_03]: there's almost 38 feet from where our proposed addition would be to that intersection of Judkins and Woodside Road.

92
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:31,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So this means that our addition, you know, shouldn't or will not interfere with visibility for drivers and pedestrians at that intersection.

93
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:35,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the bottom picture just shows from

94
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:54,777
[SPEAKER_03]: our backyard neighbors right like in our backyard there that the addition wouldn't interfere with them pulling out of their driveway either because the addition would be within our fenced area and still leave that visibility to the road.

95
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:57,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And next slide.

96
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:06,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to make a few more points to why the relief, we're seeking does not create substantial detriment to the public good.

97
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:13,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So our proposed addition is reasonable size for a one car garage.

98
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:19,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It also leaves one and a half feet from the side yard requirements of all non corner lots in our neighborhood.

99
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:27,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We were also very thoughtful in designing the addition, you know, to preserve the character of our home in the neighborhood.

100
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:35,834
[SPEAKER_03]: We mimicked the gambrel roof and then we're maintaining the wood painted shingles on it.

101
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:42,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we also rarely park our car in our driveway because it's such a nightmare.

102
00:09:42,702 --> 00:09:52,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So our new flat driveway will allow us to keep our cars off Jenkin Road, and just kind of create more space there for our neighbors and anybody who's coming through.

103
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then one more slide.

104
00:09:56,314 --> 00:10:03,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, um, I actually reviewed the Medford's comprehensive plan because it was part of the application process.

105
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:18,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so although, you know, I do realize it's more for, you know, big picture citywide planning, um, I did see that our proposal is compatible with the plan's goal to preserve the character of Medford's neighborhoods.

106
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:34,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also aligns with the goal to adopt flood resilience and is actually a direct example of the plan's acknowledgement that flexibility with zoning ordinances will be needed to address flooding issues.

107
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually all I have.

108
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:41,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.

109
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,360
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope that you'll grant us the relief we're seeking.

110
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer any questions.

111
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:48,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Kimberly.

112
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:51,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to go to the board first.

113
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:54,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Do any of the board members have questions for the applicant?

114
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:03,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, go ahead.

115
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:10,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you mentioned something about not owning a portion of the

116
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:13,008
[SPEAKER_07]: property and an easement.

117
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:26,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said it sounded like it was longer than nine foot and I'm looking at the different plans and I just want to make sure I understood that correctly because I don't see the delineation between your property line and the part you were referring to.

118
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:31,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in that that plot line is just our property lines.

119
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:45,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I actually don't know what the actual city easement is for every property but there's always like a piece of land that is between the street and where our property line starts.

120
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's my understanding.

121
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:56,071
[SPEAKER_03]: The plot shows our direct property lines.

122
00:11:56,352 --> 00:12:01,395
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go back to the pictures, our fence is a little short of our property line.

123
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:08,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just pointing out that there's, like I said, eight to nine feet of grass beyond our fence.

124
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:10,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that makes sense.

125
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:26,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you own the property in the city just has an easement so you can't use all of it or does this city on the property, I'm looking in the assessor's database and I don't like it looks like it goes all the way to the line I don't know if Scott, you know, I don't know if somebody else has knowledge there.

126
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:28,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Scott, Building Commissioner.

127
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what she's talking about is what is known as the roadway.

128
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:37,926
[SPEAKER_11]: The roadway that the city has is the asphalt plus the sidewalk and all that.

129
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,468
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really an easement.

130
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,930
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the roadway that her property butts up to.

131
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,773
[SPEAKER_11]: It just happens to be more than what you see as the asphalt.

132
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,395
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all of those parts and pieces together.

133
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:49,415
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really an easement.

134
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,817
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just road versus property.

135
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, maybe we're using the wrong term there.

136
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.

137
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't have sidewalks through our neighborhood.

138
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,049
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm guessing that's what that part of that grass.

139
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a sidewalk.

140
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

141
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,251
[SPEAKER_07]: No public participation right now.

142
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:09,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So but so yeah, that was my what I was trying to figure out.

143
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:14,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it nine foot of grass or is it nine plus nine?

144
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:15,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it's

145
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, nine feet of it's I did measure.

146
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say I think it was.

147
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:27,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say it's 8 1⁄2 just to be a little less, but it's 8 1⁄2 feet from the edge of the road to our fence.

148
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it and then.

149
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:35,912
[SPEAKER_03]: In within our fence will be another.

150
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,953
[SPEAKER_03]: 9 feet.

151
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:42,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I'm saying all this right 9 feet till our to where our addition will start.

152
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:44,835
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thanks.

153
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:48,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mike.

154
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:49,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Kimberly.

155
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:51,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle, go ahead.

156
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chair.

157
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Danielle Evans, senior planner.

158
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to add that I believe this is a private way.

159
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:06,202
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, it's the property owner owns to the central line.

160
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:11,706
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no city ownership of the road itself.

161
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:16,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

162
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to belabor it, but it.

163
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,861
[SPEAKER_07]: It still seems like I'm getting mixed information.

164
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:25,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it.

165
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:30,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Effectively 18 foot of grass or is it 18 foot to the center line?

166
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:45,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want, you can bring up the simplified plot.

167
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:57,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, which could be wrong as it was nine foot to the point nine foot to the property line.

168
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is basically where our current fences.

169
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:13,576
[SPEAKER_03]: And then beyond our fence, there's an additional nine feet of grass, but it's my understanding that is beyond our property line.

170
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:24,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So the setback measurement is from the property line, not the edge of the road.

171
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:31,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just don't see it reflected in the assessor's database or anything like that.

172
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the plot goes all the way to the road.

173
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.

174
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like that everywhere.

175
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:53,795
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a simplified version of a much more complicated plot plan that our surveyor, I mean, we had a surveyor come out and do the whole survey and this was the end result.

176
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:59,106
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually why we thought we had a lot more space.

177
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:05,152
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't think we would be, you know, dealing with any variants or whatever, but okay.

178
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:05,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

179
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:07,774
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see where you're going with it.

180
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:08,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike is if they're.

181
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:14,781
[SPEAKER_09]: If the property line property does go to that point, then they would have, they'd be within the setback.

182
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

183
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,170
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I guess my question reminds me of, sorry, I'm sorry, Scott.

184
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:46,976
[SPEAKER_02]: This was, remember we had the property at Century, which they wanted to put the porch in the front, but because if we counted where the street met the grass, they had enough room, but because it was a private way, it sort of pushes it back like three or four feet from where it really is.

185
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:52,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of the, I think it's kind of along those lines.

186
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm getting it right.

187
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:58,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because it was a private way to push back from the center line.

188
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Building Commissioner, if you can add something.

189
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:08,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this is a common misunderstanding with ways, whether it's a public way by the city or it's a private way.

190
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:12,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Your property line is not always where the asphalt stops or starts.

191
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this case, that is what it is.

192
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:18,528
[SPEAKER_11]: They do on the right to the fee in the road to the center of the road.

193
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,271
[SPEAKER_11]: But they can't use it because it's technically off their property.

194
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,953
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't use it to build a pond.

195
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:29,178
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to maintain the right to re-pass and re-pass to all the butters on both sides.

196
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:40,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a complicated thing, but yes, there's an additional nine feet of grass that belongs to her partially, but she can't use it for purposes of constructing.

197
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

198
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:44,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Commissioner.

199
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:50,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, does that cover where you were trying to clarify?

200
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:50,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

201
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:51,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

202
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:52,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

203
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:55,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions from the board?

204
00:17:58,757 --> 00:17:59,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, go ahead.

205
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:00,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. chair.

206
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just through you.

207
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:04,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just looking at Google maps and I'm.

208
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,641
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a clarifying question sort of.

209
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:17,629
[SPEAKER_08]: does the fence that you have reflect your property line or is it sort of before?

210
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:23,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just right inside of our property line.

211
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:38,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, I don't know exactly how many inches or if it's a full foot, but if you look on our more detailed plot plan, you can see that our fence is just inside of our property line.

212
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, I just was curious, thank you.

213
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Chris, thank you.

214
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions from the board?

215
00:18:51,108 --> 00:19:01,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we will go to public comment.

216
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:08,563
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody from the public wants to comment on this case, please raise your hand on Zoom.

217
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can email Dennis.

218
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, if you would, put your email address in the chat.

219
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:29,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dennis.

220
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:48,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, while we're waiting for that, I mean, I did send this to the board, but we did receive four letters in support of this from neighboring butters to this property.

221
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:49,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

222
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:49,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

223
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:50,688
[SPEAKER_09]: The board has received.

224
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:52,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

225
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:54,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are in the folder as well.

226
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:55,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

227
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:58,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are on in the public record.

228
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:03,276
[SPEAKER_09]: But I understand that we did not receive any letters against correct.

229
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:05,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

230
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:09,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I saw the I don't know, maybe I missed one.

231
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there?

232
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:13,267
[SPEAKER_02]: report said one today.

233
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:17,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier earlier today, we got 3 of them and I sent another one that came in today.

234
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's in the folder yet.

235
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:29,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any hands raised on zoom.

236
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:31,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis of you know, raising.

237
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:34,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not seeing.

238
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:35,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And you folks hear me.

239
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I go ahead.

240
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:39,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't hear me.

241
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:40,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

242
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:41,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we can hear you.

243
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:46,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say I'm totally in support of Kim, John, Jack and Charlie.

244
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a resident of method for 42 years.

245
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,389
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't ask for better residents.

246
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:58,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so whatever the board can do, we certainly want to keep people, families of their nature in method.

247
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:02,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're losing people here and there, so I totally support it.

248
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,661
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighbors totally support her and her family.

249
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:08,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we certainly want to keep these people in method.

250
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:12,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Robert.

251
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:15,294
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could just get your name and address for the record.

252
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:16,355
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Robert Mello.

253
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:26,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at Robert Mello and Paula Mello at 40 Judkins Road, right beside Kim and John, directly beside them.

254
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:28,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 40 Judkins Road.

255
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:30,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

256
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:33,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, do you see anybody else?

257
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see anybody else with a hand raised.

258
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:37,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not.

259
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:37,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, apologies.

260
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:41,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't copy that 1 letter and now it's up on the.

261
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:44,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Google drive, so right?

262
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,259
[SPEAKER_01]: We did send a letter of support for Kim and John.

263
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

264
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:56,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a motion to close public comment and go to deliberation?

265
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:00,089
[SPEAKER_09]: 2nd, 2nd.

266
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:01,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mary.

267
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:02,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike.

268
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Mary.

269
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:07,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Chris.

270
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:09,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

271
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim.

272
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:11,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

273
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jamie, aye.

274
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:17,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I am just going to pause that because I do see we have somebody trying to raise their hand.

275
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:19,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Tim, if you want to go ahead and speak.

276
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:20,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys hear me okay?

277
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:20,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Very faintly.

278
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:20,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

279
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:20,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Just another thing.

280
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:34,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I also, I live across the street from John and Kim and I totally support the building of the house.

281
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:58,462
[SPEAKER_10]: for great residents, great people, and we have absolutely no issue with them, including the addition on the house.

282
00:22:58,482 --> 00:23:00,803
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thumbs up from myself, Tim, and my wife, Michelle, at 43 Jenkins Road.

283
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:01,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Tim, I appreciate it.

284
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:01,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

285
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:03,725
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, for board deliberation, I will open it up for the board.

286
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:07,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Would like to start.

287
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:25,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take the 1st comment on this 1. so obviously, we do have a corner lot at the end of a row.

288
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:27,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the.

289
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:33,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Is no budding neighbor on the side that where the addition is looking to go.

290
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,772
[SPEAKER_09]: From the condition of the lot, obviously, this is a variance.

291
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:53,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are looking specifically at soil condition, shape, topography of the land, and where a little enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or bylaw.

292
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:55,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Apologies, my light just went off.

293
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:57,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

294
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,881
[SPEAKER_09]: would affect the owner's ability to build.

295
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:21,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent of the law.

296
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:29,736
[SPEAKER_09]: With the space on the property line of nine feet and obviously the public space to the road of additional nine feet,

297
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:41,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see difficulty with the addition, especially considering the position of the home on the lot and their opportunity to develop on the other side where the driveway currently exists.

298
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:43,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, go ahead.

299
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I tend to agree with you, Jamie.

300
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:57,946
[SPEAKER_07]: The lot's clearly an unusual shape and topography, and the position of the current house limits the possible locations for an above

301
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:07,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it looks like there is no sidewalk in this case, and so, you know.

302
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:10,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know for sure, but I would presume there aren't.

303
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:20,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Current plans to add one, and so, you know, unlike that other case, Dennis, you were referring to, it seems like the effective setback is.

304
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,941
[SPEAKER_07]: More than 15 ft anyway, and so, um.

305
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:43,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, you know, it would have been nice to get an explicit confirmation one way or the other from the neighbor on Woodside, but I think it's, um, you know, the design is, um, it fits the neighborhood and, um, it, it's set back enough from the street.

306
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:50,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and the lot is certainly unusual and the, the water damage, uh, is a, is a hardship.

307
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:53,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it meets the variance criteria.

308
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:57,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mike.

309
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:59,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else from the board?

310
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:08,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also in a agreement with that as well.

311
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:13,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything Mike just mentioned, I feel the same.

312
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:18,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Jim.

313
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:19,348
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

314
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:23,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary or Chris, do you guys have anything that you'd like to add?

315
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:39,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm, I'm in agreement with what everybody has said so far, and particularly in light of the slope, the topography of of that garage, and I do believe that it will be in the best interest of safe for safety.

316
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,710
[SPEAKER_06]: For granting that variance.

317
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:47,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

318
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:59,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would also say as long as the neighbors are happy with it, I think this is one of those projects where it mostly hinges on the neighbors.

319
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:13,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And because houses are different types as you go around that neighborhood, so it's not unusual to have such an arrangement.

320
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, as long as the neighbors are happy, I don't see a problem with it.

321
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:22,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chris.

322
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:28,837
[SPEAKER_09]: The board awaits a motion on the variance for 32 Judkins Road.

323
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:34,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I motion to approve the variance for 32 Judkins Road.

324
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

325
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:38,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

326
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:43,682

445
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:35,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that starts a 20 days appeals period.

00:28:56,221 --> 00:29:03,105
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway, case number 40D-2022-01.

457
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:20,734
[SPEAKER_02]: MVP Mystic LLC is making a request that the board determine that certain proposed changes to multifamily eight-story apartment development consisting of two buildings located in approximately three acres of land at 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway, property ID 7-02-10 are insubstantial changes pursuant to 760 code of Massachusetts regulations

458
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:27,389
[SPEAKER_02]: 36.0511 of the regulations governing comprehensive permits issued under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40B.

459
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:32,373
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no proposed changes to the number of units, parking spaces, bike parking spaces, or building rights.

460
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:36,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dennis.

461
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:38,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

462
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

463
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Mr. Chair and members of the board.

464
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim Alexander from Mill Creek Residential.

465
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Mr. Alexander.

466
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:51,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to see you all again, and appreciate the opportunity.

467
00:29:51,204 --> 00:30:11,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have with me members of our design team and consultant team, and you'll hopefully, those of you who've been on the board will remember Chris and Louise from Goulston and Storrs, our legal counsel, and then our team from TAT, the architect Andrew Stebbins and Matt Duggan are here.

468
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:15,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony Donato is our civil engineer from Hancock Associates.

469
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:19,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rob Adams is on as well as our landscape architect from Albertson.

470
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:24,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So the same team that has been working on the project now for a few years.

471
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:35,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Mister chair I I know with a couple of new members it you let me know it will be helpful to provide some background on the project in general.

472
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:50,148
[SPEAKER_05]: If that help I'm happy to do that otherwise I do have a few slide to sort of help describe and maybe put some imagery to the refinement that we're showing in the plan that sort of make up this is a special change request.

473
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:55,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure you want to do a quick overview and then move into the specific changes that we appropriate.

474
00:30:57,174 --> 00:31:11,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Great so just for the new members of the board and I know the building commissioner as well is new since our hearing process that was I remember correctly started in October of 2022 and concluded in June or July of 2023.

475
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway

476
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:26,019
[SPEAKER_05]: a residential multi-family community that was approved under the, as Dennis stated, the Chapter 40B laws.

477
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:39,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the corner of Mystic Valley Parkway and Commercial Street, just north of McDonald Park, and hopefully folks are familiar with that location, just directly to the west of the Cambridge County Courthouse.

478
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:50,876
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I mentioned, we went through a process with this board that concluded just over a year ago that approved the 40B permit.

479
00:31:52,277 --> 00:32:02,799
[SPEAKER_05]: The project consists of two buildings that are eight stories each, a total of 350 residential units, obviously parking on-site, on-site leasing and amenities.

480
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:05,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was all, obviously,

481
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: reviewed and peer reviewed during the process in late 22 into mid 23.

482
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And since that time, we have

483
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:23,454
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pleased to say now we've been able to advance our drawings, right?

484
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So get more detail into our drawings that eventually become the construction drawings.

485
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:33,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And as part of that process, certain refinements come to light, certain small changes are made.

486
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:41,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what has predicated this in what's known in 40B as an insubstantial change submission.

487
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:46,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have, if you don't mind me sharing, I have a couple,

488
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,229
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have co-host options.

489
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:52,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Please go ahead.

490
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

491
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I do.

492
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:58,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

493
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:06,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are seeing your slides.

494
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:07,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

495
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:07,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

496
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:15,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I'll provide, uh, we submitted to the board, I think it was on the 14th of, of, um,

497
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:25,191
[SPEAKER_05]: October, a letter and a revised set of plans, architecture, civil, and a landscape rendered plan as well, outlining these refinements.

498
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:33,418
[SPEAKER_05]: But happy to provide just on a few slides, I think eight or 10 slides, just the quick summary of the changes.

499
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:43,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Dennis read into the introduction, these plan refinements are really related to the advancement of our construction drawings.

500
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:52,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as we, as we went from the permit set, if you will, into what's known as schematic design and design development.

501
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we noticed there are some opportunities for it really improvement and refinement to the plans.

502
00:33:58,716 --> 00:34:01,299
[SPEAKER_05]: They're generally related to.

503
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:12,991
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiency of design and construction, and I think more clearly, efficiency and a betterment for the resident experience, the operational experience, and I'll talk about a few of those things in a minute.

504
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:22,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to be very clear, the refinements don't alter any of the major program or categories that are already approved.

505
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:24,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, still 350 residential units,

506
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:33,142
[SPEAKER_05]: The unit mix, meaning the, the mix between 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom and studio units remains.

507
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:35,208
[SPEAKER_05]: remarkably the same.

508
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:38,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the identical parking count as we've had.

509
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,911
[SPEAKER_05]: The commercial space of 2,000 square feet remains the same.

510
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:49,175
[SPEAKER_05]: The building programming and spacing is really substantially the same as well.

511
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:57,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also wanted to note that, you know, one of the things we looked at in some detail with the board in 2022 and 23 was the corner plaza on the corner

512
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:07,741
[SPEAKER_05]: to show that in our in a couple of slides here.

513
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:20,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So jumping in, this is just a quick overview that shows in red the foot building footprints from the comprehensive permit or the permit that was issued a little over a year ago.

514
00:35:21,506 --> 00:35:26,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And then underlying that all the black is what's proposed in the current scheme.

515
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is helpful just to show, you know, a couple of tweaks and ins and outs, right?

516
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:43,495
[SPEAKER_05]: One here where the leasing, or I'm sorry, the building lobby may jut out a little bit further than previous, but in other areas, you know, the building is pulled back a little bit from where it was previously.

517
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:51,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just a general overview to sort of underpin again that these changes are really minor pushes and pulls.

518
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:53,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

519
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:10,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so getting into a little bit more granular detail and hopefully these are again, I think will will prove to be improvements to the plan both for for resident experience and our operational experience.

520
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,353
[SPEAKER_05]: But 1 of the things we wanted to point out is a is a change in a relocation of the bike storage rooms.

521
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:18,451
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that had a lot of discussion.

522
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:24,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I know many of you will recall adequate bike storage, adequate placement for bike storage.

523
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:29,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's something that we, as we continue to progress the plans.

524
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:47,738
[SPEAKER_05]: started to look at in greater detail, and we're able to find a way to move bike storage from interior of the garage, where it was on two levels, the first level and the second level of the garage, and move that outboard to have an exterior access along the center drive aisle between the two buildings.

525
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what's shown on the right.

526
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the approved plans on the left and the proposed plans on the right of the screen.

527
00:36:56,862 --> 00:37:10,386
[SPEAKER_05]: The good news is not only are the bike rooms now accessible directly to the exterior, but we're also able to fit 15 or 18 more bikes, we believe, in this configuration.

528
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:18,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was submitted, and there was actually a sheet in the architectural set with some blowups on these and detailed drawings of these bike rooms.

529
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:22,469
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to point that out as what we see is really an improvement to the plan.

530
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Another couple, similarly, we had trash rooms for the residents and the retail space that were in board in the garage.

531
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:45,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And something we have now are accomplishing here is the ability to move the trash rooms to the exterior, have an exterior access.

532
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:51,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this case, a trash room that is more proximate to the retail space as well.

533
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:58,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, operational efficiency, you know, trash is picked up sometimes two, three times a week.

534
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:07,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to make sure we talked about during our hearing process, I recall, you know, how does that trash get from the corner of the garage and then to the outside of the building so it can be picked up?

535
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:13,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now we've got a direct door that goes directly from the trash room out to, out

536
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,513
[SPEAKER_05]: easily stop and pick it up.

537
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:22,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is showing the trash in the southern building.

538
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:44,723
[SPEAKER_05]: The next slide is the same thing in the northern building where it was previously in an inside corner, and now we've moved it out to an exterior corner, which is actually good that it's along also this long lay-by access area that we all created during the first review and hearing process.

539
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,328
[SPEAKER_05]: couple more to point out.

540
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:50,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned retail.

541
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:55,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Retail is the same size, roughly 2,000 or just actually exactly 2,000 square feet.

542
00:38:55,791 --> 00:39:00,632
[SPEAKER_05]: In the previous plan, it was pulled off of the corner and there was some back of house on the building corner here.

543
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:08,235
[SPEAKER_05]: The move to the trash room meant that we could also push the retail all the way to the corner of the building.

544
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:17,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we feel is the right thing to do operationally to have it directly adjacent to trash, but also it activates this corner of the building.

545
00:39:17,374 --> 00:39:19,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the Southeast corner of the building.

546
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:23,179
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go further plan north, that's where the, the courthouse is and.

547
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:42,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving east to west on Misty Valley Parkway is actually a very prominent corner on the site, gets lots of eyeballs, and so we feel like this is the best way to set up a future commercial retail tenant with both eyeballs, signage, and visibility.

548
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,571
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more.

549
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:58,036
[SPEAKER_05]: This is showing the two building lobbies, really the resident lobbies that are facing each other along the center access drive.

550
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:06,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior, they were quite small, really just a quick entry and then obviously access to elevators.

551
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:30,023
[SPEAKER_05]: What we've tried to do in looking at it again is expand those resident entries in the lobbies and make sure we had adequate space, not only for daily, for mail and, you know, mailboxes for the residents, but also package room, which of course in a multifamily community is always at a, space is at a premium and packages are obviously much more, are a big part of daily life.

552
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:35,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we wanted to make sure that these lobbies can accommodate those kind of daily needs for our residents.

553
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:41,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also helped us to better delineate a lobby space from actual residential units.

554
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:49,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see, if you can see my cursor, this lobby in the southern building was really directly adjacent to a residential unit.

555
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:52,312
[SPEAKER_05]: This A denotes a one-bedroom unit.

556
00:40:52,792 --> 00:41:02,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been able, you can see on the right, to now have a lobby space within a corridor with a door there before you get to the actual residential space.

557
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:10,060
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more quick things and I'll wrap up.

558
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,801
[SPEAKER_05]: The changes to in a couple of different locations, but this is a good example of it.

559
00:41:18,382 --> 00:41:26,306
[SPEAKER_05]: In the prior plan, we had some shallow unit depths, shallower than we would normally want to do.

560
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:35,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're able to just slightly adjust the footprint of the parking within the building to allow for full depth residential units here.

561
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, the trash and the bike rooms that I had mentioned before.

562
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:50,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what that meant for the rest of the plan is just some slight shuffling and adjustment of where the residential units then fall within the building, especially on the ground floor.

563
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:59,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's sort of what's shown here in this red box, you know, slight change to the footprint and how the units are configured on the very northern edge of the building.

564
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:04,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is right up against that abutting sort of driveway.

565
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And then further north is the wetland area.

566
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:15,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, a couple things on amenities that are further up in the building.

567
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:21,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll recall our courtyards on the fourth level of the building have amenity spaces that are adjoining them within the building.

568
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:28,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior, they are shown in a corner here and in a rectangle here.

569
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are single height spaces, obviously valuable space and wanting to engage and activate those courtyards.

570
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:41,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a couple of things we looked at is one is making these actually double height space.

571
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:52,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So this space in the red boxes below are actually not just on the fourth floor, but they also encompass space on the fifth floor as well.

572
00:42:53,170 --> 00:43:00,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're able to have really meaningful space there and good visibility in and out of the courtyard.

573
00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:12,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also just shifted the one in the southern building to be that much closer to the elevator core, so we didn't have to go buy a residential unit in order to get to the amenities.

574
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:25,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So just, again, small things, but things that we felt were going to be beneficial to the daily life of our residents, and hopefully the daily life of, you know, everything, all the servicing and operational needs of the building as well.

575
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:33,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So no changes to the courtyard, no changes to the fact that we've got storage space adjoining those courtyards.

576
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:37,977
[SPEAKER_05]: That was all the things we talked about during our initial hearings.

577
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:41,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last one is going up to the roof.

578
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,963
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a rooftop amenity that we showed previously on the

579
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:49,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Southeastern corner of the building, if you will.

580
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:57,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is Mystic Valley Parkway looking south over the park and with views of the Boston skyline eventually.

581
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:16,252
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things, and this is, again, just to really try to maximize the resident experience, shifting that further to the west, so in the southwest corner, allows, you know, really a direct access from the elevators down to that rooftop amenity or the top-level amenity, if you will.

582
00:44:16,992 --> 00:44:20,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So same size, shape generally, but just

583
00:44:27,243 --> 00:44:28,404
[SPEAKER_05]: transportation of the elevators.

584
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:31,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'll leave it there.

585
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:49,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, these are, that's, there was, I think, a little bit more detail, obviously, in our letter, but wanted to make sure we could sort of generally explain these types of changes, and A, why we think they're beneficial to the project, and B, of course, why, you know, they're seen under Chapter 40B as insubstantial.

586
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:56,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'll end there, and Mr. Chair, happy to take any questions, and of course, our team is here, too, if there are any specifics.

587
00:45:04,354 --> 00:45:05,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

588
00:45:05,215 --> 00:45:05,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Alexander.

589
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:11,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I just want to check with Dennis, uh, the board real quick.

590
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,939
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need to go to public comment for this.

591
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

592
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:21,404
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a review of the existing project for an insubstantial versus substantial change by the board only.

593
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:21,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

594
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:31,369
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be my interpretation.

595
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:33,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, go ahead.

596
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:52,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Jamie, whether or not we're required to, I don't see the harm in checking, as long as the comment is focused on what the board's actually deciding here, which is whether it's a substantial change, yeah.

597
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:54,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

598
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:58,556
[SPEAKER_09]: So first, we'll go through the standard process.

599
00:45:58,596 --> 00:46:00,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to the board for questions to the applicant.

600
00:46:09,153 --> 00:46:10,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I might go ahead.

601
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:12,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, not a question, just a comment.

602
00:46:13,496 --> 00:46:15,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the update on the project.

603
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:17,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Glad to see it's advancing.

604
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:23,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all of the changes described seem very reasonable.

605
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:29,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I mean, when the board deliberates, I guess we'll talk about insubstantial.

606
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:35,830
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, just in general, I think these are good changes that make the project more functional.

607
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

608
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:40,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Mike.

609
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:44,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions from the board or comments?

610
00:46:47,143 --> 00:46:55,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the proposed plan alter any way the exterior of the previous proposal?

611
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do they remain the same?

612
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:01,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you for the question.

613
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:06,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry, I should have mentioned that before the know.

614
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:14,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the, the exterior of the buildings and the design language, and many of the things that were adjusted as part of that.

615
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:41,546
[SPEAKER_05]: year remain the same so the elevations are also provided in the architectural plan set and I think you know this is where there you know are there slight adjustments to where balconies are located on the facade there's there are but the design language and the ins and outs and the materiality and even the colors that we proposed are maintained in this

616
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:55,079
[SPEAKER_05]: but also I think there are a couple of renderings on the cover page of the of the architectural plan set and that's probably the most helpful to see.

617
00:47:55,099 --> 00:48:04,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

618
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:07,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments from the board?

619
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:22,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just for scope and for understanding, since we are doing public comment, I do want to just read the section of the code that does apply to this.

620
00:48:22,283 --> 00:48:27,306
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 760 CMR 5607, section four, substantial changes to the project.

621
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:31,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to read the examples that are considered substantial, just for reference.

622
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:39,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So substantial changes, for examples, would be something along the lines of an increase of more than 10% in the height of the building.

623
00:48:40,158 --> 00:48:57,528
[SPEAKER_09]: an increase of more than 10% in the number of units proposed, a reduction of the size of the site of more than 10% and a decrease in the number of units proposed in that same scale, a change in the building, garden apartment styles versus townhouse versus high-rise,

624
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,691
[SPEAKER_09]: or a change of one form of housing tenure or another.

625
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:07,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, in a 40B state market and with 25% affordable, there's no change to that scope.

626
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:13,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you're for an understanding of what we're looking at from the scale and impact perspective.

627
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:16,736
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll open it up for public comment.

628
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:22,358
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody from the public would like to make a comment, please raise your hand on Zoom, or you can send an email.

629
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:24,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, Chris, go ahead.

630
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:48,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, Mr. Chair, have a question just on the first proposed project change to the north building where it talks about the trash rooms have been relocated from interior corners within the garage of each building to exterior facing areas in the building.

631
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:52,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any more detail on that?

632
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:54,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a, you know, is there any

633
00:49:57,682 --> 00:50:00,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Any rendering that shows a little bit of that or an elevation?

634
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:06,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the question.

635
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:10,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me reshare my screen real quick.

636
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,532
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be helpful.

637
00:50:21,157 --> 00:50:21,357
[SPEAKER_05]: There.

638
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So to answer your question, is your question like, how does this generally opt?

639
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:31,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the southern building.

640
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:32,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I can move to the northern building.

641
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be helpful.

642
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:39,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the northern building, where trash was in the northwest interior corner of the garage.

643
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:45,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been moved to the southeast corner of the building.

644
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:54,726
[SPEAKER_05]: There are yet when there are elevations provided within the architectural plan set that show how this, you know, kind of looks and feels from the exterior.

645
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:14,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally speaking, the way these work within the building is there's a trash chute or a trash room on each floor, you know, door access, and then you go in and there's a chute, and then the trash, you know, drops down into our collection bins within this trash room.

646
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:23,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the double doors are there, so those bins can be rolled out on the, you know, morning of a trash pickup or, you know, the defined time of a trash pickup.

647
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if that answers your question,

648
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:30,472
[SPEAKER_05]: and why we located it where we did.

649
00:51:32,232 --> 00:51:33,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

650
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:33,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.

651
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:43,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious as to how the collection would occur and whether or not that's visible.

652
00:51:44,316 --> 00:51:54,119
[SPEAKER_08]: But in fact, I guess it's, in a way, looking at the proposed change, possibly less visible to the street side than the

653
00:51:57,758 --> 00:51:59,199
[SPEAKER_08]: permanent way of last year.

654
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

655
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,141
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know what I'm saying?

656
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:14,649
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what is the exterior of this, uh, appear to the passerby or, you know, someone that, um, everyone has to crash at the back usually.

657
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

658
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:16,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

659
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:23,194
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's for the vast majority of time, it appears as a double doors, um, out to this access drive.

660
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:33,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like I said, whether it's twice or three times a week, you know, at a defined time, the bins can be rolled out through these doors, picked up, and then the bins are rolled right back in.

661
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:38,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's generally how, you know, a multifamily sort of trash collection works.

662
00:52:38,953 --> 00:52:47,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite frankly, one of the things that we had some discussion on during the original hearings was the fact that having trash inboard to the building

663
00:52:47,886 --> 00:52:53,950
[SPEAKER_05]: would have to roll out through the vehicular entrance and then back, you know, somewhere off to the sidewalk here.

664
00:52:54,010 --> 00:53:02,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably going to be more impactful to the daily life of residents and, you know, more work for operations staff and possibly more work for the trash pickup folks too.

665
00:53:02,856 --> 00:53:10,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of the reasoning behind, all right, let's get this outboard where, you know, it's not any more visible on a daily basis and it's actually just easier.

666
00:53:20,209 --> 00:53:20,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chris.

667
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:21,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Alexander.

668
00:53:24,071 --> 00:53:26,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will open a public comment.

669
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:33,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And then from public, if you could raise your hand on Zoom, provide your name and address for the record, or email Dennis.

670
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:34,916
[SPEAKER_09]: His email is on the chat.

671
00:53:35,497 --> 00:53:39,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, dmcdougall.medford-ma.gov.

672
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dennis, we haven't received any communications from the public prior to the meeting, correct?

673
00:53:46,082 --> 00:53:46,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

674
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any hands raised on Zoom.

675
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:00,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have anything in email?

676
00:54:01,044 --> 00:54:13,328
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do not.

677
00:54:15,048 --> 00:54:15,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

678
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:19,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just close the public portion and enter deliberation.

679
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a second?

680
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:25,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

681
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:27,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Jim.

682
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:27,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

683
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:28,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

684
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:29,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

685
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

686
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:31,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

687
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:33,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

688
00:54:34,043 --> 00:54:34,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

689
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:35,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

690
00:54:35,945 --> 00:54:36,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jamie, aye.

691
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:40,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we are in deliberation.

692
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:43,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I reviewed what is considered substantial.

693
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:55,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, 10% change to the building in height, size, increase in units, reduction in units, or a change in form or type of housing.

694
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:56,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, conversion from

695
00:54:57,615 --> 00:54:59,916
[SPEAKER_09]: what we see here in garden style to townhomes or such.

696
00:54:59,936 --> 00:55:03,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Mike.

697
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:12,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I don't see any changes here that trigger the technical requirements that would be a substantial change.

698
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said earlier, I think the changes make the project better.

699
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:22,026
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would be comfortable for the board to find that these are insubstantial changes.

700
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:25,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mike.

701
00:55:26,736 --> 00:55:43,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, 1 thing I do want to add, we did not have, uh, we did get, uh, a review with our, uh, legal, uh, KP law as well as our 40B consultant, uh, Judy Barrett and both of those organizations, uh, did agree that there was no substantial changes documented in the request.

702
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, any other deliberation from the board?

703
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:09,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair awaits a motion on the consideration of substantial versus insubstantial changes for 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway.

704
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:17,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I motion to find these changes to the plans for 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway to be insubstantial.

705
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll second that.

706
00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:21,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

707
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:23,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

708
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:24,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

709
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:25,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

710
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:27,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

711
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:28,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

712
00:56:29,784 --> 00:56:31,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Mike.

713
00:56:32,285 --> 00:56:34,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, and Jamie.

714
00:56:34,446 --> 00:56:34,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

715
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:39,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you everybody for your time.

716
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:43,209
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the decision finding here is that the changes are in substantial.

717
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:45,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, do we for this?

718
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a decision on that as well written up.

719
00:56:56,056 --> 00:57:00,321
[SPEAKER_07]: David, you can check with the lawyers, but I think the recommendation is yes.

720
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like a full decision, but it would be a, oh, go ahead.

721
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:06,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Attorney Grenier might have some feedback.

722
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:08,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

723
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:09,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

724
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, member and Mr. Chair.

725
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:24,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, typically this is documented in a simple letter where the board acknowledges, sorry, the insubstantial change, references the plans that were submitted with our letter.

726
00:57:25,205 --> 00:57:31,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a one and a half pager, typically, and I'm happy to coordinate with you, Dennis.

727
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,088
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got examples of this.

728
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:38,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Amy Quessel would have examples as well, but typically this is documented in a simple letter.

729
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:41,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

730
00:57:41,665 --> 00:57:42,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

731
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,448
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be great.

732
00:57:45,768 --> 00:57:46,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

733
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:51,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the heads up Chris, I am actually out of the office tomorrow.

734
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:52,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back in on Monday.

735
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:57,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

736
00:57:57,837 --> 00:58:01,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we do not have any cases on the additional cases on the agenda.

737
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any administrative updates?

738
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:03,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis?

739
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:09,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be straight up nothing to speak of right now.

740
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,569
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a couple of violence for next month.

741
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,550
[SPEAKER_02]: We should actually we're doing this.

742
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:18,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Discuss the date for the next meeting.

743
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:22,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The next meeting in November would be Thanksgiving.

744
00:58:22,273 --> 00:58:24,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, we sort of mentioned it last.

745
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Eating, but, you know, whether we love to have dinner with.

746
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:38,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I know we talked about the potential moving it to the 21st.

747
00:58:40,914 --> 00:58:43,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Or to the 5th.

748
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:51,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there was a preference for the 5th when I correct based on.

749
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Filing timing, and then also the consideration for the.

750
00:58:56,322 --> 00:59:00,364
[SPEAKER_09]: December meeting that would likely get bumped forward into the 2nd, week of January.

751
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:07,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, that was sort of the reason because that one would more likely be moved into January 2nd.

752
00:59:08,255 --> 00:59:09,836
[SPEAKER_08]: The 5th is election day, by the way.

753
00:59:09,856 --> 00:59:15,279
[SPEAKER_02]: 5th of December, sorry.

754
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,643
[SPEAKER_02]: 5th of December, yeah, sorry, yeah.

755
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:24,025
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do voting in the morning and the evening.

756
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:31,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Just announcing up front, I can't make the 5th, so that doesn't necessarily mean choose a different date, but just want that to be known.

757
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:33,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you Mike.

758
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:33,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

759
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:47,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put it out there for the other members who aren't here and then we can sort of put a pin on that one and if we can't, there's no meeting continued so we can just, you know, as long as everything is advertised right to the proper date, we'll find a better date.

760
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:47,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

761
00:59:48,057 --> 00:59:50,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've got everybody here.

762
00:59:50,997 --> 00:59:51,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to check.

763
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim, would the fifth work for you?

764
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:54,898
[SPEAKER_09]: It works, yes.

765
00:59:55,798 --> 00:59:57,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, does the fifth work for you?

766
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:58,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it does.

767
00:59:58,579 --> 00:59:59,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I have the wrong

768
01:00:00,603 --> 01:00:00,843
[SPEAKER_09]: 1 month.

769
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:01,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no worries.

770
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:03,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done that plenty of times.

771
01:00:04,404 --> 01:00:06,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Mary, does the 5th work for you?

772
01:00:06,624 --> 01:00:07,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, December 5th.

773
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:08,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, correct.

774
01:00:09,525 --> 01:00:12,606
[SPEAKER_09]: All right and 5th does work for me, so we can pencil that in tentatively.

775
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:16,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and we can follow up with, um, Andre to see if he's available.

776
01:00:20,847 --> 01:00:24,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to the record, you had to actually tell us last meeting.

777
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:27,509
[SPEAKER_02]: She wasn't going to make she actually be.

778
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:32,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I just forgot because.

779
01:00:32,483 --> 01:00:33,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

780
01:00:33,023 --> 01:00:43,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing we have is that we didn't.

781
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, still working on the meeting minutes from last meeting.

782
01:00:47,392 --> 01:00:49,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that was midterm, so things got a little sideways for her.

783
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:52,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I do, we did the last meeting.

784
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:53,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to talk.

785
01:00:53,876 --> 01:00:56,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't approve the August minutes because nobody had enough time, but.

786
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:59,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We tabled it for this month.

787
01:01:03,256 --> 01:01:03,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

788
01:01:04,216 --> 01:01:10,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Does everybody have an opportunity to review minutes or do we need to bump that and add it to the agenda for next meeting?

789
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:18,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I say next meeting, but if others have reviewed, that's fine.

790
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I unfortunately didn't read them.

791
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:24,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I assumed they were approved last meeting.

792
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:28,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you weren't there, so no worries.

793
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:33,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Dennis, why don't we, uh, that was August.

794
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:39,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why don't we bump that to a bunch of meeting minutes approval next meeting?

795
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:39,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

796
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:46,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could resend out the August minutes when you send out the other minutes, that way we can review them all.

797
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:49,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

798
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll motion to adjourn.

799
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:56,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

800
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:58,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call.

801
01:01:59,383 --> 01:01:59,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

802
01:02:00,404 --> 01:02:00,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

803
01:02:01,445 --> 01:02:01,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

804
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:02,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

805
01:02:03,108 --> 01:02:03,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

806
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:04,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

807
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:05,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

808
01:02:06,652 --> 01:02:06,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

809
01:02:07,754 --> 01:02:08,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jamie?

810
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:08,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

811
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:12,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you everyone for your time tonight and your patience.

812
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good evening.

813
01:02:13,722 --> 01:02:15,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
