00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:06,896
Good evening everyone, welcome to the October 24th meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:10,258
Thank you for your patience and waiting for the start of the meeting.

3
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,720
We are going to get started now.

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,643
Dennis, if you could re-read the first case.

5
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:23,848
32 Jimpkins Road, case number A-2024-22, athlete and owner Kimberley and John Roper,

6
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:36,836
I installed a garage at 32 Jenkins Road on the Woodside Road side of the property within the front yard setback, which is not allowed for the City of Mecklensdorf and Williams Chapter 94 Table B Table of Dimensional Requirements.

7
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:40,398
Thank you, Dennis.

8
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:42,178
And do we have a representative for the applicant?

9
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,620
Amy, don't we have to take a roll call?

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,460
Don't.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,701
Sorry.

13
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:50,843
My script is... Let's take a roll call of attendance.

14
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:52,743
I appreciate the procedural.

15
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:54,844
Mike Caldera?

16
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:55,945
Present.

17
00:00:58,607 --> 00:00:59,227
Jim Tarani?

18
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,108
Present.

19
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:02,210
Mary Lee?

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,331
Present.

21
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:04,812
Christy Aveda?

22
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:06,893
Present.

23
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:08,955
And Jamie Thompson, present.

24
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:10,196
Thank you, Mike.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,981
And do we have a representative for the applicant?

26
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,488
Hi, my name is Kimberly Rupert.

27
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:38,991
So, do you have a anything you can go ahead and if you will present to the board.

28
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:41,571
Sure.

29
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:46,233
Dennis, were you able to show the slides for me?

30
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:47,233
Yep.

31
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:54,535
Sorry, the volume on my side is really low and I can't get it any higher.

32
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:55,555
So hopefully you can hear me.

33
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:55,915
Okay.

34
00:01:59,245 --> 00:01:59,805
Okay, great.

35
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,586
So, so thank you.

36
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:10,829
My name is Kimberly Rupert, my husband's also on the call here john Rupert, and we're at 32 Jenkins road.

37
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:18,852
So I just want to say thank you to the board for all your time and expertise and reviewing our application and also being here tonight.

38
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:25,214
So this first slide is a picture of our addition.

39
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:31,795
It's on the left side of our house adjacent to Woodside Road.

40
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:40,418
We are hoping it will be a garage on the first floor and then above the garage is a bedroom, bathroom, and laundry room.

41
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:49,211
And then the work also includes backfilling our existing driveway, which is on the right side of the house, which I'll talk about in a little bit.

42
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,197
Dennis, okay, you can go to the next slide there.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,383
The next slide just shows the rear views of what the proposed addition would look like.

44
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:12,729
So the back on the left is the back is the backyard is the view from the backyard and on the right side there is the view from Woodside Road.

45
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,376
I'm not sure if it's on the right side.

46
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:27,800
So our proposed garage would be 16 feet wide to accommodate one car.

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,881
And it provides a setback of 9 feet.

48
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:41,785
So my husband and I are here tonight seeking a variance of 6 feet from the required 15 feet side yard setback on a corner lot.

49
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:49,327
And if you can jump ahead, Dennis, to the plot plant, there's a simplified plot.

50
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:51,447
So that just shows what variants we're looking for.

51
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:53,968
So this is a simplified plot plan.

52
00:03:54,728 --> 00:04:01,109
If you click again, there'll be a little red circle that shows the addition that we're proposing.

53
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,370
So it's 16 feet wide there and 24 feet long.

54
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:17,194
And then the little red box there shows that the setback that the addition allows is nine feet when it should be, or what's required is 15 feet.

55
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:23,836
And then I just wanted to point out on this line, I mean, I know you guys are probably used to looking at

56
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,619
plot plot lines, but the lines are the property line.

57
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:36,026
So there's like another almost eight and eight and a half, nine feet beyond our property line to the road.

58
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:42,752
So there's like nine feet of grass there, which I understand, you know, is an easement.

59
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:52,560
But I just want to point out how much space is on that piece of our property lot and kind of the only buildable space on our property.

60
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,123
If you click forward to the next slide.

61
00:04:55,143 --> 00:05:09,239
So our hardship here is that our property is unique, and the strict adherence to the side yard setback will not allow us to fix our existing driveway and garage and expand our home.

62
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:22,730
our lot is not only a corner lot with three 15 feet setbacks, but it's also a very different shape, size, and topography when compared to other corner lots in our neighborhood.

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:29,735
Looking at other corner lots, there are these beautiful, nice rectangles with the house nicely centered in the middle of the lot.

64
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:39,262
Ours is a reverse pie shape lot and our house, and so we have angled property lines.

65
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:43,685
And our house is set back in that kind of like a slight angle, too.

66
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,869
And additionally, you can go to the next slide.

67
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:52,552
Additionally, the topography of our existing driveway plays into this.

68
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:53,853
It's also unique.

69
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:59,057
And it's what we're aiming to fix by filling it in and building a new garage.

70
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:04,882
So our driveway on the other side of the house, on the right hand side of the house, is this very steep slope.

71
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:08,864
directly into our garage that's under our first floor of the house.

72
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:13,326
So when it rains, the water just flows right into our garage.

73
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:22,771
We have installed a trench drain and a sump pump, but unfortunately it doesn't keep all the water out and it still fails occasionally.

74
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:30,814
So what this means is that we can't really use our garage for cars and storage because of the water damage, mold and rust.

75
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:37,537
And also in the winter, it's just a complete sheet of ice because the house blocks the sun.

76
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:43,240
It's unsafe, I've fallen a few times, and just everything about this driveway is stressful.

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,543
If you click to the next slide, we just have a couple pictures of the driveway.

78
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,449
This just shows it.

79
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,393
The height of this wall right by the garage door is a little over six feet.

80
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:11,200
I don't know if it's hard to tell how much of a slope of it is, but when it rains, the water is definitely a river that goes right into our garage.

81
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:18,125
Right at the bottom there, you can see the trench drain, and then that picture on the right is the sump pump that we installed.

82
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:22,608
And if you go to the next picture.

83
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:32,614
Unfortunately, I, you know I haven't taken a lot of pictures when we've had flooding so this, this is an old one before we installed the trench train in some pump.

84
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,377
but it has looked like this since then.

85
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:47,262
It just shows that the water comes in and it also shows just how gross it is because all the dirt and everything comes with it.

86
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,603
It's a mess.

87
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:52,465
Go to the next slide.

88
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,165
These next pictures,

89
00:07:56,348 --> 00:08:03,654
demonstrate how our proposal does not nullify the intent and purposes of the 15 foot setback on a corner lot.

90
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:11,680
So the positioning of our house on our lot does leave a lot of space to the intersection.

91
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:20,666
there's almost 38 feet from where our proposed addition would be to that intersection of Judkins and Woodside Road.

92
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:31,914
So this means that our addition, you know, shouldn't or will not interfere with visibility for drivers and pedestrians at that intersection.

93
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:35,156
And then the bottom picture just shows from

94
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:54,777
our backyard neighbors right like in our backyard there that the addition wouldn't interfere with them pulling out of their driveway either because the addition would be within our fenced area and still leave that visibility to the road.

95
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:57,260
And next slide.

96
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:06,406
And I just wanted to make a few more points to why the relief, we're seeking does not create substantial detriment to the public good.

97
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:13,069
So our proposed addition is reasonable size for a one car garage.

98
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:19,233
It also leaves one and a half feet from the side yard requirements of all non corner lots in our neighborhood.

99
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:27,703
We were also very thoughtful in designing the addition, you know, to preserve the character of our home in the neighborhood.

100
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:35,834
We mimicked the gambrel roof and then we're maintaining the wood painted shingles on it.

101
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:42,281
And then, you know, we also rarely park our car in our driveway because it's such a nightmare.

102
00:09:42,702 --> 00:09:52,172
So our new flat driveway will allow us to keep our cars off Jenkin Road, and just kind of create more space there for our neighbors and anybody who's coming through.

103
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,154
Um, and then one more slide.

104
00:09:56,314 --> 00:10:03,118
And lastly, um, I actually reviewed the Medford's comprehensive plan because it was part of the application process.

105
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:18,648
Um, and so although, you know, I do realize it's more for, you know, big picture citywide planning, um, I did see that our proposal is compatible with the plan's goal to preserve the character of Medford's neighborhoods.

106
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:34,375
And it also aligns with the goal to adopt flood resilience and is actually a direct example of the plan's acknowledgement that flexibility with zoning ordinances will be needed to address flooding issues.

107
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,737
And that's actually all I have.

108
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:41,279
And thank you.

109
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,360
We hope that you'll grant us the relief we're seeking.

110
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm happy to answer any questions.

111
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:48,502
Thank you very much, Kimberly.

112
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:51,169
I'm just going to go to the board first.

113
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:54,090
Do any of the board members have questions for the applicant?

114
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:03,715
Mike, go ahead.

115
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:10,798
Yeah, you mentioned something about not owning a portion of the

116
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:13,008
property and an easement.

117
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:26,453
So you said it sounded like it was longer than nine foot and I'm looking at the different plans and I just want to make sure I understood that correctly because I don't see the delineation between your property line and the part you were referring to.

118
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:31,170
Yeah, in that that plot line is just our property lines.

119
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:45,101
And, you know, I actually don't know what the actual city easement is for every property but there's always like a piece of land that is between the street and where our property line starts.

120
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,907
At least that's my understanding.

121
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:56,071
The plot shows our direct property lines.

122
00:11:56,352 --> 00:12:01,395
If we go back to the pictures, our fence is a little short of our property line.

123
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:08,721
I was just pointing out that there's, like I said, eight to nine feet of grass beyond our fence.

124
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:10,883
Okay, that makes sense.

125
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:26,472
Do you own the property in the city just has an easement so you can't use all of it or does this city on the property, I'm looking in the assessor's database and I don't like it looks like it goes all the way to the line I don't know if Scott, you know, I don't know if somebody else has knowledge there.

126
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:28,419
Hi, Scott, Building Commissioner.

127
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,421
I think what she's talking about is what is known as the roadway.

128
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:37,926
The roadway that the city has is the asphalt plus the sidewalk and all that.

129
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,468
It's not really an easement.

130
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,930
It's the roadway that her property butts up to.

131
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,773
It just happens to be more than what you see as the asphalt.

132
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,395
It's all of those parts and pieces together.

133
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:49,415
It's not really an easement.

134
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,817
It's just road versus property.

135
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,459
Yeah, maybe we're using the wrong term there.

136
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,187
Yeah, sorry.

137
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,968
Well, we don't have sidewalks through our neighborhood.

138
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,049
So I'm guessing that's what that part of that grass.

139
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,350
It could be a sidewalk.

140
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,170
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,251
No public participation right now.

142
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:09,693
So but so yeah, that was my what I was trying to figure out.

143
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:14,595
Is it nine foot of grass or is it nine plus nine?

144
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:15,175
Okay, so it's

145
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,087
Yes, nine feet of it's I did measure.

146
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,147
I don't want to say I think it was.

147
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:27,430
I'll say it's 8 1⁄2 just to be a little less, but it's 8 1⁄2 feet from the edge of the road to our fence.

148
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,230
Got it and then.

149
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:35,912
In within our fence will be another.

150
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,953
9 feet.

151
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:42,714
Hopefully I'm saying all this right 9 feet till our to where our addition will start.

152
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:44,835
OK, thanks.

153
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:48,949
Thank you, Mike.

154
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:49,610
Thank you, Kimberly.

155
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:51,451
Danielle, go ahead.

156
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,714
Thank you, Chair.

157
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,656
I'm Danielle Evans, senior planner.

158
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,277
I'm just going to add that I believe this is a private way.

159
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:06,202
So generally, it's the property owner owns to the central line.

160
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:11,706
So there's no city ownership of the road itself.

161
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:16,529
Thank you.

162
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,618
I don't want to belabor it, but it.

163
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,861
It still seems like I'm getting mixed information.

164
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:25,241
Is it.

165
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:30,064
Effectively 18 foot of grass or is it 18 foot to the center line?

166
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:45,053
I mean, if you want, you can bring up the simplified plot.

167
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:57,021
Yeah, I mean, which could be wrong as it was nine foot to the point nine foot to the property line.

168
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,727
Which is basically where our current fences.

169
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:13,576
And then beyond our fence, there's an additional nine feet of grass, but it's my understanding that is beyond our property line.

170
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:24,349
So the setback measurement is from the property line, not the edge of the road.

171
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:31,605
Yeah, I just don't see it reflected in the assessor's database or anything like that.

172
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,067
It looks like the plot goes all the way to the road.

173
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,628
Yeah, I agree.

174
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,389
It looks like that everywhere.

175
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:53,795
This is a simplified version of a much more complicated plot plan that our surveyor, I mean, we had a surveyor come out and do the whole survey and this was the end result.

176
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:59,106
That's actually why we thought we had a lot more space.

177
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:05,152
We didn't think we would be, you know, dealing with any variants or whatever, but okay.

178
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:05,632
Thank you.

179
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:07,774
So I see where you're going with it.

180
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:08,695
Mike is if they're.

181
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:14,781
If the property line property does go to that point, then they would have, they'd be within the setback.

182
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,222
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,170
uh, I guess my question reminds me of, sorry, I'm sorry, Scott.

184
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:46,976
This was, remember we had the property at Century, which they wanted to put the porch in the front, but because if we counted where the street met the grass, they had enough room, but because it was a private way, it sort of pushes it back like three or four feet from where it really is.

185
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:52,537
So it's sort of the, I think it's kind of along those lines.

186
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,158
I think I'm getting it right.

187
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:58,604
Yeah, because it was a private way to push back from the center line.

188
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,484
Building Commissioner, if you can add something.

189
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:08,186
Yeah, this is a common misunderstanding with ways, whether it's a public way by the city or it's a private way.

190
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:12,427
Your property line is not always where the asphalt stops or starts.

191
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,227
And in this case, that is what it is.

192
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:18,528
They do on the right to the fee in the road to the center of the road.

193
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,271
But they can't use it because it's technically off their property.

194
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,953
They can't use it to build a pond.

195
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:29,178
They have to maintain the right to re-pass and re-pass to all the butters on both sides.

196
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:40,188
So it's a complicated thing, but yes, there's an additional nine feet of grass that belongs to her partially, but she can't use it for purposes of constructing.

197
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,651
Thank you.

198
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:44,092
Thank you, Commissioner.

199
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:50,034
Mike, does that cover where you were trying to clarify?

200
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:50,874
Yes.

201
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:51,354
Yeah.

202
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:52,515
Perfect.

203
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:55,936
Any other questions from the board?

204
00:17:58,757 --> 00:17:59,257
Chris, go ahead.

205
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:00,638
Mr. chair.

206
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,258
Yeah, just through you.

207
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:04,659
I'm just looking at Google maps and I'm.

208
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,641
This is just a clarifying question sort of.

209
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:17,629
does the fence that you have reflect your property line or is it sort of before?

210
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:23,192
Yeah, it's just right inside of our property line.

211
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:38,519
So I think, I don't know exactly how many inches or if it's a full foot, but if you look on our more detailed plot plan, you can see that our fence is just inside of our property line.

212
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,941
Thank you, I just was curious, thank you.

213
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,785
Thanks, Chris, thank you.

214
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,088
Any other questions from the board?

215
00:18:51,108 --> 00:19:01,357
Okay, we will go to public comment.

216
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:08,563
If anybody from the public wants to comment on this case, please raise your hand on Zoom.

217
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,465
Or you can email Dennis.

218
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,087
Dennis, if you would, put your email address in the chat.

219
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:29,840
Thank you, Dennis.

220
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:48,367
Jim, while we're waiting for that, I mean, I did send this to the board, but we did receive four letters in support of this from neighboring butters to this property.

221
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:49,387
Yep.

222
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:49,988
Thank you.

223
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:50,688
The board has received.

224
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:52,029
Yep.

225
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:54,110
And those are in the folder as well.

226
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:55,991
Correct.

227
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:58,273
Those are on in the public record.

228
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:03,276
But I understand that we did not receive any letters against correct.

229
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:05,497
Correct.

230
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:09,680
And as I saw the I don't know, maybe I missed one.

231
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,220
Is there?

232
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:13,267
report said one today.

233
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:17,649
Earlier earlier today, we got 3 of them and I sent another one that came in today.

234
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,670
I don't think it's in the folder yet.

235
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:29,753
I don't see any hands raised on zoom.

236
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:31,854
Dennis of you know, raising.

237
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:34,174
And I'm not seeing.

238
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:35,935
And you folks hear me.

239
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:37,976
I go ahead.

240
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:39,536
I can't hear me.

241
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:40,036
I'm not sure.

242
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:41,757
Yeah, we can hear you.

243
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:46,825
I just want to say I'm totally in support of Kim, John, Jack and Charlie.

244
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,347
I've been a resident of method for 42 years.

245
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,389
You couldn't ask for better residents.

246
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:58,995
Um, so whatever the board can do, we certainly want to keep people, families of their nature in method.

247
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:02,838
I know we're losing people here and there, so I totally support it.

248
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,661
The neighbors totally support her and her family.

249
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:08,583
And, uh, we certainly want to keep these people in method.

250
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:12,972
Thank you, Robert.

251
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:15,294
If you could just get your name and address for the record.

252
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:16,355
My name is Robert Mello.

253
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:26,503
I live at Robert Mello and Paula Mello at 40 Judkins Road, right beside Kim and John, directly beside them.

254
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:28,625
Yeah, 40 Judkins Road.

255
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:30,046
Thank you very much.

256
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:33,628
Dennis, do you see anybody else?

257
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,530
I don't see anybody else with a hand raised.

258
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:37,131
I do not.

259
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:37,932
And yeah, apologies.

260
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:41,095
I didn't copy that 1 letter and now it's up on the.

261
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:44,017
Google drive, so right?

262
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,259
We did send a letter of support for Kim and John.

263
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,480
Thank you.

264
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:56,106
Do we have a motion to close public comment and go to deliberation?

265
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:00,089
2nd, 2nd.

266
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:01,270
Thank you, Mary.

267
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:02,511
Mike.

268
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,413
Hi, Mary.

269
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:07,935
Hi, Chris.

270
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:09,409
Aye.

271
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,610
Jim.

272
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:11,451
Aye.

273
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,572
And Jamie, aye.

274
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:17,395
I am just going to pause that because I do see we have somebody trying to raise their hand.

275
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:19,437
Tim, if you want to go ahead and speak.

276
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:20,017
Can you guys hear me okay?

277
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:20,317
Very faintly.

278
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:20,417
Okay.

279
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:20,798
Just another thing.

280
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:34,688
I also, I live across the street from John and Kim and I totally support the building of the house.

281
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:58,462
for great residents, great people, and we have absolutely no issue with them, including the addition on the house.

282
00:22:58,482 --> 00:23:00,803
So, thumbs up from myself, Tim, and my wife, Michelle, at 43 Jenkins Road.

283
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:01,764
Thank you very much, Tim, I appreciate it.

284
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:01,964
Thank you.

285
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:03,725
All right, for board deliberation, I will open it up for the board.

286
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:07,919
Would like to start.

287
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:25,185
I can take the 1st comment on this 1. so obviously, we do have a corner lot at the end of a row.

288
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:27,406
Um, the.

289
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:33,028
Is no budding neighbor on the side that where the addition is looking to go.

290
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,772
From the condition of the lot, obviously, this is a variance.

291
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:53,562
So we are looking specifically at soil condition, shape, topography of the land, and where a little enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or bylaw.

292
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:55,083
Apologies, my light just went off.

293
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:57,965
Sorry.

294
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,881
would affect the owner's ability to build.

295
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:21,511
And that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent of the law.

296
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:29,736
With the space on the property line of nine feet and obviously the public space to the road of additional nine feet,

297
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:41,321
I don't see difficulty with the addition, especially considering the position of the home on the lot and their opportunity to develop on the other side where the driveway currently exists.

298
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:43,121
Mike, go ahead.

299
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,462
Yeah, I tend to agree with you, Jamie.

300
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:57,946
The lot's clearly an unusual shape and topography, and the position of the current house limits the possible locations for an above

301
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:07,775
Um, it looks like there is no sidewalk in this case, and so, you know.

302
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:10,636
I don't know for sure, but I would presume there aren't.

303
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:20,439
Current plans to add one, and so, you know, unlike that other case, Dennis, you were referring to, it seems like the effective setback is.

304
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,941
More than 15 ft anyway, and so, um.

305
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:43,641
So yeah, you know, it would have been nice to get an explicit confirmation one way or the other from the neighbor on Woodside, but I think it's, um, you know, the design is, um, it fits the neighborhood and, um, it, it's set back enough from the street.

306
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:50,162
So, and the lot is certainly unusual and the, the water damage, uh, is a, is a hardship.

307
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:53,663
So I think it meets the variance criteria.

308
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:57,122
Thank you, Mike.

309
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:59,223
Anyone else from the board?

310
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:08,765
I'm also in a agreement with that as well.

311
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:13,746
Everything Mike just mentioned, I feel the same.

312
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:18,408
Thank you, Jim.

313
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:19,348
You're welcome.

314
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:23,829
Mary or Chris, do you guys have anything that you'd like to add?

315
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:39,707
Um, I'm, I'm in agreement with what everybody has said so far, and particularly in light of the slope, the topography of of that garage, and I do believe that it will be in the best interest of safe for safety.

316
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,710
For granting that variance.

317
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:47,252
Thank you.

318
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:59,337
Yeah, I would also say as long as the neighbors are happy with it, I think this is one of those projects where it mostly hinges on the neighbors.

319
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:13,560
And because houses are different types as you go around that neighborhood, so it's not unusual to have such an arrangement.

320
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,061

321
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:22,235
Thank you, Chris.

322
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:28,837
The board awaits a motion on the variance for 32 Judkins Road.

323
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:34,199
I motion to approve the variance for 32 Judkins Road.

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,760
I'll second.

Aye.

444
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:32,337
If so, I'm going to write the decision and then when it's done, it'll get signed and then filed in the clerk's office.

445
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:35,079
And then that starts a 20 days appeals period.

446
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:38,661
And then once that appeals period is done, then you can get your building permit.

447
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:41,123
Great.

448
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:42,244
Thank you so much, everyone.

449
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:46,467
Good luck.

450
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:48,029
Thank you.

451
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:49,009
Really appreciate it.

452
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:49,470
Thank you.

453
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:50,611
Thank you, Board.

454
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:51,151
Appreciate it.

455
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,201
Okay, Dennis, if you would read the next case.

456
00:28:56,221 --> 00:29:03,105
4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway, case number 40D-2022-01.

457
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:20,734
MVP Mystic LLC is making a request that the board determine that certain proposed changes to multifamily eight-story apartment development consisting of two buildings located in approximately three acres of land at 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway, property ID 7-02-10 are insubstantial changes pursuant to 760 code of Massachusetts regulations

458
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:27,389
36.0511 of the regulations governing comprehensive permits issued under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40B.

459
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:32,373
There are no proposed changes to the number of units, parking spaces, bike parking spaces, or building rights.

460
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:36,556
Thank you, Dennis.

461
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:38,258
Do we have a representative for the applicant?

462
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,059
Yes.

463
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,461
Good evening, Mr. Chair and members of the board.

464
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,643
Tim Alexander from Mill Creek Residential.

465
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,461
Good evening, Mr. Alexander.

466
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:51,184
Nice to see you all again, and appreciate the opportunity.

467
00:29:51,204 --> 00:30:11,617
I also have with me members of our design team and consultant team, and you'll hopefully, those of you who've been on the board will remember Chris and Louise from Goulston and Storrs, our legal counsel, and then our team from TAT, the architect Andrew Stebbins and Matt Duggan are here.

468
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:15,480
Tony Donato is our civil engineer from Hancock Associates.

469
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:19,289
And Rob Adams is on as well as our landscape architect from Albertson.

470
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:24,493
So the same team that has been working on the project now for a few years.

471
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:35,200
Mister chair I I know with a couple of new members it you let me know it will be helpful to provide some background on the project in general.

472
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:50,148
If that help I'm happy to do that otherwise I do have a few slide to sort of help describe and maybe put some imagery to the refinement that we're showing in the plan that sort of make up this is a special change request.

473
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:55,571
Sure you want to do a quick overview and then move into the specific changes that we appropriate.

474
00:30:57,174 --> 00:31:11,726
Great so just for the new members of the board and I know the building commissioner as well is new since our hearing process that was I remember correctly started in October of 2022 and concluded in June or July of 2023.

475
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,448
So this is 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway

476
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:26,019
a residential multi-family community that was approved under the, as Dennis stated, the Chapter 40B laws.

477
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:39,450
It's the corner of Mystic Valley Parkway and Commercial Street, just north of McDonald Park, and hopefully folks are familiar with that location, just directly to the west of the Cambridge County Courthouse.

478
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:50,876
And as I mentioned, we went through a process with this board that concluded just over a year ago that approved the 40B permit.

479
00:31:52,277 --> 00:32:02,799
The project consists of two buildings that are eight stories each, a total of 350 residential units, obviously parking on-site, on-site leasing and amenities.

480
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:05,120
And so that was all, obviously,

481
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:12,059
reviewed and peer reviewed during the process in late 22 into mid 23.

482
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,001
And since that time, we have

483
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:23,454
We're pleased to say now we've been able to advance our drawings, right?

484
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,916
So get more detail into our drawings that eventually become the construction drawings.

485
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:33,919
And as part of that process, certain refinements come to light, certain small changes are made.

486
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:41,802
And so that's what has predicated this in what's known in 40B as an insubstantial change submission.

487
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:46,264
So I have, if you don't mind me sharing, I have a couple,

488
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,229
You should have co-host options.

489
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:52,809
Please go ahead.

490
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,249
Yep.

491
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,070
I think I do.

492
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:58,612
Sure.

493
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:06,316
And we are seeing your slides.

494
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:07,116
Okay.

495
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:07,696
Excellent.

496
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:15,580
Um, so I'll provide, uh, we submitted to the board, I think it was on the 14th of, of, um,

497
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:25,191
October, a letter and a revised set of plans, architecture, civil, and a landscape rendered plan as well, outlining these refinements.

498
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:33,418
But happy to provide just on a few slides, I think eight or 10 slides, just the quick summary of the changes.

499
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:43,987
And as Dennis read into the introduction, these plan refinements are really related to the advancement of our construction drawings.

500
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:52,868
Um, as we, as we went from the permit set, if you will, into what's known as schematic design and design development.

501
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,636
Uh, we noticed there are some opportunities for it really improvement and refinement to the plans.

502
00:33:58,716 --> 00:34:01,299
They're generally related to.

503
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:12,991
efficiency of design and construction, and I think more clearly, efficiency and a betterment for the resident experience, the operational experience, and I'll talk about a few of those things in a minute.

504
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:22,737
Just to be very clear, the refinements don't alter any of the major program or categories that are already approved.

505
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:24,578
Of course, still 350 residential units,

506
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:33,142
The unit mix, meaning the, the mix between 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom and studio units remains.

507
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:35,208
remarkably the same.

508
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:38,429
We have the identical parking count as we've had.

509
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,911
The commercial space of 2,000 square feet remains the same.

510
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:49,175
The building programming and spacing is really substantially the same as well.

511
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:57,559
And I also wanted to note that, you know, one of the things we looked at in some detail with the board in 2022 and 23 was the corner plaza on the corner

512
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:07,741
to show that in our in a couple of slides here.

513
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:20,866
So jumping in, this is just a quick overview that shows in red the foot building footprints from the comprehensive permit or the permit that was issued a little over a year ago.

514
00:35:21,506 --> 00:35:26,068
And then underlying that all the black is what's proposed in the current scheme.

515
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,653
And this is helpful just to show, you know, a couple of tweaks and ins and outs, right?

516
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:43,495
One here where the leasing, or I'm sorry, the building lobby may jut out a little bit further than previous, but in other areas, you know, the building is pulled back a little bit from where it was previously.

517
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:51,176
So this is just a general overview to sort of underpin again that these changes are really minor pushes and pulls.

518
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:53,897
Oops.

519
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:10,070
Yeah, so getting into a little bit more granular detail and hopefully these are again, I think will will prove to be improvements to the plan both for for resident experience and our operational experience.

520
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,353
But 1 of the things we wanted to point out is a is a change in a relocation of the bike storage rooms.

521
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:18,451
This is something that had a lot of discussion.

522
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:24,534
I know many of you will recall adequate bike storage, adequate placement for bike storage.

523
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:29,357
And so it's something that we, as we continue to progress the plans.

524
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:47,738
started to look at in greater detail, and we're able to find a way to move bike storage from interior of the garage, where it was on two levels, the first level and the second level of the garage, and move that outboard to have an exterior access along the center drive aisle between the two buildings.

525
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,180
So that's what's shown on the right.

526
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,663
Obviously, the approved plans on the left and the proposed plans on the right of the screen.

527
00:36:56,862 --> 00:37:10,386
The good news is not only are the bike rooms now accessible directly to the exterior, but we're also able to fit 15 or 18 more bikes, we believe, in this configuration.

528
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:18,388
So that was submitted, and there was actually a sheet in the architectural set with some blowups on these and detailed drawings of these bike rooms.

529
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:22,469
But I wanted to point that out as what we see is really an improvement to the plan.

530
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:35,489
Another couple, similarly, we had trash rooms for the residents and the retail space that were in board in the garage.

531
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:45,775
And something we have now are accomplishing here is the ability to move the trash rooms to the exterior, have an exterior access.

532
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:51,119
And in this case, a trash room that is more proximate to the retail space as well.

533
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:58,145
So again, operational efficiency, you know, trash is picked up sometimes two, three times a week.

534
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:07,973
Want to make sure we talked about during our hearing process, I recall, you know, how does that trash get from the corner of the garage and then to the outside of the building so it can be picked up?

535
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:13,037
Well, now we've got a direct door that goes directly from the trash room out to, out

536
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,513
easily stop and pick it up.

537
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:22,834
So this is showing the trash in the southern building.

538
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:44,723
The next slide is the same thing in the northern building where it was previously in an inside corner, and now we've moved it out to an exterior corner, which is actually good that it's along also this long lay-by access area that we all created during the first review and hearing process.

539
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,328
couple more to point out.

540
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:50,089
I mentioned retail.

541
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:55,271
Retail is the same size, roughly 2,000 or just actually exactly 2,000 square feet.

542
00:38:55,791 --> 00:39:00,632
In the previous plan, it was pulled off of the corner and there was some back of house on the building corner here.

543
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:08,235
The move to the trash room meant that we could also push the retail all the way to the corner of the building.

544
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:17,334
Which we feel is the right thing to do operationally to have it directly adjacent to trash, but also it activates this corner of the building.

545
00:39:17,374 --> 00:39:19,196
So this is the Southeast corner of the building.

546
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:23,179
If you go further plan north, that's where the, the courthouse is and.

547
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:42,495
Driving east to west on Misty Valley Parkway is actually a very prominent corner on the site, gets lots of eyeballs, and so we feel like this is the best way to set up a future commercial retail tenant with both eyeballs, signage, and visibility.

548
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,571
A couple more.

549
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:58,036
This is showing the two building lobbies, really the resident lobbies that are facing each other along the center access drive.

550
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:06,080
Prior, they were quite small, really just a quick entry and then obviously access to elevators.

551
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:30,023
What we've tried to do in looking at it again is expand those resident entries in the lobbies and make sure we had adequate space, not only for daily, for mail and, you know, mailboxes for the residents, but also package room, which of course in a multifamily community is always at a, space is at a premium and packages are obviously much more, are a big part of daily life.

552
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:35,027
And so we wanted to make sure that these lobbies can accommodate those kind of daily needs for our residents.

553
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:41,488
And it's also helped us to better delineate a lobby space from actual residential units.

554
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:49,971
So you can see, if you can see my cursor, this lobby in the southern building was really directly adjacent to a residential unit.

555
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:52,312
This A denotes a one-bedroom unit.

556
00:40:52,792 --> 00:41:02,176
And we've been able, you can see on the right, to now have a lobby space within a corridor with a door there before you get to the actual residential space.

557
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:10,060
A couple more quick things and I'll wrap up.

558
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,801
The changes to in a couple of different locations, but this is a good example of it.

559
00:41:18,382 --> 00:41:26,306
In the prior plan, we had some shallow unit depths, shallower than we would normally want to do.

560
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:35,230
And we're able to just slightly adjust the footprint of the parking within the building to allow for full depth residential units here.

561
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,872
And then of course, the trash and the bike rooms that I had mentioned before.

562
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:50,514
And so what that meant for the rest of the plan is just some slight shuffling and adjustment of where the residential units then fall within the building, especially on the ground floor.

563
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:59,516
And that's sort of what's shown here in this red box, you know, slight change to the footprint and how the units are configured on the very northern edge of the building.

564
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:04,157
So this is right up against that abutting sort of driveway.

565
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,978
And then further north is the wetland area.

566
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:15,137
Lastly, a couple things on amenities that are further up in the building.

567
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:21,939
You'll recall our courtyards on the fourth level of the building have amenity spaces that are adjoining them within the building.

568
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:28,040
Prior, they are shown in a corner here and in a rectangle here.

569
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,342
Those are single height spaces, obviously valuable space and wanting to engage and activate those courtyards.

570
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:41,165
And so a couple of things we looked at is one is making these actually double height space.

571
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:52,670
So this space in the red boxes below are actually not just on the fourth floor, but they also encompass space on the fifth floor as well.

572
00:42:53,170 --> 00:43:00,914
So we're able to have really meaningful space there and good visibility in and out of the courtyard.

573
00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:12,302
And we also just shifted the one in the southern building to be that much closer to the elevator core, so we didn't have to go buy a residential unit in order to get to the amenities.

574
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:25,752
So just, again, small things, but things that we felt were going to be beneficial to the daily life of our residents, and hopefully the daily life of, you know, everything, all the servicing and operational needs of the building as well.

575
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:33,633
So no changes to the courtyard, no changes to the fact that we've got storage space adjoining those courtyards.

576
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:37,977
That was all the things we talked about during our initial hearings.

577
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:41,159
And the last one is going up to the roof.

578
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,963
We have a rooftop amenity that we showed previously on the

579
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:49,149
Southeastern corner of the building, if you will.

580
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:57,195
So this is Mystic Valley Parkway looking south over the park and with views of the Boston skyline eventually.

581
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:16,252
One of the things, and this is, again, just to really try to maximize the resident experience, shifting that further to the west, so in the southwest corner, allows, you know, really a direct access from the elevators down to that rooftop amenity or the top-level amenity, if you will.

582
00:44:16,992 --> 00:44:20,493
So same size, shape generally, but just

583
00:44:27,243 --> 00:44:28,404
transportation of the elevators.

584
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:31,745
So, I'll leave it there.

585
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:49,634
Again, these are, that's, there was, I think, a little bit more detail, obviously, in our letter, but wanted to make sure we could sort of generally explain these types of changes, and A, why we think they're beneficial to the project, and B, of course, why, you know, they're seen under Chapter 40B as insubstantial.

586
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:56,077
So, I'll end there, and Mr. Chair, happy to take any questions, and of course, our team is here, too, if there are any specifics.

587
00:45:04,354 --> 00:45:05,094
Thank you very much.

588
00:45:05,215 --> 00:45:05,935
Mr. Alexander.

589
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:11,578
Um, so I just want to check with Dennis, uh, the board real quick.

590
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,939
We don't need to go to public comment for this.

591
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,300
Correct.

592
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:21,404
This is a review of the existing project for an insubstantial versus substantial change by the board only.

593
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:21,744
Correct.

594
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:31,369
That seems to be my interpretation.

595
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:33,911
Mike, go ahead.

596
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:52,495
Yeah, Jamie, whether or not we're required to, I don't see the harm in checking, as long as the comment is focused on what the board's actually deciding here, which is whether it's a substantial change, yeah.

597
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:54,895
Okay.

598
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:58,556
So first, we'll go through the standard process.

599
00:45:58,596 --> 00:46:00,417
Go to the board for questions to the applicant.

600
00:46:09,153 --> 00:46:10,934
I might go ahead.

601
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:12,635
Yeah, not a question, just a comment.

602
00:46:13,496 --> 00:46:15,157
Thank you for the update on the project.

603
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:17,338
Glad to see it's advancing.

604
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:23,002
I think all of the changes described seem very reasonable.

605
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:29,346
And yeah, I mean, when the board deliberates, I guess we'll talk about insubstantial.

606
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:35,830
But yeah, just in general, I think these are good changes that make the project more functional.

607
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,252
Great, thank you.

608
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:40,957
Thank you Mike.

609
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:44,761
Any other questions from the board or comments?

610
00:46:47,143 --> 00:46:55,371
Does the proposed plan alter any way the exterior of the previous proposal?

611
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,014
Or do they remain the same?

612
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:01,612
Yeah, thank you for the question.

613
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:06,660
And I'm sorry, I should have mentioned that before the know.

614
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:14,792
So, the, the exterior of the buildings and the design language, and many of the things that were adjusted as part of that.

615
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:41,546
year remain the same so the elevations are also provided in the architectural plan set and I think you know this is where there you know are there slight adjustments to where balconies are located on the facade there's there are but the design language and the ins and outs and the materiality and even the colors that we proposed are maintained in this

616
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:55,079
but also I think there are a couple of renderings on the cover page of the of the architectural plan set and that's probably the most helpful to see.

617
00:47:55,099 --> 00:48:04,865
Thank you.

618
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:07,567
Any other comments from the board?

619
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:22,183
Okay, just for scope and for understanding, since we are doing public comment, I do want to just read the section of the code that does apply to this.

620
00:48:22,283 --> 00:48:27,306
It's 760 CMR 5607, section four, substantial changes to the project.

621
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:31,068
I'm just going to read the examples that are considered substantial, just for reference.

622
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:39,413
So substantial changes, for examples, would be something along the lines of an increase of more than 10% in the height of the building.

623
00:48:40,158 --> 00:48:57,528
an increase of more than 10% in the number of units proposed, a reduction of the size of the site of more than 10% and a decrease in the number of units proposed in that same scale, a change in the building, garden apartment styles versus townhouse versus high-rise,

624
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,691
or a change of one form of housing tenure or another.

625
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:07,733
So again, in a 40B state market and with 25% affordable, there's no change to that scope.

626
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:13,015
Just so you're for an understanding of what we're looking at from the scale and impact perspective.

627
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:16,736
So we'll open it up for public comment.

628
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:22,358
If anybody from the public would like to make a comment, please raise your hand on Zoom, or you can send an email.

629
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:24,059
I apologize, Chris, go ahead.

630
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:48,008
I did, Mr. Chair, have a question just on the first proposed project change to the north building where it talks about the trash rooms have been relocated from interior corners within the garage of each building to exterior facing areas in the building.

631
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:52,091
Is there any more detail on that?

632
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:54,572
Do you have a, you know, is there any

633
00:49:57,682 --> 00:50:00,964
Any rendering that shows a little bit of that or an elevation?

634
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:06,488
Thanks for the question.

635
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:10,150
Let me reshare my screen real quick.

636
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,532
That'd be helpful.

637
00:50:21,157 --> 00:50:21,357
There.

638
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:30,022
So to answer your question, is your question like, how does this generally opt?

639
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:31,362
So this is the southern building.

640
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:32,563
I can move to the northern building.

641
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,744
It might be helpful.

642
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:39,827
So here's the northern building, where trash was in the northwest interior corner of the garage.

643
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:45,369
And it's been moved to the southeast corner of the building.

644
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:54,726
There are yet when there are elevations provided within the architectural plan set that show how this, you know, kind of looks and feels from the exterior.

645
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:14,393
Generally speaking, the way these work within the building is there's a trash chute or a trash room on each floor, you know, door access, and then you go in and there's a chute, and then the trash, you know, drops down into our collection bins within this trash room.

646
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:23,060
And then the double doors are there, so those bins can be rolled out on the, you know, morning of a trash pickup or, you know, the defined time of a trash pickup.

647
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,922
So I'm not sure if that answers your question,

648
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:30,472
and why we located it where we did.

649
00:51:32,232 --> 00:51:33,053
Yeah, thank you.

650
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:33,533
It does.

651
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:43,816
I'm curious as to how the collection would occur and whether or not that's visible.

652
00:51:44,316 --> 00:51:54,119
But in fact, I guess it's, in a way, looking at the proposed change, possibly less visible to the street side than the

653
00:51:57,758 --> 00:51:59,199
permanent way of last year.

654
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,700
Yeah.

655
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,141
So you know what I'm saying?

656
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:14,649
You know, what is the exterior of this, uh, appear to the passerby or, you know, someone that, um, everyone has to crash at the back usually.

657
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:15,809
Yeah.

658
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:16,149
Sorry.

659
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:23,194
So it's for the vast majority of time, it appears as a double doors, um, out to this access drive.

660
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:33,891
And then, like I said, whether it's twice or three times a week, you know, at a defined time, the bins can be rolled out through these doors, picked up, and then the bins are rolled right back in.

661
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:38,173
So that's generally how, you know, a multifamily sort of trash collection works.

662
00:52:38,953 --> 00:52:47,197
And quite frankly, one of the things that we had some discussion on during the original hearings was the fact that having trash inboard to the building

663
00:52:47,886 --> 00:52:53,950
would have to roll out through the vehicular entrance and then back, you know, somewhere off to the sidewalk here.

664
00:52:54,010 --> 00:53:02,776
And it's probably going to be more impactful to the daily life of residents and, you know, more work for operations staff and possibly more work for the trash pickup folks too.

665
00:53:02,856 --> 00:53:10,922
So that was kind of the reasoning behind, all right, let's get this outboard where, you know, it's not any more visible on a daily basis and it's actually just easier.

666
00:53:20,209 --> 00:53:20,749
Thank you, Chris.

667
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:21,830
Thank you, Mr. Alexander.

668
00:53:24,071 --> 00:53:26,372
So we will open a public comment.

669
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:33,416
And then from public, if you could raise your hand on Zoom, provide your name and address for the record, or email Dennis.

670
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:34,916
His email is on the chat.

671
00:53:35,497 --> 00:53:39,038
Again, dmcdougall.medford-ma.gov.

672
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,921
And Dennis, we haven't received any communications from the public prior to the meeting, correct?

673
00:53:46,082 --> 00:53:46,522
That is correct.

674
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,124
I don't see any hands raised on Zoom.

675
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:00,984
Do you have anything in email?

676
00:54:01,044 --> 00:54:13,328
No, I do not.

677
00:54:15,048 --> 00:54:15,448
Thank you.

678
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:19,510
I'll just close the public portion and enter deliberation.

679
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,931
Do we have a second?

680
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:25,071
Second.

681
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:27,332
Thank you, Jim.

682
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:27,612
Mike?

683
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:28,438
Aye.

684
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:29,839
Jim?

685
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,700
Aye.

686
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:31,861
Chris?

687
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:33,322
Aye.

688
00:54:34,043 --> 00:54:34,303
Mary?

689
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:35,164
Aye.

690
00:54:35,945 --> 00:54:36,665
And Jamie, aye.

691
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:40,328
Okay, we are in deliberation.

692
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:43,531
Again, I reviewed what is considered substantial.

693
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:55,461
Obviously, 10% change to the building in height, size, increase in units, reduction in units, or a change in form or type of housing.

694
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:56,682
Again, conversion from

695
00:54:57,615 --> 00:54:59,916
what we see here in garden style to townhomes or such.

696
00:54:59,936 --> 00:55:03,758
Go ahead, Mike.

697
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:12,361
Yeah, so I don't see any changes here that trigger the technical requirements that would be a substantial change.

698
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,203
And like I said earlier, I think the changes make the project better.

699
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:22,026
So I would be comfortable for the board to find that these are insubstantial changes.

700
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:25,207
Thank you, Mike.

701
00:55:26,736 --> 00:55:43,702
Uh, 1 thing I do want to add, we did not have, uh, we did get, uh, a review with our, uh, legal, uh, KP law as well as our 40B consultant, uh, Judy Barrett and both of those organizations, uh, did agree that there was no substantial changes documented in the request.

702
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,304
Uh, any other deliberation from the board?

703
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:09,823
Chair awaits a motion on the consideration of substantial versus insubstantial changes for 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway.

704
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:17,487
I motion to find these changes to the plans for 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway to be insubstantial.

705
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,068
I'll second that.

706
00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:21,909
Thank you.

707
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:23,290
Jim?

708
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:24,650
Aye.

709
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:25,851
Chris?

710
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:27,752
Aye.

711
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:28,792
Mary?

712
00:56:29,784 --> 00:56:31,485
Hi, Mike.

713
00:56:32,285 --> 00:56:34,086
Hi, and Jamie.

714
00:56:34,446 --> 00:56:34,486
Hi.

715
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:39,088
Thank you everybody for your time.

716
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:43,209
We have the decision finding here is that the changes are in substantial.

717
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:45,290
Um, do we for this?

718
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,431
We need a decision on that as well written up.

719
00:56:56,056 --> 00:57:00,321
David, you can check with the lawyers, but I think the recommendation is yes.

720
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:03,584
It's not like a full decision, but it would be a, oh, go ahead.

721
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:06,567
It looks like Attorney Grenier might have some feedback.

722
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:08,489
Go ahead.

723
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:09,150
Thank you very much.

724
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,261
Thank you, member and Mr. Chair.

725
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:24,265
Yes, typically this is documented in a simple letter where the board acknowledges, sorry, the insubstantial change, references the plans that were submitted with our letter.

726
00:57:25,205 --> 00:57:31,327
It's a one and a half pager, typically, and I'm happy to coordinate with you, Dennis.

727
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,088
We've got examples of this.

728
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:38,390
I'm sure Amy Quessel would have examples as well, but typically this is documented in a simple letter.

729
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:41,605
Excellent.

730
00:57:41,665 --> 00:57:42,146
Thank you very much.

731
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,448
It'd be great.

732
00:57:45,768 --> 00:57:46,289
Yes, please.

733
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:51,813
Well, the heads up Chris, I am actually out of the office tomorrow.

734
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:52,794
We'll be back in on Monday.

735
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:57,337
Okay.

736
00:57:57,837 --> 00:58:01,420
Um, we do not have any cases on the additional cases on the agenda.

737
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,522
Do we have any administrative updates?

738
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:03,782
Dennis?

739
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:09,647
I'm going to be straight up nothing to speak of right now.

740
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,569
You have a couple of violence for next month.

741
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,550
We should actually we're doing this.

742
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:18,972
Discuss the date for the next meeting.

743
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:22,153
The next meeting in November would be Thanksgiving.

744
00:58:22,273 --> 00:58:24,595
So, again, we sort of mentioned it last.

745
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,737
Eating, but, you know, whether we love to have dinner with.

746
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:38,833
Okay, so I know we talked about the potential moving it to the 21st.

747
00:58:40,914 --> 00:58:43,175
Or to the 5th.

748
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:51,319
I think there was a preference for the 5th when I correct based on.

749
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,782
Filing timing, and then also the consideration for the.

750
00:58:56,322 --> 00:59:00,364
December meeting that would likely get bumped forward into the 2nd, week of January.

751
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:07,234
Exactly, that was sort of the reason because that one would more likely be moved into January 2nd.

752
00:59:08,255 --> 00:59:09,836
The 5th is election day, by the way.

753
00:59:09,856 --> 00:59:15,279
5th of December, sorry.

754
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,643
5th of December, yeah, sorry, yeah.

755
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:24,025
We can do voting in the morning and the evening.

756
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:31,210
Just announcing up front, I can't make the 5th, so that doesn't necessarily mean choose a different date, but just want that to be known.

757
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:33,154
Okay, thank you Mike.

758
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:33,934
Chris?

759
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:47,257
I can put it out there for the other members who aren't here and then we can sort of put a pin on that one and if we can't, there's no meeting continued so we can just, you know, as long as everything is advertised right to the proper date, we'll find a better date.

760
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:47,757
Perfect.

761
00:59:48,057 --> 00:59:50,977
Well, we've got everybody here.

762
00:59:50,997 --> 00:59:51,558
I just want to check.

763
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,918
Jim, would the fifth work for you?

764
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:54,898
It works, yes.

765
00:59:55,798 --> 00:59:57,219
Chris, does the fifth work for you?

766
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:58,379
Yeah, it does.

767
00:59:58,579 --> 00:59:59,279
Sorry, I have the wrong

768
01:00:00,603 --> 01:00:00,843
1 month.

769
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:01,443
Yeah, no worries.

770
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:03,844
I've done that plenty of times.

771
01:00:04,404 --> 01:00:06,024
Uh, Mary, does the 5th work for you?

772
01:00:06,624 --> 01:00:07,585
Uh, December 5th.

773
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:08,845
Yes, correct.

774
01:00:09,525 --> 01:00:12,606
All right and 5th does work for me, so we can pencil that in tentatively.

775
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:16,887
Um, and we can follow up with, um, Andre to see if he's available.

776
01:00:20,847 --> 01:00:24,568
And just to the record, you had to actually tell us last meeting.

777
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:27,509
She wasn't going to make she actually be.

778
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:32,443
I just forgot because.

779
01:00:32,483 --> 01:00:33,003
Okay.

780
01:00:33,023 --> 01:00:43,029
The other thing we have is that we didn't.

781
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,932
Uh, still working on the meeting minutes from last meeting.

782
01:00:47,392 --> 01:00:49,914
Um, that was midterm, so things got a little sideways for her.

783
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:52,816
So, but I do, we did the last meeting.

784
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:53,716
We were going to talk.

785
01:00:53,876 --> 01:00:56,958
We didn't approve the August minutes because nobody had enough time, but.

786
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:59,735
We tabled it for this month.

787
01:01:03,256 --> 01:01:03,676
Okay.

788
01:01:04,216 --> 01:01:10,198
Does everybody have an opportunity to review minutes or do we need to bump that and add it to the agenda for next meeting?

789
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:18,520
I say next meeting, but if others have reviewed, that's fine.

790
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,801
I unfortunately didn't read them.

791
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:24,941
I assumed they were approved last meeting.

792
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:28,142
Yeah, you weren't there, so no worries.

793
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:33,859
Um, Dennis, why don't we, uh, that was August.

794
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:39,022
Yeah, why don't we bump that to a bunch of meeting minutes approval next meeting?

795
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:39,982
Yep.

796
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:46,927
And if you could resend out the August minutes when you send out the other minutes, that way we can review them all.

797
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:49,348
Perfect.

798
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,231
Okay, I'll motion to adjourn.

799
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:56,472
I'll second.

800
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:58,702
Roll call.

801
01:01:59,383 --> 01:01:59,583
Jim?

802
01:02:00,404 --> 01:02:00,524
Aye.

803
01:02:01,445 --> 01:02:01,646
Mike?

804
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:02,326
Aye.

805
01:02:03,108 --> 01:02:03,408
Chris?

806
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:04,850
Aye.

807
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:05,951
Mary?

808
01:02:06,652 --> 01:02:06,772
Aye.

809
01:02:07,754 --> 01:02:08,134
And Jamie?

810
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:08,475
Aye.

811
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:12,019
Thank you everyone for your time tonight and your patience.

812
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,141
Have a good evening.
