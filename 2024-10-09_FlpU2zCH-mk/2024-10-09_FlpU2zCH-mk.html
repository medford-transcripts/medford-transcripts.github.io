    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=0.109s">As</a>  importantly, thank you everybody else who's here because you all are the reason why we do the work that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=7.968s">This</a>  is a historic moment for Medford Public Schools, and it's one that we have to soak in and really take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=15.875s">When</a>  I ran for office in 2019, which is 100 dog years ago, it seemed like part of the reason I ran is because I would go to school committee meetings, and the hard questions about what do we need and don't have, those questions never were asked, and they certainly weren't answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=34.15s">That</a>  is one of the many reasons why I ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=37.132s">Once</a>  I got elected and I started on the school committee, we started having budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=41.635s">The</a>  first thing I said was, what is the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=43.636s">How</a>  does this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=44.376s">How</a>  do we know what we need versus how do we know how much we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=48.298s">There</a>  were a lot of blank stares in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=50.039s">There</a>  were a lot of people who were like, what do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=54.102s">I</a>  said, how do we know what we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=56.463s">does</a>  it just always magically match every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=59.764s">And</a>  everyone sort of said, yeah, it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=63.166s">And</a>  I said, okay, well, if you talk to the community, they talk a lot about what we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=67.488s">So</a>  this can't be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=70.889s">So</a>  from that moment on, I've been on a quest to be more intentional about describing the budget in terms of what we would need. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=79.933s">That</a>  year in the middle of the onset of COVID, we started simple and we just said to the department heads, what are three to five things you could do that would improve student outcomes? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=92.125s">How</a>  much did the list cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=95.348s">Anybody,</a>  any guesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=97.851s">You</a>  know, any guesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=102.566s">not</a>  that much, but $10 million, a cool $10 million without a lot of strategic thinking, without a lot of time to really think deeply about that question because they were also in the middle of shutting down school and trying to figure out this virtual learning thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=118.938s">So</a>  a cool $10 million just like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=122.661s">Ever</a>  since then, we have taken more strategic approaches to get to that same question, and it changes a little bit every year how we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=129.367s">But</a>  the answer is always about $10 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=132.73s">The</a>  answer of what we need and don't have is always significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=138.655s">And</a>  it's changed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=140.017s">So</a>  we aren't talking about needing Chromebooks for every student anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=143.159s">We</a>  were in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=144.981s">That's</a>  changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=146.081s">Now</a>  we're talking about we need money to replace those Chromebooks that we bought in 2020 because it's not an option to not have technology anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=154.505s">So</a>  as I think about this work that we're doing, I'm excited to let people be free to really think about what could improve student outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=166.789s">What</a>  do we need that we don't have? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=169.69s">And</a>  this moment is a huge start. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=174.912s">If</a>  you were paying attention this spring, you know that the budget was bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=179.115s">It</a>  was dire. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=181.116s">The</a>  MPS administration was asked to lay out sort of what would it take to meet the city's available allocation and they laid out a devastating list of cuts and we were still 2.7 million dollars <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=194.304s">away</a>  from that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=196.786s">So</a>  when you talk about 2.7 million more dollars, nothing is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=202.85s">Class</a>  size, athletics, extracurriculars, buses, the arts, the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=208.613s">2.7</a>  million dollars is a big, big number. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=211.375s">And</a>  that's in addition to all of the other cuts that they could lay out for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=217.336s">I'm</a>  super grateful that my fellow finance task force members voiced their unwavering support when I said, we can't live through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=226.359s">This</a>  is too deep for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=230.24s">And</a>  we were able to work with the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=234.801s">I'm</a>  grateful to every city department that ratcheted back what they wanted out of the budget so that <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=240.762s">the</a>  situation at Medford Public Schools could be a little less bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=244.064s">And</a>  that's what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=245.064s">It</a>  was less bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=246.885s">I'm</a>  also grateful for one-time funds because that all allowed us to do some things in a stopgap way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=254.488s">We</a>  were able to save two literacy interventionists, four department heads, three behavior specialists, one nurse, two elementary school teachers, and a facilities maintenance budget that was a little less anemic than in years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=267.034s">So</a>  that's what we did with one-time funds, but that's one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=270.917s">That</a>  means that all of those things are on the chopping block again next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=277.061s">There's</a>  no more one-time funds to fill this void. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=281.684s">So</a>  let's talk about November because that's actually a more fun thing to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=286.433s">We're</a>  going to do two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=287.754s">The</a>  first thing we're going to do is stabilize the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=290.416s">What</a>  does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=291.857s">We're</a>  going to stop the potential of that hole that we've created with one-time funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=299.801s">We're</a>  going to close that gap and we're going to close it for good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=303.503s">Those</a>  critical staff members I just talked about, we're going to put them in a position where they can continue to support our students the way that they need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=311.528s">The</a>  stabilizing money will also fund our technology replacement budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=315.251s">It's</a>  2024, and it's not an option to not have technology anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=320.416s">It</a>  will also allow us to restore an administrative assistant at the McGlynn School, where we have one administrative assistant managing two school buildings and supporting two principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=328.622s">It's</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=329.863s">And</a>  she's going to do it, and she's going to be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=332.566s">But</a>  that is a stopgap situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=335.808s">So</a>  we're looking forward to being able to do something to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=339.252s">And</a>  it will also this stabilization money will ensure that we never have to find out what that $2.7 million would actually look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=347.317s">So</a>  that's one thing we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=348.378s">We're</a>  going to stabilize the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=349.819s">We're</a>  going to stop doing this one time thing where we don't have enough to even get by. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=356.826s">yay</a>  but as importantly we're going to invest in the future so we're going to do more than just run in place we are going to do more and the list of possibilities is long and you probably all have your own list of what you think is possible or what you think <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=379.442s">would</a>  be useful and so I brought my list just to give you a flavor of what was I thinking about when I sat in those meetings and we arrived at these numbers where we were going to ask for the community to bring seven million more dollars to MPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=394.093s">So</a>  here's a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=395.895s">Our</a>  vocational students deserve access to the arts and AP classes and they shouldn't have to take Spanish or any other language online because the schedule is simply incompatible. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=405.842s">That</a>  is what happens today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=409.389s">Fixing</a>  it is a huge undertaking and it's gonna change the structure of the school day and the schedule for every single student at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=416.233s">So</a>  it's a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=418.574s">All</a>  of our students deserve more time for learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=421.475s">We</a>  have the shortest school day around and it's time for Medford to do more than the minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=429.979s">More</a>  students deserve access to transportation because two miles is too far to walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=439.184s">It</a>  doesn't matter how old you are, that's a long walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=443.348s">Our</a>  staff deserve investment in high quality professional development and support as they develop their craft as educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=450.976s">Our</a>  paras deserve a living and competitive wage and so do our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.004s">This</a>  is a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=456.924s">We've</a>  made a lot of progress for our paraprofessionals, but there's so much to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=462.467s">Our</a>  athletes, our extracurricular participants, they deserve the very best opportunities we can provide, and that starts with increasing our coaching and advisor stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=472.613s">They</a>  have not been addressed in a decade or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=476.835s">They</a>  are fractional compared to the time that our advisors and our coaches put into our students, and we need to do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=486.102s">Our</a>  buildings deserve maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=489.952s">It's</a>  the most boring thing, but it's so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=493.835s">The</a>  project to replace the HVAC system at McGlynn and Andrews is $20 million alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=499.938s">$20</a>  million. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=501.279s">So</a>  that project is ongoing, but $20 million will be spent on that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=507.924s">And</a>  that's just so that those buildings can have acceptable HVAC systems, and it's not too hot to learn in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=518.67s">just</a>  this morning I got a list of immediate repair needs that are happening that are happening across the district as we prepare for the start of school it was a cool half million dollars right there so the need across the school our buildings are all new but they're aging our buildings are new but they're 20 years old and that means their their systems are at the end of life so we have to be prepared to do something different than we've done all along <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=543.625s">we</a>  have to maintain what we have so we don't have to do this again because I think that's critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=550.068s">Certainly</a>  the Medford High School project is a bit of a separate matter than what we're talking about tonight if anyone wants to have if anyone has questions about the Medford High building project please let me know I'm happy to answer them after this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=562.013s">So</a>  the list goes on that's my list I've probably already spent seven million dollars so I'll stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=568.376s">And</a>  I know we all have a list, and I think that's really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=573.159s">So</a>  when we do this in November, the next thing that happens is we start talking about now what? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=580.324s">What</a>  is the plan, and how are we going to best use this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=583.546s">And</a>  I want to see all of you at that table. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=585.867s">That's</a>  a very public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=587.669s">It</a>  happens on the floor, out in the open, in the light of day, so that we can hear from people about what those priorities are and what they think is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FlpU2zCH-mk&t=595.934s">But</a>  first, we have to get there.</p>
