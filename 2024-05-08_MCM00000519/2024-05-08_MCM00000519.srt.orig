1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:00,531
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:12,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the March 21st, 2024 meeting of the Charter Study Committee, Article VI Subcommittee, which is on financial procedures.

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:20,038
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our first subcommittee meeting, and we have one other member, Jean, who was unable to join us.

4
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first item on the agenda is regarding

5
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:35,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought we would review the budget discussion because we did discuss with the whole committee some of these matters at the March 7th meeting.

6
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:44,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We did discuss the city council budget amendment, but it's been re-raised.

7
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:49,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just throwing that out and we can open the discussion with that.

8
00:00:51,816 --> 00:01:07,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I went looking for the budget amendment, and I found something, and I put it in our drive, but it didn't look like what the call-in center had up on the screen last week.

9
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:16,402
[SPEAKER_01]: What the call-in center had up on the screen, the heading said, I think, charter amendment,

10
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:23,271
[SPEAKER_01]: but it more resembled the budget ordinance that they had been working on.

11
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a little confused.

12
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:26,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

13
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:38,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So there has been some confusion because there is the charter amendment that was proposed and then there's also this ordinance which they're working on or they've been working on for a while with the administration.

14
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:42,635
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually passed its first reading on Tuesday night.

15
00:01:44,355 --> 00:02:02,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next step in that, for anybody who's going to be watching later, is that the second reading, I guess, is what goes into an advertisement in whatever newspaper where the Somerville Journal, I guess, is what they have.

16
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Somerville Journal, Medford, whatever it calls itself.

17
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it comes back to the council for its third reading to go in effect.

18
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:18,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So my estimation would be that it will probably come back for its third reading.

19
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:27,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the council meets not April 2nd, but April 9th and probably the 23rd.

20
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't know that.

21
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back one of those.

22
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:34,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that's standard for ordinances, but yeah, it is.

23
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,930
[SPEAKER_02]: really for them to go through that many?

24
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,912
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a first reading and then the second reading.

25
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Maury can probably attest to this too.

26
00:02:46,173 --> 00:03:02,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Second reading is it goes into some newspaper or something, and then it goes back to the council floor for a third reading after that, and then they accept it.

27
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:03,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I think it's probably,

28
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,826
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 days for it to go.

29
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:07,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

30
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's not really.

31
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that doesn't really pertain to us.

32
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:29,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, definitely some of the issues I think that ordinance addresses like the timeline we would be looking at the, the amendment, the really the main content of the amendment that is at issue is.

33
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:37,084
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability for the city council to move money in the budget.

34
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:45,866
[SPEAKER_02]: We discussed it at the March 7th meeting, and we voted unanimously to not put that into our draft charter.

35
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:50,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a member who wants to re-raise it.

36
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:55,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we should probably wait for her to hear what she has to say.

37
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to talk to the subcommittee about it because

38
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:13,028
[SPEAKER_02]: If we've been charged with looking at Article 6, the decision for us is do we investigate it because Gene did offer to do research and whatnot.

39
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:26,461
[SPEAKER_02]: But, or my feeling is that even if our subcommittee feels like we want it, that that's a good idea, I feel like we need to go back to the committee, the whole committee first, because the whole committee voted no on it.

40
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:39,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So my feeling is we can't really raise it, we can't open it up again without having the whole committee say, yeah, sure, let's learn more about it.

41
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:44,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to just see how you all felt about it because Gene brought it to our subcommittee.

42
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:54,074
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I for one would like to stand behind that vote that we talked, you know, I mean, that's my feeling.

43
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what the city council is trying to do.

44
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it's healthy, and it's the right way to move.

45
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:09,646
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get into all kinds of jockeying around.

46
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:17,190
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up with a stalemate, that we want this, no, we want that, and we feel as though we can do this.

47
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there has to be one final answer to all of this stuff.

48
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:28,297
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it's laid out, and the way it's laid out, I think, in the majority of cities and towns in the Commonwealth, is the mayor

49
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:38,615
[SPEAKER_00]: or the city council or select men or whatever form type of government you have, the final say goes with the mayor on the budget.

50
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:52,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in mayor council governments, there is no city in Massachusetts that allows the city council this power other than Boston, and it's very new in Boston.

51
00:05:52,439 --> 00:06:02,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and as we talked about in chapter 44, section 32, specifically says the city council can't do this.

52
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

53
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:13,661
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to get a special act charter and it's not unheard of that the state might say, well, you know, it for this special act will allow it.

54
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:33,827
[SPEAKER_02]: But besides all the reasons you just mentioned, Maury, putting something in the charter that is actually state, that state law states is not allowed to me is also a really good reason not to do it.

55
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:49,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think my feeling is, you know, we, we had a pretty good discussion about it, you know, with the committee of the whole couple of weeks ago, we had the Collins Center there, you know, giving us some guidance.

56
00:06:50,563 --> 00:07:04,770
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I know that I have said, you know, regarding other things that may not be in the charter, you know, that I would like to see in the charter, other various topics I've said, you know, well, just because it's not in the charter doesn't mean that it can't be, why can't we be trendsetters?

57
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:13,213
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think some of the things that I've brought up are probably not already governed by state law.

58
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:26,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I think going to what you said and the fact that no other community does this and it is governed by state law, then,

59
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:40,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And the call-in center doesn't seem to recommend it, then I think we should, as Maury said, stand behind the vote that we took.

60
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:45,160
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, we did have a member bring it up again.

61
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,004
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to, in the,

62
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:54,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Progression of going from where we are now to.

63
00:07:55,692 --> 00:08:00,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to the ballot, it has to go through the city council.

64
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:03,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So, to be able to say.

65
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:07,656
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we gave it a good hard 1.

66
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:11,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Deliberation research, et cetera.

67
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:11,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And.

68
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:27,113
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is what we arrived at and back up and have all of that research backed up with yet another committee of the whole vote, which I think will probably turn out the same way.

69
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:32,075
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know.

70
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:35,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's a bit of a, you know, conundrum.

71
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:41,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can go back to the city council and say, we took a deep dive into it and, you know.

72
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:42,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

73
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that deep dive is going to look like, and I think that's one thing Jean is going to have to tell us.

74
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:51,965
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of research did she have in mind?

75
00:08:52,886 --> 00:09:06,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she's going to have to go look at other states to see if, or she could look at Boston, or look at other states because it's not done in Massachusetts, so you couldn't really

76
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:14,276
[SPEAKER_02]: find out or look at the federal, you know, the states, you know, federal or state or state government.

77
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:21,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like we're maybe a little divided on whether we should reopen this.

78
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:32,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I think, what I'm going to propose is that we ask Jean what she has in mind in terms of specifically where she wants to research.

79
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:43,565
[SPEAKER_02]: But before she does that, I do think we need to ask the whole committee, since the whole committee voted no, I think the committee has to say yes or no to reopening it.

80
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you guys feel about that.

81
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:49,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Eunice.

82
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I would go along with that.

83
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:52,131
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

84
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Maury?

85
00:09:54,984 --> 00:09:56,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd definitely go along with that.

86
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:57,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know that.

87
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,406
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I think generally pretty good.

88
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,067
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing this for a while.

89
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:19,756
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the point that we just talked about, I get a kick out of the city council because you know, as you well know, we asked for a home rule petition to get the charter revision started and they all now get the signatures, you know, but they turn around and get

90
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:26,279
[SPEAKER_00]: their little amendments that they want to make, that should, to me, you want to make these amendments?

91
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in front of the voters, you know?

92
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:33,784
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't pick and choose any longer, and that's what they're doing here.

93
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:46,931
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as, I just have to say that about that, because it irks me so much when I think about, you know, we didn't have to go through all of this that we got through just to get to a simple charter review, not saying anything's going to even change.

94
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:47,512
[SPEAKER_00]: But

95
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:53,856
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they just go ahead and want to move things around.

96
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:55,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very frustrating.

97
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,000
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as, yeah, put it back in front of the whole committee.

98
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:05,906
[SPEAKER_00]: We did take a vote, you know, if it's, you know, a 10 to 1 or 11 to 1, you know, Jean's done a tremendous amount of work.

99
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:07,447
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a great head on her shoulder.

100
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:11,710
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, sometimes, you know, hey, not everything we want to see happens, happens.

101
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,973
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why we're a committee of 12 people, you know, to

102
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:16,918
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward.

103
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:20,639
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I say definitely put it in front of the whole committee.

104
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

105
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:27,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, um, I, I mean, our, our next full committee meeting is the first Thursday in April.

106
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we are going to meet before that, but if we do, we can talk to Gene about it then.

107
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:45,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if we don't, um, I think we'll just, uh, like I said, I don't feel like we can go ahead and pursue this without asking the committee since the committee did vote on it.

108
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:47,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

109
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:49,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.

110
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:49,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

111
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:49,978
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

112
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our meeting schedule for the next, you know, between now and the 4th.

113
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a bit tight because we also have another subcommittee meeting next week as well on Wednesday night.

114
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Easter weekend and everything, you know, a lot of people may have other things going on.

115
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:12,483
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the time we regroup, it's Monday or Tuesday and then we're together on Thursday.

116
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:12,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

117
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, so that sounds like a good plan for that particular issue.

118
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:25,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, just looking at, so this is our article six.

119
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the thing that we have to sort of decide is how are we going to tackle it?

120
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:33,894
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, we're going to review, I mean, just looking at this,

121
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:44,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just lays out in state law the submission of city budget to city council procedure for approval, rejection, or alteration.

122
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:49,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And it pretty much lays out what happens in Medford and pretty much every other city in the state.

123
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this we can just review on our own.

124
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:55,006
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just good to know.

125
00:12:57,327 --> 00:13:02,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we want to think about whatever we put in the charter, we want to make sure that it

126
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:08,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to probably make sure that it doesn't contradict anything in this, right?

127
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:09,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

128
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:15,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And allowing the city council to move money would contradict this.

129
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:17,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it say it?

130
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,478
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't originate appropriations.

131
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,939
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't increase the full amount of the budget.

132
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: They can reduce appropriations, but they can't increase them, basically.

133
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the sort of the basic rules.

134
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:50,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of, you know, what a lot of other subcommittees have done is kind of use these drafts and create a draft of the charter.

135
00:13:51,026 --> 00:14:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ultimately, when we get that draft finished, the Collins Center will look at it and hopefully tell us if there's anything in it that's like, you know, could cause problems or et cetera.

136
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,615
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a complex article.

137
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, as a subcommittee, decide.

138
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,259
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to kind of recommend.

139
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:23,310
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make decisions and make recommendations on kind of the main issues, and then we're going to let the call-in center tell the call-in center, okay, here's what we decided, and then let them draft it.

140
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:25,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do that.

141
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:40,629
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I took out of, I didn't have time to go, go back and listen to that section of the meeting, but I did read the, I have the minutes in front of me here.

142
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, where is it?

143
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Colin center advises not being too specific about the budget process and the charter.

144
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:53,592
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an interesting highlight.

145
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:01,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would have applied to probably most sections of the charter too.

146
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,540
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead.

147
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,061
[SPEAKER_01]: There were that specific in that one.

148
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:18,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm a little bit perplexed about some of the things that I'm looking at that could go in the charter that other communities have done and other thoughts that I have.

149
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:28,456
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how does, what's the difference between the charter and this ordinance that they drafted?

150
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:32,760
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinance, you know, I'll give them credit for is pretty good.

151
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:47,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And it certainly, you know, seems to address a lot of the timeline and, you know, requests and things, you know, not just during budget season, but, you know, throughout the year,

152
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:54,586
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep, you know, to be, for them to be aware of the financial health of the city.

153
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:58,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that makes it easier getting to budget season.

154
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.

155
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So an ordinance is a piece of legislation.

156
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:07,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the constitution and laws.

157
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,551
[SPEAKER_02]: The charter is the constitution, the ordinance is the laws.

158
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:18,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So an ordinance can be changed, you know, by the legislative body, the charter,

159
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,351
[SPEAKER_02]: can't be changed so easily.

160
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:27,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And ordinances are like policy, they can go, they tend to go into more detail.

161
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:37,236
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we've seen, and of course, Medford doesn't have this section in its charter now, we're just going by state law.

162
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:47,379
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we have seen is that we can, you know, there can be things in the charter that will lay out a timeline, right?

163
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:51,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

164
00:16:51,487 --> 00:17:03,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the call-in center said maybe not get too detailed, maybe they were talking about like a level of detail that the ordinance goes into wouldn't necessarily be appropriate for the charter.

165
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's...

166
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:27,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we can look at that ordinance and use it as a guide, or we can just say, you know, our process is our process, and we are going to research what a reasonable timeline is and make our own decisions and recommend that.

167
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:36,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's a lot of ways we can go about this.

168
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can see just from this, this first section is pretty standard.

169
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:48,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty standard.

170
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:50,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we need to spend a lot of time on that.

171
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:51,324
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.

172
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:55,706
[SPEAKER_00]: We should take a look at the ones that are really simple here, saying, OK, we need a little tweak here.

173
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,046
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great the way it's written.

174
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:00,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those off our plate and then go with the longer ones.

175
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:05,690
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just differently phrased.

176
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this one looks good to me.

177
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:20,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference between this one and Pittsfield is that this one says the last day of June and it doesn't say June 30th.

178
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just say that.

179
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just put that in black.

180
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving right along.

181
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,522
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost done.

182
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:28,263
[SPEAKER_02]: We got six what?

183
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Finished in five minutes.

184
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this one annual budget meeting establishes the timeframe for budget meetings and any required participants.

185
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:47,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like, unless I'm mystic and I could have made mistakes when I put the document together, Weymouth doesn't have this.

186
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:53,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not like a requirement, but I think, you know, I don't know, we'll have to discuss.

187
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:55,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a good idea to have an annual budget meeting?

188
00:18:56,204 --> 00:19:02,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the Cotton Center said, this is more, it's not really about next year's budget, right?

189
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:05,178
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular meeting.

190
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:16,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think what they said, um, uh, any January budget meetings would be a discussion of how the current year's finances are going and projections.

191
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:19,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's, you know, you still have a half a year left.

192
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:23,764
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you, and there's also in terms of.

193
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,825
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, money coming in, they have the.

194
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:41,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Chapter 90 funds, I think it is, different sources of revenue from the state that they're not fully aware of until sometime in the middle of the spring.

195
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they start hashing things out.

196
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:54,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So this particular meeting that would be before the process of actually, it would basically be sort of like, let's all get together, review,

197
00:19:57,007 --> 00:20:03,089
[SPEAKER_02]: the current financial situation in the city and look at forecasts.

198
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:08,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sort of just like getting everybody together to talk about that.

199
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, what this does is it helps the communication between the branches of government.

200
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:18,332
[SPEAKER_00]: It's- That's what I like about it.

201
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:19,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

202
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we agree that we think it's a good idea to put this in?

203
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:36,868
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it, and I think 60 or even 75 days before, because as Eunice just said, there's certain monies and so forth that come in later that help them establish, really pull the strings tighter on the budget.

204
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:45,590
[SPEAKER_00]: But a little feel-good session, as you all say at NOVA, that they all can sit down at the table and let's not be yelling and screaming and pointing fingers.

205
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,211
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our situation.

206
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,231
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're up against.

207
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,692
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we did good this year.

208
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:51,712
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we did bad.

209
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:53,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

210
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:55,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

211
00:20:56,815 --> 00:21:09,224
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the city council and the school committee, I think anywhere that we can add in there that gets them collaborating, I think is a win.

212
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:18,931
[SPEAKER_01]: After some of the things that I think have gone on the past couple of years, distinctly remembering

213
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:29,315
[SPEAKER_01]: After some of the violence at the high school over the last, you know, 18 months, you know, counselor Scott Pelly saying if we had only known.

214
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:31,436
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have helped more.

215
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:40,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and maybe allocated some more money for whatever it was that might have stemmed the tide.

216
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anything that we can put in the charter anywhere.

217
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,652
[SPEAKER_01]: gets them, gets the bodies, the three bodies collaborating, I think is a win.

218
00:21:51,673 --> 00:22:04,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we could look at some other cities to see what they say for this, but interestingly we have Melrose, which doesn't, it just says the mayor shall call a joint meeting before the commencement of the budget process.

219
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:05,318
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't

220
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,162
[SPEAKER_02]: have a timeline or anything, it just says before.

221
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:20,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Pittsfield says at least 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year, which I'm trying to figure that out because isn't the fiscal year July 1st?

222
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:29,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking somewhere in April, because May would be 60 days before the beginning.

223
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:31,433
[SPEAKER_00]: So May 1st would be 60 days.

224
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:34,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking a meeting in March or April.

225
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:51,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably, this is, I mean, the state law, I mean, if we looked at the state law, the budget, you know, I mean, people in Medford want to talk about wanting to move the budget process earlier, but I believe it's pretty much June,

226
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:55,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometime in June that it's due, right?

227
00:22:55,506 --> 00:23:03,215
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this year, the budget that was submitted this year was the earliest budget and I think in about 30 years that was submitted, you know?

228
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:04,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

229
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:14,307
[SPEAKER_00]: The old way of doing things was at the 11th hour, come up with the budget and then hold everybody at gunpoint to approve it or the city would be in a shutdown.

230
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So 60 days puts it at what, May 1st, we said?

231
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:20,848
[SPEAKER_00]: May 1st.

232
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:33,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is probably later than, you know, that would be, I mean, it's reasonable if you consider that the budget should be done by the end of June.

233
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:40,232
[SPEAKER_02]: But doing what Melrose does leaves it sort of open.

234
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It could just be before.

235
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:43,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Or.

236
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:50,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Should it be like, what's 90 days would put it at April, beginning of April?

237
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:53,311
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?

238
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a timeline, because that holds their feet to the fire.

239
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:59,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, they can all say, oh, we don't need a meeting.

240
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,117
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all talked and all that.

241
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:03,338
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, you're doing something.

242
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:04,959
[SPEAKER_00]: And give them a window.

243
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:13,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 90 and 60 days, a meeting must be held between the mayor must call for a meeting between the city council, school committee, and the mayor's office.

244
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:17,210
[SPEAKER_00]: in preparation for the upcoming budget.

245
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:21,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think 90 days?

246
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:23,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, should we say at least?

247
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:26,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give them a window between 90 and 60.

248
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:33,449
[SPEAKER_00]: No earlier than 90 days, no later than 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year.

249
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:33,609
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

250
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:34,849
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?

251
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,210
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm saying it incorrectly.

252
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,551
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so no.

253
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:44,735
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if we actually put actual dates on that, then that would have to be somewhere between April 1 and May 1.

254
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:46,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

255
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,153
[SPEAKER_00]: May 1st puts you at 60 days out.

256
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:57,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess saying at least a certain amount basically just gives a deadline.

257
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that it can happen earlier, right?

258
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:01,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

259
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:03,205
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can't happen after.

260
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:11,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we need to put the window or should we just say, just give them the deadline?

261
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:16,203
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would like to see is this going in a different tactic.

262
00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:18,344
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, Melva, could you make that a little bit bigger?

263
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:20,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

264
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:22,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us are blind as bats.

265
00:25:24,628 --> 00:25:30,692
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would like to actually see, fiscal year, let me talk this out for a minute.

266
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:33,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiscal year starts July 1.

267
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:42,680
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would actually like to see would be a meeting between the bodies somewhere in January or February.

268
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:44,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Uhhh...

269
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:52,364
[SPEAKER_01]: after, say, January 15th, maybe, because that would give you a look at the finances.

270
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:58,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get what the Collins Center is saying about the earlier makes things difficult.

271
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:02,527
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got July, August, September, October, November, December.

272
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:04,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the first six months out of the year.

273
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:14,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the school side, you've got September, October, November, December, four months where the students have been in the classroom.

274
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:40,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you did it, let's say after January 15th, and I think we'd need to get some input from the finance director, is how long does it take him to wrap up December to have numbers, to have some sort of a,

275
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:50,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Overview of what the budget was from July 1 to December 31st, or if we moved it to.

276
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:53,534
[SPEAKER_01]: February after February 15th, maybe after.

277
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:56,795
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, winter break.

278
00:26:58,754 --> 00:27:07,338
[SPEAKER_01]: then you'd have six or seven months and they'd be able to say, this is what we have spent thus far.

279
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:23,925
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on track to stay within the budget or we're spending way less or way more or we're okay for this year, but I think for next year, we're going to need a higher budget of X for Y.

280
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would help.

281
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would it help?

282
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:34,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you have a point.

283
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:36,257
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor makes the budget.

284
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:40,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mayor has to hear from all the departments, right?

285
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:43,193
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that.

286
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:51,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess my feeling is if we're going to use this language to review the financial condition of the city, that could maybe be done in January.

287
00:27:51,836 --> 00:28:02,599
[SPEAKER_02]: But revenue and expenditure forecasts and other relevant information in order to develop a coordinated budget, I don't think that that would be available in January.

288
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:07,327
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's enough time myself.

289
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could happen in January.

290
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't be this purpose.

291
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:13,051
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

292
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:16,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I see your point.

293
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:23,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we talked to me, if we were going to do one for this purpose, we need to make it later.

294
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,402
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we talked about doing one in January, it would maybe be another section.

295
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:30,865
[SPEAKER_02]: for a different purpose.

296
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:42,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But if Article 6 is about financial procedures, I feel like what we would be talking about in January is just informational.

297
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:49,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't really be about creating the following year's budget.

298
00:28:50,599 --> 00:29:13,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think then maybe what we can do and what I would actually like to see both in the legislative and executive and school committee sections of the charter, I would like to see the three bodies collaborating a couple of times a year.

299
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:19,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one of them would be the budget meeting, which would come maybe in March or April.

300
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:25,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another, and that would go into Article 6.

301
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another meeting, at least one more at some point in the year that would just be a, here's how things are going.

302
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:44,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the kinds of things, maybe a portion of the meeting, a top level of the budget,

303
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:52,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our security cameras are coming to the end of their lifespan.

304
00:29:52,550 --> 00:30:01,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to need to do something with those next fiscal year, bigger things.

305
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:06,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just a regular, here's how things are going.

306
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:10,196
[SPEAKER_01]: That would then go in Articles 2, 3, and 4.

307
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:18,600
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying that there should be a requirement that all the bodies have to meet?

308
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,980
Yeah.

309
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,302
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like we have to put a purpose in.

310
00:30:27,962 --> 00:30:28,702
[SPEAKER_01]: State of the city?

311
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:30,042
[SPEAKER_01]: State of the school committee?

312
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:35,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

313
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:43,668
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about the school committee, the city council has no relationship with the school committee, other than approving the budget.

314
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:44,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

315
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,609
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct, but.

316
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:54,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I, for 1 after having watched a whole lot of stuff.

317
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Would like to see the bodies collaborate more for the.

318
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:03,813
[SPEAKER_01]: good of the entire city and the good of the students.

319
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:13,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be something that- I just don't know what the city council could do about any information that they receive.

320
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:30,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, part of the reason that the school committee issues come up at the city council is because the city council has public meetings and some people go there, but the city council doesn't really have power to address those issues.

321
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:37,520
[SPEAKER_02]: they could maybe put some kind of pressure on, you know, and make statements about it.

322
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of the actual working of the government, what would the city council be able to do about any of those issues?

323
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:54,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think hearing them and, you know, some of them can be addressed with more money than,

324
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:58,371
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're the ones that allocate the.

325
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:02,093
[SPEAKER_01]: The money, you know, or they're the ones that could.

326
00:32:05,815 --> 00:32:08,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've just heard time and time again.

327
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:13,839
[SPEAKER_01]: That if the city council knew that X was going on.

328
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:17,840
[SPEAKER_01]: In the schools that perhaps they could have.

329
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Helped perhaps they could have yeah.

330
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering what that means.

331
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:35,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if they knew about, you know, some of the issues that were happening in the schools with the fights, what would they have been able to, like, what could they have done?

332
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:37,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that means.

333
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I don't know if there's anything that we could put in the charter that would

334
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:46,946
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that would address that.

335
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:48,407
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

336
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:59,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, I mean, in terms of the, what we know that the city council has power over in terms of relating to the schools is the budget, because they vote on the budget.

337
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:04,192
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't appropriate, they can't create appropriations.

338
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:13,121
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, so we are, we are talking about right now, an annual meeting of the three bodies.

339
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:18,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is hopefully going to make it through at least in this section.

340
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the other sections, we can talk about it more, we can look into that more.

341
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:30,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Because collaboration is definitely it's one of the issues that we've heard people say they want to, you know, that they want to see.

342
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So the timeline

343
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury's suggesting the window.

344
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:47,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to create the window or we just want to create the deadline?

345
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with Maury.

346
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:53,511
[SPEAKER_01]: The window holds their feet to the fire more.

347
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:58,213
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them a little flexibility too.

348
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:02,135
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way, you could say the deadline gives them more flexibility because- Yeah.

349
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:09,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with the deadline, they have to do it no later than this date, but they can do it any time before that.

350
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the window, they have to do it within that window, right?

351
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,631
[SPEAKER_02]: See what I'm saying?

352
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:18,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

353
00:34:19,252 --> 00:34:22,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the charter says they have to have the meeting, they have to have the meeting.

354
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:26,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we say at least X days, that's the deadline.

355
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:28,298
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do it any time before that.

356
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,980
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's, so.

357
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, putting the window saying no earlier than this time.

358
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:45,127
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the reason I put that in there, I thought of that, was to eliminate what you said earlier.

359
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:52,814
[SPEAKER_00]: What good is a meeting in January or February when you're only six months into the program and you don't know what's coming up?

360
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:53,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

361
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:58,638
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just where you're three quarters of the way through it if you've got a pretty good feel for what's in front of you.

362
00:34:59,339 --> 00:34:59,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

363
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an argument for putting that, I think.

364
00:35:04,922 --> 00:35:08,123
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would make it somewhere between April 1st and May 1st.

365
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:09,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And May 1st, yeah.

366
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:14,025
[SPEAKER_02]: If we picked 90, let's see, June 1st would be.

367
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,846
[SPEAKER_00]: You go 75 days if you wanted.

368
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:19,687
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be April 1st.

369
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:26,729
[SPEAKER_00]: April 1st to May, between April 1st and May 1st, they have to hold that meeting.

370
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:28,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

371
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:31,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to make it so that they can hold it in March if they want to?

372
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:33,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Mid-March, is that?

373
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't need, you know, again, probably any of these, we probably, once we say what we think would be good, we probably have to talk to the financial office about all of it.

374
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And hear from them.

375
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say the same.

376
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:58,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we could sit here, you know, till the cows come home, you know, debating a window or timeframe or earlier or later, but

377
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:16,573
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to what the call-in center said, given the streams that come through and things, when are they going to have enough information to make the meeting valuable?

378
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:22,937
[SPEAKER_02]: This basically says they can't do it before April 1st and they can't do it after May 1st?

379
00:36:23,937 --> 00:36:24,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

380
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:28,640
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in that four-week window, that 30-day window.

381
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,341
[SPEAKER_01]: March 15th to May 15th?

382
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:30,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

383
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:34,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the May 1st is a good no later than.

384
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:59,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from what I gather from what the budget process is looking like now that we're kind of just about up against it, watching the school committee meeting the other night.

385
00:37:00,357 --> 00:37:03,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the mayor said that they're having their 1st.

386
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Budget meeting coming up.

387
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:08,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was my.

388
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the first week of April.

389
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:20,506
[SPEAKER_01]: The second, third of April, first week of somewhere around the first week of April, I think, because then they're having a full committee meeting, I think Monday, April 8th.

390
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:23,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think their first budget meeting is just prior to that.

391
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:30,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the way that the city council seems to be arranging their budget timeline going.

392
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:33,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it hasn't passed yet, the new ordinance.

393
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:47,958
[SPEAKER_01]: They already crafted their budget priorities that are going to the mayor actually by tomorrow.

394
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:57,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Then budget meetings with the department heads are going to be held between April 15th and May 15th.

395
00:37:57,105 --> 00:38:01,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I think between April 1st,

396
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:13,021
[SPEAKER_01]: and May 1st or May 15th, maybe?

397
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:19,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we have April 1st and May 1st.

398
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:28,155
[SPEAKER_02]: For this particular meeting, I think no later than 60 days is probably good for this particular meeting.

399
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:38,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, as you say, Eunice, the budget process is kind of starting up already in mid-April.

400
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:39,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

401
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:40,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

402
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically starting next week.

403
00:38:43,964 --> 00:38:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

404
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:46,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wouldn't want to do this after May 1st.

405
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:54,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless we want to push it back to 75 days and make it no later than April 15th.

406
00:38:56,893 --> 00:39:01,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is, do I have a copy of the ordinance here that they're?

407
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:09,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what do you think, Maury, about April 15th, making it no later than April 15th?

408
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:15,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to?

409
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:23,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what if there was some year that things were just sort of happening so that it was harder to do it earlier, right?

410
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:28,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's why I feel like 60 days is more reasonable.

411
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you think?

412
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:35,604
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 days since May 1st, right?

413
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:36,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

414
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I think within that timeframe, no later than that, they should have a meeting.

415
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:54,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether we want to put a timeline of when they should accomplish this meeting, do they want to go 120 days before and give them another month and no later than 60 days?

416
00:39:54,994 --> 00:40:02,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives them plenty of time to get together, plus they have a pretty good feel of the condition financially the city is in.

417
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:27,643
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so right now we have no earlier than 90 days before and no later than, no earlier than 90 days and, let's see, and no later than 60 days, wait, before the beginning of the fiscal year, right?

418
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:31,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, yep.

419
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:38,210
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor shall call a joint meeting of the city council and school committee before the commencement of the budget.

420
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an annual meeting that's before the commencement of the budget process.

421
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have it April 1st and they want to start in March, what do you think?

422
00:40:58,823 --> 00:40:59,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

423
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:01,404
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go March, April, May.

424
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:03,564
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go change it to 120 days.

425
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:06,425
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

426
00:41:06,445 --> 00:41:08,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you agree?

427
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:14,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we go no later than 60, prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, the mayor?

428
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:19,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the beginning.

429
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:19,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

430
00:41:19,648 --> 00:41:23,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that out and go prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.

431
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Or prior to the beginning.

432
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:27,674
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fiscal year.

433
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:29,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can say prior to instead of before.

434
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:33,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the beginning.

435
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:35,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Something doesn't sound right in there.

436
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe beginning before the fiscal year or something.

437
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:40,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

438
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:45,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the beginning of the fiscal year just means July 1st, right?

439
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:47,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let it go right there.

440
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:47,864
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks fine.

441
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:53,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So no earlier than 120 days and no later than 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year.

442
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: If we put a comma, that will help people too.

443
00:41:58,902 --> 00:42:13,059
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor shall call a joint meeting of the City Council and School Committee before the commencement of the budget process to review the financial condition of the city, revenue and expenditure forecasts, and other relevant information prepared by the mayor in order to develop a coordinated budget.

444
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good.

445
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:17,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to check all these dates and, you know.

446
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,985
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to go in front of the whole committee to let them.

447
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:23,869
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure we have some other suggestions.

448
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:24,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

449
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:31,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the subcommittee picks these numbers, I mean, I think we should probably go to the financial department.

450
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:39,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the financial department says those are, yeah, that can be done, then we can bring it to the whole committee.

451
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,741
[SPEAKER_01]: My question though, is it says, you know.

452
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:46,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the commencement of the budget process, so if they do it, you know.

453
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:53,087
[SPEAKER_01]: If they come up against that 60 days, of course, you know, giving them that much of a window, you know.

454
00:42:53,827 --> 00:43:06,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they have some wiggle room to play with, but if they, you know, but it up to, you know, the 60 days, which is May 1st, which is a little bit over a month from now.

455
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:08,805
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as we said, the budget process.

456
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,048
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for the city council, it's.

457
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:19,656
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much started with the city councils, you know, sending their requests to the mayor this week.

458
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:27,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And the school committee meetings starting next week, you know, by May 1st, they're in the thick of it.

459
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:29,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you hope they are.

460
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:31,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

461
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:31,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

462
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:33,110
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I hope?

463
00:43:34,062 --> 00:43:37,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, this is basically giving them flexibility.

464
00:43:38,103 --> 00:43:38,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

465
00:43:38,943 --> 00:43:53,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if there's a particular year where, wow, something happens and we can't start till, you know, and, but it's, I don't know, that's, it's no later than, but they definitely can start earlier.

466
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:55,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

467
00:43:56,187 --> 00:43:56,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

468
00:43:56,992 --> 00:44:04,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's reasonable, you know, Melrose gave no timeline, they just said before.

469
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:08,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives the most flexibility, right?

470
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:18,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It just says there has to be an annual budget meeting before, before, you know, the process is started.

471
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:23,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, that's an option, but we were kind of saying we like to put the deadlines in.

472
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll check the numbers with the financial department and see what they said.

473
00:44:31,723 --> 00:44:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

474
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Submission of the operating budget and budget message.

475
00:44:36,747 --> 00:44:41,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Establishes process for budget development and time frame for budget submission.

476
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a big one.

477
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:46,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I interrupt you for just one second?

478
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I have printed out

479
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:55,567
[SPEAKER_01]: hear the article six, the comparison with the three different communities.

480
00:44:55,587 --> 00:44:56,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

481
00:44:57,288 --> 00:45:05,291
[SPEAKER_01]: After the 6-1 fiscal year with Melrose, Pittsfield, and Weymouth, there comes another section after that.

482
00:45:05,331 --> 00:45:07,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see it on what you have up on the screen.

483
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:10,813
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because I know what you're talking about, the school committee thing?

484
00:45:11,154 --> 00:45:12,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the public hearing.

485
00:45:12,654 --> 00:45:13,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in Pittsfield.

486
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:19,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that I somehow, when I made the document, I put it in the wrong place.

487
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it doesn't seem like it should have gone where it was.

488
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:26,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did was I moved it down to, it was Weymouth.

489
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was purple, so yeah, it was Weymouth.

490
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:36,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved it down here because I don't see that it could go in those two other sections.

491
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,665
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I could tell, it was the only one that had a whole separate section on that.

492
00:45:42,768 --> 00:45:44,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, we're going to get to it.

493
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

494
00:45:47,935 --> 00:45:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see Melrose or Pittsfield having that separate section.

495
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:53,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

496
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that has is budget message.

497
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the others having budget message.

498
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:08,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, so I mean, maybe what we should, let's look at the first two first since they're shorter.

499
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:21,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So Melrose, not less than 45 days before the beginning of the fiscal year, which would be, let's just, May 15th, is that right?

500
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:24,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I calculating that right?

501
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

502
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:30,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, I'm trying to find out where you are on, I've got it in front of me.

503
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:33,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Not less than 45 days before the beginning of the fiscal year.

504
00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:34,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

505
00:46:34,306 --> 00:46:35,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be May 15th.

506
00:46:36,428 --> 00:46:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

507
00:46:37,268 --> 00:46:41,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means by May 15th, the mayor shall submit to the city council a proposed.

508
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:47,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's actually, um, earlier than it has been done in Medford in the past, right?

509
00:46:48,136 --> 00:46:48,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

510
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:52,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Brianna did it last year, it was right around the middle of May.

511
00:46:54,602 --> 00:46:56,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in that window.

512
00:46:57,724 --> 00:47:02,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and okay, the budget message piece is in this section for Melrose.

513
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: The budget message shall explain the operating budget in fiscal terms and in terms of work programs for all city agencies.

514
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:21,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It shall outline the proposed fiscal policies of the city for the ensuing fiscal year, describe important features of the proposed operating budget, and indicate any major variations from the current operating budget fiscal policies

515
00:47:23,286 --> 00:47:25,207
[SPEAKER_02]: and reasons for the changes.

516
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:34,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Complete fiscal plan of all city funds shall be in the form the mayor deems desirable.

517
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:36,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's where they have the school budget.

518
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:46,336
[SPEAKER_02]: The school budget as adopted by the school committee shall be submitted to the mayor within a reasonable time before the submission of the proposed operating budget for the city council.

519
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:50,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So the school committee that says has to submit it before

520
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:56,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't give them a deadline, but it just says a reasonable time before May 15th.

521
00:48:00,189 --> 00:48:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mayor shall notify the school committee of the date by which the budget of the school committee shall be submitted to the mayor.

522
00:48:06,575 --> 00:48:12,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it gives the mayor the ability to tell the school committee, you need to get it to me by X date, right?

523
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:12,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

524
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,381
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to have her budget fund.

525
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:18,124
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor is going to have their budget fund by X amount of dates.

526
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:21,867
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have this so I can include it in the entire package.

527
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:22,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

528
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:27,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and they shall coordinate the dates and times of the school committee's budget process under the general laws.

529
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:32,612
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems pretty good, but let's see what Pittsfield says, at least 30 days.

530
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:35,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So they say, Melrose says May 15th.

531
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:40,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Pittsfield says basically June 1st, right?

532
00:48:41,723 --> 00:48:50,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And our friendly budget ordinance over here says, uh, presentation and review of comprehensive budget process.

533
00:48:51,107 --> 00:48:58,450
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor will submit the comprehensive budget proposal to the city council no later than May 31st of each year.

534
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

535
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,911
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor will make a presentation.

536
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:05,012
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going, they're going 30 days.

537
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:14,314
[SPEAKER_01]: With a considerable amount of work done prior to that point.

538
00:49:14,395 --> 00:49:23,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, when they get the comprehensive budget, it shouldn't be because they'll have already gone through the meetings of all the department heads by then.

539
00:49:23,644 --> 00:49:25,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

540
00:49:25,807 --> 00:49:27,368
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be much of a surprise to them.

541
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

542
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us,

543
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:35,502
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at one community that says May 15th, another one that says May 31st.

544
00:49:36,783 --> 00:49:45,007
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks like it's pretty much the same as Melrose, except Pittsfield does give some more specific numbers for the school committee.

545
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:52,411
[SPEAKER_02]: The school budget shall be submitted at least 30 days.

546
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So this basically says that the school budget has to be submitted to the mayor on May 1st.

547
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:05,548
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also says the mayor shall notify the school committee of the date by which the proposed budget.

548
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:16,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those seem a little... They're a little contradictory, but they're also saying this is the final timeline if no one does anything about it.

549
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:18,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right, right.

550
00:50:18,472 --> 00:50:19,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it means.

551
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:20,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

552
00:50:20,673 --> 00:50:22,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so those two.

553
00:50:22,354 --> 00:50:25,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Weymouth says not later than 75.

554
00:50:25,094 --> 00:50:25,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, wow.

555
00:50:25,635 --> 00:50:25,775
[SPEAKER_02]: That's...

556
00:50:30,884 --> 00:50:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, before that's.

557
00:50:33,705 --> 00:50:34,986
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like April 15th.

558
00:50:35,726 --> 00:50:39,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, women is maybe smaller.

559
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:41,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not as complicated.

560
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:41,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

561
00:50:42,628 --> 00:50:43,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they work off a town meeting.

562
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:47,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it does say town council, so they might.

563
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they're different.

564
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:57,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be why that seems too early, right?

565
00:50:58,378 --> 00:51:06,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is they say that the mayor shall provide for publication in a local newspaper of notice and a general summary of the proposed budget.

566
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the other two did something like that too.

567
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see anything.

568
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:12,847
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

569
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:19,592
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just say the budget message submitted by the mayor shall explain the operating budget.

570
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:23,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that Mass General Law said that.

571
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:27,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

572
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:35,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, so the 175 days, looks like it comes from within 175 days after the annual organization.

573
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, that's...

574
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,981
[SPEAKER_02]: That's within 175 days after.

575
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:45,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be January, right?

576
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Within 175 days from January.

577
00:51:52,043 --> 00:51:54,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like about six months.

578
00:51:55,003 --> 00:51:55,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

579
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:56,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's not helpful.

580
00:51:57,644 --> 00:51:57,844
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

581
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:03,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to see if they said anything about.

582
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:05,546
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

583
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:06,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

584
00:52:07,006 --> 00:52:07,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look back.

585
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:13,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my rail just changed.

586
00:52:13,962 --> 00:52:15,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in your way, right?

587
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:16,222
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, there we go.

588
00:52:18,143 --> 00:52:23,204
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so Weymouth, as we've talked about, is maybe a little different.

589
00:52:24,484 --> 00:52:30,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have, so they just put it in different sections.

590
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:34,567
[SPEAKER_02]: The other two included budget messaging and school,

591
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:40,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It just did it within the same paragraph.

592
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:43,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is pretty much the same thing that the other said.

593
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:58,374
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty much, this looks like maybe it's a little more detailed, but it's, yeah, I don't think property tax levies were mentioned in the other ones, were they?

594
00:52:59,334 --> 00:52:59,635
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

595
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

596
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:09,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's this whole school committee budget.

597
00:53:13,074 --> 00:53:16,316
[SPEAKER_02]: This also has the thing about putting things in the local newspaper.

598
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:24,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know the school committee, I know by law they have to do a public hearing.

599
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I've heard them talk about that a few times before.

600
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:30,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that they get that in there.

601
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: My feeling is that the more simple one is probably better, but I don't know how you guys feel, like using either Melrose or Pittsfield as a model.

602
00:53:44,114 --> 00:53:52,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, well,

603
00:53:53,335 --> 00:54:04,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the mayor was able to do it, you know, last year, you know, somewhere in the May 15th, May 20th category, which is the earliest it's ever been done in decades.

604
00:54:05,811 --> 00:54:08,294
[SPEAKER_01]: The usual process that I've.

605
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:37,620
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, seen over the years, you know, when things don't go totally amiss and totally off the wall, like they've done a few times in the last few years, but over the last, I don't know, seven, eight years that I've been paying some attention to it over a couple of different mayors is that usually the budget would be presented somewhere in the vicinity of the,

606
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:41,847
[SPEAKER_01]: 1st of June, you know, a little bit.

607
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:47,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Before a little bit afterwards, and that then follows with.

608
00:54:50,308 --> 00:55:12,071
[SPEAKER_01]: budget meetings, they don't call them hearings, budget meetings over the course of much of June, including a Saturday usually, a Saturday morning, one Saturday morning, maybe two, with the parade of department heads coming through and presenting their budget and

609
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:28,362
[SPEAKER_01]: the council is having the opportunity to ask questions and then the budget gets voted on in the final Tuesday meeting of the fiscal year, which is usually around the 26th, 28th.

610
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:38,487
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular section is just about submission of the budget and the budget message.

611
00:55:39,623 --> 00:55:47,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when we get to the next section, it's going to address other action on the operating budget, sort of what you're talking about.

612
00:55:48,728 --> 00:56:00,995
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was saying was I personally think for this section, the Melrose or the Pittsfield, which is more sort of streamlined, I like their text models better than the Weymouth one.

613
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know how you guys feel.

614
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:10,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And Melrose and Pittsfield are pretty much exactly the same except for the timeline.

615
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:21,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we agree that we like the Melrose and Pittsfield text, we can keep that and then just decide what we think we should include as the timeline.

616
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:24,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

617
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:25,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.

618
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:27,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

619
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:29,489
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

620
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:32,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just use the Melrose.

621
00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:33,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get rid of Weymouth.

622
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:45,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question is the, well, unless we don't like 30 or 45 days and we want to put something else, but I don't know what else we could put.

623
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:49,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So 30 or 45 days, right?

624
00:56:49,595 --> 00:56:51,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, 30.

625
00:56:51,397 --> 00:56:57,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Melrose has 45, which means that the mayor would have to have the budget submitted by mid-May.

626
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:06,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're doing if they leave their collaboration to the school committee.

627
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:11,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Their collaboration meeting with the school committee to the last possible moment.

628
00:57:12,552 --> 00:57:18,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then 2 weeks is, you know, right?

629
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:19,058
[SPEAKER_01]: They do that.

630
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:19,639
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying 30th.

631
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:20,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

632
00:57:23,087 --> 00:57:23,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

633
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:32,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're actually allowing May 1st as a potential annual budget meeting date, it would be pretty hard to do the budget in two weeks, right?

634
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:36,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, I mean, that's their own fault if they do that.

635
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:36,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

636
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:38,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

637
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:44,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like 30 days is reasonable because, again, it's not less than.

638
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:46,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean it can't be submitted earlier.

639
00:57:47,882 --> 00:58:06,009
[SPEAKER_02]: but if there's some reason that some year it's going to be really hard to get the budget in by mid, you know, done by mid-May, you know, I feel like the 30 days, I would go for the 30 days, but I don't know what you guys think.

640
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going with that.

641
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:11,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it doesn't preclude them, like you say, doing

642
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:38,430
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinance that they seem to be following now that should go into effect shortly, if they're doing the department head budget meetings throughout the month of May and they see 25 department heads parade through in May with their budget, then when they get the entire budget book on June 1,

643
00:58:40,928 --> 00:58:44,270
[SPEAKER_01]: it shouldn't be a shocker to them what they're getting.

644
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:45,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

645
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:54,615
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other question is, Pittsfield gives a school budget deadline, at least 30 days.

646
00:58:55,455 --> 00:58:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Melrose just lets the school committee and the mayor work it out.

647
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we think about that?

648
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:08,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should have Paulette.

649
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:19,724
[SPEAKER_02]: The school budget has to be submitted before the mayor submits, obviously, the proposed operating budget to the city council.

650
00:59:20,184 --> 00:59:22,345
[SPEAKER_02]: This one just says a reasonable time.

651
00:59:24,485 --> 00:59:29,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that because the school committee is not going to fail to submit the budget in time.

652
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:34,968
[SPEAKER_02]: They know they have until a certain date because that's been already outlined.

653
00:59:36,763 --> 00:59:42,106
[SPEAKER_02]: How important is it to then, within that, say, well, the school committee has to be by X date?

654
00:59:42,627 --> 00:59:42,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

655
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:44,108
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think, Maury?

656
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:47,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of go along with your thinking on this one.

657
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:59,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they, let's face it, all three different phases of the government here know what has to be done.

658
00:59:59,778 --> 01:00:01,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.

659
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,321
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know,

660
01:00:04,586 --> 01:00:10,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they can have, I don't think they have to be, I don't think, I think what you're saying is fine.

661
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:13,329
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Eunice?

662
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:13,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree?

663
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:15,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I do.

664
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:33,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it might be something that maybe we either when we beforehand or in our next group meeting or whatever that we highlight to Paulette's attention.

665
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and feedback, she's she's the expert in that area.

666
01:00:38,432 --> 01:00:48,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or, you know, and she'll see this when, you know, when we submit it to right and maybe just call our attention to and say, have a look at this and see if it.

667
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:49,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.

668
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:53,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this gives the school committee the most flexibility.

669
01:00:53,437 --> 01:00:58,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only thing I can imagine her saying is like, well, gee, a deadline would have really helped.

670
01:00:58,758 --> 01:00:59,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's what she would say.

671
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:01,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

672
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:02,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

673
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:03,418
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy to do.

674
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:05,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

675
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:05,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

676
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:07,039
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

677
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:17,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So section 6.4 establishes the protocols for adopting the budget, including holding of public hearings, ability to modify and reject, and time frame for adoption and posting requirements.

678
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:20,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what 6-4 does.

679
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:31,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of these Melrose, it's broken down into public hearing, adoption of budget, same with Pittsfield.

680
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:38,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Pittsfield has an additional section, which we'll look at and Weymouth,

681
01:01:40,231 --> 01:01:43,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you know, Weymouth is a little different.

682
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we should just take Weymouth out because it's so different.

683
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:46,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It's town.

684
01:01:46,974 --> 01:01:47,654
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.

685
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:48,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

686
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:48,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

687
01:01:48,534 --> 01:01:49,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get rid of Weymouth.

688
01:01:50,935 --> 01:01:54,857
[SPEAKER_00]: We seem to be more in concert with Marrows and Pittsfield, what they're saying.

689
01:01:55,477 --> 01:01:56,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

690
01:01:56,358 --> 01:01:59,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Weymouth, I think, has a different form of government.

691
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:01,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why the Collins Center included Weymouth.

692
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:02,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

693
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

694
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know either.

695
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there might have been other better choices.

696
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:09,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they wanted us to see a contrast.

697
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:10,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.

698
01:02:11,085 --> 01:02:11,425
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

699
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:15,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So Melrose has for the public, let's go one by one.

700
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So public hearings.

701
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:28,162
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council shall publish in at least one local news publication of general circulation in the city, a notice of the proposed operating budget as submitted by the mayor.

702
01:02:29,323 --> 01:02:31,025
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be my newspaper thing again.

703
01:02:32,135 --> 01:02:46,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, the notice shall state the times and places where copies of the entire proposed operating budget are available for inspection and the date, time, and place not less than 14 days after its publication when a public hearing will be held.

704
01:02:47,086 --> 01:02:48,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see what Pittsfield says.

705
01:02:51,914 --> 01:02:53,737
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much the same thing, right?

706
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:56,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Exact same thing, actually.

707
01:02:57,643 --> 01:03:00,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, it's a question of do we want to keep it in there?

708
01:03:01,188 --> 01:03:06,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might even be that this is part of state law, and that's why it's in there.

709
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:07,058
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.

710
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:15,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we just, you know... My only fear, what do we do about the local news publication, seeing how we don't have one?

711
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:17,056
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a problem.

712
01:03:17,697 --> 01:03:29,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I mean, like I said, with the budget ordinance, and I think the leaf blower ordinance, and they worked on the food truck ordinance last night, any of these ordinances,

713
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:37,035
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be, like I said, there was one reading last night for the budget ordinance.

714
01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:40,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of these have to be publicized.

715
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:49,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the clerk has been using, I think it's the Somerville Journal slash Medford, whatever.

716
01:03:49,745 --> 01:03:51,747
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Somerville News.

717
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:53,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is that that one?

718
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:55,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.

719
01:03:56,471 --> 01:04:03,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where the stuff has to be publicized because I think that that's probably state law.

720
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:08,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I, I, I believe you're right in what you're saying that it is state law.

721
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

722
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:18,616
[SPEAKER_02]: When they shut down Medford Transcript, they did supposedly merge it with that Somerville paper, right?

723
01:04:18,796 --> 01:04:21,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So theoretically, there's Medford News in there.

724
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:25,322
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever paper is correct, it's either Somerville News.

725
01:04:25,382 --> 01:04:27,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the Somerville Journal was gone.

726
01:04:27,283 --> 01:04:31,987
[SPEAKER_00]: That was always the bigger publication in Somerville.

727
01:04:32,908 --> 01:04:35,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a larger problem statewide because, I mean,

728
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:42,777
[SPEAKER_01]: the local papers have gone the way of the dinosaur, so.

729
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:56,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so in this day and age, does putting something like this in the charter create a potential problem if there's no local news publication of general circulation?

730
01:04:56,787 --> 01:04:57,348
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my point.

731
01:04:57,428 --> 01:04:59,069
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do we have then?

732
01:04:59,149 --> 01:04:59,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Patch.

733
01:05:05,523 --> 01:05:07,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, but that's circulation.

734
01:05:08,764 --> 01:05:12,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, general circulation, I don't know.

735
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:13,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

736
01:05:13,665 --> 01:05:20,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like this is something, I mean, we're going to leave this in, I think, right?

737
01:05:20,787 --> 01:05:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm going to do is, I mean, do you agree that we should leave this in?

738
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:28,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something in there to notify.

739
01:05:28,128 --> 01:05:29,109
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to.

740
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:44,606
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think- This is what we want to find out more about because- But I mean, state law supersedes anything in the charter.

741
01:05:45,187 --> 01:05:55,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you look around and the only two newspapers in Eastern Massachusetts end up being the Globe and the Herald, then

742
01:05:58,435 --> 01:06:01,956
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff isn't like The Globe or The Herald, I don't think.

743
01:06:01,996 --> 01:06:02,616
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.

744
01:06:03,016 --> 01:06:06,737
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a problem for state law, really.

745
01:06:06,817 --> 01:06:07,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

746
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:10,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

747
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,019
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have a newspaper, we don't have a newspaper.

748
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:14,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

749
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:21,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should decide to leave that there and just maybe I put that in yellow so we could ask a question about it.

750
01:06:21,782 --> 01:06:24,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a way,

751
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:33,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe there's a way to change it so that it's not, it doesn't seem so connected to print media.

752
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:34,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

753
01:06:34,321 --> 01:06:35,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look into that.

754
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:36,223
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

755
01:06:36,343 --> 01:06:39,346
[SPEAKER_02]: So, adoption of the budget.

756
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:41,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how these two compare.

757
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:47,555
[SPEAKER_02]: First one was exactly the same between Melrose and Fitzfields.

758
01:06:49,016 --> 01:06:49,977
[SPEAKER_02]: For this one, we thought,

759
01:06:53,705 --> 01:07:02,828
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council shall adopt the operating budget with or without amendments not more than 45 days following the date the budget is filed.

760
01:07:03,528 --> 01:07:07,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Pittsfield did say what we decided on, which was 30 days.

761
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:11,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That would mean the budget would be submitted no later than May 31st.

762
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,630
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make any sense because

763
01:07:22,488 --> 01:07:27,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That must not be, because that's past June 30th, right?

764
01:07:28,892 --> 01:07:32,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, what do we do, go budgetless for the first 15 days of July?

765
01:07:37,437 --> 01:07:43,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Melrose has it being submitted earlier, but here's Pittsfield, it also says 45 days.

766
01:07:43,321 --> 01:07:45,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

767
01:07:45,822 --> 01:07:46,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

768
01:07:48,684 --> 01:08:02,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if the budget doesn't get submitted until 30 days before the beginning of the fiscal year, which would be like... June 1st, right?

769
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:06,328
[SPEAKER_02]: June 1st, yeah.

770
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Not less than June 1st, it says.

771
01:08:09,468 --> 01:08:10,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I know.

772
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:15,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this does say not more than 45 days.

773
01:08:21,428 --> 01:08:22,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these two are identical.

774
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:31,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that the date the budget is filed with the city clerk is the same as the date that it's submitted, right?

775
01:08:33,172 --> 01:08:33,732
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

776
01:08:35,853 --> 01:08:36,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

777
01:08:36,453 --> 01:08:44,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that it's a different date than, I don't think, than the date the mayor submits it to the city council?

778
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:50,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a pretty important thing for us to find out before we

779
01:08:52,205 --> 01:08:53,225
[SPEAKER_01]: go with any one of these.

780
01:08:53,825 --> 01:09:00,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it doesn't say not more than 45 days following the date the mayor submits it to the city council.

781
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:07,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It says not more than 45 days following the date the budget is filed with the city clerk.

782
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:20,392
[SPEAKER_00]: You think we should ask Adam for 15 minutes of his time, have these little notes that we need to have clarified and sit down with him?

783
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:31,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he'll say the same thing you said about the- Or maybe Nina would be able to tell us.

784
01:09:32,388 --> 01:09:34,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Nina would probably.

785
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a simple question.

786
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:48,983
[SPEAKER_02]: What we want to know is, is the date the budget is filed with the city clerk same as the date budget is submitted to city council, right?

787
01:09:50,245 --> 01:09:56,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would send that paragraph to Nina in an email and ask her to offer some clarity.

788
01:09:57,731 --> 01:09:57,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

789
01:09:58,172 --> 01:10:17,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So because this submission of budget says when it has to be submitted to the city council, and the dates of that do seem a little bit different than this adoption.

790
01:10:18,717 --> 01:10:25,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But 45 days, we can look at other charters, but the two charters from cities we have here both say 45 days.

791
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So that does seem pretty standard.

792
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:37,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So other than that, I think that the language is completely the same.

793
01:10:38,424 --> 01:10:41,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can just get rid of one of these.

794
01:10:42,878 --> 01:10:43,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're the same.

795
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:45,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's this available?

796
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Pittsfield has an extra thing, which we'll look at in a second.

797
01:10:49,483 --> 01:10:59,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me do this, and then I'm going to put, because we want to know what this means, I don't know that we're going to put this in yellow.

798
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:04,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so we can understand what that means.

799
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:04,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

800
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:06,495
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

801
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:11,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it didn't become yellow.

802
01:11:11,118 --> 01:11:12,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't it become yellow?

803
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I did something wrong.

804
01:11:14,591 --> 01:11:18,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you keep it all together, Melva.

805
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:20,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to shut myself by now.

806
01:11:21,013 --> 01:11:21,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there we go.

807
01:11:22,214 --> 01:11:22,314
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

808
01:11:22,414 --> 01:11:23,074
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

809
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:23,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

810
01:11:24,395 --> 01:11:33,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sort of want to, I mean, likely we're going to keep it this way because it seems standard, but we do want to understand what we're recommending, right?

811
01:11:33,338 --> 01:11:34,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to know about that.

812
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:39,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was only in Pittsfield.

813
01:11:42,848 --> 01:11:46,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this just is about availability of the operating budget.

814
01:11:46,451 --> 01:11:59,480
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to any other posting requirements under the law, immediately after submission of the proposed budget to the city council, the mayor shall pause the entire budget document to be posted on the city's website.

815
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:02,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I do too.

816
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:08,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Said proposed budget document shall remain posted during the city council review process contained in this article.

817
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:14,578
[SPEAKER_02]: After the enactment of the budget, it shall be posted on the city's website and shall remain there throughout the fiscal year.

818
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:23,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this maybe already happens, but I think it's good to put it in here.

819
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:31,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It does already happen, at least under Marilonga Kern, it has been happening.

820
01:12:32,362 --> 01:12:37,563
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think she's doing that because she thinks it's a best practice.

821
01:12:38,844 --> 01:12:44,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting it in the charter will require anybody in the future to do so.

822
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:45,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

823
01:12:46,266 --> 01:12:46,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

824
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:48,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's good.

825
01:12:48,528 --> 01:12:49,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.

826
01:12:49,248 --> 01:12:50,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good thing to keep.

827
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

828
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:53,211
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

829
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:55,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Capital Improvement Program.

830
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:56,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

831
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:01,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Establishes the protocols for creating and adopting the capital budget.

832
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

833
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:10,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't say that I'm not a money person, but we'll see.

834
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:15,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, the city has been working on capital improvement programs every five years.

835
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:17,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

836
01:13:18,483 --> 01:13:27,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So this says every- It's a five-year plan of where they want to be from such and such a date to five years from when, so.

837
01:13:28,289 --> 01:13:32,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is interesting because Melrose says every three years, right?

838
01:13:32,232 --> 01:13:32,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

839
01:13:32,812 --> 01:13:33,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

840
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:35,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It still says every year?

841
01:13:35,894 --> 01:13:35,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

842
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:45,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so in terms of- Scroll down a little more right there.

843
01:13:45,123 --> 01:13:46,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says right there, what does it say?

844
01:13:47,165 --> 01:13:50,108
[SPEAKER_00]: A list of all to be on during the next five years.

845
01:13:50,428 --> 01:13:57,155
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the way the city's been doing it here, every year with a five-year plan.

846
01:13:58,188 --> 01:14:07,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this capital improvement program is submitted every year, but it's- I believe it has been.

847
01:14:07,514 --> 01:14:09,595
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an update on the five-year plan.

848
01:14:09,936 --> 01:14:11,417
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this out of it.

849
01:14:11,817 --> 01:14:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

850
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:16,160
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I've been doing it all the time.

851
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So that Medford's current process is more like Pittsfield.

852
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:21,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just look at what Melrose is doing.

853
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

854
01:14:22,464 --> 01:14:23,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Every three years,

855
01:14:27,347 --> 01:14:32,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a list of capital improvements proposed to be undertaken during the next ensuing five years.

856
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:38,255
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both saying the same thing, but a little differently.

857
01:14:39,156 --> 01:14:45,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, except in Melrose, the capital improvement program is only submitted every three years.

858
01:14:46,021 --> 01:14:47,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Pittsfield, it's every year.

859
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,144
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty big difference.

860
01:14:51,685 --> 01:14:52,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think?

861
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:53,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

862
01:14:56,202 --> 01:14:58,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I think about this.

863
01:14:59,626 --> 01:15:08,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like I have enough knowledge to really, I feel like I would want to talk to the financial department, maybe.

864
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:10,180
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

865
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:14,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Going through their budget ordinance process, which has been

866
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:23,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that, um, it's kind of contentious between the administration and the council over their last many meetings.

867
01:15:23,573 --> 01:15:26,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Particularly since last fall.

868
01:15:26,975 --> 01:15:29,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a piece of it.

869
01:15:30,396 --> 01:15:35,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Has to do with, um, capital improvements, revolving funds and.

870
01:15:42,439 --> 01:16:00,544
[SPEAKER_01]: both the chief of staff and the budget director, finance director, have raised a lot of concern that given this, and maybe this is neither here nor there with what we're trying to do, but just to add a little bit of more context,

871
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:11,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of our antiquated systems and staffing and so forth that a lot of this is very difficult for them to do right now.

872
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:16,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Right as the chief of staff stated in a recent meeting.

873
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:19,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that when an ordinance goes into effect, it's.

874
01:16:20,352 --> 01:16:26,837
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of like a law and, you know, if they don't do it, they're essentially breaking the law.

875
01:16:26,857 --> 01:16:29,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so.

876
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:37,693
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a lot of concerns over, including things that they can't do.

877
01:16:37,713 --> 01:16:40,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that makes sense.

878
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:41,701
[SPEAKER_01]: What we put out there,

879
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:51,262
[SPEAKER_01]: if what we, if the charter that we're creating actually goes into effect, it's going to be a few years down the road anyway.

880
01:16:51,902 --> 01:17:02,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe by that time they will be able to do things, but you know, well, I mean, I think that that ordinance is going to go into way more detail than the charter in general.

881
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:09,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, so I don't, uh, anything we put in the charter, I think needs to be able to be implemented, implemented at any time.

882
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:11,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

883
01:17:12,697 --> 01:17:18,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know whether there's any stuff about capital improvement in the budget ordinance.

884
01:17:18,642 --> 01:17:19,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing there is.

885
01:17:21,824 --> 01:17:27,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like I just need to know more to know whether I think

886
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:30,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year is a good idea.

887
01:17:31,019 --> 01:17:39,263
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the five-year window in terms of, you know, sort of laying out the capital improvements is, that's in both, right?

888
01:17:39,283 --> 01:17:46,206
[SPEAKER_02]: They talk about, but the difference is every year, every three years.

889
01:17:46,506 --> 01:17:48,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's some cities that do it every two years.

890
01:17:49,048 --> 01:17:49,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

891
01:17:50,227 --> 01:17:50,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be?

892
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:57,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but on the last paragraph of the murals, it says the mayor shall annually revise this information.

893
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,189
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.

894
01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:10,451
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basically saying the same thing a little bit differently, that every year the mayor has to talk about the capital improvements and how it's proceeding forward or falling behind.

895
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:14,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But the mayor doesn't have to submit that to the city council every year.

896
01:18:17,118 --> 01:18:24,444
[SPEAKER_02]: under Melrose, then the mayor has to like be responsible and kind of keep track of all the capital improvements.

897
01:18:25,144 --> 01:18:25,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

898
01:18:26,065 --> 01:18:30,949
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't have to submit the right to the city.

899
01:18:31,429 --> 01:18:31,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

900
01:18:32,731 --> 01:18:35,533
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know which is better.

901
01:18:35,913 --> 01:18:36,373
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point.

902
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:38,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like I need to know more.

903
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:40,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is it you know, could

904
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:58,471
[SPEAKER_01]: You or someone have a conversation with either Nina or Bob Dickinson or have one of them come and give us 15 minutes of their time at an upcoming meeting?

905
01:18:59,632 --> 01:18:59,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

906
01:19:00,012 --> 01:19:03,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I can start by

907
01:19:08,092 --> 01:19:20,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can make a list of these questions that we have and ask, you know, submit them to the chief of staff and the chief financial officer and ask, just ask questions about that.

908
01:19:21,226 --> 01:19:24,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we feel like we need more than that, we can invite them to a meeting.

909
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

910
01:19:29,955 --> 01:19:30,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like...

911
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:40,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless one of you feels like you know about this and we should do one or the other, I feel like I've got to leave these here until we know more.

912
01:19:41,692 --> 01:19:42,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

913
01:19:43,752 --> 01:19:44,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm leaving that.

914
01:19:45,932 --> 01:19:48,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the scope of what we're capable of at the moment.

915
01:19:48,773 --> 01:19:50,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

916
01:19:50,633 --> 01:19:59,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And Weymouth says every year too, but we're going to take out Weymouth because we decided we're... We can also look at other cities as we're going.

917
01:20:00,055 --> 01:20:01,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, independent audit.

918
01:20:04,602 --> 01:20:10,004
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know, just an annual independent audit, which we do now, but... Wow.

919
01:20:10,724 --> 01:20:11,684
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supposed to do.

920
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,725
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't had a... Oh.

921
01:20:15,285 --> 01:20:24,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they went... I don't know if Brianna's done some, but I know prior to Stephanie and Michael, I think it was 15 or 20 years that there had been no audits done.

922
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:26,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, jeez.

923
01:20:26,527 --> 01:20:29,708
[SPEAKER_00]: By an outside agency, and that was a...

924
01:20:30,857 --> 01:20:33,438
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a contentious point at some times.

925
01:20:34,339 --> 01:20:36,840
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you need this in there.

926
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:39,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.

927
01:20:42,002 --> 01:20:54,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are exactly the same, but I do see one difference, which is Pittsfield says, at least every five years, the city council shall conduct a competitive procurement process to retain these auditing services.

928
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of interesting.

929
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what that means is... The City Council will hire the auditor.

930
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct?

931
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:08,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it sounds like, although let's see.

932
01:21:08,561 --> 01:21:09,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The City Council, yes.

933
01:21:10,622 --> 01:21:18,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And that every five years they have to... So that basically what it seems like is they can't just use the same firm every year without...

934
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:21,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Without.

935
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:28,790
[SPEAKER_01]: In Melrose, it says the award of a contract to audit shall be made by the city council annually, no later than September 15th.

936
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:45,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they all say that, but Pittsfield adds that they will do a competitive procurement process, which is, I'm gonna actually just look it up because I know what I think it is, but, um,

937
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:57,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're basically going out to bid to find out if the auditor that they've been using for the past four years is giving them the best price for the best amount of services.

938
01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:59,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suppose it can't hurt.

939
01:22:00,442 --> 01:22:01,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to, you know.

940
01:22:01,462 --> 01:22:03,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it sounds like a good thing, right?

941
01:22:03,802 --> 01:22:06,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

942
01:22:06,903 --> 01:22:09,043
[SPEAKER_00]: I think five years is too long, myself.

943
01:22:12,735 --> 01:22:15,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's OK for them.

944
01:22:15,456 --> 01:22:24,900
[SPEAKER_02]: If they've got a firm that's working well and all that, then do you think they should do it more often, Laurie?

945
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:31,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest, just thinking out loud, every three years or something like that.

946
01:22:31,782 --> 01:22:33,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think five years is a long time.

947
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:35,563
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot goes on here.

948
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:44,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at even the way our city is being run right now.

949
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:59,006
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had a city solicitor for, what, two years, three years, and you have an outside law firm in here, and legally they can't be doing things without the city solicitor, but yet we seem to bypass that.

950
01:23:00,494 --> 01:23:01,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

951
01:23:01,354 --> 01:23:09,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've heard that it's getting to be more common for cities to contract out for legal services, but.

952
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:11,980
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems so expensive.

953
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:16,262
[SPEAKER_01]: But they haven't overseen the bills, so we really don't even know.

954
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:27,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand it's a whole different world today where you need more than maybe one person as your legal counsel, so who knows?

955
01:23:27,673 --> 01:23:30,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what, you guys, we have 10 minutes left, but this is the last section.

956
01:23:31,476 --> 01:23:33,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just go back to the auditor for one second?

957
01:23:33,738 --> 01:23:53,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to put in anything or is there anything in state law that would supersede that nobody from the auditing firm shall have any ties to Medford or any of its municipal employees?

958
01:23:54,887 --> 01:23:55,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

959
01:23:55,827 --> 01:23:57,428
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very vague to me.

960
01:23:57,788 --> 01:24:03,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have to really think about what that would mean because ties, you know what I mean?

961
01:24:03,249 --> 01:24:06,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, it has to be defined if we're going to do something like that.

962
01:24:07,111 --> 01:24:07,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

963
01:24:07,371 --> 01:24:18,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think you all know kind of what I'm getting at, you know, just like a relative, anybody that would, you know,

964
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:27,742
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear what you're saying, Eunice, but I also hear what Mill was saying is you have to define it.

965
01:24:28,143 --> 01:24:42,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an immediate family member that works for the city and also has some sort of jurisdiction of an appointment of a company like this to, I don't know, I think it's kind of tricky.

966
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:46,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also, I mean, would conflict of interest laws

967
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:51,286
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent, theoretically prevent this kind of problem?

968
01:24:52,226 --> 01:24:52,667
[SPEAKER_00]: It may.

969
01:24:53,507 --> 01:24:54,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think so.

970
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:58,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think so too.

971
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:15,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So would an auditor that we hire, we hire, you know, ABC auditing firm and, you know, whoever from the firm is assigned to our account, do they then have to go through

972
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:20,833
[SPEAKER_01]: conflict of interest training to work on a municipal account?

973
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:24,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

974
01:25:26,838 --> 01:25:30,921
[SPEAKER_02]: City employees have to, I don't know if contractors do, I don't know.

975
01:25:31,161 --> 01:25:35,884
[SPEAKER_02]: But I put in the notes, look into conflict of interest prevention.

976
01:25:36,445 --> 01:25:41,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We can try to find out if that's something that we should look into.

977
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:51,686
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, this is a restatement of prohibition of expenditures beyond appropriation.

978
01:25:52,867 --> 01:26:01,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like these two are the same, exactly the same.

979
01:26:01,795 --> 01:26:02,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

980
01:26:08,458 --> 01:26:11,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Weymouth has some other stuff, as usual.

981
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:12,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

982
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love Weymouth.

983
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:18,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is her personal liability.

984
01:26:18,703 --> 01:26:19,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

985
01:26:22,225 --> 01:26:22,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

986
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:26,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the less complicated is probably better.

987
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:27,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you.

988
01:26:27,267 --> 01:26:29,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Less said sometimes, better off.

989
01:26:31,429 --> 01:26:36,732
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we're covering all bases, which it certainly appears that we are.

990
01:26:38,867 --> 01:26:45,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So, since Melrose and Pittsfield are the same, and they do reference Mass General Law.

991
01:26:45,431 --> 01:26:49,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we need anything else in there, Collin Center will tell us.

992
01:26:50,594 --> 01:26:50,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

993
01:26:51,694 --> 01:26:58,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering if some of the stuff that's spelled out here, town officials,

994
01:27:00,027 --> 01:27:09,014
[SPEAKER_02]: shall submit an allotment schedule of the appropriations of all personnel categories.

995
01:27:09,194 --> 01:27:09,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

996
01:27:09,935 --> 01:27:11,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that seems like a lot.

997
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:12,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

998
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:15,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I need to read that one a little bit more.

999
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,161
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read it more and bring it up if you want next time.

1000
01:27:18,181 --> 01:27:21,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'll pass on that one.

1001
01:27:22,557 --> 01:27:23,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're good.

1002
01:27:23,658 --> 01:27:24,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a meal last night.

1003
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:25,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read it tonight.

1004
01:27:25,459 --> 01:27:26,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll fall asleep.

1005
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:29,041
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a draft here.

1006
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:37,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have one section, the capital improvement program that we have questions on.

1007
01:27:37,546 --> 01:27:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know exactly what we should do yet.

1008
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:47,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I think we could probably do this, I think.

1009
01:27:50,795 --> 01:27:53,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the language is the same, it's just the timeline that's different.

1010
01:27:55,078 --> 01:27:57,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could do this and then.

1011
01:27:57,299 --> 01:28:00,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow out.

1012
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:02,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1013
01:28:07,404 --> 01:28:12,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Every three years and not less than 120 days.

1014
01:28:12,127 --> 01:28:12,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1015
01:28:15,202 --> 01:28:22,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll do this yellow this and say, and then this, let's see.

1016
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:31,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm just going to do this, because this one says at least 60 days before the start, so I will.

1017
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:36,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do, what did I just do?

1018
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:37,911
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I just do?

1019
01:28:38,671 --> 01:28:40,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Every three years and not less than 190 days, what did it say?

1020
01:28:43,287 --> 01:28:44,968
[SPEAKER_02]: for every year?

1021
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:49,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1022
01:28:51,992 --> 01:28:53,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, don't go back.

1023
01:28:53,993 --> 01:29:01,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my, where's my, sorry guys.

1024
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:02,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1025
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:06,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to see what they're laying, what did Pittsfield say?

1026
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, I can't remember what they said.

1027
01:29:11,201 --> 01:29:16,604
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that way we still, we have it, we just don't know, we just have to fill out.

1028
01:29:17,404 --> 01:29:20,306
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we have a draft with questions in yellow.

1029
01:29:20,326 --> 01:29:29,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I will share, I will write minutes, I will share this, and I will, and Gene.

1030
01:29:29,091 --> 01:29:34,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe you want to send this to Gene and let her maybe put her two cents in, Melva.

1031
01:29:34,907 --> 01:29:36,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean can take a look at it.

1032
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:43,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and I will contact, I'll ask the questions that we have of the chief of staff and we'll see where we get.

1033
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:48,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we'll have more questions or maybe not.

1034
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:58,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess our question now is, do we want to have another meeting just to finalize this before we send it on to the whole committee?

1035
01:29:58,539 --> 01:30:04,406
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a quick meeting, see what the results of answers to our questions and so forth.

1036
01:30:04,726 --> 01:30:09,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need me to go with you on these, if you have to go to city hall or whatever, let me know.

1037
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:09,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to.

1038
01:30:10,052 --> 01:30:10,132
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1039
01:30:10,232 --> 01:30:11,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could.

1040
01:30:12,715 --> 01:30:17,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We could we could make an appointment with Nina or I was going to just write right to her.

1041
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:20,441
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I have a pretty flexible schedule too.

1042
01:30:20,561 --> 01:30:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I'm happy that it feels right as well.

1043
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:28,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll contact I'll contact Nina and see what she says.

1044
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:29,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1045
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:34,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it might be nice to go in and talk, because then if questions come up.

1046
01:30:34,382 --> 01:30:39,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to sit down and look them face to face instead of behind a keyboard myself.

1047
01:30:39,346 --> 01:30:39,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1048
01:30:40,046 --> 01:30:40,647
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's good.

1049
01:30:41,968 --> 01:30:43,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are we talking?

1050
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:43,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1051
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:45,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is March 21st.

1052
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:45,851
[SPEAKER_02]: How about

1053
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:59,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I don't know if Jean is usually available on Thursdays or not.

1054
01:31:00,322 --> 01:31:02,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to check with her and get back to us?

1055
01:31:02,922 --> 01:31:06,763
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, why don't I just do, I will do, how about I do a doodle poll?

1056
01:31:07,804 --> 01:31:09,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't do next Thursday.

1057
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:13,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do a doodle poll, Lori, if I send out a link to a doodle poll?

1058
01:31:13,726 --> 01:31:15,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever done a doodle poll?

1059
01:31:15,626 --> 01:31:16,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try.

1060
01:31:17,287 --> 01:31:24,669
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, how about I will, I won't do a doodle poll, I'll just send out, I'll send out an email with possible dates.

1061
01:31:26,746 --> 01:31:32,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, there's not that many of us, so I have a comment from the public to that.

1062
01:31:32,896 --> 01:31:33,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to add.

1063
01:31:33,457 --> 01:31:34,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1064
01:31:36,206 --> 01:31:47,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys remember from our very first listening session back in June, a gentleman by the name of Paul Garrity got up and spoke at length and asked some really good pointed questions of us.

1065
01:31:47,089 --> 01:31:48,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know him until that night.

1066
01:31:48,889 --> 01:31:51,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him for years.

1067
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:58,151
[SPEAKER_01]: He grabbed me at an event last summer and asked me to keep him updated on the budget stuff.

1068
01:31:58,431 --> 01:32:02,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he sat in on one of our recent Zoom meetings.

1069
01:32:02,232 --> 01:32:03,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember which one it was.

1070
01:32:03,412 --> 01:32:05,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was two months ago.

1071
01:32:06,273 --> 01:32:19,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I gave him a heads up in an email the other day that we were starting the budget discussion today, and evidently he's not here, but he did write back to me and said, thanks for the update.

1072
01:32:20,981 --> 01:32:27,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to offer that there would be a detailed discussion, and maybe this doesn't fall into our purview, I don't know.

1073
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:44,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I would offer that there'd be a detailed discussion on requiring the implementation and maintenance of a unified systems-based budgeting process, ERP, enterprise resource planning software.

1074
01:32:45,771 --> 01:32:54,395
[SPEAKER_01]: The systemized process would include all city and school department, as well as office of the mayor, the city council, and school committee.

1075
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:59,860
[SPEAKER_01]: If you recall when he spoke that night, he talked an awful lot about process and system.

1076
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:09,469
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked about those programs too on our meeting at the city council and in the council chambers, he did speak of that.

1077
01:33:09,809 --> 01:33:15,215
[SPEAKER_00]: He's spoken to me on two or three different occasions regarding the software and so forth.

1078
01:33:15,973 --> 01:33:16,653
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that called?

1079
01:33:16,853 --> 01:33:17,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Enterprise?

1080
01:33:18,814 --> 01:33:20,075
[SPEAKER_01]: ERP, I guess.

1081
01:33:20,435 --> 01:33:22,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Enterprise Resource Planning.

1082
01:33:23,176 --> 01:33:26,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a second ago.

1083
01:33:26,217 --> 01:33:26,337
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1084
01:33:28,078 --> 01:33:30,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that software, or is that just a?

1085
01:33:31,019 --> 01:33:34,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a software package, if I heard them correctly.

1086
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't Google it, but.

1087
01:33:38,641 --> 01:33:43,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know that we could put a specific kind of software in the.

1088
01:33:43,823 --> 01:33:45,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we can.

1089
01:33:45,747 --> 01:33:49,669
[SPEAKER_02]: in the charter, but yeah.

1090
01:33:49,829 --> 01:34:01,996
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes back to what they've been talking about between the city council and the finance department and the chief of staff with our- No, it's a process.

1091
01:34:03,016 --> 01:34:06,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a software system, yeah.

1092
01:34:06,478 --> 01:34:10,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to- No, thank you.

1093
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:14,983
[SPEAKER_01]: He went on to ask about recalls as well and I invited him to our

1094
01:34:15,845 --> 01:34:18,107
[SPEAKER_01]: public engagement meeting next week, so.

1095
01:34:20,809 --> 01:34:32,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so what he's advocating is not just, he's saying that there should be, that the actual sort of tools that are used should be linked.

1096
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:36,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what this would do.

1097
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make the business of branches of government linked

1098
01:34:43,028 --> 01:34:47,470
[SPEAKER_02]: technologically, you know, the rules of information, etc.

1099
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:54,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in education, higher education and secondary level private education for many years.

1100
01:34:54,952 --> 01:35:09,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the registrar's office would have a software system, the admissions office would have a software system, the nurse's office, you know, all of it, the academic office.

1101
01:35:09,058 --> 01:35:09,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's

1102
01:35:10,493 --> 01:35:15,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I called in and said, my family is moving, and my son Johnny is moving.

1103
01:35:15,824 --> 01:35:21,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told the nurse's office that wouldn't filter out to all of the others.

1104
01:35:22,228 --> 01:35:24,870
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get an integrated system, you tell one, they all know.

1105
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:26,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

1106
01:35:26,091 --> 01:35:26,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.

1107
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:29,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's right for government.

1108
01:35:29,393 --> 01:35:30,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to learn more about it.

1109
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:35,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But the branches of government are supposed to be independent.

1110
01:35:35,597 --> 01:35:38,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're supposed to work together, but they're also supposed to have independence.

1111
01:35:39,579 --> 01:35:43,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's how their checks and balances, right?

1112
01:35:44,022 --> 01:35:50,246
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, the issue that we had recently that made the paper with the firefighters

1113
01:35:51,860 --> 01:36:06,445
[SPEAKER_01]: RetroPay and things like that, part of the problem allegedly that it wasn't being processed as quickly is because it had to go through like three or four different systems and then be hand checked.

1114
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:13,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe, I don't know, maybe that, maybe if we had what he was talking about, it would be a whole lot easier.

1115
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:21,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that it wouldn't be, but I don't know if it would be a good idea to have it for the different branches of government.

1116
01:36:21,884 --> 01:36:28,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I could see, I mean, the mayor's office has a ton of departments that it has to oversee and all that.

1117
01:36:29,849 --> 01:36:32,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I don't know.

1118
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:33,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1119
01:36:33,511 --> 01:36:34,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1120
01:36:34,571 --> 01:36:35,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's,

1121
01:36:36,847 --> 01:36:38,408
[SPEAKER_02]: They're separate branches of government.

1122
01:36:38,768 --> 01:36:42,251
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's how the governments work, right?

1123
01:36:42,731 --> 01:36:49,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something for us to just, you know, I don't mind taking another look, taking a bit of a look at it and bringing it back.

1124
01:36:49,276 --> 01:36:55,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can look at it, but I don't think we can recommend a specific software in the charter.

1125
01:36:57,062 --> 01:36:57,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?

1126
01:36:57,802 --> 01:37:01,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1127
01:37:01,985 --> 01:37:03,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's the role of the charter.

1128
01:37:05,428 --> 01:37:06,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1129
01:37:08,672 --> 01:37:16,878
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely can put things in the charter that encourage, you know, the branches of government to interact more.

1130
01:37:17,218 --> 01:37:21,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, intergovernmental communications, you know, and so forth like that.

1131
01:37:22,682 --> 01:37:26,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think we, you know, that's why we put the annual budget meeting in there.

1132
01:37:26,945 --> 01:37:29,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they having something like that this year?

1133
01:37:29,387 --> 01:37:32,429
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

1134
01:37:32,509 --> 01:37:33,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard of anything.

1135
01:37:34,156 --> 01:37:35,636
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I, I, I don't know.

1136
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:42,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, it seems like what they're doing, you know, the school committee is starting their process next week.

1137
01:37:42,778 --> 01:37:49,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and their process has changed over the last few years as well, um, from what it used to be like.

1138
01:37:49,499 --> 01:38:01,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the city council, uh, they had two meetings where they listed out their priorities, which are going to the mayor actually, uh, by tomorrow.

1139
01:38:02,242 --> 01:38:13,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't remember what happens in between, but they're starting their parade of department heads coming in between April 15th and May 15th.

1140
01:38:14,167 --> 01:38:15,047
[SPEAKER_01]: With the city council.

1141
01:38:15,667 --> 01:38:15,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1142
01:38:15,907 --> 01:38:16,988
[SPEAKER_01]: With the city council.

1143
01:38:17,448 --> 01:38:19,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the full budget coming.

1144
01:38:19,509 --> 01:38:19,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1145
01:38:20,249 --> 01:38:24,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they usually do that in June after they get the budget.

1146
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:26,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're doing the.

1147
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:31,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Department heads between April 15th and May 15th.

1148
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:34,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the budget is due to them.

1149
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:43,822
[SPEAKER_01]: By May 31st, June 1 and then after that, if they feel like they need to bring in a department head.

1150
01:38:44,602 --> 01:38:48,583
[SPEAKER_01]: For a 2nd time, or if the mayor feels like.

1151
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:53,514
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, such and such a department head should go back to the city council.

1152
01:38:54,195 --> 01:38:55,736
[SPEAKER_01]: That can happen in June.

1153
01:38:56,377 --> 01:39:08,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it means that June isn't going to be, it used to be that, you know, June, you know, was like a total madhouse to getting it, you know, all the department heads in.

1154
01:39:08,449 --> 01:39:10,791
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they were having Saturday sessions.

1155
01:39:11,708 --> 01:39:28,354
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly because the police and the fire, some of the budgets can get in and out in 10 or 15 minutes, and they do eight or 10 of them between six and nine at night on a Tuesday or a Wednesday.

1156
01:39:28,774 --> 01:39:29,895
[SPEAKER_01]: But the police and the fire,

1157
01:39:31,013 --> 01:39:34,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would go on a Saturday, you know, and you, the police would present from, like, 9 to sometimes 1030 or 11 o'clock.

1158
01:39:35,556 --> 01:39:37,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would go on a Saturday.

1159
01:39:46,223 --> 01:40:06,736
[SPEAKER_01]: five-minute break the fire department would come in for another hour and a half and then the next Saturday they do the DPW and under the DPW you have not only the commissioner Tim McGivern but you have water and sewer and wires and trees and so each of those little niche areas would come in as well.

1160
01:40:08,757 --> 01:40:10,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a madhouse in June to get it all done.

1161
01:40:10,678 --> 01:40:12,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1162
01:40:12,519 --> 01:40:13,240
[SPEAKER_01]: In April and May.

1163
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:15,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I am.

1164
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:18,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a big job every year, no matter what.

1165
01:40:18,771 --> 01:40:22,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that can be done to improve the process is good.

1166
01:40:24,512 --> 01:40:24,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1167
01:40:25,112 --> 01:40:25,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1168
01:40:25,272 --> 01:40:25,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1169
01:40:26,012 --> 01:40:29,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, I think we made a lot of progress.

1170
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:38,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will eventually was going to be probably the most complicated we knocked out.

1171
01:40:38,534 --> 01:40:38,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1172
01:40:39,314 --> 01:40:40,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1173
01:40:40,655 --> 01:40:40,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1174
01:40:41,155 --> 01:40:42,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

1175
01:40:42,935 --> 01:40:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1176
01:40:44,355 --> 01:40:45,975
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing really well, actually.

1177
01:40:46,535 --> 01:40:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting close.

1178
01:40:50,676 --> 01:40:52,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I will send the minutes.

1179
01:40:52,597 --> 01:40:57,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I will send out a schedule or suggestions for another meeting date.

1180
01:40:59,038 --> 01:41:06,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will contact Nina to see if she's open to meeting with us to answer some of these questions.

1181
01:41:06,819 --> 01:41:07,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

1182
01:41:07,819 --> 01:41:10,380
[SPEAKER_00]: What are our upcoming meeting dates?

1183
01:41:11,781 --> 01:41:14,462
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something next week.

1184
01:41:14,502 --> 01:41:15,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Public engagement group.

1185
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:33,890
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1186
01:41:41,507 --> 01:41:44,428
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty good working draft of the whole charter.

1187
01:41:44,448 --> 01:41:46,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think we would.

1188
01:41:46,628 --> 01:41:49,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the summer is going to be writing the final report.

1189
01:41:49,929 --> 01:41:57,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it sounds like in our meeting on April 4th, we should have two and three done.

1190
01:41:57,972 --> 01:41:59,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.

1191
01:42:01,126 --> 01:42:02,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Elections is 7, right?

1192
01:42:02,808 --> 01:42:05,330
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I did some of that.

1193
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:08,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we already did that right?

1194
01:42:08,093 --> 01:42:13,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Nova 7, 7, just bringing it to the entire committee for any review or tweaks.

1195
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:13,218
7.

1196
01:42:13,258 --> 01:42:16,381
[SPEAKER_01]: 4 should hopefully be done if not by April 18th meeting.

1197
01:42:23,668 --> 01:42:28,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be, yeah, I mean, you guys are going to are going to present in April 18th.

1198
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is going to be, you know, is it going to mean we have to go back to city council, but we'll see.

1199
01:42:35,373 --> 01:42:41,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 6 is almost done 6 and then the, the, that sort of.

1200
01:42:42,614 --> 01:42:45,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Administrative one, five, we'll have to look at that.

1201
01:42:45,996 --> 01:42:48,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That might just be mostly standard language.

1202
01:42:48,217 --> 01:42:51,719
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look at that and see if there's anything in there that we want to look at more closely.

1203
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:58,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the one definitions and whatnot, which is again, mostly standard language.

1204
01:42:59,264 --> 01:43:03,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think, isn't there a nine and a 10, which are kind of basic?

1205
01:43:05,187 --> 01:43:08,649
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, yeah, there was one that was the thing about.

1206
01:43:08,669 --> 01:43:11,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, reviewing the chatter and things.

1207
01:43:12,707 --> 01:43:12,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1208
01:43:13,067 --> 01:43:14,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

1209
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.

1210
01:43:15,929 --> 01:43:16,830
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do that too.

1211
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:19,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But but it was mostly basic.

1212
01:43:20,772 --> 01:43:21,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1213
01:43:21,092 --> 01:43:21,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1214
01:43:22,793 --> 01:43:23,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Most meat on it.

1215
01:43:24,975 --> 01:43:31,098
[SPEAKER_01]: By by the second May meeting, I think all the stuff with the most meat on it should be done.

1216
01:43:31,919 --> 01:43:32,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so too.

1217
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So very exciting.

1218
01:43:34,561 --> 01:43:38,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your all your participation.

1219
01:43:38,663 --> 01:43:39,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is

1220
01:43:40,334 --> 01:43:40,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1221
01:43:41,294 --> 01:43:42,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to our leader.

1222
01:43:43,415 --> 01:43:45,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, don't know how you're keeping it all together.

1223
01:43:45,616 --> 01:43:47,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw that you're doing some art stuff too.

1224
01:43:49,298 --> 01:43:50,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Copious free time.

1225
01:43:51,459 --> 01:43:52,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my pottery.

1226
01:43:52,339 --> 01:43:52,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1227
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:53,540
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to do that.

1228
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:54,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep me sane.

1229
01:43:56,701 --> 01:43:57,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's got to.

1230
01:43:59,242 --> 01:43:59,583
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1231
01:43:59,923 --> 01:44:01,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great rest of the day.

1232
01:44:01,103 --> 01:44:02,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1233
01:44:02,324 --> 01:44:02,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

1234
01:44:02,604 --> 01:44:03,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1235
01:44:03,524 --> 01:44:04,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care guys.

1236
01:44:04,085 --> 01:44:04,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
