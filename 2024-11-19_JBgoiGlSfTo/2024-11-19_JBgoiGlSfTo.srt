[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

73
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, I have some.

74
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:19,261
[SPEAKER_12]: I just put the information on slides to make it easier for you

75
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:23,791
[SPEAKER_12]: committee, if you can let me know if I can share that.

76
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:25,996
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be all set now to share your screen.

77
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:27,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there we go.

78
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

79
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:47,889
[SPEAKER_12]: So the members of the council will remember, and for the new members, our community development block grant funding every year requires that we submit an annual action plan, and the director comes before you and submits the funding.

80
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:58,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Every five years, we also have to submit a consolidated plan that is our five-year strategic plan for how we will be spending money over the next five years.

81
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:01,058
[SPEAKER_12]: of CDBG funding.

82
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:15,203
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a process that was started essentially a year ago, and I just wanted to just very quickly give you some highlights of that so that you're aware of the background for this, particularly for the new members, but also because this is only done every five years.

83
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:29,068
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a five-year consolidated plan we'll be submitting to the federal government that was introduced to the public in mid-March through a public meeting that we held,

84
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:33,170
[SPEAKER_12]: and has been on our website and available from Ashley since then.

85
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:41,494
[SPEAKER_12]: That plan is 101 pages long because of the formatting that the federal government requires in it.

86
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,357
[SPEAKER_12]: So very, very briefly, I have a few slides to tell you.

87
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:55,122
[SPEAKER_12]: It includes the process at how we came to here, a needs assessment of the community, a market analysis with demographics, and a strategic plan.

88
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:03,352
[SPEAKER_12]: The needs assessment was started around this time last summer.

89
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:14,443
[SPEAKER_12]: This time last year, we are part of a five community coalition with Malden is the lead agency that revolves particularly around our home housing funding.

90
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:20,549
[SPEAKER_12]: So they hired a consultant who went out they did a needs assessment.

91
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:31,989
[SPEAKER_12]: which included stakeholder interviews, web-based survey, public sessions, including March 11th, and then today, public comment, which has been open since March 11th, and Ashley received comments.

92
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,454
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we are able to incorporate any comments that are submitted today.

93
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,530
[SPEAKER_12]: We then look specifically at our non-housing needs.

94
00:08:41,630 --> 00:09:04,280
[SPEAKER_12]: The consortium looks at the housing needs, the needs that were listed by the consultants who did the review, and just very quickly, public open space, recreation, facility improvements to make facilities comply with public safety and access standards, preservation and protection of environmental and historic resources,

95
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, updates to facilities, including firehouses, public schools, libraries, shelters to persons with special need and neighborhood facilities.

96
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:20,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Improvement to streets, water and sewer lines, flood and drainage, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, parking lots and tree planting.

97
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:33,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And then activities to assist businesses, including storefront revitalization are all things that were identified over the course of this process that are allowable expenses under CDBG.

98
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:54,198
[SPEAKER_12]: They looked at public service needs, which included transportation for those in need, affordable childcare services, access to food and emergency services, transitional housing, life skill building, supportive services and advocacy, English as a second language classes and job preparedness.

99
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:58,119
[SPEAKER_12]: The strategic plan that is in the 101 page plan,

100
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:04,955
[SPEAKER_12]: The first goal is to support the expansion and preservation of affordable housing.

101
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:06,436
[SPEAKER_12]: The numbers.

102
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:10,399
[SPEAKER_12]: The second goal is to increase economic development opportunities.

103
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,423
[SPEAKER_12]: The third is to enhance parks, public facilities and infrastructure.

104
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:19,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fourth goal is to enhance public services.

105
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:21,488
[SPEAKER_12]: To that end, the

106
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:27,900
[SPEAKER_12]: We put together a budget for the first year of the action plan.

107
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:37,088
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this, which was emailed out to the Councilors, the goal lists a description of projects and the amounts.

108
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:45,316
[SPEAKER_12]: So for the affordable housing for this coming fiscal year, we're recommending and I'll just round $217,000.

109
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:52,207
[SPEAKER_12]: to increase, that's 14% of our allocated funds.

110
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:58,113
[SPEAKER_12]: The economic development opportunities, we're recommending 236,000, that's 15%.

111
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:09,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a place where we would include some of the grants and assistance that we're talking about for small businesses, although we also have additional funding for that.

112
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:16,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Enhancing parks, public facilities and infrastructure, we're recommending $551,000.

113
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,700
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 35%.

114
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:22,706
[SPEAKER_12]: That is typically where Medford puts the bulk of its funds is into this category.

115
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:28,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the public services, we are typically, you may all remember, limited to 15%.

116
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:34,586
[SPEAKER_12]: This year because of the health emergency that cap was lifted.

117
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:45,410
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're actually recommending 16% this year and that meets the needs of the public service agencies as they expressed it to us on that's $255,000, and then planning and administration.

118
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:57,436
[SPEAKER_12]: and that includes staff salaries, consultants, the housing production plan, and that's $314,000.

119
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,317
[SPEAKER_12]: The planning administration is capped at 20%.

120
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:13,583
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll then remind you that we had the public service agencies presented on virtual hearing in April, and they spoke to these dollar amounts.

121
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:17,025
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is the amount of money that we are recommending

122
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:27,294
[SPEAKER_12]: because they lifted the cap, rather than nickel and diming the agencies altogether, they requested 16% of our funding rather than 15.

123
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:36,140
[SPEAKER_12]: And we said, let's just give them the 16% this year, because we're allowed to do that as an exception to the rule this year.

124
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:48,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so what is not in this plan, and I kind of wanted to call that out, but also share with you is the, um, CDBG coronavirus funding.

125
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:54,234
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got, we're getting extra funding this fiscal year, um, because of the health emergency.

126
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:59,135
[SPEAKER_12]: So we did do a grant round to our public service agencies for that.

127
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:05,576
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the third page on the handout that you received via email, and then I'm showing on the screen now.

128
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:11,238
[SPEAKER_12]: is what was requested of the coronavirus funding.

129
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:17,561
[SPEAKER_12]: It is not part of our regular annual plan, but I wanted to include it so that you'd be aware of this.

130
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:27,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, housing families is requesting an extra $52,000 as cm transportation is asking for 12,000.

131
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:36,361
[SPEAKER_12]: The mold and why, and I must point out that they've, they run the mystic community market which is our largest food pantry in Medford.

132
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,642
[SPEAKER_12]: They're asking for just shy of $62,000 from the coronavirus funding.

133
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:47,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've determined that Medford's are you okay program that's being run out of City Hall.

134
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:58,324
[SPEAKER_12]: We, we spun that program up without knowing how exactly how we were going to pay for it because we knew we needed it in this emergency situation, and we can fund it through this program.

135
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:00,954
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's $21,000.

136
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:14,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are the recommendations of the community development office and the mayor for this year's annual annual funding for this community development block grant.

137
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:17,085
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll just stop there.

00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:26,631

141
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:35,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, just a quick question.

142
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:40,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we voting on the additional stuff that you just presented to us or is that coming at a later time?

143
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,019
[SPEAKER_02]: The COVID stuff.

144
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:54,284
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize, I had hit mute.

145
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:57,706
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm always nervous that my children are gonna make noise while I'm trying to speak with you.

146
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,172
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not, it does not include the COVID funding.

147
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:08,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe we're actually going to need a city council vote on the COVID funding.

148
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:14,800
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my understanding right now, but I wanted to present it to you so that you would have that information as well.

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:15,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Hurtubise, any questions that have come in through email?

[SPEAKER_07]: We have the city engineer here to present regarding safe routes to school project.

197
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:46,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

198
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:48,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications from the mayor, 20-355.

199
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Council President Falco,

200
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,057
[SPEAKER_10]: and honorable members of the Medford City Council.

201
00:16:55,397 --> 00:17:03,823
[SPEAKER_10]: As you are aware, the city is working in coordination with MassDOT to plan for safe routes to school project for the Brooks Elementary School.

202
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:12,770
[SPEAKER_10]: The project involves improvements to sidewalks that directly abut private residential parcels.

203
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:20,196
[SPEAKER_10]: The federal funding granted for this project requires that the right-of-way be in complete ownership and physical control of the city.

204
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,817
[SPEAKER_10]: The survey prepared

205
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:30,630
[SPEAKER_10]: for the project identify 12 private properties that contain public infrastructure or require a temporary construction easement.

206
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:43,825
[SPEAKER_10]: In order to meet the requirements of the projects, permanent easements will alter the High Street, Mystic Street, and Walcott Street layouts to encompass the public infrastructure in temporary easements with

207
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:46,643
[SPEAKER_10]: will facilitate construction of sidewalks.

208
00:17:47,223 --> 00:18:05,736
[SPEAKER_10]: The written offer was sent to the 12 property owners via certified mail on April 2, 2020, and Tim McGibbon, City Engineer, has been in contact with each owner to address concerns throughout this process, starting from the initial contact letter back in December 2019.

209
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:21,436
[SPEAKER_10]: easements were appraised by a certified general appraiser and those appraisals were reviewed by a certified general review appraiser to establish just compensation for the easements.

210
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:33,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I respectfully request that the city council vote to approve the attached order of taking associated with these easements at your regular May 12, 2020 meeting and therefore approve

211
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:37,779
[SPEAKER_10]: the alternations of High Street, Mystic Street, and Walcott Street.

212
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:49,086
[SPEAKER_10]: The alternations of High Street, Mystic Street, and Walcott Street are approved by the Mayor and recommended to the City Council by the Community Development Board via unanimous vote on March 25, 2020.

213
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:55,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. McGibbon will be in attendance to answer any questions on this matter.

214
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

215
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:05,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Additional documents may be inspected in the office of the city clerk, Bedford City Hall, Bedford, Massachusetts.

216
00:19:07,691 --> 00:19:09,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's see.

217
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:14,372
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a city engineer with us tonight, Tim McGibbon.

218
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:18,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, I don't know if you want to maybe

219
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:22,870
[SPEAKER_10]: speak to this a little bit, or if the councillors have questions, we can go with the questions.

220
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you want to lead off with what we're doing, that'd be great.

221
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:28,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly, I'll lead off.

222
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,435
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you very much for suspending the rules for me here.

223
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:33,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Wonderful.

224
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:40,199
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think all councillors know, I think I spoke with just about every one of you between

225
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,902
[SPEAKER_17]: over the last couple of weeks, basically.

226
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:49,669
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is a milestone in a process that started in November, really.

227
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,414
[SPEAKER_17]: The first letters went out in December, as noted in the letter.

228
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:58,859
[SPEAKER_17]: And the process is defined by MassDOT

229
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,681
[SPEAKER_17]: what's called a right-of-way certificate.

230
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:17,627
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's basically any public infrastructure, such as the edge of a sidewalk, for example, which is the case, a lot of the cases with these easements, needs to be within the public right-of-way to have the project move forward.

231
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:32,975
[SPEAKER_17]: So, most of these easements, the permanent easements anyway, are alterations, minor alterations of the high street layout and the intersections with Walcott and Mystic Street, which are all public laid out, public accepted ways.

232
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:42,280
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the process as defined by MassDOT as well as our local procedures, you know,

233
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:49,787
[SPEAKER_17]: You said a lot of it that's written in the letter, but basically we notify all the owners of the property.

234
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,007
[SPEAKER_17]: We did that back in November.

235
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:55,870
[SPEAKER_17]: I personally interviewed each owner in person to answer questions, hear concerns.

236
00:20:56,751 --> 00:21:01,394
[SPEAKER_17]: We performed title exams as well as the extra step of certifications, title certifications.

237
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:13,421
[SPEAKER_17]: We also performed appraisals with a special certification, a type of appraisal, and then had those reviewed by basically a third party review appraiser.

238
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:31,881
[SPEAKER_17]: And then on April 2nd, we made written offers to the owners and we had the Community Development Board also recommended and endorsed the plans for the easements.

239
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:42,529
[SPEAKER_17]: And once we're approved, assuming that we approve here, it would then get recorded and payment would be tendered to the owners.

240
00:21:45,325 --> 00:22:04,275
[SPEAKER_17]: The, I think there's a couple of things just to note there are basically two types of easements, and then within the permanent easements is two types in there too so basically this temporary easements for construction, and that's for a temporary time period, it's five years, the way we wrote the order.

241
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:15,778
[SPEAKER_17]: And that allows the contractor to set a form at the back of a sidewalk, for example, or repair a walkway that may go from the sidewalk onto the private property, things like that.

242
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,959
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there are permanent easements that alter the Hyde Street right-of-way.

243
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of these are slivers of private property where a public sidewalk is on private property.

244
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:31,244
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's basically a correction of the right-of-way.

245
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:41,432
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's one more, and that is we're converting the Hastings High Street intersection from a private way to a public way.

246
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:43,493
[SPEAKER_17]: So the whole intersection becomes public.

247
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:47,016
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are a couple of the larger permanent easements.

248
00:22:49,554 --> 00:23:05,322
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it, this is one step and one item and one milestone for the larger Safe Routes to School project that has been going through the different milestones as time goes on.

249
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:07,543
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm happy to answer any questions.

250
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:11,645
[SPEAKER_17]: I also have a bunch of material if we need to reference anything or pull up anything on the screen, so.

251
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:13,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

252
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, we have Councilor Morell.

253
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:20,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Councilor Knight actually had his hand up first.

254
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:23,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I apologize Councilor Knight.

255
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:31,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, you're the chair you can pick what you want so it doesn't matter to me.

256
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,271
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go first it's fine with me.

257
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:34,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

258
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:45,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Just question for Tim remind me about the, the easements as far as the, the funding for the minor easements remind me just what that amount is and where it comes from.

259
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,737
[SPEAKER_17]: to be able to use that money for other things.

260
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:49,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it appropriate use of that money?

261
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:12,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

262
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:24,206
[SPEAKER_19]: So Tim, as I understand the project that's before us this evening, the only matter that the council really has the purview to vote on this evening would be whether or not we authorize the land taking.

263
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:24,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that correct?

264
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,327
[SPEAKER_17]: That is correct.

265
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:31,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's a pretty narrow purview tonight.

266
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:39,669
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is, yeah, to establish the easements and the order of taking and therefore the alteration of those three roadways.

267
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:50,649
[SPEAKER_19]: And I did hear in your presentation that a hundred percent of the property owners that are impacted by this have signed off on the project There's there's no actual sign off Councilor Knight.

268
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,371
[SPEAKER_17]: I have talked to all of them.

269
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,234
[SPEAKER_17]: They are in favor of In general they're in favor.

270
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:59,497
[SPEAKER_17]: I cannot speak for them Some of them may be here tonight.

271
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:01,639
[SPEAKER_17]: They are aware tonight.

272
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:05,222
[SPEAKER_17]: They are aware of tonight They were notified through the the process statute and

273
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:11,226
[SPEAKER_17]: and I also went the extra mile and called them and made sure they knew about tonight as well.

274
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:28,697
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't received any comments or letters or emails that would demonstrate that they are against granting easement or take issue with the damages proposed.

275
00:25:28,997 --> 00:25:32,319
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a 30-day waiting period to confirm that fact.

276
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:42,711
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and I didn't receive any further information from any of the property owners in the 30 day period.

277
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:48,115
[SPEAKER_17]: I would guess that they're pretty okay with receiving the money for doing very little.

278
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:55,730
[SPEAKER_19]: So, but you've, so have you had, has their personal contact been made with 100% of the people that are going to be impacted by this?

279
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that is correct.

280
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:57,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

281
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:57,771
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

282
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:04,355
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, you know, I don't want to see this thing, say we vote on it tonight and then tomorrow someone saying, what the hell are they doing on my front lawn?

283
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:05,416
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?

284
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:07,878
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to make sure that everybody's well aware.

285
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:14,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Communications have been a strong suit in the city of Medford when it comes to certain aspects of construction projects.

286
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:20,070
[SPEAKER_17]: this particular, and it's a good point, Councilor Knight, this particular project, it's unavoidable.

287
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:30,144
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been in constant contact and actually have to submit diaries for each owner to MassDOT that gives the date, the topic of conversation.

288
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:33,067
[SPEAKER_17]: how I made contact, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

289
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,749
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's pretty strict.

290
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:39,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Some owners are more willing to talk and chat and meet than others.

291
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:42,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And some have much more questions.

292
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:46,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the owners, you know, they just kind of going through the motions.

293
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,724
[SPEAKER_17]: So it depends on each owner.

294
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:54,116
[SPEAKER_17]: And this funding that we're receiving, it's about a million bucks, you said, and it's going to be coming from the state?

295
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:59,038
[SPEAKER_17]: The project is about, I think the number is $1.2 million.

296
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:05,920
[SPEAKER_17]: A portion of that, I think a significant portion, I don't know the exact number, I apologize, is federally funded.

297
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:11,562
[SPEAKER_17]: So most of it is federally funded, and then the state is making up some, it's the $200,000 and $300,000.

298
00:27:14,823 --> 00:27:18,664
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not city money for this project, and we actually don't even need to execute the project.

299
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:25,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Once the project begins, we'll be providing oversight, and I'm the representative for those property owners moving forward as well with the project.

300
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:28,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that how that works?

301
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:34,688
[SPEAKER_19]: So based on the current financial state at the federal and state level, is that commitment for those funds still there?

302
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:40,889
[SPEAKER_17]: I have not heard otherwise, and I did ask that question, and it remains status quo.

303
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:41,958
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

304
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:51,923
[SPEAKER_20]: And the last question that I have, and I promise it's my last question, would be, what's the estimated cost to the taxpayer for the completion of this project?

305
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:58,286
[SPEAKER_18]: You said it's about $83,000 in Chapter 90 funds that we're going to be using from our budget that would go to roadway repairs for this project.

306
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:03,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any other expenditure that would have to come out of the city's coffers in order for us to complete the project?

307
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:12,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Besides sort of my time, my staff's time, and then...

308
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:20,809
[SPEAKER_17]: significant costs for fees, like, for example, I have to register, I mean, sorry, record all the documents, that's going to be $500 or something.

309
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Things like that.

310
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:38,000
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if the city chooses to piggyback on this project, other projects, which I will most likely recommend that we do, so what, you know, what we want to do between now and when that project gets executed is making sure that

311
00:28:39,180 --> 00:29:01,285
[SPEAKER_18]: You know if there's any water valves that need to be replaced we replace them things like that In terms of just the scope of the grant, you know, I mean, I'm not worried about other structure projects that might come along with it I mean if we're planning smartly, I would hope that that's what we do I would hope that if we're gonna up the street that we go on the ground and we fix the underground infrastructure to Yeah, but in terms of the funds Yeah, okay

312
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,442
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, great.

313
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:11,165
[SPEAKER_19]: But it wouldn't exceed $100,000 is what you're telling me based upon the 83,000 from the Chapter 90 funds and then any ancillary costs.

314
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:12,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

315
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:18,787
[SPEAKER_17]: And we did also spend money out of Chapter 90 to hire the appraiser and the title certification.

316
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:23,889
[SPEAKER_17]: But that money that we spent already, we're not going to spend in the future.

317
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:24,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

318
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,210
[SPEAKER_19]: It's already been

319
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:28,374
[SPEAKER_19]: That money's out the window already.

320
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:29,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Out the window, yeah.

321
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:33,358
[SPEAKER_17]: We needed to spend a certain amount of money in order to get the 1.2 mil.

322
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, okay.

323
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:47,911
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so in terms of the overall investment that the city's made in the return on the investment, we're looking at making an investment of maybe somewhere around $150,000 for the total cost to the community, and we're getting a million point two back?

324
00:29:48,572 --> 00:29:50,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's a good way to put it, yep.

325
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:51,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, excellent.

326
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:51,975
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. McGiven.

327
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:52,515
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate it.

328
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:53,796
[SPEAKER_19]: You always do come prepared.

329
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,137
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

330
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:55,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

331
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:56,189
[SPEAKER_06]: God's all night.

332
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,889
[SPEAKER_06]: God's love.

333
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:57,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Morel.

334
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

335
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few more questions.

336
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:13,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Tim, if you could remind me just procedurally what the steps are as far as between now and you know if this project's approved, uh, or what levels it has to be approved for work to actually begin.

337
00:30:13,754 --> 00:30:19,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand it's been approved by the mayor and then tonight we're voting on orders of the taking.

338
00:30:19,395 --> 00:30:22,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there are there any additional things that the council has to vote on?

339
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:24,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And what stands between now and if the project were to start?

340
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:39,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, um, so, so far we have approval by the mayor approval by the planning board approval by the traffic commission, and then hopefully after tonight approval by this entity, and then after this.

341
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:46,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Once we get the right-of-way certificate, there are a couple things we have to do, record the documents, tender payments, things like that.

342
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:50,227
[SPEAKER_17]: MassDOT holds the reins on the project.

343
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:56,731
[SPEAKER_17]: And as far as I understand, this is one of the last pieces they need to advertise for bid.

344
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,494
[SPEAKER_17]: So once they advertise for bid, the train has left the station.

345
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:03,056
[SPEAKER_17]: and the project is moving forward.

346
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:07,601
[SPEAKER_17]: It's gonna take a while to get from advertise the bid to shovel in the ground.

347
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:17,491
[SPEAKER_17]: But all the approvals sort of, the traffic commission was the, for example, the regulatory approval for the change in the traffic, the change in the parking.

348
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:22,536
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this would be the approval for the land rights transfer.

349
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:28,539
[SPEAKER_17]: and then obviously planning board has to make that recommendation.

350
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,781
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is one step in that process.

351
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:37,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't believe that there would be any other council action.

352
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:42,345
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not 100% certain on that, but I believe that is the case.

353
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:43,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

354
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:47,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And remind me, these funding opportunities through Safe Routes to School,

355
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:48,943
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very competitive.

356
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:55,225
[SPEAKER_06]: How many about, do you know, are given out across the country, uh, are awarded, um, yearly or how often they're awarded?

357
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:58,326
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not know the answer to that question.

358
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:00,526
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, Todd Blake is in attendance.

359
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,046
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if he knows the answer.

360
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, Todd, if you do, could you chime in?

361
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if he does, but he might, I don't.

362
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:08,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

363
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:11,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, would you know the answer to that question?

364
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd?

365
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:41,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I do know it's a competitive process and one of the things that they're looking for is to make sure that the municipalities are ready because I think there's other municipalities that want this money.

366
00:32:42,215 --> 00:32:43,776
[SPEAKER_17]: So we were lucky to win this

367
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:50,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

368
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello, then Councilor Marks.

369
00:32:53,462 --> 00:32:54,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello.

370
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:55,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

371
00:32:56,367 --> 00:33:01,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim, what would be the average payout to the property owner for these small pieces of land?

372
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:02,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

373
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:11,117
[SPEAKER_17]: The average is tough because it ranges from $50 to, I think one of them is $24,000.

374
00:33:11,937 --> 00:33:14,858
[SPEAKER_17]: So the average is not really an average.

375
00:33:15,158 --> 00:33:16,199
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, that's the range.

376
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,560
[SPEAKER_17]: So most of them are in the thousands of dollars in the three figures, $4,000, $5,000, $8,000.

377
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,580
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple of big ones.

378
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,040
[SPEAKER_17]: One's $24,000, like I said.

379
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I think one's $16,000.

380
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:22,201
[SPEAKER_17]: The total is $83,000.

381
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:22,681
[SPEAKER_17]: The smallest is $50,000.

382
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:33,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a couple of that are $150 in the hundreds.

383
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:36,809
[SPEAKER_17]: And those are one square foot, 10 square feet, five square feet, things like that.

384
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:37,930
[SPEAKER_17]: They're very, very small ones.

385
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:46,297
[SPEAKER_17]: So the big ones are for the temporary easements because temporary easements are larger in square foot and they're paid out a little bit differently.

386
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:48,118
[SPEAKER_17]: They're assessed a little bit differently.

387
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:48,739
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're bigger.

388
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:55,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, where are these funds coming from to pay the easements from us or the DOT?

389
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:56,614
[SPEAKER_17]: These are, these are chapter 90.

390
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:59,358
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to use chapter 90, the state allocation for roadway work.

391
00:33:59,698 --> 00:33:59,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

392
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:03,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, Tim, uh, I am going to vote in favor of this this evening.

393
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:09,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my only question is, um, I, I wish the city council had been brought into this, uh, a little sooner.

394
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So we knew what was going on rather than at the last minute.

395
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:18,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And I support all the sidewalk and street improvements.

396
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:27,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've lived in this neighborhood for 40 plus years, both on Hastings Lane and where I am now off of Mystic Street.

397
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:28,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So my kids all went to the Brooks School.

398
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:29,684
[SPEAKER_03]: They all walked to school.

399
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't ever remember seeing a lot of kids riding their bike to school.

400
00:34:35,248 --> 00:35:02,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So and that's really the my only uh complaint is um We're doing a three block bike lane that goes to nowhere And that's really the only I mean they say the sidewalk improvements the curbs everything else is is a great idea And I and I I that is a but again, I just I don't fathom uh, the rationale of a three block uh bike route So, uh, that's then that's my two cents

401
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:19,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Understood understood and I think you know, I as I've explained I think to everybody Mastod has certain criteria The city has a complete streets policy and the bike lane ideally We've built a maybe a three or four block section of it.

402
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,521
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a plan a master plan For the whole city.

403
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:29,607
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you know in the future future projects extending that bike lane could happen I don't know but

404
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,669
[SPEAKER_17]: It isn't just going to be to nowhere forever.

405
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:39,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And even if it is to nowhere, it does provide a certain level of safety improvement for everybody.

406
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,493
[SPEAKER_17]: I hear you.

407
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:48,077
[SPEAKER_03]: High Street is not the most popular bike route in the city of Medford.

408
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:48,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you.

409
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:49,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you.

410
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:51,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

411
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:53,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

412
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

413
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:56,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

414
00:35:56,812 --> 00:36:06,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And first, I'd like to applaud the Brooks School for, I believe it's been six years for this grant.

415
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:19,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And many of the improvements, 99% of them of which I agree with, will do tremendous in traffic calming and making a high street or a portion of high street safer to travel.

416
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:23,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do support a big portion of this, Mr. President.

417
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim, I had a question for you.

418
00:36:25,372 --> 00:36:26,473
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about easements.

419
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:34,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there are several properties that are privately owned that have private property on city property.

420
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:48,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was told by yourself that the state was going to put out an agreement that they weren't going to go after property owners that may have encroached on city property.

421
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:51,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you just give us a little update on that?

422
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:52,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

423
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:59,763
[SPEAKER_17]: So one of the requirements that MassDOT had at the beginning was to secure all encroachments.

424
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:09,609
[SPEAKER_17]: What that means is you either need to remove the encroachment from the public way or enter an agreement with the property owner to allow the encroachment to stay.

425
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:14,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Encroachments are basically a form of trespassing.

426
00:37:15,932 --> 00:37:20,315
[SPEAKER_17]: You have private property and someone else's property, in this case, the public way.

427
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:23,323
[SPEAKER_17]: So there was 29 of those.

428
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:35,169
[SPEAKER_17]: And myself and the city solicitor spent some time looking at this, researching it, digging into it, talking with MassDOT.

429
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:45,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the end of the day, the retaining walls, which run the length of High Street down this corridor, have been there for quite a long time.

430
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:47,775
[SPEAKER_17]: We have plans from 1908 that have those walls on them.

431
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:53,784
[SPEAKER_17]: So MassDOT was convinced that they are, quote, monumental walls.

432
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,751
[SPEAKER_17]: So basically helping to establish the extensive high street.

433
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:06,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Those walls have been there, part of those private parcels, and part of the way for 100 years or more.

434
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:12,506
[SPEAKER_17]: So basically, MassDOT's not requiring that we get those encroachment agreements.

435
00:38:13,046 --> 00:38:17,248
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't really fit quite well into the idea of what an encroachment is.

436
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:24,971
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are statutes out there that protect walls and property that was built before a certain

437
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:27,266
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to be able to do that.

438
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,007
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to be able to do that.

439
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:30,408
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to be able to do that.

440
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:32,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to be able to do that.

441
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,672
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to be able to do that.

442
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:42,358
[SPEAKER_17]: to collect them.

443
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:54,209
[SPEAKER_17]: I have received some back and the property owners that received those encroachment agreements, if they want them, we are more than willing to entertain that and get them signed and make them real.

444
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,150
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no harm in that.

445
00:38:56,411 --> 00:39:03,858
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's something that the property owner can say, am I okay with status quo, having a little bit of the face of my wall in the public way?

446
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:05,160
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been like that for a hundred years.

447
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,101
[SPEAKER_17]: or do I want to enter an agreement with the city to add that extra level of protection?

448
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:20,824
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, at this point, we're leaving it up to the property owners, and I'm going to circle back with the city solicitor and see if we should be following up on all those anyway to help protect the city and those property owners.

449
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:33,808
[SPEAKER_17]: It may be a good thing to do, but at this point, we're sort of pressing pause on that until, you know, until I actually have a chance to write a letter to all of them and say, hey, you know, if you still want this, we can go ahead and move forward with it.

450
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:39,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so just so I understand then regarding this current project of St.

451
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:48,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Ruth's to school, there will be no property, city resident property that will be taken.

452
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,882
[SPEAKER_17]: by DOT or by any other entity.

453
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:54,922
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

454
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:56,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we're not going to remove any encroachments.

455
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:58,224
[SPEAKER_17]: So these walls are monumental walls.

456
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:01,505
[SPEAKER_17]: They're part of establishing that high street right-of-way.

457
00:40:01,825 --> 00:40:05,347
[SPEAKER_17]: It's similar to how you have other monuments that sort of establish bounds.

458
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:12,530
[SPEAKER_17]: So there would be no taking or removing walls, removing fences or any of that.

459
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:12,750
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

460
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:25,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and Mr. President, if I could, I know there, uh, were a number of concerns by, uh, residents, area residents on high street and some of the, uh, budding streets.

461
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:35,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the traffic commission, uh, had a meeting, uh, several months back regarding, uh, the taking of parking spots along high street.

462
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:37,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so this project can move forward.

463
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I know many residents voiced their concern, um, naturally.

464
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:46,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Parking is at a premium, and let's face it, no one wants to lose a parking spot.

465
00:40:48,298 --> 00:41:03,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And we as a council voted unanimously, I believe it was several months back, to ask if DOT and the city could get together and see if they can explore some other options where we may be able to save some parking along High Street.

466
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently that didn't bear any fruit, those discussions.

467
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:19,837
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Mr. President, at the traffic commission meeting, there were several residents that brought up to the traffic commission whether or not they could take a bike lane.

468
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:24,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And during non-peak time, for instance, 7 p.m.

469
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:24,938
[SPEAKER_07]: or 8 p.m.

470
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:33,463
[SPEAKER_07]: at night, have it revert to parking, area parking from 7 p.m., 8 p.m.

471
00:41:33,483 --> 00:41:34,043
[SPEAKER_07]: at night to 6 a.m.

472
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:34,263
[SPEAKER_07]: or 7 a.m.

473
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,043
[SPEAKER_07]: in the morning.

474
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:42,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And the traffic commission said they were going to look into it.

475
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:56,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a discussion today with Chief Buckley, and he reiterated his concerns that, first of all, that DOT made it clear that this project had to have a bike lane.

476
00:41:57,578 --> 00:41:59,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And none of us want to jeopardize a million dollars.

477
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,362
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I did ask him if the traffic commission was going to explore

478
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:12,045
[SPEAKER_07]: possibly turning this bike lane for non-peak hours into parking spots.

479
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:14,706
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said they are going to explore that.

480
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:20,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did get a reassurance from Chief Buckley today that that was under advisement.

481
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:29,293
[SPEAKER_07]: The second piece I just want to touch upon, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, I received a number of emails from people today in support of the project.

482
00:42:30,073 --> 00:42:33,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, 99% of this project I do support.

483
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:48,047
[SPEAKER_07]: The one concern I have, Mr. President, which I found a little terrifying in several of the emails I received, is residents saying that they now can have their elementary school child use High Street to bike to school.

484
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:51,670
[SPEAKER_07]: That really concerns me, Mr. President.

485
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:55,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not one to put a rubber stamp on anything.

486
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:59,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that we may be able to get money for this project is great.

487
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:05,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that this project has a big public safety component in it is great.

488
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:07,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And the traffic calming component is great.

489
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:15,020
[SPEAKER_07]: The one concern I do have, Mr. President, and I know the city engineer said we have more plans to extend our bike lanes.

490
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,002
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why we were told at the beginning the bike lane was going to be on that side of High Street was

491
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:34,047
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's the safest side because when you have bicyclists traveling, for what we were told, you want them, because they're going at a slower speed, to travel uphill rather than downhill.

492
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:37,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And that made it for a safer area and that's why they decided

493
00:43:37,888 --> 00:43:41,330
[SPEAKER_07]: to make the bike lane go up High Street rather than down High Street.

494
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:42,811
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my understanding.

495
00:43:43,392 --> 00:44:07,088
[SPEAKER_07]: My concern is, Mr. President, if residents feel comfortable now having their child bike to school, especially elementary kids on a very, very busy road on High Street, we have a four-block bike lane that goes up High Street, which is the slow part when you're riding a bike, and all of a sudden it stops at the top by Hastings Lane.

496
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:17,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And it goes into the downward slope down High Street and a very winding, dangerous part of High Street, extremely dangerous.

497
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:24,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we'd all be negligent if we didn't step up and say, you know what?

498
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:34,889
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're going to do the bike lane, for the very least, we should extend this, whether it's part of this project or part of the city project, whatever it might be.

499
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:42,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I, in good conscience, have a tough time saying, OK, we'll accept the money, we'll put the bike lane for four blocks, and no one will be the wiser.

500
00:44:43,036 --> 00:44:45,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I foresee a problem, Mr. President,

501
00:44:45,638 --> 00:44:50,939
[SPEAKER_07]: especially if residents think now we're creating a safe zone for children to ride their bikes.

502
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:53,039
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not a safe zone.

503
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:00,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way it breaks off, Mr. President, if anyone's familiar, at the top of Hastings, then it winds down.

504
00:45:00,621 --> 00:45:07,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a very dangerous area to all of a sudden have a bike lane stop, especially for young kids.

505
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:14,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like, Mr. President, to offer a motion tonight that we as a city, if we're going to move forward with this project,

506
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:21,852
[SPEAKER_08]: that we move forward and also extend that bike lane, Mr. President, all the way down High Street.

507
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:27,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll leave it up to the city engineer.

508
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:39,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll leave it up to the traffic engineer to decide when to get to Winthrop Circle and so forth and let them decide the logistics of it.

509
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:45,158
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't have in my conscience to leave a bike path just because it's getting funded for four blocks.

510
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We should turn a blind eye as a city and say, well, that's fine with us.

511
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:50,862
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

512
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:52,103
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to turn down the money.

513
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:54,945
[SPEAKER_07]: We should step up, Mr. President, to the plate.

514
00:45:56,905 --> 00:46:04,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're talking about spots, there's no loss of parking spots on that point of High Street that winds down.

515
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:07,587
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be an ideal place to continue the bike lane.

516
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:14,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when we tell parents, we're creating safe routes to school, we're really creating a safe route.

517
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:21,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Because four blocks that leads to an area that's a dangerous area is not a safe route, Mr. President.

518
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:41,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm going to offer that tonight as a motion that, you know, I'm going to support this project, but it has to be, Mr. President, that we have our city engineer and we'll ask the mayor, because the mayor presented this paper to us, to give us a commitment that that bike lane will be extended, Mr. President, not in the future, but now as part of this project.

519
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the city has to pick up the cost, then so be it, Mr. President.

520
00:46:46,241 --> 00:46:47,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Second that motion, Mr. President.

521
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So Councilor Marks has offered

522
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:57,846
[SPEAKER_10]: in a motion as a B paper to the main paper that has been seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

523
00:46:58,386 --> 00:47:00,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Curtis, do you have the wording in that motion?

524
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:11,717
[SPEAKER_13]: The B paper is to extend the bike lane all the way down High Street with, I mean, and then there was with additional input from the city engineer and the administration.

525
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:16,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, the reason why I say that, I'm not a traffic engineer.

526
00:47:16,353 --> 00:47:17,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a parking engineer.

527
00:47:18,194 --> 00:47:21,637
[SPEAKER_07]: But clearly, Mr. President, that is not the right thing to do.

528
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:23,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have to be an engineer to make that decision.

529
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:26,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Leaving it the way it is is not the right thing to do.

530
00:47:27,022 --> 00:47:30,145
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we have to do as a community, Mr. President.

531
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:33,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're going to make it safe, I realize we can't make every road right now.

532
00:47:33,848 --> 00:47:35,249
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we're going to do this project,

533
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:45,012
[SPEAKER_07]: and call it Safe Routes to School, and I have parents that have sent him emails saying, you know, I live near Meffitt Square, and thank goodness my son can take his bike now to school.

534
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:47,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm concerned with that, because guess what?

535
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:49,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm putting my stamp of approval on that.

536
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:51,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't feel safe, Mr. President.

537
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:53,315
[SPEAKER_07]: And no one's going to tell me otherwise.

538
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:54,876
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's going to tell me otherwise.

539
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:57,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information on that big paper?

540
00:47:58,177 --> 00:47:59,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Morell.

541
00:48:00,258 --> 00:48:02,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that conditional saying, well, like,

542
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:07,306
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll only vote for this if, or that's a suggestion on top of?

543
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:08,467
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not what I said.

544
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:09,468
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what I said.

545
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:11,229
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not conditional.

546
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:12,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

547
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:14,751
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not, it's not, that's not conditional.

548
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:14,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

549
00:48:15,031 --> 00:48:15,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

550
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

551
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:18,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

552
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:24,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President and thank you for the I appreciate council marks bringing this forward.

553
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:27,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that We've talked to many residents who?

554
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:46,957
[SPEAKER_11]: felt a little slighted Tim with the taking of those parking spaces and We can understand the biggest the biggest draw for myself as well as the bike lane is the intersection of Ruben Street and High Street and having an identified crosswalk and a

555
00:48:47,817 --> 00:49:02,234
[SPEAKER_11]: uh an area now that people are going to have to stop the way they're going to reconfigure that area so i think that is a huge plus it's a it's a to me a huge safety issue we have right now um and and with council mox's uh

556
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:19,105
[SPEAKER_11]: remarks with the with the with the turn I think it's very important and I too was I to talk to a few of the neighbors and the Request I appreciate how it's a mark soon as homework and getting chief Buckley to read to consider the parking overnight I think that's important.

557
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:21,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So Again, it's all the Brooks parents.

558
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:30,993
[SPEAKER_11]: We we heard you loud and clear It wasn't at any point that we thought that you know, we don't want to move forward with such you know an initiative, but we also have to make sure that

559
00:49:33,195 --> 00:49:37,960
[SPEAKER_11]: They had to know that we got into this game really late.

560
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:50,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, once you've clarified the hundred residents that have been informed and have an end product with the taking of the land,

561
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:59,982
[SPEAKER_11]: the continuation of the bike lane to make it a true bike lane where I too shared Council Mark's concerns with the dangerous situations.

562
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:08,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And then looking into that evening parking and the configuration of the high movement, I think it's a no-brainer.

563
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,013
[SPEAKER_11]: So I too will support this project.

564
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:23,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I thank all the Brooks parents that originally started this years ago, because I don't know if any of the parents that originally started this project are even in, you know, their children still go to the school.

565
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:28,904
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I applaud those parents and moving forward with this initiative.

566
00:50:28,924 --> 00:50:29,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

567
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:31,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Carlos Scarpelli.

568
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:34,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim McGibbon has a comment.

569
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:37,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, I just wanted to talk just real quick.

570
00:50:38,127 --> 00:50:48,432
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm already, one of the things about the removing of the parking and I've already talked to some of the people that are concerned about that.

571
00:50:48,852 --> 00:51:02,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And one other thing that we can kind of layer on top of, you know, having traffic commission look at the nighttime situation, but also I'm trying to help one of the property owners with looking at her property.

572
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:05,179
[SPEAKER_17]: The properties there are big enough and the driveways are,

573
00:51:06,003 --> 00:51:12,006
[SPEAKER_17]: to be such that there's things that you could do on-site, too, to increase how much parking you can have on the site.

574
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:17,709
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm working with at least one resident on that piece, too.

575
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,490
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's available.

576
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:28,275
[SPEAKER_17]: If there are residents who are very concerned about losing that spot for a certain amount of time and want to explore on-site parking, they should call my office and we could talk about it.

577
00:51:28,295 --> 00:51:30,396
[SPEAKER_17]: I can look at their property and try to help them with that.

578
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:31,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

579
00:51:32,057 --> 00:51:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

580
00:51:32,597 --> 00:51:33,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

581
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:35,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

582
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:39,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to second, thanks to everyone who advocated for this.

583
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:45,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the first, fifth grade at the Brooks, and I can remember how dangerous it was even then as a 10 year old.

584
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:48,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two questions.

585
00:51:48,764 --> 00:51:52,086
[SPEAKER_02]: One is just about Councilor Marks' motion.

586
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:55,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that just be between Winthrop Circle and the Woburn Street intersection?

587
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:01,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that question for me?

588
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:01,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

589
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:06,034
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the clarification on that on that B paper?

590
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:13,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I'd like to leave it open ended because, you know, we may be also talking about the other end of high street as well.

591
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:26,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, as I stated, I'm not a traffic engineer, but really it doesn't make sense for us to put a stamp of approval on something that I don't, I don't believe is safe in particular for elementary school kids to be riding.

592
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to leave that open ended.

593
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:34,473
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not contingent upon approval, but, um, you know, I hope Tim takes this back to the city administration.

594
00:52:34,913 --> 00:52:37,975
[SPEAKER_07]: and let them know that something needs to be done immediately there.

595
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though there may be long-term plans, something needs to be done immediately with this project.

596
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:44,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I totally agree.

597
00:52:44,698 --> 00:52:46,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually, I think, leaving it.

598
00:52:46,939 --> 00:52:51,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be encouraged to see both sections of how we could do that.

599
00:52:51,161 --> 00:52:52,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

600
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:53,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So just wanted to make sure on that.

601
00:52:53,902 --> 00:53:02,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Tim, kind of similar question, just what would it be possible to, what would it take to do that in your estimation?

602
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:07,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, whenever we try to do that, anyway, whenever we're repainting a street or resurfacing, we measure.

603
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:09,540
[SPEAKER_17]: We go out, we measure.

604
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Folks in my office, Todd, bring some money, they go out, they measure.

605
00:53:13,682 --> 00:53:19,544
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's room, we'll try to see if we can add a five foot wide bike lane.

606
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:22,846
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's not, four foot's an option, but that's not ideal.

607
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:25,148
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do try to take a look at that.

608
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:45,187
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'd have to measure the road We have to look at the the topography look at the intersections Take a look at the master plan that the bike Commission did see see how it lines up with that So we would do exactly what Councilor Marx is is alluding to and we would take a look at it Break out the paper and the pencils and the calculator and see what would work I

609
00:53:46,568 --> 00:54:10,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Agree with the sentiments of just having the bike lane and it's not ideal However bicycles can be in that road anyway, so there are they go from their own lane to a lane that they're supposed to be in anyway and I think if people in just in general if and I and I I agree with mark council marks it we can't tell people what to do right and then they may or may not do it if someone tells their child to go ride in the bike lane and

610
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:13,345
[SPEAKER_17]: and they're in danger.

611
00:54:13,365 --> 00:54:15,327
[SPEAKER_17]: That's probably not a smart thing to do.

612
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:18,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Bike lanes, travel within roadways with traffic.

613
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:30,997
[SPEAKER_17]: The bike commission that I was on, it always says that's really for the more experienced cyclists, children, things like that, children and people who aren't experts or not even close to experts or whatever.

614
00:54:32,037 --> 00:54:35,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Sidewalk might be more appropriate for that.

615
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,381
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyway.

616
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:38,862
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

617
00:54:39,322 --> 00:54:39,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Tim.

618
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:50,212
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at it, if we could look at something temporary, at least in between Winthrop Circle and Woburn, maybe just if we're not resurfacing, could we do temporary paint?

619
00:54:50,272 --> 00:54:53,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of thinking of that as a focus area.

620
00:54:53,696 --> 00:54:54,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we would do that.

621
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:55,497
[SPEAKER_17]: We definitely could do that.

622
00:54:55,758 --> 00:55:01,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm actually excited that this was brought up and this B paper was made, because I'm in agreement.

623
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:04,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we should try to extend it as far as we can.

624
00:55:05,558 --> 00:55:05,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

625
00:55:05,978 --> 00:55:06,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

626
00:55:06,238 --> 00:55:06,458

00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:33,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

697
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:33,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

698
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:34,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you

699
00:55:34,755 --> 00:55:36,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe type it, Todd, if you can.

700
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:39,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you want to type it in the chat, maybe that might be the best bet.

701
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:49,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so while we're waiting for Todd to make his comment, Councilor Lange, did you want to make a comment?

702
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Cavill.

703
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Mr. President.

704
00:55:56,071 --> 00:56:03,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim, I remember when we looked at the plans and they showed the paving, it was kind of like a patchwork paving.

705
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:09,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that going to be paved from Woburn Street and Hastings Lane all the way down to the school?

706
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:16,468
[SPEAKER_03]: in one pave rather than every intersection get a nice smooth pave, then we get the rough and then we go to the smooth.

707
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:26,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I recall when we looked at the plans, that's how they looked, is they talked to get a pave all the way from that whole length right to the school.

708
00:56:27,446 --> 00:56:42,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, it is still like that and just so everybody knows we traded pavement for RFPs, which we felt were much more appropriate for safe routes to school to increase that pedestrian crossing safety.

709
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:48,259
[SPEAKER_17]: So we took, move money out of pavement and into RFPs on the project.

710
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:57,511
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do the project what's getting funded by the project, you're right, the intersections are getting repaved, and not between the intersections.

711
00:56:59,093 --> 00:57:03,297
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are exploring what to do between the intersections.

712
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:06,501
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, we don't, we don't have a solution quite yet.

713
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:09,744
[SPEAKER_17]: But by the time construction starts, we intend to have a solution.

714
00:57:10,245 --> 00:57:12,287
[SPEAKER_17]: So stay tuned.

715
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:14,629
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, well, I don't want that as well.

716
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:16,271
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want a nice brand new intersection.

717
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:20,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I mean, we're probably looking at maybe a

718
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:27,513
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 yards of 30 yards of paving, extra paving in between those few streets.

719
00:57:28,053 --> 00:57:32,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just behoove us while the pavers there just not grind.

720
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:38,569
[SPEAKER_03]: They grind all the way down and rather than leave those little spots in the middle open.

721
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:42,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they say, you know, High Street hasn't been paid for many years.

722
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:49,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you see it, you know, we're starting to get the wear marks, you know, the rolling hills in several areas of High Street.

723
00:57:49,653 --> 00:57:52,534
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I think it would be the prudent thing to do.

724
00:57:53,914 --> 00:57:57,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, you know, I said, I know this is going to be a tough year finding money for things.

725
00:57:57,995 --> 00:58:02,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that can be taken into consideration, I think it would be helpful also.

726
00:58:03,462 --> 00:58:13,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we talk about it a lot in our office, and it was a trade-off that I think was the right one, but now we have this little bit of a gap in the pavement, so we are working to address it, so thank you.

727
00:58:15,846 --> 00:58:16,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Tim.

728
00:58:16,346 --> 00:58:17,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

729
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:24,969
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may for one minute, let's see, City Clerk Hurtubise, I believe you received a message from our traffic engineer.

730
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:26,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you read that?

731
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, absolutely.

732
00:58:28,527 --> 00:58:35,412
[SPEAKER_13]: He says next steps, point of information, traffic commission would be involved in any extension of the bike lane beyond what was already approved by them.

733
00:58:37,853 --> 00:58:38,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

734
00:58:38,874 --> 00:58:39,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

735
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:40,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

736
00:58:42,196 --> 00:58:49,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I think based upon what I'm hearing from my colleagues that this thing's ready for a vote and I'd move for approval of the paper.

737
00:58:50,422 --> 00:58:51,383
[SPEAKER_19]: Second Mr. President.

738
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

739
00:58:56,246 --> 00:58:57,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, we may have some,

740
00:58:58,038 --> 00:58:59,119
[SPEAKER_07]: residents that like to speak.

741
00:58:59,599 --> 00:58:59,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

742
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:01,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to call on them right now.

743
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, so let's see.

744
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:05,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anybody that would like to speak?

745
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:05,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

746
00:59:06,102 --> 00:59:07,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, right here.

747
00:59:07,082 --> 00:59:10,304
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could please press for the record.

748
00:59:12,205 --> 00:59:13,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

749
00:59:13,245 --> 00:59:15,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

750
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:15,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

751
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:19,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I am Camille Pasatempo and I live at three 60 high street.

752
00:59:20,148 --> 00:59:24,850
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is, um, impacting my living.

753
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:26,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

754
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:30,723
[SPEAKER_15]: The parking is going to impact me a lot.

755
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:48,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I have tenants that live downstairs I have an 80 year old tenant and that means that she's going to have to pack across the street in Order to get home to cross the street on a busy You know in the busy road now and

756
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:51,487
[SPEAKER_15]: for her to come into the house.

757
00:59:51,828 --> 00:59:56,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I have two other tenants that, you know, work until 1030 at night.

758
00:59:57,811 --> 01:00:02,913
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it's them parking across the street and having them come into their own home.

759
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:07,696
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no parking on the side streets, Mystic or Auburn.

760
01:00:08,456 --> 01:00:11,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I have six cars already parked in my driveway.

761
01:00:12,731 --> 01:00:17,856
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is going to impact me and my, you know, the way that I live.

762
01:00:18,357 --> 01:00:22,561
[SPEAKER_15]: I've lived here all my life and believe me, I know high street is very dangerous.

763
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:26,746
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, my sister got hit by a car 50 years ago on high street.

764
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:33,753
[SPEAKER_15]: I raised my kids here, but I did not like the way the city handled how they took away the parking.

765
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:42,377
[SPEAKER_15]: We literally got a notice, this was the notice, two weeks before the traffic commission took a vote.

766
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:45,638
[SPEAKER_15]: We had two weeks, we didn't know what was going on.

767
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:51,120
[SPEAKER_15]: They had the vote, they had the meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon on a Tuesday.

768
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,781
[SPEAKER_15]: So of course a lot of people couldn't attend.

769
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:58,263
[SPEAKER_15]: We went and in 20 minutes my parking was gone.

770
01:00:59,278 --> 01:01:03,619
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't feel like we were notified about this project.

771
01:01:03,759 --> 01:01:06,060
[SPEAKER_15]: We had no idea about this project.

772
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,021
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, people, it's great.

773
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,602
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you want to have your kid ride a bike on high street to go to school.

774
01:01:12,622 --> 01:01:13,982
[SPEAKER_15]: It's supposed to be the safe school.

775
01:01:14,062 --> 01:01:21,404
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mike and Councilor Marks, thank you for making that recommendation for the overnight parking, which would help.

776
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:23,374
[SPEAKER_15]: It really would.

777
01:01:23,815 --> 01:01:30,477
[SPEAKER_15]: But to take away 19 spots, it will really impact us and a lot of the people on the street.

778
01:01:30,997 --> 01:01:36,039
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that the engineer department, they said that they did a survey, which I have right here.

779
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:50,144
[SPEAKER_15]: They, for a week, they looked at the parking situation in January and that there were plenty of parking spots across the street, but they did not take in consideration in the summer when

780
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:58,184
[SPEAKER_15]: people park here to walk down to the commuter rail or take the express bus into Boston, because this is what happens.

781
01:01:58,264 --> 01:01:59,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Those parking spots go away.

782
01:02:00,785 --> 01:02:07,429
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to have a problem on High Street once this project goes forward.

783
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:09,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all I wanted to say.

784
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:11,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for listening.

785
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:12,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

786
01:02:13,492 --> 01:02:15,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, who else wanted to speak?

787
01:02:19,138 --> 01:02:25,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Please raise your hand if you'd like to speak and I'll... Oh, yes.

788
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:30,402
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could please have your name and address for the record.

789
01:02:31,062 --> 01:02:35,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, Patti Summers and it's 304 High Street in Medford.

790
01:02:36,064 --> 01:02:38,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

791
01:02:38,645 --> 01:02:44,607
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to speak on very much similar to Camille Pasatempo.

792
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been here for 25 or 26 years,

793
01:02:49,086 --> 01:02:57,496
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mostly park in my driveway, but I do have a mother who is wheelchair bound that I have care of a couple of days a week.

794
01:02:58,277 --> 01:03:07,288
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I need to be able to pull her up in my driveway is where I get her out onto the sidewalk and then get her up to the back of my yard.

795
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:11,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, she also is, uh, has dementia.

796
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:18,979
[SPEAKER_16]: So she's not able to understand for me to say, I'm going to take you out here and run you across to the other side of high street.

797
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:21,739
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is an issue for me as far as parking goes.

798
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:32,303
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to tell you, honestly, having lived here for 25 years, um, I worked from home always and had my office on the very front of my house for a good 15 years.

799
01:03:33,992 --> 01:03:52,743
[SPEAKER_16]: My children are now grown, so I feel, you know, okay, as far as my kids go, but honestly, any parent that thinks that, or anybody, any adult that thinks, or a city person that thinks that this four block bike lane is smart for children and safe for children, you're definitely mistaken.

800
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:59,607
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't tell you how many times the T sign that's in front of my house has been leveled.

801
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:05,361
[SPEAKER_16]: how many times the tree in front, so many times the tree in front of my house that the city stopped replacing the tree.

802
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:08,323
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the only house here that doesn't have a tree for years now.

803
01:04:08,843 --> 01:04:11,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks is 100% correct.

804
01:04:11,725 --> 01:04:13,345
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not safe for children.

805
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,347
[SPEAKER_16]: My kids are grown, so I don't have to worry about my own children.

806
01:04:17,707 --> 01:04:28,873
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know $1.2 million is a lot of money for the city, but I will tell you, it'll cost you $1.2 million for the first child that's killed outside here.

807
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:33,696
[SPEAKER_16]: this intersection here, and I know you might think bump outs are going to help.

808
01:04:34,657 --> 01:04:36,959
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just not a smart decision.

809
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:44,527
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just my opinion, but I've been here for 20 something years and I see what the traffic is like out here.

810
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,208
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just not wise.

811
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:52,655
[SPEAKER_16]: And what are you going to do with a child who hops on their bike at Brooks School and the lane stops in front of my house?

812
01:04:53,928 --> 01:04:56,910
[SPEAKER_16]: and they realize, oh, I forgot a book, or I forgot whatever.

813
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:03,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they then gonna get on their bike and have to pass other children in that same bike lane to go back to the school for something?

814
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:04,514
[SPEAKER_16]: None of it makes sense.

815
01:05:04,794 --> 01:05:16,161
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that it's a lot of money, I really do, and I'm sure the city could use it, but it just seems like there's gotta be something smarter if it really has to do with the safety of children.

816
01:05:18,042 --> 01:05:20,704
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just not, I don't know, it just doesn't seem like a wise,

817
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:22,474
[SPEAKER_16]: wise thing to do.

818
01:05:22,754 --> 01:05:30,078
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thank Councilor Marks for, you know, really thinking about it and knowing if it's really something that people should be saying yes to.

819
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:33,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

820
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:34,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

821
01:05:37,622 --> 01:05:40,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments?

822
01:05:41,744 --> 01:05:42,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

823
01:05:44,165 --> 01:05:45,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Please have your name and address for the record.

824
01:05:46,727 --> 01:05:48,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Sue Brown.

825
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:50,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at 127 Pine Ridge Road in Medford.

826
01:05:51,724 --> 01:05:54,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to speak in support of this project.

827
01:05:55,226 --> 01:05:59,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important that Medford adopt a safe streets program.

828
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:20,279
[SPEAKER_05]: This may not be dotting every I to be a perfect solution, but people I have talked to in the area and my own belief is that it will increase traffic calming and is one step in the direction we need to take in this city to improve our streets for all.

829
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

830
01:06:22,025 --> 01:06:22,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

831
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:29,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Would anybody else like to speak?

832
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:35,774
[SPEAKER_10]: On the question, Mr. President.

833
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,015

[SPEAKER_10]: Council of beers.

888
01:09:20,085 --> 01:09:21,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

889
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:28,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have Director Hunt on the call, so we were able to start through the CPA, this rental assistance program.

890
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:34,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up through ABCD Malden and Housing Families is providing some information as well.

891
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:38,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was hoping that Director Hunt might be able to provide a little bit more information.

892
01:09:38,638 --> 01:09:43,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

893
01:09:44,563 --> 01:09:45,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

894
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia hunt and the director, the acting director of community development.

895
01:09:51,842 --> 01:10:03,129
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be clear, this program has been funded through the community preservation coalition funding this year, we've provided, they have provided through the city council funds to ABCD.

896
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:13,174
[SPEAKER_12]: which is an organization that already administers rental programs for residents.

897
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:20,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will just very quickly call up onto my screen the information.

898
01:10:20,557 --> 01:10:28,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I wasn't expecting to do this, but I do actually have a flyer that we can circulate and I can put on the screen the phone number.

899
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:31,763
[SPEAKER_12]: If anybody needs to contact ABCD,

900
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:34,624
[SPEAKER_12]: for rental assistance.

901
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:43,769
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also, as we're mentioning that, you can contact housing families for pro bono legal assistance.

902
01:10:49,672 --> 01:10:52,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a point of information.

903
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:54,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

904
01:10:55,015 --> 01:11:00,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Can this information be put on the government channel as well as community access, or is it already there?

905
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:15,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I will tell you that I am not aware exactly where it's being circulated, but I will definitely send it after this meeting to Patrick Gordon to share on the community access channel to put through as a PSA on there.

906
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:16,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

907
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:17,790
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all, Mark.

908
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:18,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for mentioning that.

909
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,130
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a good, great idea.

910
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's on the city's website.

911
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:26,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I just requested screen sharing so I could pop it up on your screen now.

912
01:11:26,111 --> 01:11:27,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

913
01:11:39,422 --> 01:11:40,803
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

914
01:11:42,783 --> 01:11:43,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Share.

915
01:11:43,943 --> 01:11:46,684
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the flyer and we'll get it up there.

916
01:11:47,544 --> 01:11:51,425
[SPEAKER_12]: And here is the phone number and an email address and I'll read it out.

917
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:53,145
[SPEAKER_12]: The phone number is 617-348-6347.

918
01:11:59,255 --> 01:12:11,856
[SPEAKER_12]: That is for abcd housing and they also have an email address housing at boston abcd.org That is for emergency rental assistance

919
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:15,389
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'm going to just share with you very quickly.

920
01:12:15,409 --> 01:12:18,211
[SPEAKER_12]: There is the pro bono legal.

921
01:12:18,311 --> 01:12:27,355
[SPEAKER_12]: So if your landlord is threatening you, or you feel that you need legal assistance with a housing situation, you can call housing families.

922
01:12:27,495 --> 01:12:35,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a program funded through the city of Medford for free legal help with regards to housing issues.

923
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And that phone number is 781-322-4111.

[SPEAKER_12]: 9 1 1 9 extension 1 4 6 will circulate this one as well.

[SPEAKER_12]: And then there is going to be a session housing information session via zoom on.

[SPEAKER_12]: May 21st at 6 30 p.m.

927
01:13:00,951 --> 01:13:05,674
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just this flyer has just started circulating in the last 24 hours.

928
01:13:06,474 --> 01:13:10,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so this is a Open public zoom meeting.

929
01:13:10,077 --> 01:13:18,562
[SPEAKER_12]: We will present about these various programs and the resources that are available And I do want to say it is being organized by roberta

930
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:31,957
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to take credit for the program that she has put it that she has been working hard to organize.

931
01:13:32,898 --> 01:13:35,120
[SPEAKER_12]: So were there any other points on that?

932
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,581
[SPEAKER_12]: You wanted me to hit Councilor bears?

933
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:38,382
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thanks, Alicia.

934
01:13:38,402 --> 01:13:39,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry for putting you on the spot.

935
01:13:39,723 --> 01:13:42,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we had Roberta Cameron on earlier, but I think she had to hop off.

936
01:13:42,805 --> 01:13:45,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate you taking that on.

937
01:13:45,848 --> 01:13:46,368
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

938
01:13:50,354 --> 01:13:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Caraviello.

939
01:13:51,655 --> 01:13:52,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

940
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:57,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia, is that the only form of advertisement going out to the families?

941
01:13:58,706 --> 01:14:06,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So the flyers are out and I will say that we have been circulating it around Facebook.

942
01:14:06,349 --> 01:14:08,770
[SPEAKER_12]: We have sent it to a number of email lists.

943
01:14:10,371 --> 01:14:17,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Jackie Peaks, the director of communications for the city has taken point on the outreach.

944
01:14:17,914 --> 01:14:22,376
[SPEAKER_12]: So I am not sure everywhere that she has sent it to.

945
01:14:22,396 --> 01:14:28,498
[SPEAKER_12]: It is on the COVID-19 webpage of the city's all the emergency stuff

946
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:31,019
[SPEAKER_12]: the housing information is there as well.

947
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:40,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because if you recall, the director of ABCD said that they don't normally market, they don't really target Method residents.

948
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:47,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where my concern was, making sure that the Method residents get to know what is available to them.

949
01:14:48,263 --> 01:14:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just that piece of flyer may not be enough to let people know.

950
01:14:56,727 --> 01:15:01,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it should be on Channel 3 a little more often.

951
01:15:02,013 --> 01:15:07,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they should be down at the food banks, both at Mystic Avenue and St.

952
01:15:07,919 --> 01:15:13,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Raphael's and the Episcopal and the other church, the Unitarian Church on High Street.

953
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:18,889
[SPEAKER_03]: those places have people that are in need there.

954
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:24,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, just to send out a flyer that goes nowhere is not the answer.

955
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:32,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I say I want to make sure that people in Medford are getting the benefit of their CPA funding.

956
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:34,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Has there been any calls?

957
01:15:35,518 --> 01:15:36,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackie, can you answer that?

958
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Any calls regarding this program yet?

959
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:46,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for, can you hear me?

960
01:15:46,662 --> 01:15:46,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

961
01:15:47,222 --> 01:15:48,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you for recognizing me.

962
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:51,063
[SPEAKER_04]: There have not been any calls yet.

963
01:15:51,183 --> 01:16:00,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking notes and we'll definitely, it's on my, actually my agenda for tomorrow to post a lot more about some of the flyers that have come out to me today.

964
01:16:00,046 --> 01:16:01,127
[SPEAKER_04]: They are posted on our website.

965
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:10,779
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll certainly raise the issue internally here about calls about this and other upcoming programs in the next few weeks.

966
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:15,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's been three weeks and we haven't even gotten a call yet.

967
01:16:16,547 --> 01:16:19,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of bothers me a little bit.

968
01:16:20,011 --> 01:16:25,918
[SPEAKER_12]: be clear, what we're advertising is for them to call ABCD, not anybody in the city.

969
01:16:26,318 --> 01:16:34,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So if our advertising is working, they're not reaching myself or Jackie, they are actually going straight to ABCD.

970
01:16:34,387 --> 01:16:41,214
[SPEAKER_12]: We have gotten a number of calls about housing issues to the Office of Community Development over the last three weeks.

971
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:52,195
[SPEAKER_12]: And our administrative assistant Lorena has been talking them through what their issues are and then referring them over to ABCD and Housing Families as appropriate.

972
01:16:52,657 --> 01:17:04,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I could amend this to get a report from ABCD to find out how many calls from Methodist residents that have been received as of this date.

973
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:14,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I want to make sure that our residents are getting the benefit of this and not residents from other cities.

974
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:24,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we'll speak to, I'll ask our staff person who is coordinating with ABCD to reach out to them on that.

975
01:17:24,653 --> 01:17:25,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

976
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:29,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

977
01:17:29,755 --> 01:17:30,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from the council?

978
01:17:31,495 --> 01:17:35,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

979
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:38,318
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's okay.

01:18:57,402 --> 01:18:58,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1024
01:18:58,183 --> 01:19:00,123
[SPEAKER_10]: We will now revert to the regular order of business.

1025
01:19:00,604 --> 01:19:01,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1026
01:19:01,964 --> 01:19:06,706
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-344 offered by Councilor Knight and Vice President Caraviello.

1027
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:15,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas the question was raised at a recent meeting by the Zoning Court of Appeals as to whether or not experiences are authorized in the City of Medford.

1028
01:19:15,247 --> 01:19:21,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas on July 19, 2016, the City of the Medford City Council approved paper 166-586.

1029
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:31,035
[SPEAKER_10]: which requested a written legal opinion from the city solicitor as to whether or not use variances are authorized in the city of Medford.

1030
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:43,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas, on August 12, 2016, the city solicitor provided the requested legal opinion to the city council, which determined use variances are authorized in the city of Medford.

1031
01:19:43,601 --> 01:19:49,244
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas, this opinion was not challenged by any entity in any legal form.

1032
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:52,506
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas, the Medford City Council failed to approve Papers 1-7

1033
01:19:53,644 --> 01:20:04,621
[SPEAKER_10]: and 18-354 seeking the deauthorization of use variances in the City of Medford and whereas on April 24, 2018, the Medford City Council approved

1034
01:20:06,647 --> 01:20:19,592
[SPEAKER_10]: 18-376 in a super majority roll call vote, calling for the adoption of the city solicitor's opinion and authorization to amend the codified ordinances to reflect the finding of his opinion.

1035
01:20:19,832 --> 01:20:34,937
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas the Medford City Council in the city of Medford is the city of Medford legislative body enabled as the sole authority responsible for the passage of local zoning law, be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests

1036
01:20:35,732 --> 01:20:48,138
[SPEAKER_10]: The city solicitor Scanlon forward to the Zoning Board of Appeals a copy of the solicitor's opinion and other documents deemed necessary at her discretion.

1037
01:20:48,398 --> 01:20:54,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And be it further resolved that the city clerk provide copies of Papers 16-856, 17-007, 18-354, and 18-376 to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1038
01:21:05,472 --> 01:21:16,198
[SPEAKER_10]: We have further resolved that the Medford City Council respectively requests that the Zoning Board of Appeals acknowledges and affirm by way of roll call vote the following.

1039
01:21:16,918 --> 01:21:27,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one, the Zoning Board of Appeals has been provided a copy of the city solicitor's opinion on August 12, 2016, determining use variances are permitted in the city of Medford.

1040
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:32,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, the Zoning Board of Appeals has been provided with council papers

1041
01:21:32,568 --> 01:21:33,949
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-856, 17-007, 18-354, and 18-376.

1042
01:21:34,109 --> 01:21:52,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Number three, the Zoning Board of Appeals recognizes that the Medford City Council is the City of Medford's legislative body enabled as the sole authority responsible for the passage of local zoning law.

1043
01:21:53,156 --> 01:22:02,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Number four, the Zoning Board of Appeals recognizes that the question as to whether or not use variances are authorized in the City of Medford has been addressed

1044
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:10,115
[SPEAKER_10]: by way of the August 12, 2016 legal opinion and council passage of paper 18-376.

1045
01:22:11,075 --> 01:22:18,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Number five, the Zoning Board of Appeals recognizes that use variances are authorized in the city of Medford.

1046
01:22:18,637 --> 01:22:19,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1047
01:22:20,337 --> 01:22:21,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1048
01:22:21,878 --> 01:22:26,919
[SPEAKER_20]: And I thank you for going through that very long history that was outlined.

1049
01:22:27,523 --> 01:22:30,944
[SPEAKER_20]: in the resolution that Councilor Caraviello and I have put together.

1050
01:22:31,744 --> 01:22:38,006
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultimately, it was a long resolution because there's a longstanding history of the allowance of a use variance here in our community.

1051
01:22:38,526 --> 01:22:44,468
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you look at the history, Mr. President, you'll see that in 2016, an opinion was asked of the solicitor.

1052
01:22:45,249 --> 01:22:49,850
[SPEAKER_20]: The solicitor produced an opinion that said use variances were authorized in the city of Medford.

1053
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,310
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2017, we had a proposal

1054
01:22:53,513 --> 01:22:57,716
[SPEAKER_20]: that was made by a Councilor to deauthorize use variances in the city of Medford.

1055
01:22:58,296 --> 01:23:07,281
[SPEAKER_20]: If, in fact, use variances weren't authorized in the city of Medford, there would be no need for a Councilor to file a paper requesting that they be deauthorized in 2017.

1056
01:23:08,702 --> 01:23:15,346
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2018, Mr. President, another paper was offered before the council by a Councilor to deauthorize the use variance.

1057
01:23:16,107 --> 01:23:18,028
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this paper failed to pass.

1058
01:23:19,136 --> 01:23:27,361
[SPEAKER_20]: If use variances did not exist in the city of Medford, there would be no need for the legislative body to bring a proposal forward to deauthorize the use variance in the city of Medford.

1059
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:45,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, then we have a roll call vote that passed by super majority, adopting the city solicitor's opinion of August 12th, 2016, which states that use variances are allowed and authorized in the city of Medford.

1060
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:53,272
[SPEAKER_20]: The solicitor's opinion went on to say that the codified ordinances in the city of Medford do not reflect such.

1061
01:23:53,412 --> 01:24:01,317
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a Scribner's error that has been made and that we can correct this Scribner's error by passage of resolution.

1062
01:24:01,918 --> 01:24:11,985
[SPEAKER_20]: The council passed paper 18376, which called for adoption of the city solicitor's opinion and amendment to the codified ordinance to reflect such.

1063
01:24:13,413 --> 01:24:18,075
[SPEAKER_20]: Allowing the use variance has been a longstanding policy in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

1064
01:24:18,895 --> 01:24:23,997
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the public policy established by the council, the legislative arm of this community.

1065
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:30,459
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the job of the boards and commissions in this community not to establish public policy, but to execute it.

1066
01:24:31,919 --> 01:24:39,362
[SPEAKER_20]: When applicants before the Zoning Board of Appeals are being told inaccurate information that use variances are prohibited, when they clearly are allowed,

1067
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:52,693
[SPEAKER_20]: as supported by the opinion of the solicitor, the lack of a legal challenge, and the action of the legislative body in the community, this irresponsible action opens up the city to vulnerabilities and liabilities.

1068
01:24:53,513 --> 01:24:57,014
[SPEAKER_20]: Applicants before the Zoning Board of Appeals have the right to be heard.

1069
01:24:57,034 --> 01:25:04,916
[SPEAKER_20]: The Zoning Board of Appeals has applicants before it that are requesting use variances.

1070
01:25:05,616 --> 01:25:07,497
[SPEAKER_20]: The Zoning Board of Appeals is raising the question,

1071
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Do use variances exist in the city of Medford?

1072
01:25:11,348 --> 01:25:12,649
[SPEAKER_20]: That question has been answered.

1073
01:25:12,669 --> 01:25:16,091
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been answered and it's been time-tested, Mr. President.

1074
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:23,976
[SPEAKER_20]: The Zoning Board of Appeals is in a position right now to take a look at this issue, to reaffirm the opinion of the city solicitor or to challenge it.

1075
01:25:24,637 --> 01:25:33,723
[SPEAKER_20]: But applicants that come before the Zoning Board shouldn't be turned around, turned away when someone makes a statement saying, I don't have the authority to issue use variances.

1076
01:25:33,743 --> 01:25:35,344
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not authorized in the city of Medford.

1077
01:25:35,796 --> 01:25:38,379
[SPEAKER_20]: when the legislative history clearly indicates that they are.

1078
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:43,245
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution as before.

1079
01:25:44,446 --> 01:25:45,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1080
01:25:45,628 --> 01:25:46,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello.

1081
01:25:47,645 --> 01:25:48,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1082
01:25:49,206 --> 01:25:53,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank my fellow Councilor for his diligent work here.

1083
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:54,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with him.

1084
01:25:55,069 --> 01:25:56,350
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a longstanding question.

1085
01:25:56,370 --> 01:26:00,452
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes back and forth, back and forth, whether they are allowed or not allowed.

1086
01:26:01,512 --> 01:26:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have documentation saying that it is.

1087
01:26:04,434 --> 01:26:09,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, if somebody wants to challenge this in the court of law, then I think it's time that they do so.

1088
01:26:10,617 --> 01:26:15,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I think the paperwork stands on its own.

1089
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we should move on from there.

1090
01:26:21,044 --> 01:26:22,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1091
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from the council?

1092
01:26:24,788 --> 01:26:25,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Comments?

1093
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:26,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

1094
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:29,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1095
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:31,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I can appreciate the intent of this.

1096
01:26:33,053 --> 01:26:48,376
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it's not as clear as what was stated about a longstanding history, because I'd say over the past 20 years, at least 15 or 16 of those years, use variances were not issued by the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1097
01:26:48,936 --> 01:26:51,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just really recent, of recent time,

1098
01:26:52,057 --> 01:26:58,199
[SPEAKER_07]: that the Zoning Board of Appeals started to flex their muscle and issue use variances.

1099
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:05,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It was also stated that this has never been appealed, or no body or entity has ever appealed this.

1100
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:13,884
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2016, Mr. President, the Method City Council sued our own Zoning Board of Appeals.

1101
01:27:15,237 --> 01:27:29,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And one part of the suit was that the voting board gave out too many variances, and also that use variances are not authorized in the city of Meffitt.

1102
01:27:30,193 --> 01:27:33,016
[SPEAKER_07]: That came from a unanimous vote of the Meffitt City Council.

1103
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:36,906
[SPEAKER_07]: after we hired a zoning attorney to represent us.

1104
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:47,109
[SPEAKER_07]: So as early as 2016, June of 2016, we were on record as a council saying, it's illegal what the zoning board did by giving the use variance.

1105
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not as clear as was stated.

1106
01:27:50,450 --> 01:28:00,993
[SPEAKER_07]: My hope, Mr. President, is that when we start to go through and codify like we just spoke about in the committee of the whole, that we'll address these issues one at a time.

1107
01:28:01,713 --> 01:28:24,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to rush to judgment now to address this, you know What's being asked is to give the authority to an appointed board to do really what should be set forth in zoning regulations and rules by the Meffitt City Council and to give the authority to an appointed board to go and potentially

1108
01:28:25,765 --> 01:28:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: two houses down from you, take it from a residential zone to a commercial zone or industrial zone, give them that authority.

1109
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:36,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to do that, Mr. President.

1110
01:28:37,457 --> 01:28:38,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally don't want to do that.

1111
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:46,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the council should sit down and put together a thoughtful zoning plan, Mr. President.

1112
01:28:46,767 --> 01:28:53,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And we should be the ones that dictate, not pass that responsibility off to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1113
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:57,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So this has indeed been challenged by the Medford City Council.

1114
01:28:58,781 --> 01:29:01,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not as clear cut as was stated.

1115
01:29:01,924 --> 01:29:21,077
[SPEAKER_07]: uh that uh you know the city solicitor came out with an opinion uh which is great uh mr president i've also been told that it was a ballot question back some 18 years ago and that was uh part of the footnote that is currently part of our ordinance that puts a footnote out there and um

1116
01:29:22,618 --> 01:29:24,299
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot to this, Mr. President.

1117
01:29:24,879 --> 01:29:29,222
[SPEAKER_07]: And I personally think we should go through the codification.

1118
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:37,389
[SPEAKER_07]: We should take a look at this and do a thoughtful process, Mr. President, rather than just a knee-jerk reaction at this point.

1119
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:39,170
[SPEAKER_07]: We waited this long, Mr. President.

1120
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:48,497
[SPEAKER_07]: The ambiguity has been around for many, many years, no matter who you talk to, because there's two sections that reflect different language within our zoning.

1121
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:51,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where the problem lies.

1122
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And does it need to be addressed?

1123
01:29:54,344 --> 01:29:55,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1124
01:29:55,505 --> 01:29:56,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the way of addressing it?

1125
01:29:57,167 --> 01:29:58,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't agree with this, Mr. President.

1126
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:05,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And I personally think the council took a stance back in 2016 for a reason.

1127
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the reasons was to protect neighborhoods, Mr. President.

1128
01:30:09,561 --> 01:30:16,347
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, at that time, felt that the Zoning Board of Appeals didn't have the authority to act and do a use change.

1129
01:30:16,907 --> 01:30:18,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still feel that way, Mr. President.

1130
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:30,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And eventually, that'll be my vote when it comes time that I will not be supporting giving out that authority to an appointed board where the Medford City Council should be doing that, Mr. President.

1131
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:31,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1132
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1133
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,844
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Councilor Knight and Councilor Bears.

1134
01:30:36,044 --> 01:30:37,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Mr. President, ultimately,

1135
01:30:38,114 --> 01:30:39,695
[SPEAKER_20]: The city solicitor came up with an opinion.

1136
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,117
[SPEAKER_20]: The opinion has gone unchallenged.

1137
01:30:42,497 --> 01:30:46,860
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2018, this council by a super majority vote adopted that solicitor's opinion.

1138
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:55,506
[SPEAKER_20]: If we look back at the lawsuit from 2016, one thing I think that we're failing to talk about is the fact that we got thrown out of court by the judge by having no standing.

1139
01:30:58,568 --> 01:30:59,949
[SPEAKER_20]: The issue has never been decided.

1140
01:30:59,989 --> 01:31:01,810
[SPEAKER_20]: It was never challenged because it was never decided.

1141
01:31:02,531 --> 01:31:06,854
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultimately, the question before this council is, have we adopted

1142
01:31:07,349 --> 01:31:15,091
[SPEAKER_20]: The city solicited his opinion based upon the research that he performed, which would be the law of the community that says use variances are allowed.

1143
01:31:15,852 --> 01:31:17,672
[SPEAKER_20]: This council has adopted that opinion.

1144
01:31:17,892 --> 01:31:19,213
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the legislative history.

1145
01:31:19,913 --> 01:31:24,434
[SPEAKER_20]: The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to move forward on the...

1146
01:31:37,461 --> 01:31:38,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1147
01:31:40,103 --> 01:31:40,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Layton.

1148
01:31:40,743 --> 01:31:43,245
[SPEAKER_20]: To change that, there's a process to go about changing that.

1149
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:50,690
[SPEAKER_20]: When Papers 17007 and Papers 18354 came before the council, they failed.

1150
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:58,515
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2016, we challenged the local street development, and there was a discussion about use variances.

1151
01:31:58,535 --> 01:32:02,318
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2016, the solicitor also put an opinion, and it said use variances are authorized.

1152
01:32:03,012 --> 01:32:08,174
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2017, a paper was filed to deauthorize use variances.

1153
01:32:08,214 --> 01:32:10,915
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2018, a paper was filed to deauthorize use variances.

1154
01:32:11,336 --> 01:32:14,357
[SPEAKER_20]: If use variances didn't exist, there'd be no need to file the papers.

1155
01:32:15,077 --> 01:32:19,419
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2018, the council then went on to say, look it, use variances do exist.

1156
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:28,903
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the legislative intent of this body, the legislative body responsible for the implementation of the Zoning Act to clarify that this does exist.

1157
01:32:29,683 --> 01:32:30,864
[SPEAKER_20]: And we want to pass this

1158
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,881
[SPEAKER_20]: clarification on to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1159
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:35,361
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what this paper is.

1160
01:32:35,921 --> 01:32:40,503
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, use variances are allowed because that's been determined by the city solicitor.

1161
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:42,183
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the law of the land.

1162
01:32:42,344 --> 01:32:46,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, also when the council is bringing this suit against the Zoning Board of Appeals,

1163
01:32:53,191 --> 01:32:59,257
[SPEAKER_07]: We were also advised by the city solicitor that he felt that we had standing as a city council.

1164
01:32:59,798 --> 01:33:07,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, you know, if anyone could show me and I've talked to people that have been on the council when this change supposedly took place.

1165
01:33:08,646 --> 01:33:13,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't get anyone to verify that this was ever changed.

1166
01:33:13,892 --> 01:33:21,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anyone could show that to me, and in my research, my personal research, I can't find it anywhere written.

1167
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:22,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find the minutes.

1168
01:33:23,141 --> 01:33:26,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find anything that states when this was changed, Mr. President.

1169
01:33:26,724 --> 01:33:32,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nice to just put things out there, and the fact that papers were offered before the council is meaningless.

1170
01:33:32,811 --> 01:33:34,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that doesn't mean anything.

1171
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:37,176
[SPEAKER_07]: People offer papers before the council all the time.

1172
01:33:37,616 --> 01:33:38,738
[SPEAKER_21]: I disagree, Mr. President.

1173
01:33:38,758 --> 01:33:39,939
[SPEAKER_21]: It actually doesn't mean something.

1174
01:33:39,959 --> 01:33:41,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it goes to the motivation.

1175
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:43,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilman Marks has the floor.

1176
01:33:43,663 --> 01:33:45,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, people offer things, Mr. President.

1177
01:33:45,165 --> 01:33:45,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the floor.

1178
01:33:45,505 --> 01:33:45,966
[SPEAKER_20]: You're the point.

1179
01:33:49,183 --> 01:33:52,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, people offer things for different motivations.

1180
01:33:52,705 --> 01:33:56,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know when those papers were offered, for what motivation, and so forth.

1181
01:33:56,626 --> 01:34:04,330
[SPEAKER_07]: All I can tell you, Mr. President, is that I can't find it anywhere that shows that this was voted on by the Medford City Council.

1182
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:07,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's ambiguity in the current zoning.

1183
01:34:08,614 --> 01:34:11,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we challenged it as a city council.

1184
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:15,340
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't forget, when we came back with no standing, we appealed February 1, 2018.

1185
01:34:15,701 --> 01:34:22,747
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council unanimously, all seven councilors, voted to appeal the land court decision.

1186
01:34:23,541 --> 01:34:32,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was after Mark Rumley's decision that was done in July of 2016, stating that there are allowed uses.

1187
01:34:32,663 --> 01:34:35,984
[SPEAKER_07]: We still went forward, Mr. President, after the land court.

1188
01:34:36,324 --> 01:34:38,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for other reasons, it was dropped and so forth.

1189
01:34:39,325 --> 01:34:45,987
[SPEAKER_07]: But we still went forward with what was offered, stating that we didn't believe that a use variance could be issued.

1190
01:34:46,687 --> 01:34:49,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the exact language by the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1191
01:34:50,815 --> 01:34:51,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went forward.

1192
01:34:51,836 --> 01:34:52,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So who do we believe?

1193
01:34:52,797 --> 01:34:56,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we believe the two papers that came before us that no one voted on?

1194
01:34:56,379 --> 01:35:01,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we believe the council that went forward in 2016 and 18 for a lawsuit and land court?

1195
01:35:02,243 --> 01:35:03,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, who, I don't know, who do we believe?

1196
01:35:04,745 --> 01:35:05,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1197
01:35:05,626 --> 01:35:06,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

1198
01:35:07,127 --> 01:35:15,813
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, I do believe that I've presented quite a bit of documentation relative to the fact, and that documentation was produced by the administration and produced by the city's lawyer, the city solicitor.

1199
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:18,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultimately, I think we need to keep the facts straight.

1200
01:35:19,115 --> 01:35:20,116
[SPEAKER_20]: What the council appealed,

1201
01:35:21,707 --> 01:35:27,588
[SPEAKER_20]: was whether or not we had standing, not whether or not use variances exist in the city of Medford or anything else.

1202
01:35:27,688 --> 01:35:29,709
[SPEAKER_20]: What we appealed was whether or not we had standing.

1203
01:35:30,169 --> 01:35:32,630
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we went through that appeal and we negotiated a settlement.

1204
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:33,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1205
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:36,631
[SPEAKER_20]: So ultimately the history is there.

1206
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:39,751
[SPEAKER_20]: The legislative history clearly shows what the intent is of this council.

1207
01:35:40,612 --> 01:35:45,073
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have a solicitor's opinion that comes well before the council took these votes.

1208
01:35:45,593 --> 01:35:48,053
[SPEAKER_20]: So I leave it up to my council colleagues.

1209
01:35:48,634 --> 01:35:49,954
[SPEAKER_20]: I move for approval of the question.

1210
01:35:50,543 --> 01:36:10,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, I don't think that, you know, presenting facts to the Zoning Board of Appeals based upon the legislative history of this body and the opinion of the city solicitor does anything other than reaffirm our position on use variances and let them know where we stand so that moving forward, we're all working in concert with the intent of the Zoning Act.

1211
01:36:11,096 --> 01:36:12,697
[SPEAKER_09]: And the decision- Point of information, Mr. President.

1212
01:36:13,438 --> 01:36:15,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1213
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:19,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd question, what is our position on use variances?

1214
01:36:20,983 --> 01:36:23,585
[SPEAKER_21]: pursuant to the vote 18376.

1215
01:36:24,225 --> 01:36:26,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, we have two new councillors.

1216
01:36:27,868 --> 01:36:29,609
[SPEAKER_07]: We have two new councillors, Mr. President.

1217
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:32,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I myself am not in support of that.

1218
01:36:32,891 --> 01:36:35,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what the gentleman's talking about.

1219
01:36:36,013 --> 01:36:39,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe he's referring to councillors from 20 years ago where they stood.

1220
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:42,737
[SPEAKER_07]: But let me tell you, that's not where I currently stand.

1221
01:36:42,877 --> 01:36:50,102
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, to clarify, Mr. President, I'm referring to the council vote that was taken on paper 18376 by roll call, which passed with supermajority.

1222
01:36:50,595 --> 01:37:01,786
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, um, the legislation passed, this body passed a resolution, that resolution reaffirmed the solicitor's opinion and corrected the scriveners that were in the codified version of our ordinances.

1223
01:37:02,246 --> 01:37:05,229
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't know how much simpler it has to get than that.

1224
01:37:05,729 --> 01:37:07,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, that action took place.

1225
01:37:07,251 --> 01:37:08,332
[SPEAKER_20]: It hasn't been undone.

1226
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:10,374
[SPEAKER_20]: That action hasn't been undone.

1227
01:37:10,454 --> 01:37:12,636
[SPEAKER_20]: So just because there's been turnover on the council.

1228
01:37:13,123 --> 01:37:14,705
[SPEAKER_20]: doesn't mean that the action's undone.

1229
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:19,912
[SPEAKER_20]: That's like saying, because we passed an ordinance five years ago and the body's changed, the ordinance doesn't count anymore.

1230
01:37:19,952 --> 01:37:20,873
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not the way it works.

1231
01:37:21,334 --> 01:37:22,856
[SPEAKER_20]: The body acted, the body passed it.

1232
01:37:23,056 --> 01:37:26,120
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the legislative intent at the time, and that should carry through until it's changed.

1233
01:37:27,222 --> 01:37:27,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you councilman.

1234
01:37:27,983 --> 01:37:34,407
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a motion president point of information point of information council marks The zba is an autonomous body.

1235
01:37:34,547 --> 01:37:35,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, correct?

1236
01:37:35,668 --> 01:37:40,792
[SPEAKER_07]: If that truly was the case, mr President, why are we as a meffitt city council sending them anything?

1237
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:42,433
[SPEAKER_07]: They're an autonomous body.

1238
01:37:42,453 --> 01:37:43,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1239
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:49,278
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't answer to the meffitt city council So why do we if this is so clear as my council colleague is stating?

1240
01:37:49,919 --> 01:37:51,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we have to mention anything to them?

1241
01:37:52,185 --> 01:37:55,770
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the Zoning Board of Appeals doesn't create public policy, they execute it.

1242
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:58,553
[SPEAKER_20]: The Medford City Council creates and establishes public policy.

1243
01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:02,278
[SPEAKER_20]: That policy's been established and the Zoning Board of Appeals is using their discretion.

1244
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:05,646
[SPEAKER_20]: to say, no, you can't bring an application before us when they can't.

1245
01:38:06,126 --> 01:38:08,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So are they a violation?

1246
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:09,368
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they a violation?

1247
01:38:09,408 --> 01:38:10,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're saying?

1248
01:38:10,788 --> 01:38:22,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that the Zoning Board of Appeals made an error, an error in judgment that's opened the city up to liabilities by refusing to hear an application for an individual that's applied for a use variance based upon the legislative history and the solicitor's opinion.

1249
01:38:22,353 --> 01:38:23,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I do.

1250
01:38:23,153 --> 01:38:24,053
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel as though they made an error.

1251
01:38:24,493 --> 01:38:26,054
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why I put this resolution forward.

1252
01:38:26,074 --> 01:38:31,336
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why I took the time to research the legislative history so that we'd all understand that this is how it went down.

1253
01:38:34,036 --> 01:38:38,357
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a motion on the floor by council and I, is that, does that motion have a second?

1254
01:38:38,717 --> 01:38:39,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, Mr. President.

1255
01:38:39,817 --> 01:38:42,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Bears.

1256
01:38:43,758 --> 01:38:44,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1257
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:48,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess just, I wasn't here for all that legislative history.

1258
01:38:49,459 --> 01:38:53,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my only question right now, and I might want to do some more research.

1259
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And until I do that, I don't think I could vote for this.

1260
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:00,161
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the council passed,

1261
01:39:01,232 --> 01:39:04,173
[SPEAKER_02]: the paper saying that we approve of the solicitor's opinion.

1262
01:39:04,213 --> 01:39:07,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that change the ordinance and the issues with the ordinance that we're having?

1263
01:39:08,515 --> 01:39:10,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it clarified the situation.

1264
01:39:10,556 --> 01:39:16,359
[SPEAKER_20]: The solicitor gave us an opinion that said that there was a scrivener's error in the codification of the ordinances that happened in 2001.

1265
01:39:16,559 --> 01:39:22,061
[SPEAKER_20]: The city solicitor has produced a document from August 12, 2016 that includes history of his research.

1266
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:32,693
[SPEAKER_20]: Part of that history is an email exchange between the solicitor and the MuniCode company that we use to codify our ordinances.

1267
01:39:33,173 --> 01:39:42,716
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you go through that email, you can see the history and the back and forth, MuniCode even saying that it's an error, that use variances are allowed and never should have been changed.

1268
01:39:43,116 --> 01:39:52,539
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's plenty of documentation backing up the fact that the codified ordinances that were done in 2001 contained a Scribner's error relative to use variances.

1269
01:39:52,819 --> 01:39:54,380
[SPEAKER_20]: We asked for clarification, we got it.

1270
01:39:55,802 --> 01:39:58,145
[SPEAKER_20]: We've adopted the clarification as law in the community.

1271
01:39:58,505 --> 01:39:59,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1272
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:02,175
[SPEAKER_07]: What information, Councilor Marks?

1273
01:40:02,876 --> 01:40:04,977
[SPEAKER_07]: It's as clear as mud, Mr. President.

1274
01:40:05,518 --> 01:40:19,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And for my council colleague just to state that he believed the Zoning Board of Appeals made an error in judgment when they voted on something shows you how unclear this is, Mr. President, because they're all very capable people on that Zoning Board of Appeals.

1275
01:40:20,009 --> 01:40:21,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not as clear as stated.

1276
01:40:21,991 --> 01:40:25,574
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not something, you know, against a colleague or this or that.

1277
01:40:26,014 --> 01:40:28,356
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make sure, Mr. Not taken that way at all, Councilor.

1278
01:40:28,676 --> 01:40:39,946
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I just want to make sure, Mr. President, that when the Zoning Board of Appeals gets together and discusses an issue, a use variance is probably one of the highest standards of variances.

1279
01:40:40,286 --> 01:40:40,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about it.

1280
01:40:41,066 --> 01:40:44,049
[SPEAKER_07]: You're changing the use of a particular site.

1281
01:40:44,389 --> 01:40:50,254
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not doing a setback, or you're not doing something about a height limitation, or whatever, topography.

1282
01:40:50,574 --> 01:40:53,137
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about changing the use of a property.

1283
01:40:53,777 --> 01:40:57,120
[SPEAKER_07]: That is probably the most sacred part of zoning.

1284
01:40:57,701 --> 01:41:09,551
[SPEAKER_07]: And to say that our Zoning Board of Appeals doesn't understand that, whether you can give or use variance or not, maybe they shouldn't be on the Zoning Board of Appeals if they don't understand that aspect of the zoning.

1285
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:10,112
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a good point.

1286
01:41:10,132 --> 01:41:11,033
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a very good point.

1287
01:41:11,113 --> 01:41:12,754
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is it's not clear.

1288
01:41:12,894 --> 01:41:13,635
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the point.

1289
01:41:14,016 --> 01:41:15,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would caution my colleagues

1290
01:41:15,899 --> 01:41:20,704
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're in the process of changing things now and finally looking after a couple of decades.

1291
01:41:21,044 --> 01:41:22,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this right.

1292
01:41:22,446 --> 01:41:23,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this right.

1293
01:41:23,747 --> 01:41:26,650
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and some of us may have difference of opinion like I do.

1294
01:41:27,211 --> 01:41:28,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1295
01:41:28,733 --> 01:41:29,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Martz.

1296
01:41:29,734 --> 01:41:33,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears, did you have further questions or comments?

1297
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:36,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, I guess.

1298
01:41:37,327 --> 01:41:42,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a clarification that the ordinance is wrong, but the incorrect language is still in the zoning ordinance.

1299
01:41:42,329 --> 01:41:43,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that basically where we are?

1300
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:45,171
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not.

1301
01:41:45,751 --> 01:41:48,572
[SPEAKER_20]: We've actually moved to correct the language.

1302
01:41:48,652 --> 01:41:51,834
[SPEAKER_20]: However, the codification last occurred in 2001.

1303
01:41:52,974 --> 01:42:01,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Based upon the meeting that we had just an hour or two ago, the next step that this council is going to take going forward with our zoning reform would be a recodification.

1304
01:42:02,099 --> 01:42:05,000
[SPEAKER_20]: At that time, I think that this error would be addressed anyhow.

1305
01:42:05,736 --> 01:42:09,780
[SPEAKER_20]: However, in the meantime, we have applicants that are applying for use variances.

1306
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,061
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not given their day in court.

1307
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:12,582
[SPEAKER_20]: They deserve the right to a hearing.

1308
01:42:12,602 --> 01:42:16,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Whether they get denied or not, they shouldn't be told they can't apply and that they can't present their case.

1309
01:42:16,565 --> 01:42:18,627
[SPEAKER_20]: They should be given the opportunity to present their case.

1310
01:42:19,888 --> 01:42:21,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to the Zoning Board of Appeals, not us.

1311
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:27,314
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's up to the Zoning Board of Appeals insofar as whether or not they have the authority to issue the use variance.

1312
01:42:27,805 --> 01:42:37,107
[SPEAKER_20]: With the zoning board saying we don't have the authority to issue the use variance if we had the legislative body is saying no you do Because our legislative history and the intent of the acts they should do there's a problem.

1313
01:42:37,507 --> 01:42:43,408
[SPEAKER_07]: There's two conflicting sections in the zoning I think that's what council beers is alluding to right?

1314
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:52,830
[SPEAKER_20]: By way of the vote on paper 1 8 3 7 6 we addressed it those we addressed those two conflicting sections We adopted the list of his opinion.

1315
01:42:53,130 --> 01:42:55,010
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no longer two conflicting sections.

1316
01:42:55,130 --> 01:42:57,331
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been Oh, no, there is

1317
01:42:59,977 --> 01:43:01,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, we can no longer hear you.

1318
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, we can't hear you.

1319
01:43:08,064 --> 01:43:08,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1320
01:43:10,886 --> 01:43:14,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Peters, did you have any further questions?

1321
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:16,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at this time, thank you.

1322
01:43:16,892 --> 01:43:18,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1323
01:43:18,553 --> 01:43:19,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from the council?

1324
01:43:23,357 --> 01:43:23,497
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1325
01:43:24,338 --> 01:43:25,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1326
01:43:25,659 --> 01:43:27,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions in general?

1327
01:43:28,203 --> 01:43:30,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody from the public who have a question or want to comment on this?

1328
01:43:30,965 --> 01:43:33,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1329
01:43:34,548 --> 01:43:39,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Hernebies, have you received any emails since we started talking about this issue?

1330
01:43:39,752 --> 01:43:41,194
[SPEAKER_13]: President, there are no emails on this topic.

1331
01:43:41,214 --> 01:43:43,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so there is a motion on the floor.

1332
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:50,401
[SPEAKER_10]: That motion was from Councilor Knight, and it was seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

1333
01:43:52,743 --> 01:43:55,986
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, Clerk Hernebies, please call the roll.

01:44:26,904 --> 01:44:27,744
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

01:44:28,165 --> 01:44:29,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Four votes to three.

1354
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:32,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

1355
01:44:32,909 --> 01:44:34,410
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-345 offered by Councilor Knight.

1356
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:49,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it so resolved that the Chief of Fire and Chief of Police provide the Medford City Council with a breakdown of minimum safe staffing requirements by job title, a breakdown of current staffing levels by job title, and a listing of budgeted positions that are currently vacant.

1357
01:44:49,922 --> 01:44:50,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1358
01:44:51,378 --> 01:44:57,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, based upon the conversations that we had last Wednesday evening, the financial picture in this community is grim.

1359
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:09,422
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's incumbent upon us as city councilors to make sure that we are informed as best we can be when it comes down to the current financial circumstances that are facing this community.

1360
01:45:10,182 --> 01:45:12,043
[SPEAKER_20]: We've seen our private outside

1361
01:45:12,981 --> 01:45:16,683
[SPEAKER_20]: can help you get revenue forecasts of what to expect for the next fiscal year.

1362
01:45:17,523 --> 01:45:21,265
[SPEAKER_20]: One of those things is an $8 million budget shortfall at this point in time.

1363
01:45:21,865 --> 01:45:26,327
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I put several resolutions on this evening on similar subject matter.

1364
01:45:26,847 --> 01:45:37,912
[SPEAKER_20]: And what they are is to get information to this council so that we can sit back and begin to craft an informed decision that we need to make on whether or not we're going to pass a budget this year and what that budget is going to include.

1365
01:45:39,063 --> 01:45:45,771
[SPEAKER_20]: On top of that, Mr. President, we need to take a look at certain aspects of our service delivery and identify what's important and essential to us.

1366
01:45:45,931 --> 01:45:55,483
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that based upon the circumstances that we've all faced, no one can shake a stick at the fact that our public safety personnel are going above and beyond during these trying times right now.

1367
01:45:55,503 --> 01:45:57,966
[SPEAKER_20]: They're essential workers that have been out there on the front lines.

1368
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:17,278
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I'd just like to see what it is our current staffing levels are, our budgeted staffing levels are, and our minimum staffing levels are to ensure that as we move forward and we face these trying fiscal times, that we do our best to secure as many positions as we can in the public safety realm so that moving forward, we know that the residents in this community are protected.

1369
01:46:17,758 --> 01:46:27,061
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that, you know, we've all said it before, the number one priority and the number one goal and objective as an elected official in this community is making sure our streets are safe and our community is safe, and we can't do that without

1370
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:28,462
[SPEAKER_20]: public safety personnel.

1371
01:46:29,322 --> 01:46:31,143
[SPEAKER_20]: I ask my council colleagues to support the results.

1372
01:46:32,344 --> 01:46:33,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilman.

1373
01:46:33,105 --> 01:46:36,847
[SPEAKER_10]: So Councilman, did you want to take these all up at once or did you want to individually?

1374
01:46:37,647 --> 01:46:44,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, I would say paper 20345, paper 20346, paper 20350, and paper 20351 are all of similar subject matter and can be consolidated.

1375
01:46:50,427 --> 01:46:54,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I'm going to read those, I'll read each resolution now and then we will take a vote on this.

1376
01:46:54,608 --> 01:46:59,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd ask that you wait for read paper 20350 last Mr. President.

1377
01:47:00,709 --> 01:47:10,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so 20346 offered by Council night be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request an update on the balance remaining in the DPW Snow and Ice account.

1378
01:47:12,005 --> 01:47:14,426
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-0-351 offered by Council on 8.

1379
01:47:14,486 --> 01:47:32,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it so resolved that Medford City Council request a report from the city administration outlining the number of vacant positions funded in the fiscal year 20 budget, including the job title, department, amount of appropriation for each job title, and account number for which each appropriation is funded.

1380
01:47:33,398 --> 01:47:36,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And 2-0-350 offered by Council on 8.

1381
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request

1382
01:47:40,762 --> 01:47:58,727
[SPEAKER_10]: The figures outlined in the revenue forecast presentation made at the May 8th, 2019 City Council Committee, the whole by the, that's May 8th, 2020 City Council Committee, the whole by the city's outside auditors provided to the council in written format.

1383
01:48:00,648 --> 01:48:06,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So on those resolutions offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1384
01:48:09,084 --> 01:48:21,273
[SPEAKER_20]: When we go back to last Wednesday evening's meeting and we met with our private outside consultant responsible for auditing here in the city of Medford, he also provided us with some revenue forecasts.

1385
01:48:21,933 --> 01:48:27,998
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was very impressed with the presentation and the level of preparedness that Mr. Roselli brought to the table.

1386
01:48:28,978 --> 01:48:37,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, one of the things that he said that I took away that evening was that he is confident that we can start a budget discussion by

1387
01:48:37,688 --> 01:48:39,949
[SPEAKER_20]: June 1st and have a budget by June 30th.

1388
01:48:41,409 --> 01:48:44,250
[SPEAKER_20]: He's given us revenue forecasts that are very conservative.

1389
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:54,533
[SPEAKER_20]: And moving forward, I think it's important that we work as hard as we can to put together an annual fiscal year budget, Mr. President.

1390
01:48:54,713 --> 01:48:59,475
[SPEAKER_20]: I know there's been a lot of talk about a one-twelfths budget or a quarterly budget.

1391
01:48:59,815 --> 01:49:02,336
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't think that that's the way to go, Mr. President.

1392
01:49:02,516 --> 01:49:06,737
[SPEAKER_20]: In these discussions that we had on Wednesday evening, we talked about what approach we were going to take.

1393
01:49:08,258 --> 01:49:22,167
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's a question as to whether or not we want to take a wait-and-see approach Wait and see if we're going to get bailed out by the federal government wait and see if we're going to get bailed out by the state government We have revenue projections from private outside consultants that we're paying money to to give us revenue projections.

1394
01:49:22,527 --> 01:49:24,868
[SPEAKER_20]: We have them I feel as though it's important.

1395
01:49:24,888 --> 01:49:32,153
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President that we take the bull by the horns That we move forward and we control our own destiny and don't wait for a bailout

1396
01:49:33,314 --> 01:49:38,798
[SPEAKER_20]: If, in fact, we're going to be facing trying fiscal times, then we need to take the bull by the horns.

1397
01:49:39,298 --> 01:49:41,559
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to do things the Medford way, Mr. President.

1398
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:47,824
[SPEAKER_20]: And sitting back and playing the wait and see who's going to bail us out approach is not the Medford way.

1399
01:49:48,404 --> 01:49:55,669
[SPEAKER_20]: If that were the Medford way, Mr. President, we wouldn't have been the first community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to have a transit-oriented smock growth development.

1400
01:49:58,353 --> 01:50:07,577
[SPEAKER_20]: If waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we certainly wouldn't have been able to purchase the grounds where Homel Stadium is for $1 and a land transfer.

1401
01:50:08,857 --> 01:50:16,901
[SPEAKER_20]: If waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we wouldn't have been able to get our applications in early enough to get a 90% reimbursement on the construction of our schools.

1402
01:50:18,342 --> 01:50:26,365
[SPEAKER_20]: If waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we wouldn't have been the first community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to establish a linkage fee

1403
01:50:27,273 --> 01:50:35,116
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think, Mr. President, as we move forward, what we need to do is put together a budget, a 12-month annual budget, where we make hard decisions.

1404
01:50:35,997 --> 01:50:40,819
[SPEAKER_20]: God forbid we have to go forward with those projections that have been presented to us.

1405
01:50:41,139 --> 01:50:41,759
[SPEAKER_20]: God forbid.

1406
01:50:42,179 --> 01:50:45,180
[SPEAKER_20]: Because there's going to be a lot of cuts, and those cuts are going to cut deep.

1407
01:50:45,761 --> 01:50:50,042
[SPEAKER_20]: But we have revenue forecasts right now that give us a worst-case scenario.

1408
01:50:50,643 --> 01:50:54,084
[SPEAKER_20]: So we should be putting together an annual budget based upon the worst-case scenario.

1409
01:50:54,733 --> 01:51:01,558
[SPEAKER_20]: If, in fact, our funding comes back from the feds or the states better than we anticipated, then we have an influx of cash and we'll be able to fill the gaps.

1410
01:51:02,418 --> 01:51:09,003
[SPEAKER_20]: On Wednesday night, we did have a significant discussion relative to where the administration is in the preparation of their budget.

1411
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:14,286
[SPEAKER_20]: COVID-19 caused the government shutdown beginning on the 13th of March.

1412
01:51:15,888 --> 01:51:19,730
[SPEAKER_20]: We were scheduled to meet the first week in April on the budget, Mr. President.

1413
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:22,332
[SPEAKER_20]: That was two weeks before the government shutdown.

1414
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:29,618
[SPEAKER_20]: I doubt the administration was going to be able to put together an entire budget in two weeks, which would lead us all to believe that there was some work being done in the budget.

1415
01:51:30,318 --> 01:51:40,982
[SPEAKER_20]: The city administration has actually confirmed that every single department in the city has presented the administration with their working fiscal year 21 budget.

1416
01:51:41,582 --> 01:51:44,303
[SPEAKER_20]: These documents have not been consolidated.

1417
01:51:44,683 --> 01:51:46,044
[SPEAKER_20]: There is going to be a need for trimming.

1418
01:51:47,144 --> 01:51:50,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously, there are many competing needs in this community.

1419
01:51:50,427 --> 01:51:59,510
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're at the spot right now where we have worst case scenario revenue forecasts, and we have a budget based upon the projections prior to COVID-19.

1420
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:05,831
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we all want to deliver services at or better than the level that we're at today.

1421
01:52:06,772 --> 01:52:13,394
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, we have a budget that will allow us to do that, that hasn't been consolidated, but East Montgomery has presented that to us.

1422
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:17,995
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have forecasts, what the money is going to be from our private outside consultants.

1423
01:52:18,442 --> 01:52:23,729
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think, Mr. President, we're in a position where we can put together a 12-month annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year.

1424
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:25,332
[SPEAKER_20]: It might not be a pretty budget.

1425
01:52:25,652 --> 01:52:29,417
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be something that might require some tough decisions.

1426
01:52:30,018 --> 01:52:33,102
[SPEAKER_20]: But at the end of the day, like Councilor Mack said, a budget's made up of 85% salaries.

1427
01:52:35,563 --> 01:52:38,184
[SPEAKER_20]: So cutting a couple of water coolers isn't going to cut the mustard.

1428
01:52:38,244 --> 01:52:41,385
[SPEAKER_20]: We have $8 million to fill, and we've got to start doing it now.

1429
01:52:41,905 --> 01:52:45,066
[SPEAKER_20]: And sitting back and waiting to be bailed out by the Feds is not the measured way.

1430
01:52:45,426 --> 01:52:51,888
[SPEAKER_20]: If it were, we wouldn't have seen the successes that we've seen in the past, and we wouldn't have been able to weather the terrible fiscal times that we've seen in the past, like back in 2008.

1431
01:52:53,137 --> 01:52:58,021
[SPEAKER_20]: Quite frankly, here we are 12 years later, we really haven't recovered from the 2008 cuts that have been made.

1432
01:52:58,241 --> 01:53:00,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at our DPW and the staffing levels there.

1433
01:53:00,643 --> 01:53:06,047
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, Mr. President, we need a 12 month budget moving forward for fiscal year 21.

1434
01:53:06,148 --> 01:53:09,991
[SPEAKER_20]: And I asked my council colleagues to support this consolidated amendment.

1435
01:53:10,451 --> 01:53:15,555
[SPEAKER_20]: And moving forward, I look forward to working with them to solve some of these fiscal concerns that we have here in the community.

1436
01:53:16,216 --> 01:53:17,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1437
01:53:17,737 --> 01:53:19,799
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by...

1438
01:53:20,717 --> 01:53:21,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, Mr. President.

1439
01:53:21,938 --> 01:53:23,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Peters.

1440
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:25,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1441
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:28,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with much of what Councilor Knight just said.

1442
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:40,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to propose a B paper that the city administration also report to us, have discussions with the Division of Local Services, the Department of Revenue, and report back to us.

1443
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:46,364
[SPEAKER_02]: on any options for municipal bonds to cover operating expenses.

1444
01:53:46,544 --> 01:53:49,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the case, so that's the motion.

1445
01:53:49,725 --> 01:53:57,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have to just think in the case that the federal, you know, it's very possible that a federal bailout won't be forthcoming or it won't be timely.

1446
01:53:57,726 --> 01:54:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we should explore all options to make sure that we don't have to make more cuts because as has been said many times, and as Councilor Knight just said, we haven't recovered from the last round of cuts.

1447
01:54:08,969 --> 01:54:09,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Peres.

1448
01:54:11,249 --> 01:54:15,699
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Council Marks, Council Knight, the Vice President Caraviello, Council Marks.

1449
01:54:16,865 --> 01:54:17,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1450
01:54:17,966 --> 01:54:22,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I think any time you can plan ahead of time is prudent.

1451
01:54:22,248 --> 01:54:24,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So I support planning ahead of time.

1452
01:54:25,509 --> 01:54:33,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't think for a second that the city administration doesn't have a plan A, a plan B, and a plan C that they're currently working on.

1453
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:44,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I stated last week when we talked to the independent auditor, I remember years over the last several years of recent that we'd get a budget two or three days before it's due.

1454
01:54:44,978 --> 01:54:49,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're a month and a half, and it's like the sky's falling in.

1455
01:54:50,464 --> 01:54:56,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize that we're facing some tough times, but I think we have to let the process play out.

1456
01:54:56,611 --> 01:55:04,959
[SPEAKER_07]: The independent auditor also said over the next two to three weeks that we should get some meaningful answers on revenue projections.

1457
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:22,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, as one person, Mr. President, especially now when people are in fear, people are in fear right now, I don't want to put together a worst-case budget just for the sake of putting together a worst-case budget and alarming people because you know what's going to happen, Mr. President.

1458
01:55:22,443 --> 01:55:25,144
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to make tough decisions, as Councilor Knight mentioned.

1459
01:55:25,644 --> 01:55:30,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And with those decisions, you're going to have to mention layoffs, potential layoffs and so forth.

1460
01:55:30,905 --> 01:55:34,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can avoid that, Mr. President, without alarming people,

1461
01:55:35,046 --> 01:55:43,235
[SPEAKER_07]: and get to the numbers we need to get to, why do we have to put together a budget now and alarm people that may potentially lose their jobs?

1462
01:55:44,082 --> 01:55:45,823
[SPEAKER_07]: if that's not the case, Mr. President.

1463
01:55:46,343 --> 01:55:49,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And regarding a bailout, I mean, you know, it is what it is.

1464
01:55:50,844 --> 01:55:53,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd ask anyone if they're going to return their stimulus check.

1465
01:55:53,845 --> 01:55:54,665
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bailout.

1466
01:55:55,445 --> 01:55:57,566
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people are going to return your stimulus check again.

1467
01:55:57,906 --> 01:56:04,448
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if the city needs the funds, Mr. President, because revenue projections are down, local aid is going to be down.

1468
01:56:05,388 --> 01:56:06,969
[SPEAKER_07]: then so be it, Mr. President.

1469
01:56:07,029 --> 01:56:10,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's what we have to wait for, then I'm willing to wait, Mr. President.

1470
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:13,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we've waited in the past.

1471
01:56:13,791 --> 01:56:14,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should wait now.

1472
01:56:14,891 --> 01:56:16,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should stay fast.

1473
01:56:16,632 --> 01:56:19,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should see what the administration's working on.

1474
01:56:19,213 --> 01:56:23,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, in the past, as I mentioned, when you would talk about a 1-12 budget,

1475
01:56:24,835 --> 01:56:35,001
[SPEAKER_07]: It was always the city administration, Mr. President, that was against the 112th budget, because they didn't want the council to have the purse strings every month, and they didn't want to be accountable to the council.

1476
01:56:35,341 --> 01:56:43,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So every mayor for the past 20 years in this city, when a 112th budget was brought up, they've always rejected it immediately, saying they're not interested.

1477
01:56:44,679 --> 01:56:46,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it seems to be the wave.

1478
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:49,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Now everyone's looking at a 112 budget.

1479
01:56:49,561 --> 01:56:51,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe that's the direction we need to go in.

1480
01:56:52,262 --> 01:57:01,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Mr. President, but I think we should wait this out a few more weeks to see what a city auditor says, see where the projections come in, see where the revenue.

1481
01:57:01,766 --> 01:57:03,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget we extended the taxes to June 1st.

1482
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:08,912
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of this is dependent on what tax revenue we experience.

1483
01:57:09,292 --> 01:57:15,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And so far, we were told by the auditor that we're higher than expected, the amount of money we received so far.

1484
01:57:15,795 --> 01:57:18,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we anticipate about $29 or $30 million.

1485
01:57:19,216 --> 01:57:22,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say they received $12 or $13 million.

1486
01:57:22,638 --> 01:57:25,719
[SPEAKER_07]: The number escapes me, but to date so far.

1487
01:57:26,119 --> 01:57:29,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're looking good with the revenue that we anticipated.

1488
01:57:30,641 --> 01:57:31,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Local receipts are down.

1489
01:57:32,402 --> 01:57:35,003
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to take our time on this, Mr. President.

1490
01:57:35,615 --> 01:57:49,934
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think trying to force the hand we've never gotten it since I've been on the council We've never gotten involved with the city administration when they established their budget never Now we're hearing about I want to see the department head's wish list

1491
01:57:50,455 --> 01:57:51,656
[SPEAKER_07]: We've never had access.

1492
01:57:51,696 --> 01:57:54,157
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always been between the mayor and the department heads.

1493
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:59,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the department heads appear before the Medford City Council, we can ask, why is your budget like this?

1494
01:57:59,561 --> 01:58:00,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a wishlist?

1495
01:58:00,762 --> 01:58:01,542
[SPEAKER_07]: We can ask that.

1496
01:58:01,782 --> 01:58:08,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's always been between the administration and their department heads, not the responsibility of the council.

1497
01:58:09,467 --> 01:58:14,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can appreciate the fact that we want to try to get ahead of this, but that's not overstep our boundaries.

1498
01:58:15,651 --> 01:58:18,753
[SPEAKER_07]: The administration is responsible for the establishment of the budget.

1499
01:58:19,895 --> 01:58:22,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's their responsibility, Mr. President.

1500
01:58:22,416 --> 01:58:24,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's let this process play out.

1501
01:58:24,937 --> 01:58:27,438
[SPEAKER_07]: However we can assist, I think we're all willing to do that.

1502
01:58:28,018 --> 01:58:29,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not overstep our boundary.

1503
01:58:29,899 --> 01:58:40,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's have a better idea and understanding what revenues we're going to receive before we start alarming police, fire, teachers of layoffs.

1504
01:58:40,643 --> 01:58:45,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you create a budget that's $8 million short, you're going to be looking at bodies, Mr. President.

1505
01:58:45,265 --> 01:58:46,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I can guarantee you.

1506
01:58:46,265 --> 01:58:47,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been around for a while.

1507
01:58:47,405 --> 01:58:48,586
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be looking at bodies.

1508
01:58:49,437 --> 01:58:52,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we don't need to get into those conversations, why do it?

1509
01:58:53,078 --> 01:58:53,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Why alarm people?

1510
01:58:54,198 --> 01:58:57,339
[SPEAKER_07]: People have enough on their mind right now with this COVID-19.

1511
01:58:57,799 --> 01:59:02,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Why tell them that potentially they could lose their job when it's not even necessary, Mr. President?

1512
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:03,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1513
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:05,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1514
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:07,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1515
01:59:09,201 --> 01:59:12,521
[SPEAKER_20]: I certainly agree with certain aspects of what Councilor Marks said.

1516
01:59:12,722 --> 01:59:15,162
[SPEAKER_20]: One of them being we need to see what the administration's working on.

1517
01:59:15,865 --> 01:59:28,790
[SPEAKER_20]: And at Wednesday night's meeting, that's why I requested that the administration provide us with the copies of those departmental budgets that they've received thus far, so that we can see how far along in the process they are in establishing a budget.

1518
01:59:29,870 --> 01:59:39,734
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultimately, Mr. President, general law would say that the administration is required to present the council with a budget by the 170th day after the organization of government.

1519
01:59:40,194 --> 01:59:45,196
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you see that we have an inauguration,

1520
01:59:45,799 --> 01:59:48,440
[SPEAKER_20]: Administration, 170 days, budget to the council.

1521
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:52,841
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what the division of local services, state law says surrounding this.

1522
01:59:53,021 --> 02:00:04,045
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, while the council doesn't necessarily get involved in producing a budget, if in fact we don't receive a budget by the 170th day, by law, we have the right to establish our own budget and put our own budget together.

1523
02:00:04,325 --> 02:00:05,465
[SPEAKER_20]: We've never done that before.

1524
02:00:05,826 --> 02:00:08,206
[SPEAKER_20]: We've never done that before in the history of the city of Medford.

1525
02:00:08,646 --> 02:00:09,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Never done it before, Mr. President.

1526
02:00:11,479 --> 02:00:14,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Difficult times call for difficult measures and drastic times call for drastic measures.

1527
02:00:15,022 --> 02:00:18,405
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not recommending that the council put forward its own budget and send it forward.

1528
02:00:18,686 --> 02:00:23,550
[SPEAKER_20]: What I am saying is that we need to be on the same page moving forward and then we have to have an expectation.

1529
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:26,192
[SPEAKER_20]: And that expectation should be that we have an annual budget.

1530
02:00:28,514 --> 02:00:29,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you councilor.

1531
02:00:35,167 --> 02:00:37,709
[SPEAKER_10]: One second, Councilor Scarpelli, you're muted, one minute.

1532
02:00:37,869 --> 02:00:38,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1533
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:52,079
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with Councilor Marksley and Councilor Naidoo, but I remember, you know, Councilor Falco, I remember the tradition, it was the Friday of Father's Day weekend and then the vote of the school committee was that Monday.

1534
02:00:52,859 --> 02:01:01,386
[SPEAKER_11]: That was that's what the deal was and we didn't like it then and as this as the we started the process as city councilors We didn't like the process either.

1535
02:01:01,526 --> 02:01:09,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I I will tell you the reason why I would like to see this information from our department heads Because this is what other communities are doing.

1536
02:01:09,532 --> 02:01:10,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I've sat with my department.

1537
02:01:11,273 --> 02:01:16,737
[SPEAKER_11]: We've gone through a five percent ten percent twenty percent reduction With a level funded budget from last year.

1538
02:01:17,238 --> 02:01:22,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So it prepares us so we all know we're all frightened of what's going to happen or what could happen

1539
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:27,158
[SPEAKER_11]: But at least we're prepared as a department that

1540
02:01:27,799 --> 02:01:43,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I am the assistant running that department and getting prepared to, as the time runs out and the state is dragging their feet and the federal government hoping for a buyout, I think we need the opportunity to see what's in front of us, to see what we need.

1541
02:01:43,925 --> 02:01:46,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think, you know, the fear is there anyway.

1542
02:01:46,085 --> 02:01:47,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand what Councilman Mark's saying.

1543
02:01:47,906 --> 02:01:52,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's our privy to come out and say, okay, look at the budget fire.

1544
02:01:52,087 --> 02:01:54,328
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have to cut 20 people, God forbid.

1545
02:01:55,549 --> 02:01:56,529
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's also,

1546
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:05,009
[SPEAKER_11]: understanding what we're going to see in front of us, not at the 12th hour like we have in the past.

1547
02:02:05,069 --> 02:02:08,132
[SPEAKER_11]: And believe me, I don't blame this administration at all.

1548
02:02:09,493 --> 02:02:22,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the hard work they're doing, getting the auditor in front of us and talking to us and giving us forecasts, but I don't see what it will hurt to get this information in front of us right now from all our department heads so we can understand what we're doing.

1549
02:02:23,188 --> 02:02:24,429
[SPEAKER_11]: The school department's doing it.

1550
02:02:24,889 --> 02:02:26,490
[SPEAKER_11]: They understand the situation they're in.

1551
02:02:26,971 --> 02:02:28,352
[SPEAKER_11]: They're meeting with their department heads.

1552
02:02:28,732 --> 02:02:30,473
[SPEAKER_11]: They're understanding this situation ahead of time.

1553
02:02:30,833 --> 02:02:35,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Why wouldn't we, as a city, be prepared in the same situation for the same situation?

1554
02:02:35,837 --> 02:02:39,940
[SPEAKER_11]: So like I said, I know of other communities that are doing a 1-12 budget.

1555
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:41,221
[SPEAKER_11]: They've already announced that.

1556
02:02:42,422 --> 02:02:44,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I know communities doing a quarterly budget.

1557
02:02:44,723 --> 02:02:45,584
[SPEAKER_11]: They've already announced that.

1558
02:02:46,561 --> 02:02:56,430
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we're seeing is at least they're getting minimal information, maximum information that they can receive, so they're prepared to move forward with their thought process.

1559
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:57,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this isn't going to be easy.

1560
02:02:58,131 --> 02:02:58,872
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that.

1561
02:02:59,532 --> 02:03:05,638
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that if this stays status quo, this is going to be a difficult, difficult time for our community.

1562
02:03:06,559 --> 02:03:07,800
[SPEAKER_11]: And being nervous,

1563
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:12,441
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, as a municipal employee, I'm nervous.

1564
02:03:13,302 --> 02:03:16,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I look at our numbers, I'm nervous that I might be losing my job.

1565
02:03:17,264 --> 02:03:18,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So it comes with the territory.

1566
02:03:19,505 --> 02:03:24,187
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think as city councillors, getting that information in front of us is going to be important.

1567
02:03:24,207 --> 02:03:27,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why, you know, I understand, I don't want to put the fear on anybody.

1568
02:03:27,829 --> 02:03:33,612
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately, sometimes understanding something maybe

1569
02:03:34,738 --> 02:03:53,821
[SPEAKER_11]: When your back's against the wall, this is when people push to our state delegates and reach out to the governor and reach out to the federal government, reach out so the president can hear us and say, listen, we need maybe not a trillion dollar bailout package, but maybe some kind of a package that we're focusing on our state and local

1570
02:03:54,361 --> 02:03:56,963
[SPEAKER_11]: local governments to support us and what's going on.

1571
02:03:57,403 --> 02:03:59,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So sitting back, I understand.

1572
02:03:59,505 --> 02:04:07,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think that that, I think we need, I don't think we need to go after it and help and scare people and the sky is falling mentality.

1573
02:04:08,271 --> 02:04:13,935
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we need to be prepared as a council to see what shortfalls are coming with each department.

1574
02:04:13,955 --> 02:04:15,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's important to what we have to do.

1575
02:04:15,416 --> 02:04:19,900
[SPEAKER_11]: So I support that initiative, Mr. Councilman Knight.

1576
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:20,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1577
02:04:21,288 --> 02:04:22,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

1578
02:04:22,629 --> 02:04:24,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell, did you have your hand up before?

1579
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:25,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I did, yeah.

1580
02:04:26,372 --> 02:04:27,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1581
02:04:27,333 --> 02:04:42,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I just want to echo what my council colleagues are saying is that I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward, and we really are in a place where the more information we have access to, the better we're able to act when that time comes, when the budget does come down.

1582
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:47,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Municipalities are doing this, businesses are doing this, where they're looking at all scenarios, whether it's

1583
02:04:48,544 --> 02:04:59,546
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, a 5% cut, a 10% cut, a 15% cut in the money that's coming down so that we can really look at all of our options and understand when that budget does come out, what information we're working with.

1584
02:04:59,626 --> 02:05:05,388
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, part of the challenge of these times is the absolute level of uncertainty.

1585
02:05:05,828 --> 02:05:11,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So those places where we can get more information before it's time to act, I think is really essential.

1586
02:05:11,709 --> 02:05:16,970
[SPEAKER_06]: So I echo my council colleagues in that sense and support these resolutions.

1587
02:05:18,012 --> 02:05:19,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1588
02:05:19,033 --> 02:05:19,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello.

1589
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:21,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1590
02:05:21,898 --> 02:05:27,526
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of good points were made tonight on all ends, and I don't think anybody wants to scare anybody.

1591
02:05:28,407 --> 02:05:29,569
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality...

1592
02:05:30,248 --> 02:05:33,169
[SPEAKER_03]: tough times after we require tough decisions.

1593
02:05:34,049 --> 02:05:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to have the information not to find out, to scare people into losing jobs, but find ways to keep people's jobs, not cut them, help out with alternative revenue streams that come into the city.

1594
02:05:50,934 --> 02:05:53,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can all agree that I've been in the council a long time.

1595
02:05:53,094 --> 02:05:55,055
[SPEAKER_03]: On the city end,

1596
02:05:57,291 --> 02:05:58,712
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't afford to cut anybody.

1597
02:05:58,952 --> 02:06:03,016
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working with the bare bones departments.

1598
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:11,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what can possibly be cut from the city's side.

1599
02:06:12,152 --> 02:06:13,512
[SPEAKER_03]: We're short on the DPW.

1600
02:06:13,812 --> 02:06:14,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We're short everywhere.

1601
02:06:15,073 --> 02:06:15,953
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do?

1602
02:06:15,973 --> 02:06:16,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to cut them?

1603
02:06:17,373 --> 02:06:32,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our job is to figure out how to save their jobs and help with alternative revenue streams to keep these people's jobs and not have them be in fear of losing their jobs.

1604
02:06:32,797 --> 02:06:37,140
[SPEAKER_03]: There are review streams out there that we haven't even looked at.

1605
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:41,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I think if we have the information in front of us, we can make a better decision.

1606
02:06:41,924 --> 02:06:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't want anyone to lose their job.

1607
02:06:44,245 --> 02:06:49,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll sit there and I'll fight to make sure that we can save jobs, not lose them.

1608
02:06:51,130 --> 02:06:52,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1609
02:06:53,192 --> 02:06:53,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

1610
02:06:54,993 --> 02:06:55,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1611
02:06:55,954 --> 02:06:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to sound like a broken record, but

1612
02:06:58,390 --> 02:07:01,393
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're talking about a second great depression level of numbers.

1613
02:07:01,433 --> 02:07:06,638
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about unemployment numbers and economic numbers that we haven't seen in a hundred years.

1614
02:07:07,519 --> 02:07:13,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think looking at alternative revenue sources is important, but I think this overarching point that we really can't afford to cut any more.

1615
02:07:13,606 --> 02:07:21,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And the back end of that point is that there's actually going to be a higher demand for our services through this crisis and at the end of the crisis.

1616
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:32,325
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really think we need to explore all options, alternative revenue sources, and really lean into this idea that it might be important for us to try to cover this deficit with bonding.

1617
02:07:32,445 --> 02:07:34,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a once in a century question.

1618
02:07:35,227 --> 02:07:36,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a once in a century question.

1619
02:07:36,888 --> 02:07:42,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the choice is cutting essential services that we'll never get back, I think we need to make that hard choice.

1620
02:07:42,172 --> 02:07:44,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1621
02:07:44,533 --> 02:07:46,494
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Councilor Knight, then Councilor Scarpelli.

1622
02:07:46,514 --> 02:07:47,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1623
02:07:47,788 --> 02:07:57,132
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I understand where council of business is coming from because ultimately taxpayers in this community deserve to have services and service delivery is what we're here to perform.

1624
02:07:57,632 --> 02:08:14,320
[SPEAKER_20]: But at the same time, borrowing our way out of a financial situation and creating a structural deficit, not only for this upcoming fiscal year, but for fiscal years in the future and establishing a bonded debt for us to pay down for operating costs is

1625
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:16,921
[SPEAKER_20]: That's scary to me.

1626
02:08:16,941 --> 02:08:22,845
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really creating a structural deficit and relying on reserves or borrowing in order for us to operate our government.

1627
02:08:23,125 --> 02:08:30,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Granted, like you said, 100 years, Great Depression, one out of every five people is unemployed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1628
02:08:30,129 --> 02:08:32,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, in the nation right now, one in every five.

1629
02:08:33,031 --> 02:08:38,094
[SPEAKER_20]: When you look at it, you can't close the door, but we also have to be very cautious.

1630
02:08:38,154 --> 02:08:42,016
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't borrow and spend out, borrow and deplete our reserves in order for us to get

1631
02:08:43,257 --> 02:08:48,239
[SPEAKER_20]: the situation, the financial situations, the financial situation, the numbers of the numbers.

1632
02:08:48,439 --> 02:08:53,161
[SPEAKER_20]: So I commend the Council of thinking of outside the box solutions.

1633
02:08:53,581 --> 02:08:58,863
[SPEAKER_20]: However, borrowing our way out of a structural deficit, I think is something that's scary to me.

1634
02:08:59,924 --> 02:09:00,864
[SPEAKER_20]: But I rest with that.

1635
02:09:02,091 --> 02:09:02,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1636
02:09:02,431 --> 02:09:04,872
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have Councilor Scarpelli, then we'll come back to Councilor Bears.

1637
02:09:04,912 --> 02:09:06,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1638
02:09:06,133 --> 02:09:06,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1639
02:09:06,573 --> 02:09:07,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1640
02:09:07,373 --> 02:09:23,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate Councilor Bears' initiative to try and think outside the box, but I too, I think using an analogy my dad told me is, you know, to pay off your car, remortgage your home, to look at the possibility to pay a $20,000 car loan over 30 years that now it

1641
02:09:28,496 --> 02:09:42,582
[SPEAKER_11]: piles on top of what your bills are, just doesn't, I can't see that this concerning us today, leaving this to our next generation to pay for that.

1642
02:09:42,662 --> 02:09:51,767
[SPEAKER_11]: So believe me, I appreciate that maybe there's some other ways that we can think of creating revenue sources and bringing money in and trying to focus on being

1643
02:09:55,458 --> 02:10:04,901
[SPEAKER_11]: You know being creative and gutsy to go out and do it, but I think bonding our way out of that I just I I can't support that so I just want to make sure I made it public.

1644
02:10:04,921 --> 02:10:15,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Yeah, and I mean it is it's scary I don't mean to say that we should just be doing this willy-nilly and doing it without planning that's not the point but it's

1645
02:10:16,283 --> 02:10:22,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It's having that backstop at the end of the day, because I agree there's a cost to future generations, but you have to do that cost-benefit analysis, right?

1646
02:10:23,167 --> 02:10:31,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the cost of losing 10, 20 city staff and maybe never getting them back more than the cost of a bond, and if we can minimize that.

1647
02:10:31,211 --> 02:10:32,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So just really exploring the options.

1648
02:10:32,651 --> 02:10:35,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hope is that we're, I like the Medford way.

1649
02:10:35,733 --> 02:10:38,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that we get out and do things first, as Councilor Knight was saying.

1650
02:10:38,735 --> 02:10:44,077
[SPEAKER_02]: My hope on something like this is that we are in lockstep with other communities in the state if we have to go this route.

1651
02:10:44,578 --> 02:10:45,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, you know,

1652
02:10:46,112 --> 02:10:59,875
[SPEAKER_02]: The fundamental question is that's not our role as municipal and state government But it's getting to the point of the question is the federal government going to abrogate its role Its role is to borrow to bail us out because it's the one that can do it If it's going to say we're not going to do that.

1653
02:11:00,275 --> 02:11:07,256
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to look at another option because it's a hundred year crisis You know, I i'm it's scary and I completely hear what everyone's saying.

1654
02:11:07,416 --> 02:11:10,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just We can do whatever and fix the problem.

1655
02:11:10,777 --> 02:11:12,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It's having that backstop if if all of our

1656
02:11:13,667 --> 02:11:16,668
[SPEAKER_02]: other systems don't succeed to keep us in the place we need to be.

1657
02:11:17,809 --> 02:11:18,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Bears.

1658
02:11:18,909 --> 02:11:29,193
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a B paper on the table, not on the table, there's a B paper that was offered by Councilor Bears and it was actually, can you read the wording of the B paper?

1659
02:11:31,421 --> 02:11:36,985
[SPEAKER_13]: this is what I have, Mr. President, and Councilor Bears, please feel free to jump in at the end after I read this to make sure I've got this right.

1660
02:11:38,707 --> 02:11:52,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears' B paper is for the city administration to meet with the Division of Local Services and the Department of Revenue and report back to the council on the feasibility of use of municipal bonds for the budget.

1661
02:11:53,438 --> 02:11:58,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just specifically, Municipal Bond Deficit Financing Authority or authorization.

1662
02:12:00,327 --> 02:12:00,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hang on.

1663
02:12:07,072 --> 02:12:07,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1664
02:12:07,612 --> 02:12:09,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we move to second that Mr. President?

1665
02:12:09,754 --> 02:12:13,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Knight, Clerk Herveze, please call the roll on the B paper.

1666
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:18,180
[SPEAKER_13]: On the B paper, Councilor Bears?

1667
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:19,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1668
02:12:19,861 --> 02:12:20,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello?

1669
02:12:21,122 --> 02:12:21,302
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1670
02:12:26,846 --> 02:12:27,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

1671
02:12:28,147 --> 02:12:28,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1672
02:12:30,111 --> 02:12:30,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

1673
02:12:31,212 --> 02:12:31,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1674
02:12:32,893 --> 02:12:33,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell.

1675
02:12:34,594 --> 02:12:34,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1676
02:12:35,514 --> 02:12:36,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1677
02:12:36,715 --> 02:12:36,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1678
02:12:37,435 --> 02:12:38,176
[SPEAKER_13]: President Falco.

1679
02:12:39,196 --> 02:12:39,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1680
02:12:39,737 --> 02:12:41,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1681
02:12:41,998 --> 02:12:42,939
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

1682
02:12:43,719 --> 02:12:47,001
[SPEAKER_10]: On the main resolutions which were joined, 20-345, 20-346, 20-50 and 20-351.

1683
02:12:47,021 --> 02:12:47,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1684
02:12:47,501 --> 02:12:47,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

1685
02:12:58,992 --> 02:12:59,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1686
02:13:00,093 --> 02:13:08,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Just if I can add because last week when we were talking about creative ideas, I did mention about the water and sewer enterprise account.

1687
02:13:08,897 --> 02:13:13,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a history in this community of borrowing from that.

1688
02:13:14,619 --> 02:13:19,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's at no expense to the ratepayer or taxpayer in this community because

1689
02:13:20,382 --> 02:13:22,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an over assessment of the water and sewer rates.

1690
02:13:23,664 --> 02:13:31,487
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you got to be careful that you don't deplete that because it's for infrastructure improvements, but there's several millions of dollars in that account.

1691
02:13:31,977 --> 02:13:33,397
[SPEAKER_07]: that potentially could be used.

1692
02:13:34,057 --> 02:13:55,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Mr. President, back some years ago, just in line with Councilor Bears' mentioning, the council entertained looking at a tax amnesty program, where people in this community owed taxes for many years and weren't paying that they weren't subjected to the interest rates.

1693
02:13:55,981 --> 02:14:00,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a way of bringing in hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars,

1694
02:14:01,082 --> 02:14:07,208
[SPEAKER_07]: opening up a period of time with his amnesty for people that are taxed delinquent to come and pay their back taxes.

1695
02:14:07,769 --> 02:14:10,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And that just may be an option that's explored too.

1696
02:14:10,151 --> 02:14:19,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are many options out there that can be looked at, Mr. President, in order to potentially have a savings for this community.

1697
02:14:19,881 --> 02:14:21,543
[SPEAKER_07]: The last thing I'd like to say, Mr. President,

1698
02:14:23,144 --> 02:14:26,847
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to say, well, let's put together the budget the way it stands now.

1699
02:14:26,907 --> 02:14:29,349
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's $8 million in deficit, let's put it together.

1700
02:14:29,969 --> 02:14:33,131
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be, Mr. President, very alarming to people.

1701
02:14:33,151 --> 02:14:45,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know my council colleagues don't want to hear that, but it's going to be very alarming to have a public document out there, Mr. President, that's going to show that magnitude of cuts across the board.

1702
02:14:46,421 --> 02:14:49,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And I personally don't want to experience that right now.

1703
02:14:49,423 --> 02:14:50,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's a need.

1704
02:14:50,384 --> 02:15:06,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think over the next several weeks, the mayor mentioned to us when we pressured the mayor, and I think we all did, to get a preliminary budget that she was looking at, I believe, Mr. President, you were on board too, the first week in June, I think we got a commitment that she was going to give us a budget.

1705
02:15:07,056 --> 02:15:13,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And in my opinion, that gives us ample time to work with it and see if it's realistic or not.

1706
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:20,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, in my opinion, it's probably the earliest that we've gotten a budget in the past 20 years, even with all this facing us.

1707
02:15:21,024 --> 02:15:32,171
[SPEAKER_07]: So I still think we have enough time, Mr. President, and by then we'll have some of the numbers that the auditor talked about in to give us better projections to see where we stand.

1708
02:15:33,232 --> 02:15:35,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And that number, 8 million, may go up, it may go down.

1709
02:15:35,934 --> 02:15:38,596
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know, but time will tell, Mr. President.

1710
02:15:38,656 --> 02:15:41,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So I support all these initiatives.

1711
02:15:41,318 --> 02:15:43,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants additional information.

1712
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:48,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that we should give the administration the ample opportunity to work with the department heads.

1713
02:15:49,444 --> 02:15:53,126
[SPEAKER_07]: As Councilor Scott Pelly mentioned, he's working with the City of Somerville.

1714
02:15:53,487 --> 02:15:58,490
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the department head within the City of Somerville, and he's working with the mayor there to go over his budget.

1715
02:15:58,910 --> 02:16:01,111
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I'm saying should be done in our community.

1716
02:16:01,151 --> 02:16:07,595
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor should be working with the department heads, and if she's able to share information with the council, that's fine.

1717
02:16:07,995 --> 02:16:11,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But eventually we're going to get a budget like we've done for the last 20 years.

1718
02:16:12,378 --> 02:16:16,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were never privy to any of that information, Mr. President, ever.

1719
02:16:16,539 --> 02:16:28,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't remember any councilor ever requesting this information either, Mr. President, over the last years that they want to see the wish list from the department heads prior to us getting the budget.

1720
02:16:28,502 --> 02:16:34,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never mentioned that or never seen that mentioned as a council resolution.

1721
02:16:34,623 --> 02:16:37,704
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, maybe this is the time to do so.

1722
02:16:38,264 --> 02:16:41,105
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we have to let this process play out a little bit.

1723
02:16:41,685 --> 02:16:44,606
[SPEAKER_07]: and see where we stand, Mr. President.

1724
02:16:44,646 --> 02:16:45,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of clarification, Mr. President?

1725
02:16:46,206 --> 02:16:48,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of clarification, Council on 9th.

1726
02:16:48,567 --> 02:16:51,768
[SPEAKER_20]: No one's asking for a wish list budget from the department heads.

1727
02:16:51,968 --> 02:17:02,652
[SPEAKER_20]: What was represented at Wednesday night's meeting last week was that, I believe the quote from the chief of staff was that we have a fiscal year 21 working budget.

1728
02:17:04,667 --> 02:17:05,828
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a wishlist budget.

1729
02:17:05,928 --> 02:17:10,470
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a fiscal year 21 working budget based upon the revenue forecast at that time.

1730
02:17:14,711 --> 02:17:18,413
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, it's not a wishlist budget.

1731
02:17:18,513 --> 02:17:31,999
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, this coupled with the fact that, I mean, I can go back now, I've done several budgets and going back to Councilor Penta asking for wishlist budgets every single year is a resolution for a time that I was on the council.

1732
02:17:32,019 --> 02:17:34,320
[SPEAKER_20]: I recall these requests have been made in the past.

1733
02:17:34,967 --> 02:17:36,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but I'm not asking for a wishlist budget.

1734
02:17:37,092 --> 02:17:44,129
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm asking for the budget that was prepared for the working budget that was prepared for FY 15 based upon the government shutdown.

1735
02:17:45,184 --> 02:17:48,266
[SPEAKER_20]: So just to clarify that point, I apologize for the family interference.

1736
02:17:48,986 --> 02:17:49,507
[SPEAKER_07]: No worries.

1737
02:17:49,767 --> 02:17:50,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1738
02:17:50,367 --> 02:17:54,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, just if I could, there were a lot of requests asked for last week.

1739
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:59,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the original requests was for the department head wishlist budget.

1740
02:17:59,772 --> 02:18:04,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And chief of staff Dave Rodriguez said he didn't feel comfortable sharing that at that point.

1741
02:18:04,955 --> 02:18:08,577
[SPEAKER_07]: because it was in the early stages and may didn't have a time to look at it.

1742
02:18:08,997 --> 02:18:14,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So indeed, I don't know who asked for it, but someone did ask for a department head wish list budget.

1743
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:17,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And he didn't think it was fruitful or would have been valuable.

1744
02:18:17,962 --> 02:18:23,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the Councilors said, I'll consider what's valuable to share a department head wish list budget.

1745
02:18:24,146 --> 02:18:26,367
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was what was requested, Mr. President.

1746
02:18:26,387 --> 02:18:28,628
[SPEAKER_07]: So- I was the Councilor.

1747
02:18:32,757 --> 02:18:36,718
[SPEAKER_20]: that he said, I don't think this information will be helpful to you.

1748
02:18:37,218 --> 02:18:41,139
[SPEAKER_20]: And as the person that has to make the decision, I think it would be very helpful to me.

1749
02:18:41,499 --> 02:18:44,179
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, we never requested a wishlist budget.

1750
02:18:44,539 --> 02:18:47,280
[SPEAKER_20]: The question was asked to the mayor, where are you in the process right now?

1751
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:50,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Government shutdown happened on or around 3-13.

1752
02:18:50,401 --> 02:18:52,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Two weeks, we've been April 1st.

1753
02:18:52,941 --> 02:18:54,841
[SPEAKER_20]: We were scheduled to start our meetings on April 1st.

1754
02:18:54,881 --> 02:18:55,662
[SPEAKER_20]: So where are we?

1755
02:18:55,982 --> 02:18:59,262
[SPEAKER_20]: And she said, all the departments have submitted their budgets.

1756
02:18:59,962 --> 02:19:02,443
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't had a chance to review them and consolidate them.

1757
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:03,830
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, fine.

1758
02:19:04,771 --> 02:19:06,572
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, so we have a wishlist budget.

1759
02:19:07,292 --> 02:19:07,953
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a quote.

1760
02:19:08,073 --> 02:19:09,994
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have a wishlist budget for each department.

1761
02:19:10,074 --> 02:19:14,336
[SPEAKER_20]: At which time the chief of staff said, no, we do not have a wishlist budget for each department.

1762
02:19:14,776 --> 02:19:23,180
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a fiscal year 21 working budget for those departments based upon the forecast prior to COVID-19.

1763
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:25,281
[SPEAKER_20]: So this isn't a request for wishlist budget.

1764
02:19:25,301 --> 02:19:30,784
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a request for the budget, the budget that was prepared by the department heads and should COVID-19 not have happened,

1765
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:33,061
[SPEAKER_20]: we would see where we are absent the crisis.

1766
02:19:33,221 --> 02:19:39,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Now we have the, so we'll have a budget here that says, you know, in a perfect world without COVID-19, this is what we needed to meet our goals and objectives.

1767
02:19:40,526 --> 02:19:42,147
[SPEAKER_20]: Here we are with the revenue forecast.

1768
02:19:43,208 --> 02:19:45,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the budget based upon these revenue forecasts.

1769
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:46,350
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the gaps.

1770
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:47,691
[SPEAKER_20]: How are we going to fill them?

1771
02:19:47,711 --> 02:19:50,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1772
02:19:50,973 --> 02:19:52,174
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a motion on the floor.

1773
02:19:52,214 --> 02:19:56,317
[SPEAKER_10]: That motion was offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1774
02:19:56,517 --> 02:19:58,038
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was on the joint resolutions 20345, 20346.

1775
02:20:01,513 --> 02:20:05,134
[SPEAKER_10]: two zero three five five one and two zero three five zero.

1776
02:20:06,014 --> 02:20:12,235
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1777
02:20:12,555 --> 02:20:15,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Before the roll, Mr. President, are we voting these all together?

1778
02:20:16,756 --> 02:20:17,476
[SPEAKER_10]: They would join.

1779
02:20:17,756 --> 02:20:18,937
[SPEAKER_10]: The resolutions would join.

1780
02:20:18,957 --> 02:20:23,397
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all papers asking for financial information from the administration.

1781
02:20:24,218 --> 02:20:25,838
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're taking one vote on all the papers?

1782
02:20:26,378 --> 02:20:30,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's just really a request for information, if I'm correct, Councilor Knight.

1783
02:20:31,229 --> 02:20:33,391
[SPEAKER_20]: I can read it, but I can't move on.

1784
02:20:33,411 --> 02:20:36,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, there was a motion made to consolidate the papers to one.

1785
02:20:37,314 --> 02:20:37,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1786
02:20:37,994 --> 02:20:40,856
[SPEAKER_20]: With paper 350 controlling.

1787
02:20:41,517 --> 02:20:48,622
[SPEAKER_20]: So it would be paper 20-350, and then the other papers underneath it, all financial matters, all requesting information.

1788
02:20:52,245 --> 02:20:54,687
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't we do this?

1789
02:20:54,887 --> 02:20:57,409
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of council, I'd like to join all those papers.

1790
02:20:58,810 --> 02:20:59,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

1791
02:20:59,270 --> 02:20:59,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, Mr. President.

1792
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:01,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

1793
02:21:02,041 --> 02:21:02,861
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1794
02:21:03,281 --> 02:21:05,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Clerk Irving, call the roll, please.

1795
02:21:06,843 --> 02:21:07,403

1796

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1797
02:21:09,184 --> 02:21:10,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello?

1798
02:21:10,344 --> 02:21:10,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1799
02:21:11,044 --> 02:21:11,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

1800
02:21:11,925 --> 02:21:12,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1801
02:21:12,685 --> 02:21:13,285

1828

[SPEAKER_10]: One in the negative, the motion passes.

1830
02:22:00,836 --> 02:22:08,683
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-347 offered by Council of Marks be it resolved that 9th Street be repaired or repaved in the interest of public safety.

1831
02:22:08,723 --> 02:22:09,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Council of Marks.

1832
02:22:10,756 --> 02:22:11,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1833
02:22:11,937 --> 02:22:17,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I met with residents of the 9th Street Condo Association several months back.

1834
02:22:17,981 --> 02:22:22,384
[SPEAKER_07]: We met with the city engineer and the traffic engineer.

1835
02:22:23,184 --> 02:22:31,570
[SPEAKER_07]: We came up with a number of recommendations for 9th Street and Brainerd Ave, and some of which has yet to take place.

1836
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:35,252
[SPEAKER_07]: One is the marking to divide 9th Street.

1837
02:22:35,732 --> 02:22:37,754
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're familiar with the street next to Cappy's,

1838
02:22:38,514 --> 02:22:42,436
[SPEAKER_07]: when you take a right or left onto 9th Street, there's no dividing line.

1839
02:22:42,936 --> 02:22:50,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very difficult when cars are coming off of 9th Street or going onto 9th Street to see the delineation in the road.

1840
02:22:50,460 --> 02:23:02,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So we ask that a yellow marker, paving marker be put down and also that the potholes in 9th Street be repaired or repaved in the interest of public safety.

1841
02:23:04,027 --> 02:23:06,368
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by-

1842
02:23:07,810 --> 02:23:10,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Bernanke, please call the roll.

1843
02:23:17,053 --> 02:23:17,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears?

1844
02:23:18,573 --> 02:23:18,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1845
02:23:19,514 --> 02:23:20,474

02:23:20,674 --> 02:23:20,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1847
02:23:21,374 --> 02:23:21,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

1848
02:23:22,275 --> 02:23:22,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1849
02:23:22,915 --> 02:23:23,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

1850
02:23:24,035 --> 02:23:24,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1851
02:23:24,675 --> 02:23:25,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell?

1852
02:23:25,776 --> 02:23:26,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1853
02:23:26,376 --> 02:23:27,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1854
02:23:27,576 --> 02:23:27,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1855
02:23:28,156 --> 02:23:28,957
[SPEAKER_13]: President Falco?

1856
02:23:29,857 --> 02:23:30,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1857
02:23:30,317 --> 02:23:32,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1858
02:23:34,339 --> 02:23:42,127
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-348 offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the administration report back the status of the tough square street project.

1859
02:23:42,647 --> 02:23:43,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello.

1860
02:23:43,929 --> 02:23:44,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1861
02:23:44,790 --> 02:23:51,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, that's a project that was started a while ago and it sort of just left.

1862
02:23:52,505 --> 02:24:20,906
[SPEAKER_03]: uh... out there you know uh... the people of south method are always uh... getting the short end of the stick on a lot of things uh... person uh... you know the parking is good out there uh... i think the resident of it i think that the stores or they have come to accept it but uh... it hasn't been paid and it's it looks it just that it doesn't look uh... what was proposed to the to all those businesses in that tough square area so uh... i'd like to know well uh... it's that is uh... uh... we know what what is going to get paid

1863
02:24:21,566 --> 02:24:26,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so those businesses know what's going to happen there.

1864
02:24:26,891 --> 02:24:28,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1865
02:24:28,092 --> 02:24:28,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1866
02:24:29,733 --> 02:24:30,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1867
02:24:30,574 --> 02:24:33,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank Council Vice President Caraviello for putting this on.

1868
02:24:34,377 --> 02:24:43,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I've received so many calls from Salt Method residents regarding tough square, the inability for any large trucks or buses to take turns.

1869
02:24:44,626 --> 02:24:49,509
[SPEAKER_07]: around that intersection over there, the getting caught midway between.

1870
02:24:50,430 --> 02:25:01,276
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would ask if Council Vice President's are right to amend that we receive a report back from the city engineer and the traffic engineer on the status of that project as well.

1871
02:25:01,717 --> 02:25:02,477
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no problem.

1872
02:25:03,138 --> 02:25:03,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1873
02:25:04,418 --> 02:25:05,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Marks.

1874
02:25:05,939 --> 02:25:13,304
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello as amended by Councilor Mark seconded by Councilor Wright.

1875
02:25:14,213 --> 02:25:18,575
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I do believe in recent weeks, Mr. President, the council also put forward a paper requesting.

1876
02:25:22,096 --> 02:25:24,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, we lost you.

1877
02:25:24,957 --> 02:25:25,497
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't hear you.

1878
02:25:31,319 --> 02:25:31,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor?

1879
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:35,841
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, we don't do sign language.

1880
02:25:36,581 --> 02:25:36,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1881
02:25:41,370 --> 02:25:45,031
[SPEAKER_10]: just as you're getting to the good parts.

1882
02:25:45,771 --> 02:25:54,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, just a few weeks ago we requested an update relative to the runoff issues in front of Citizens Bank as it related to that project as well and I'd just like to reiterate that request as part of this result.

1883
02:25:56,274 --> 02:25:58,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay so we'll make that as an amendment as well?

1884
02:25:59,315 --> 02:26:07,298
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't have to be an amendment I just think that you know it's a request that's been made so if we can just send them the previous document that was approved by the council again because we haven't gotten an update that would be helpful.

1885
02:26:10,322 --> 02:26:15,709
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Marks and seconded by.

1886
02:26:15,729 --> 02:26:17,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1887
02:26:17,971 --> 02:26:22,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli, please call the roll.

1888
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:27,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears?

1889
02:26:27,681 --> 02:26:27,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1890
02:26:28,281 --> 02:26:29,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello?

1891
02:26:29,562 --> 02:26:29,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1892
02:26:30,302 --> 02:26:30,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

1893
02:26:31,123 --> 02:26:31,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1894
02:26:31,983 --> 02:26:32,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

1895
02:26:33,024 --> 02:26:33,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1896
02:26:33,584 --> 02:26:34,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell?

1897
02:26:34,865 --> 02:26:35,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1898
02:26:35,466 --> 02:26:36,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1899
02:26:36,586 --> 02:26:36,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1900
02:26:37,207 --> 02:26:38,007
[SPEAKER_13]: President Falco?

1901
02:26:38,227 --> 02:26:41,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1902
02:26:41,089 --> 02:26:44,871
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-0-349 offered by Councilor Morell.

1903
02:26:45,392 --> 02:26:55,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the city administration provide an update on any plans for partnerships or programs that will allow for expanded or universal COVID-19 testing for Method residents

1904
02:26:56,377 --> 02:26:57,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Member Rowe.

1905
02:26:57,937 --> 02:26:58,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1906
02:26:59,078 --> 02:27:05,900
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's pretty self-explanatory, but in recent days, we've seen Malden, Everett, Somerville earlier, Cambridge.

1907
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:16,323
[SPEAKER_06]: We're surrounded by cities that have expanded their testing for their residents or universal testing for residents through partnerships with different health organizations or hospitals.

1908
02:27:16,543 --> 02:27:24,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as there is talk at the state level of what these phases are going to look like as we work towards eventual reopening,

1909
02:27:24,909 --> 02:27:29,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to take a serious look at testing for our residents.

1910
02:27:30,132 --> 02:27:37,897
[SPEAKER_06]: As of last week, they updated the numbers and out of 351 cities and towns, Medford is still around 22 as far as rates of coronavirus cases.

1911
02:27:38,297 --> 02:27:43,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is something really important that we need to get an update from the administration on and understand where we are in this.

1912
02:27:45,522 --> 02:27:46,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1913
02:27:46,863 --> 02:27:53,307
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may ask, do you know if those cities and towns that are doing this testing, if they're also doing antibody testing?

1914
02:27:54,749 --> 02:27:55,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not know.

1915
02:27:55,270 --> 02:28:04,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Brookline is doing the random, I believe, antibody testing, but these, I pulled them out because they're doing the active infection testing.

1916
02:28:04,957 --> 02:28:12,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, can we, would you mind, I probably can't as president, but can we amend to actually include antibody testing as well?

1917
02:28:13,604 --> 02:28:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make that motion for you, Mr. President.

1918
02:28:15,805 --> 02:28:16,926
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's okay with you.

1919
02:28:18,127 --> 02:28:18,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, that works.

1920
02:28:19,128 --> 02:28:20,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1921
02:28:20,068 --> 02:28:21,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the motion by Councilor Morell.

1922
02:28:23,137 --> 02:28:26,259

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1938
02:28:50,572 --> 02:28:52,073
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-352 offered by Councilor Knight.

1939
02:28:52,133 --> 02:29:01,820
[SPEAKER_10]: We have resolved that the Medford City Council request the Recreation Department expand programming surrounding socially distanced recreational activities and opportunities.

1940
02:29:02,261 --> 02:29:17,753
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, citywide Zoom Trivia Nights, maintaining a database of residents in organizations wishing to participate in car parades and assisting in the organization of such events, TikTok video contests, scavenger hunts, and online arts shows.

1941
02:29:18,774 --> 02:29:19,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1942
02:29:20,147 --> 02:29:21,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1943
02:29:22,189 --> 02:29:30,134
[SPEAKER_20]: First and foremost, I'd like to commend Kevin Bailey and Danny Folk on the work they're doing during these trying times in the recreation department.

1944
02:29:30,694 --> 02:29:35,858
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very difficult to establish recreational programming when you can't have anybody in the same place.

1945
02:29:36,711 --> 02:29:45,395
[SPEAKER_20]: And they've been doing a great job pursuing various aspects of socially distance and online recreational opportunities for individuals in our community.

1946
02:29:45,935 --> 02:29:54,219
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm hoping that we can make a few suggestions to the gentlemen in the recreation department moving forward to implement for the betterment of our community.

1947
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:57,281
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that, you know, here we are approaching day 60.

1948
02:29:58,534 --> 02:30:03,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of us are getting stir-crazy with, you know, being trapped in the house and in the backyard.

1949
02:30:03,438 --> 02:30:10,084
[SPEAKER_20]: There's not much opportunity for us to go out and pursue recreational opportunities that aren't passive in nature.

1950
02:30:10,764 --> 02:30:12,986
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've seen a lot of work.

1951
02:30:14,307 --> 02:30:17,589
[SPEAKER_20]: take place to bring some of these services online.

1952
02:30:18,209 --> 02:30:20,651
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's been met with a measure of success.

1953
02:30:20,811 --> 02:30:27,914
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been met with certainly some enthusiasm in the community, and I'm hoping that we can take this momentum and build upon it.

1954
02:30:28,535 --> 02:30:30,696
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I commend

1955
02:30:31,056 --> 02:30:37,878
[SPEAKER_20]: the efforts of the recreation department and the work that they're doing and thinking out of the box to bring services to the residents in this community.

1956
02:30:38,359 --> 02:30:45,641
[SPEAKER_20]: And because they're doing it in a virtual setting, they're able to do it in a way that's at a significantly low cost to the taxpayer and the community.

1957
02:30:45,661 --> 02:30:51,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

1958
02:30:51,343 --> 02:30:54,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it looks like we lost you.

1959
02:30:55,044 --> 02:30:59,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to add in, I know, you know,

1960
02:31:01,107 --> 02:31:03,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight, you there?

1961
02:31:03,268 --> 02:31:06,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Celebrate a birthday party, birthday but can't have a party.

1962
02:31:06,310 --> 02:31:07,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Stuff like that, Mr. President.

1963
02:31:07,651 --> 02:31:09,533
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm hoping that my council colleagues will support.

1964
02:31:10,653 --> 02:31:12,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1965
02:31:12,294 --> 02:31:12,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Once again, right?

1966
02:31:12,895 --> 02:31:13,335
[SPEAKER_20]: Once again.

1967
02:31:13,415 --> 02:31:14,676
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to call the governor.

1968
02:31:14,696 --> 02:31:17,158
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to see if he can lend me his guy, just in case.

1969
02:31:17,818 --> 02:31:19,779
[SPEAKER_10]: This is about a 45 second gap.

1970
02:31:19,839 --> 02:31:21,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I know where you were going.

1971
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:21,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.

1972
02:31:22,892 --> 02:31:24,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell them about the gap.

1973
02:31:26,094 --> 02:31:27,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard everything, Mr. President.

1974
02:31:27,595 --> 02:31:32,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Where was I?

1975
02:31:32,179 --> 02:31:36,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Where was I?

1976
02:31:37,362 --> 02:31:40,104
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may.

1977
02:31:40,465 --> 02:31:42,986
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've been helping out since coronavirus started.

1978
02:31:43,006 --> 02:31:48,991
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife and I have been helping out during lunch hour to go down and give out meals.

1979
02:31:49,111 --> 02:31:51,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And the whole meal program that's

1980
02:31:52,392 --> 02:31:57,134
[SPEAKER_10]: given out, you know, the meals that are given out during lunch in different locations throughout our city.

1981
02:31:57,714 --> 02:32:00,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that's, that's really, that's operated by the recreation department.

1982
02:32:00,555 --> 02:32:12,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So as I go pick up my meals each day, I see Kevin Bailey, I see, I see Danny, Danny folks and Kate Quinn, and they're picking up meals every day and they have their own stations where they're giving out meals.

1983
02:32:12,439 --> 02:32:14,539
[SPEAKER_10]: They're even hand delivering meals as well.

1984
02:32:15,039 --> 02:32:19,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so they, they're out in the community hand delivering meals and they're, I mean,

1985
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:23,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, it's a recreation department of only three people.

1986
02:32:23,362 --> 02:32:29,025
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like, you know, our neighbors next door that have, you know, you know, probably 10 to 15.

1987
02:32:29,865 --> 02:32:31,406
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's only three.

1988
02:32:31,486 --> 02:32:32,767
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know they're working hard.

1989
02:32:32,807 --> 02:32:33,868
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing a lot of work.

1990
02:32:33,888 --> 02:32:35,749
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're trying to maintain the

1991
02:32:36,442 --> 02:32:51,153
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, the daily programs and putting in online content as well, as well as, you know, you know, prepping for summer programs and contingency planning as well if those summer programs don't happening, it don't happen depending on what happens with COVID-19.

1992
02:32:51,973 --> 02:32:53,835
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know that they are hard at work.

1993
02:32:53,975 --> 02:32:57,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that they're working nonstop, especially on the meals program.

1994
02:32:57,497 --> 02:33:00,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to bring that to light and make sure that people know that.

1995
02:33:00,940 --> 02:33:01,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's,

1996
02:33:01,801 --> 02:33:08,984
[SPEAKER_10]: not a big department, but that department is working continuously each day, especially with the meal distribution during COVID-19.

1997
02:33:09,065 --> 02:33:16,388
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of it, they're refurbishing the gym down at the, uh, uh, down at the Chevalier, uh, the, the, the rec headquarters.

1998
02:33:16,428 --> 02:33:21,671
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, so there's a lot going on, um, and they're doing a lot of work, but I just wanted to mention that as well.

1999
02:33:22,491 --> 02:33:24,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, did anybody else want to comment on this resolution?

2000
02:33:27,213 --> 02:33:29,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello, was that your hand up or were you just throwing something?

2001
02:33:29,834 --> 02:33:30,835
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just throwing something.

2002
02:33:34,851 --> 02:33:54,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so on the motion of night second seconded by a conflict Scarpelli Clark Hernandez actually click every year to be Gemini emails on that I Have no emails on this or any other topics remaining on the agenda for this evening.

2003
02:33:54,765 --> 02:33:57,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and is anybody I want to speak on this I

2004
02:33:58,906 --> 02:34:01,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing that no one wants to speak on it.

2005

[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Kernoghese, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks is a yes.

02:34:20,721 --> 02:34:21,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell?

02:34:21,942 --> 02:34:22,202

[SPEAKER_13]: President Falco?

2020
02:34:25,626 --> 02:34:28,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2021
02:34:28,248 --> 02:34:41,756
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-353 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the city administration amend the waste management contract to include Maple Park condominiums located at 65 Valley Street for bulk pickup service.

2022
02:34:42,196 --> 02:34:42,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

2023
02:34:44,123 --> 02:34:45,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2024
02:34:45,164 --> 02:34:47,466
[SPEAKER_07]: This may sound familiar to some of my colleagues.

2025
02:34:48,347 --> 02:34:51,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Several months back, I offered a very similar resolution.

2026
02:34:52,150 --> 02:35:05,142
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why I bring it up again this evening is the fact that last week when we were discussing the budget, it was mentioned that we could look and potentially save some money with the waste management contract.

2027
02:35:05,788 --> 02:35:12,294
[SPEAKER_07]: which we all, I should say we all, which I thought was coming up at the end of this year for renewal.

2028
02:35:13,175 --> 02:35:27,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And come to find out when the mayor mentioned it doesn't renew until 2023, Dave Rodriguez, the chief of staff, sent us a copy of the amended contract.

2029
02:35:28,067 --> 02:35:32,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on the council at the time, Mr. President, and I looked through my records.

2030
02:35:33,372 --> 02:35:41,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find anywhere that the city administration entered into a new renewal with waste management.

2031
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:45,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know it happened, so I'm not trying to say it didn't happen.

2032
02:35:46,244 --> 02:35:52,649
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the time, back in 2010, the city administration, and I just want to give a little

2033
02:35:54,198 --> 02:35:54,858
[SPEAKER_07]: history on this.

2034
02:35:55,398 --> 02:36:03,221
[SPEAKER_07]: The city administration, Mr. President signed a nine year eight or nine month contract.

2035
02:36:03,781 --> 02:36:08,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's 9.75 year contract with waste management.

2036
02:36:08,686 --> 02:36:19,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in order to enter that contract by state law, anything over three years has to be approved by the council, any contract with a length over three years.

2037
02:36:20,256 --> 02:36:32,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So then Mayor McGlynn approached the council and asked that we approve a 10-year contract, which we did, Mr. President, at the time, because there was some savings in the contract.

2038
02:36:33,226 --> 02:36:47,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Unbeknownst to me, some three and a half years later, into a 10-year contract, the mayor went back and extended the contract another three years, which he was able to do so under state statute.

2039
02:36:47,855 --> 02:36:54,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So it went from a 10-year contract, almost a 10-year contract, to a 13-year contract, Mr. President.

2040
02:36:55,240 --> 02:37:08,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And I found it ironic that at the time when the mayor renegotiated, waste management gave us an incentive of $400,000 to renegotiate the contract.

2041
02:37:09,269 --> 02:37:15,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only other change, Mr. President, was an increase in the recyclable rates.

2042
02:37:16,414 --> 02:37:20,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a fee that they're processing fee that went up from $50 per ton to $85 per ton.

2043
02:37:23,615 --> 02:37:31,039
[SPEAKER_07]: which would lead someone to believe, why would you be negotiating after you have a 10-year contract for a higher rate for recycling?

2044
02:37:31,079 --> 02:37:32,539
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense.

2045
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:39,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless, of course, you're looking for a quick fix of some incentive money, which the city received.

2046
02:37:39,703 --> 02:37:43,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Putting that all aside, Mr. President, because I'm going to bring that up another time.

2047
02:37:45,025 --> 02:37:52,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I offered a resolution on behalf of Maple Park condominiums because currently right now they only have recycling.

2048
02:37:52,808 --> 02:38:01,051
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the contract was made, apparently the city went around back some years ago to all the condominium associations and said, how would you like to participate?

2049
02:38:01,331 --> 02:38:02,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like bulk pickup?

2050
02:38:02,391 --> 02:38:03,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like recycling?

2051
02:38:03,732 --> 02:38:04,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like trash pickup?

2052
02:38:05,307 --> 02:38:09,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the time, the different condo associations chose what they wanted.

2053
02:38:09,988 --> 02:38:15,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Some opted, like Maple Condominiums, Park Condominiums, opted just for recycling only.

2054
02:38:15,970 --> 02:38:18,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, several years later, they said, you know what?

2055
02:38:18,211 --> 02:38:20,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like to get into the bulk pickup.

2056
02:38:20,352 --> 02:38:21,452
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be interested in that.

2057
02:38:22,032 --> 02:38:32,595
[SPEAKER_07]: And other condos have approached the administration previous administrations and they were allowed into different aspects of the program And they are asking now to be part of bulk pickup.

2058
02:38:33,015 --> 02:38:41,037
[SPEAKER_07]: So i'm requesting originally the council if you remember we voted to wait for the city budget to add them or

2059
02:38:41,741 --> 02:38:47,487
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, we voted to wait till the contract ended, which we all thought was too, at least I thought was 2020.

2060
02:38:48,007 --> 02:38:57,837
[SPEAKER_07]: So knowing that, um, we're not gonna, if this doesn't end until 2023, um, that I'm asking now that we don't wait for anything and that the city administration.

2061
02:38:58,377 --> 02:39:04,341
[SPEAKER_07]: add Maple Park condominiums, I believe it's 35 or 40 condos in there, add them to the bulk pickup, Mr. President.

2062
02:39:04,361 --> 02:39:05,442
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all they're requesting.

2063
02:39:05,802 --> 02:39:13,406
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a public list out there that shows you the different condos and what they receive as city services and waste management.

2064
02:39:13,887 --> 02:39:21,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's my understanding the city just has to make a call to waste management and ask that this be done for Maple Park condominiums.

2065
02:39:21,511 --> 02:39:27,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to do that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that the bulk pickup

2066
02:39:27,642 --> 02:39:31,004
[SPEAKER_07]: be added immediately to Maple Park condominiums.

2067
02:39:31,524 --> 02:39:36,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, does someone else want to speak?

2068
02:39:37,367 --> 02:39:38,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

2069
02:39:39,148 --> 02:39:40,669
[SPEAKER_10]: So the motion is by Councilor Marks.

2070
02:39:40,729 --> 02:39:42,570
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2071
02:39:42,630 --> 02:39:44,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears and Councilor Knight.

2072
02:39:44,531 --> 02:39:45,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

2073
02:39:46,632 --> 02:39:47,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2074
02:39:47,572 --> 02:39:48,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Councilor Marks.

2075
02:39:49,963 --> 02:39:57,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking at, we got some resolutions back from the mayor, and there's a letter from Brian Cairns in here regarding Maple Park.

2076
02:39:58,925 --> 02:40:08,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, it talks a lot about the trash, but it says that we agree that residents at Maple Park can participate in the city's bulk pickup, the cost for bulk items for the new fiscal year is 22 per item.

2077
02:40:08,967 --> 02:40:14,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that means that they have done this already or not, but that's just what I, I just remembered reading that.

2078
02:40:17,506 --> 02:40:18,611
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in response to your 20-09-4.

2079
02:40:24,044 --> 02:40:26,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember seeing that, but if that's the case, that's great.

2080
02:40:26,827 --> 02:40:30,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's the case because the residents are still calling me.

2081
02:40:30,930 --> 02:40:36,875
[SPEAKER_07]: They were actually asking me about the budget, if we're gonna put it in the budget, and that's why it precipitated this new resolution.

2082
02:40:36,915 --> 02:40:39,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may be the case, but I don't know.

2083
02:40:39,677 --> 02:40:40,858
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.

2084
02:40:41,838 --> 02:40:48,223
[SPEAKER_02]: The clerk forwarded us, there was a ton of stuff in here, but there's a letter dated April 20th of this year from Brian Cairns.

2085
02:40:48,844 --> 02:40:49,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last sentence says,

2086
02:40:51,060 --> 02:40:55,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, do we agree that residents at Maple Park can participate in the city's bulk pickup?

2087
02:40:55,443 --> 02:40:59,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe that needs to be communicated back to them.

2088
02:40:59,726 --> 02:41:04,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

2089
02:41:04,569 --> 02:41:05,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

2090
02:41:06,490 --> 02:41:17,898
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, I also raise the question, if in fact, you know, we had a 10-year trash contract that was extended for the period of time, when was it that

2091
02:41:18,342 --> 02:41:26,165
[SPEAKER_20]: The other condo associations in this community have been contacted relative to whether or not these bulk pickup and recycling services are available.

2092
02:41:26,525 --> 02:41:32,088
[SPEAKER_20]: If they refused these services 15 years ago and they haven't been asked again, I think that will be problematic.

2093
02:41:33,088 --> 02:41:36,650
[SPEAKER_20]: The taxpaying residents in this community, they should have access to the services that are provided.

2094
02:41:37,850 --> 02:41:41,772
[SPEAKER_20]: So just because they've opted out at one point in time, I guess the question is,

2095
02:41:42,278 --> 02:41:45,422
[SPEAKER_20]: To what frequency is the city requesting or monitoring this?

2096
02:41:45,523 --> 02:41:51,931
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the contract's a 10-year contract, so would it be, you know, they don't come back and ask for 10 years?

2097
02:41:52,492 --> 02:41:53,233
[SPEAKER_07]: By request.

2098
02:41:53,514 --> 02:41:54,956
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding, it's by request.

2099
02:41:55,416 --> 02:41:56,438
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all by request?

2100
02:41:56,738 --> 02:41:57,700
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my understanding.

2101
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking to DPW.

2102
02:41:59,995 --> 02:42:07,862
[SPEAKER_20]: So it might make sense then for the DPW to do an outreach if in fact I'm gonna get a Maple Park, which I support wholeheartedly.

2103
02:42:08,382 --> 02:42:23,755
[SPEAKER_20]: The question is, you know, do we make sure that everybody understands that they have the option to do this and extend to them the same olive branch that we're extending Maple Park or the same courtesy that we're extending Maple Park to be sure that they're aware that they have access to these services if they've in fact denied them previously.

2104
02:42:25,976 --> 02:42:26,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

2105
02:42:27,017 --> 02:42:27,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Peers.

2106
02:42:28,700 --> 02:42:37,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think just along that point as well, you know, it says in this letter from Brian Karen's, you know, there's a lot of talk about trash pickup, which they currently aren't part of the city's trash pickup.

2107
02:42:37,724 --> 02:42:39,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we said that they are part of recycling.

2108
02:42:39,685 --> 02:42:45,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And in here, it says, also, currently, this location is not putting out anything for recycling, at least not for city pickup.

2109
02:42:45,728 --> 02:42:49,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So they may even be paying for recycling and the building might not even be using it.

2110
02:42:49,610 --> 02:42:52,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just another interesting thing I saw in that letter.

2111
02:42:54,534 --> 02:42:55,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you Councilor Pierce.

2112
02:42:56,957 --> 02:42:57,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if I could.

2113
02:42:58,059 --> 02:42:58,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes Councilor Marks.

2114
02:42:59,481 --> 02:43:09,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told by the condo association that at the time they were instructed by certain type of bins that were compatible with waste management.

2115
02:43:10,155 --> 02:43:12,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would have been a great expense to them.

2116
02:43:12,397 --> 02:43:33,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So they figured out rather than buy these new bins They already had bins that they would just bypass the service Now there it's I guess fruitful for them to participate and that's why they want to participate But I think at the time they had to get a certain bin and they weren't willing to do that to fit the you know compatible with waste management, but

2117
02:43:34,872 --> 02:43:40,276
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all great questions, and I don't think we do have a formal approach once the contract is signed.

2118
02:43:40,737 --> 02:43:47,161
[SPEAKER_07]: If condos would like to get back in, and they all pay taxes as was mentioned, they should have the ability to opt back in if they'd like.

2119
02:43:48,182 --> 02:43:54,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that's something that could be explored by our DPW subcommittee.

2120
02:43:57,408 --> 02:43:58,409
[SPEAKER_10]: That very well could be.

2121
02:44:00,660 --> 02:44:02,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's the chair of that, Mr. President?

2122
02:44:02,081 --> 02:44:04,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is, the public works.

2123
02:44:05,122 --> 02:44:05,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Peters.

2124
02:44:06,522 --> 02:44:06,762
[SPEAKER_10]: You.

2125
02:44:07,603 --> 02:44:10,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks and Vice President Caraviello.

2126
02:44:11,384 --> 02:44:12,064
[SPEAKER_10]: The dream team.

2127
02:44:14,605 --> 02:44:16,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down, let's talk trash.

2128
02:44:21,367 --> 02:44:23,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, so we have any other questions, comments?

2129
02:44:24,008 --> 02:44:25,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, we have a hand up here.

2130
02:44:26,449 --> 02:44:27,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

2131
02:44:28,646 --> 02:44:31,809
[SPEAKER_01]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2132
02:44:31,829 --> 02:44:33,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, William.

2133
02:44:34,031 --> 02:44:45,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to Councilor Knight's point, I wanted to add on to that, that not only are these taxpaying citizens of Medford, they're taxpaying citizens of Medford who have done a good thing.

2134
02:44:45,700 --> 02:44:50,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them I know are senior citizens who have downsized from larger homes, presumably.

2135
02:44:51,705 --> 02:44:55,467
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, maybe more appropriate for raising a family when you have a family in there.

2136
02:44:55,847 --> 02:45:06,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really great thing if people, you know, uh, use sort of the minimum housing they need such as a condo when they're empty nesters because that's going to help with our housing crisis.

2137
02:45:07,552 --> 02:45:11,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything we can do to encourage that kind of behavior is good.

2138
02:45:12,114 --> 02:45:13,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, uh,

2139
02:45:14,896 --> 02:45:20,179
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have a housing crisis, there aren't enough places to live, running out of land, et cetera.

2140
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:29,566
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good thing if somebody chooses to sort of downsize into a condominium, we should reward that to the degree we can and make sure they can take full advantage of all of the city programs.

2141
02:45:29,606 --> 02:45:35,891
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely don't want to discourage that behavior by saying, well, if I move into a condo, I'm gonna have to deal with my own trash or something.

2142
02:45:35,931 --> 02:45:38,053
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the incentives we want.

2143
02:45:38,073 --> 02:45:39,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2144
02:45:41,075 --> 02:45:43,457
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by-

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2161
02:46:07,701 --> 02:46:10,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2162
02:46:10,483 --> 02:46:14,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, we have

2172

02:51:07,454 --> 02:51:18,120

2248
02:51:19,681 --> 02:51:21,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello.

2249
02:51:21,462 --> 02:51:29,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we adjourn, if we could have a moment of silence for those who have passed this past week from the COVID virus.

2250
02:51:29,587 --> 02:51:30,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

2251
02:51:31,154 --> 02:51:33,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, this won't be offered too many more times.

2252
02:51:35,476 --> 02:51:36,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

2253
02:51:37,496 --> 02:51:40,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

2254
02:51:41,098 --> 02:51:52,662
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, Mr. President, yesterday, there was a tragic fire on Canal Street in West Medford, and a number of families have been displaced from this fire.

2255
02:51:53,302 --> 02:51:56,843
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd ask that the city administration and the school department

2256
02:51:57,439 --> 02:52:01,582
[SPEAKER_20]: report back to the council as to what steps are being taken to help these families out.

2257
02:52:01,622 --> 02:52:09,266
[SPEAKER_20]: It's my understanding that we've seen GoFundMe pages that have been created and stuff like that.

2258
02:52:09,327 --> 02:52:12,088
[SPEAKER_20]: But in times like this, the community needs to come together.

2259
02:52:12,889 --> 02:52:21,054
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm hoping that if there's an action plan or if there's any resources available to these families that we'd be provided with notice so that we can take the appropriate steps to help out in any way that we can.

2260
02:52:21,654 --> 02:52:22,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor.

2261
02:52:23,215 --> 02:52:25,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Vice President Campbell.

2262
02:52:28,154 --> 02:52:29,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears?

2263
02:52:29,435 --> 02:52:37,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to add, you know, that Councilor, I mentioned the GoFundMe, we've seen incredible generosity from the Medford community over the past 24 hours to these families.

2264
02:52:37,480 --> 02:52:39,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to note that as well.

2265
02:52:40,402 --> 02:52:40,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2266
02:52:41,242 --> 02:52:42,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

2267
02:52:42,903 --> 02:52:52,949

2268
02:52:53,570 --> 02:52:57,332
[SPEAKER_10]: At this point, let's all rise for a brief moment of silence.

2269
02:53:11,121 --> 02:53:11,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2270
02:53:14,463 --> 02:53:18,905
[SPEAKER_08]: On that motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.
