[SPEAKER_17]: The meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:28,850
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secretary will call the roll.

3
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,810

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,310

00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,712
Mr. Ritchie?

00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:35,432

Mr. Newsom?

13
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:37,293
Present.

14
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,593

15
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:39,194

[SPEAKER_05]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

21
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,462
[SPEAKER_05]: One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:10,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we move to the approval of the minutes, we are at the start of our school year, of our calendar year, and we need to nominate a new secretary and vice chair of the school committee.

23
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:17,429
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time, I'd like to open up nominations for the vice chair of the Medford School Committee for the calendar year 19.

24
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:22,504
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a nomination for Kathy Kreatz.

25
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any other nominations that you'd like to put in?

26
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:25,946
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

27
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,707

00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:01,304

00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:10,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And now at this time we would like to open up nominations for the Secretary of the Medford School Committee for 2019.

40
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:13,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a name you'd like to put in nomination?

41
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:16,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

42
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz nominates Miyama Stone.

43
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:20,194
[SPEAKER_06]: This is second on the floor by Ms.

44
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:20,654
[SPEAKER_06]: VanDekloot.

45
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other names for nomination?

46
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:26,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I'll close that portion of the nominations.

47
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:27,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote please.

48
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:28,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

49
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,379
[SPEAKER_09]: DeVetta, Miyama Stone.

50
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

51
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz, Miyama Stone.

52
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:34,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

53
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:36,623
[SPEAKER_09]: DeVetta, Miyama Stone.

54
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:37,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

55
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:43,066
[SPEAKER_09]: VanDekloot, Miyama Stone.

56
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Mia Mustone, unanimous vote.

57
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Mia Mustone, our new secretary.

58
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:49,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations, Ms.

59
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:50,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone.

60
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:53,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

61
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:58,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Kritz, if you will give the sheets over to your colleague for the rest of the meeting.

62
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Trial by fire.

63
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, approval of the minutes of the January 7, 2019 meeting.

64
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the motion for approval by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo?

65
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:19,089
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

66
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:19,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

67
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:20,609
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

68
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:21,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

69
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Approval of Bills Transfer of Funds.

70
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

71
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:30,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote, please.

72
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember it's even and odd.

73
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

74
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:11,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up is the approval of payrolls and actually if you can, if someone could move suspension to take the item that's under eight negotiations and legal matters, it's payroll update, if we can move that up to this section.

75
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to suspend the rules by Ms.

76
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:17,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

77
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:18,792
[SPEAKER_06]: That paper is now before us.

78
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,353
[SPEAKER_06]: The approval of the payrolls were provided by Ms.

79
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:21,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Patterson.

80
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

81
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:25,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

82
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:37,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I motion to approve the payroll for this quarter, but I also have questions about the report presented and a request to have a little bit more information.

83
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,820
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I want to thank you for presenting it.

84
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:56,736
[SPEAKER_04]: When we asked for this quarterly, I know it was a long time ago, we asked for the job title and the annual salaries be listed next to the gross for the pay period.

85
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:03,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that was requested and I don't think our system can pull that information into it.

86
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

87
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:09,683
[SPEAKER_04]: The job descriptions can be added?

88
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,423
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's no type.

89
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:19,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember the last one, we would say, it doesn't say what, like some people have four paid checks.

90
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I did refer to the last one.

91
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:21,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

92
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

93
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,011
[SPEAKER_19]: I did refer to the last report presented, and this is the same format.

94
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,812
[SPEAKER_19]: This is exactly directly from the export from our financial system.

95
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:42,694
[SPEAKER_19]: So in terms of having job description, things of that sort, or title, it's not part of the payroll system, and that's not part of this particular report.

96
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I know it can be downloaded to an Excel document, and those job descriptions can be there, because you have people's names.

97
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, some people get four paychecks.

98
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know some of its longevity, but I don't know what the other things are.

99
00:11:57,088 --> 00:12:05,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and we are supposed to be able to look at this and look at our budget book to see if we're on track, and that's really the goal here.

100
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:14,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just like to table this so I can check my notes from the last meeting and the formal request that I made at that time.

101
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:18,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's OK, should we table in this report?

102
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,664
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make a motion to table.

103
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second to table?

104
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero, before the tabling.

105
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:28,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Before the tabling, I just have a couple of questions about the formatting, because I had a similar concern or idea, I guess.

106
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:38,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it possible, if not department heads, or different departments, is it possible for us to list the departments that they receive their paycheck from?

107
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:43,848
[SPEAKER_19]: So the department is not going to reflect anything that is going to,

108
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:50,759
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a three-digit code that is only meaningful to our payroll department, so it's not going to reference.

109
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,889
[SPEAKER_19]: And if somebody's working in multiple buildings, they may have different department codes.

110
00:12:55,602 --> 00:13:05,348
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not sure what the value of having a department code would be, and that would be a lot more information to be derived.

111
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:15,655
[SPEAKER_19]: So our financial reporting only provides minimal information, which is what has been provided here, as well as what was provided last year for the review.

112
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:20,658
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of base salary, again, I think I indicated on the summary report

113
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:36,487
[SPEAKER_19]: We still have many collective bargaining agreements that have not been completed, so there are many that are still not going to be reflective of any fiscal year 2018-19 COLA that could be applied.

114
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:48,113
[SPEAKER_19]: All of the steps have been increased as they would be in their particular collective bargaining agreement, but there are still a number of items that would not be, and again,

115
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:54,249
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking at a budget document, that was a plan and we did not include COLAs in that budget document.

116
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:58,072
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not going to tie out directly from what was presented in the budget.

117
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:04,617
[SPEAKER_19]: As you recall, we did have a holder, a placeholder in there for negotiation amounts.

118
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,399
[SPEAKER_19]: In good faith, that's the process that we identify.

119
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:14,784
[SPEAKER_19]: So we would only put in their step and lane depending on their particular collective bargaining agreement.

120
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:16,225
[SPEAKER_19]: So no COLAs were identified.

121
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:34,589
[SPEAKER_19]: If you do look at what is their base salary annualized across 26 pays, it will likely not match what the budget included last year, because we had a holding bucket of funds based on negotiations in anticipation for this fiscal year.

122
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:34,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

123
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you still ask questions?

124
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just trying to understand the data frames that you draw this from.

125
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:47,390
[SPEAKER_14]: So to pull out this spreadsheet here, these columns, you drew that from your payroll system, is that correct?

126
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:52,273
[SPEAKER_19]: This is one pay period, and that was the pay period January 3rd of 2019.

127
00:14:52,773 --> 00:15:06,320
[SPEAKER_19]: And I reverted you back to when that was reported previously on the bills and payrolls, so that you could see that the number ties out to what is reported to you biweekly in that regard.

128
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess the reason why I'm trying to understand the challenge of this

129
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:19,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have these numbers also cross-referenced to another data frame that where the warrants are drawn from that pay all these people, right?

130
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:21,945
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

131
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:30,427
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I'm trying to understand is that if there's someone being paid, let's say, in the high school,

132
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:32,459
[SPEAKER_14]: How do they draw their check?

133
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,561
[SPEAKER_14]: They draw their check from just payroll and that's where it's come from?

134
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:41,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Or does it go that there's a warrant drawn from the high school and that goes to pay off the payroll?

135
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:42,685
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

136
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:43,665
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

137
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:47,288
[SPEAKER_19]: This is your warrant of which it is processed from.

138
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:52,070
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the total warrant of payments going out to personnel.

139
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:56,133
[SPEAKER_19]: So under your payroll line item, that's what you are approving.

140
00:15:56,917 --> 00:16:00,099
[SPEAKER_19]: during each cycle of bills and payroll approval.

141
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:05,602
[SPEAKER_19]: So this was the total gross wages for earnings for the entire district.

142
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:07,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Alphabetically.

143
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Alpha, from January 3rd.

144
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:17,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess what I'm trying to understand is, because I've worked with a little data myself, so I'm trying to understand why is it difficult to pull out the department?

145
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:23,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I would imagine that these numbers must correspond to a different data set that you have, right?

146
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:29,248
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is their employee number, and this is referenced in payroll, a separate payroll system.

147
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:32,971
[SPEAKER_19]: The payroll itself includes deductions.

148
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:42,679
[SPEAKER_19]: It includes multiple facets that would be even more complex in order to describe and get to the gross amount.

149
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:52,387
[SPEAKER_19]: It comprises of seven different batches of groupings of different pay types, pay cycles, different employee bargaining units.

150
00:16:52,847 --> 00:17:03,511
[SPEAKER_19]: So in order to provide that detail would essentially be a phone book's worth of information.

151
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:14,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, I understand that there must be many different data frames, but what I'm trying to understand is why is it, I still, maybe it's just because my head's so thick here, so maybe you could just go through it with me a couple of times.

152
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:21,336
[SPEAKER_14]: So if, and I'm not saying that this is the case, but let's say there's Dr., I don't know, Ghostface.

153
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,878
[SPEAKER_14]: How do, you know, someone who just ended up in the payroll system.

154
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,879
[SPEAKER_14]: You hear about stories about this every so often.

155
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:33,343
[SPEAKER_14]: You read the news that there's some mystery person that's been drawing payroll for years and years and years, even though they're not on the system anymore.

156
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:35,264
[SPEAKER_14]: That couldn't happen to us, right?

157
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:43,609
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this is your gross listing based on who is active, actively in our payroll system.

158
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,570
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you know they're active?

159
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:49,990
[SPEAKER_19]: They're active by virtue of being paid on the biweekly or weekly schedule.

160
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,214
[SPEAKER_19]: So within our payroll system.

161
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,656
[SPEAKER_19]: To answer your question, we have two separate systems.

162
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:00,639
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not concurrent.

163
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:01,800
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not the same system.

164
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,523
[SPEAKER_19]: So we get a complex data feed out of our payroll.

165
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:24,643
[SPEAKER_19]: that's based on all of our active employees from every employee type from after school earnings to regular coverages to full base salaries, longevity, all of that for active employees is then filtered into the financial software reporting piece that you see in front of you.

166
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:29,948
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the gross payroll that is essentially what is paid out.

167
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:35,480
[SPEAKER_19]: on a weekly, biweekly cycle based on the number of employees.

168
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:43,063
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, if there was somebody here listed that should not be, then we would know that.

169
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:43,903
[SPEAKER_19]: How would you know that?

170
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:46,524
[SPEAKER_19]: We go through the payroll as we're processing it.

171
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:47,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

172
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:50,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Patterson, could you describe how the payroll gets to you?

173
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the end result, so it goes through phases to get to you.

174
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:59,292
[SPEAKER_14]: We approve this every week, so I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on the process.

175
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:00,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

176
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:06,573
[SPEAKER_19]: So payroll itself has auto payments for known base salaries and longevity.

177
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:14,755
[SPEAKER_19]: All of your 26 pay periods that are your regular folks, your administrators, your teachers, your paras, everybody that's on a salary schedule.

178
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,268
[SPEAKER_19]: It's automatic payment.

179
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,610
[SPEAKER_19]: So they are processed automatically.

180
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Their additional earnings would be paid separately.

181
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:31,754
[SPEAKER_19]: So if they had an additional coverage, they did some extra teaching or had a stipend assignment, that would be another line item.

182
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,875
[SPEAKER_19]: So all of that is filtered in.

183
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Timesheets are submitted.

184
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:40,257
[SPEAKER_19]: All of that is processed through the payroll that we review.

185
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:42,137
[SPEAKER_19]: We look at their deductions.

186
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:43,598
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a number of

187
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:52,599
[SPEAKER_19]: components that each person's pay report on a weekly, bi-weekly cycle is in the payroll system.

188
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:52,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

189
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,183
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that people might have different deductions, and that changes the gross wages.

190
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:00,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I completely understand that.

191
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:02,785
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm having trouble understanding.

192
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:06,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It changes the net wages, not the gross.

193
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:06,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

194
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:06,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

195
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:07,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me.

196
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:07,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

197
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:11,850
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I'm trying to understand is, so there's data coming to you.

198
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:14,064
[SPEAKER_14]: then you filter that data and make this report.

199
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:20,786
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no column about where that person works or what that person's title or role is in the company?

200
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:26,928
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, this is coming from our financial software reporting, not the payroll system itself.

201
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:29,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Those two systems do not speak to one another.

202
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,670
[SPEAKER_14]: What are the data frames?

203
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,170
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm trying to understand.

204
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pay period.

205
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:36,091
[SPEAKER_06]: He's talking about the named list.

206
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from payroll.

207
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,232
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the employee number.

208
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:39,852
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

209
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:41,393
[SPEAKER_19]: This is from admins.

210
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:53,535
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the report from admins that is processed by... I can't see names in our ledgers on the city side.

211
00:20:54,176 --> 00:21:00,763
[SPEAKER_19]: This is what's provided by the audit office based on the payroll that's submitted.

212
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the payroll system.

213
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:22,124
[SPEAKER_14]: My challenge here is it seems that there must be some sort of data frame of some sort, whether it's something like some SQL database or some database where this employee has all the facts about that employee are in a column on some sort of database.

214
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:22,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

215
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:26,826
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a very complex database that's not as

216
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,474
[SPEAKER_19]: easily manipulated, if you will.

217
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,274
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the format of the database?

218
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,535
[SPEAKER_19]: There's multiple tabs across.

219
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:38,036
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's one tab for certain areas, one tab for another.

220
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:44,997
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's MTRS, so it's not just one set of demographic for one employee.

221
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:50,879
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're talking 15 to 20 tabs going across for your data point of one particular person.

222
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:59,314
[SPEAKER_14]: With all due respect, so the only assurance that we have that we don't have some sort of ghost member on the payroll is that the program tells us so?

223
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:01,916
[SPEAKER_19]: The program does not.

224
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:04,958
[SPEAKER_19]: We verify that as we're processing payroll.

225
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:16,505
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, there has to be some confidence that the office itself is reviewing the information and going through any applicable changes in staffing that have occurred.

226
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:21,708
[SPEAKER_19]: So no, a system itself is not going to know if there's somebody artificially in that system.

227
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:29,671
[SPEAKER_19]: That's based on the human factor of the business office that we have to monitor, which we do each pay period, each cycle.

228
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:30,692
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no question.

229
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:36,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to make clear to everyone, I'm not implying that I think that there's any malfeasance.

230
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:36,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't.

231
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:40,377
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm trying to understand is the difficulty in drawing the data.

232
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:47,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Because for me, I would, whatever data frame you're working on, you should be able to draw these columns.

233
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:49,587
[SPEAKER_14]: and the columns come out.

234
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:53,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, that's all the database experience I've ever had.

235
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And in all due respect, there's no simplistic.

236
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if, let's say, code 010 meant the superintendent's office.

237
00:22:59,272 --> 00:22:59,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

238
00:22:59,532 --> 00:22:59,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

239
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:00,913
[SPEAKER_06]: You might get a report.

240
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:05,836
[SPEAKER_06]: You could get this report, and then divvied out by the people in the superintendent's office, sort of a different way.

241
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:07,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you can get something like that.

242
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:10,679
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you have people that work in different departments.

243
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:13,541
[SPEAKER_14]: So they would just have multiple entries on the column.

244
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,922
[SPEAKER_14]: See, that seems to be the solution to the problem.

245
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:23,866
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had someone who works at both the Andrews and the Roberts, they would just have a comma in between the two places.

246
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not going to assist.

247
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that help you to know that they're at the superintendent's office?

248
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, we have a fiduciary responsibility to the voters of Medford.

249
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:34,035
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's our job, right?

250
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's what we vote on, is to make sure that these people vote here.

251
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:50,060
[SPEAKER_14]: The idea is that we have a report, but you're missing a key actual value on this data frame, which is to know where this person works in our system.

252
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I have, you know, there are many, many names here, and I'm sure they all work hard.

253
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:59,068
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not, I wanna make absolutely clear, I'm not implying anything, but on the same token,

254
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:04,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's a crucial, I mean, why not just, why have the employee number or even the name?

255
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you look into, by our next meeting, whether or not you can add a column that shows the location?

256
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:31,245
[SPEAKER_19]: I can show the location but the report itself will not tie out because they will be in multiple locations because we have many people that work in multiple buildings and that's the that's the issue if you give me a spreadsheet I will make a beautiful report if you give me I wish it was that simplistic okay there's a motion on the table miss bandicoot

257
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:32,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a question.

258
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:39,089
[SPEAKER_11]: When we have our budget book, we have a name, we have a department, and we have an amount of money.

259
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,750
[SPEAKER_11]: How come it works then?

260
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,871
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not from the payroll system.

261
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:47,613
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a very challenging payroll system.

262
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:56,417
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a farm-grown payroll system, and it does not necessarily tie to our program codes or to our general ledger codes, to those types of things.

263
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:59,938
[SPEAKER_19]: We have crosswalks that we... That's why there's a continual...

264
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:14,177
[SPEAKER_19]: correction and or if there's any movement, if somebody moves from one building to another, it's imperative that payroll knows so that we can change their location, change their building, change where they're being charged within the general fund.

265
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:26,120
[SPEAKER_19]: So the budget book, again, in and of itself, is a moving document because there's been transition since we solidified it back last June.

266
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,901
[SPEAKER_19]: There were people that moved simply locations.

267
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that changes your budget book.

268
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,262
[SPEAKER_19]: That changes the department.

269
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:34,223
[SPEAKER_19]: That changes their location.

270
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:40,146
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, it's not just a quick Excel spit out.

271
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,167
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of different things.

272
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:47,570
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, there are limitations to what we can produce within our payroll system.

273
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:54,014
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little bit rudimentary in terms of certain specifics that you're looking for.

274
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:59,137
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the reality, that we do have limitations within our own reporting capacity.

275
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:00,775
[SPEAKER_19]: in this particular system.

276
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:16,364
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I've tried to prepare for you is a simplistic version for ease of reviewing so that you could see that the dollars themselves tie out to the gross wages that are reported for review on each pay period and each cycle as they come through.

277
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:22,107
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have biweekly cycles that include the weekly cycles on every given pay period.

278
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:24,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Russo.

279
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

280
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:40,986
[SPEAKER_13]: not disagree that we have a fiduciary responsibility here, but that responsibility does not mean that I'm supposed to know that each individual in this list works here and is actually pulling a salary, because they should.

281
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:45,707
[SPEAKER_13]: That's beyond imagination that that could happen.

282
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:51,769
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not my responsibility to know every person here, every time we get one of these, actually works here.

283
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:57,030
[SPEAKER_13]: My responsibility, as I see it, is to make sure that there's a process in place

284
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,622
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are staff that are making sure that that's happening.

285
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:05,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that is, we can all agree, what we want to know for sure.

286
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:13,906
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can't attest that these people work here and that they should get a salary.

287
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:18,787
[SPEAKER_13]: That's craziness to think that we would go through a list with hundreds and hundreds of people.

288
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:23,449
[SPEAKER_13]: And each week, I'm going to go know that they actually still get work here.

289
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Mr. Ruggiero.

290
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:32,703
[SPEAKER_14]: With all due respect to your point, which I understand where you're coming from, we don't have to take the entire population and test it.

291
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,103
[SPEAKER_14]: We would test a sample.

292
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:39,004
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could take 30 people from this list, and I could double check it.

293
00:27:39,484 --> 00:27:44,925
[SPEAKER_14]: That would give me a reasonable set of understanding, well, I picked 30 names at random off this list.

294
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,705
[SPEAKER_14]: All these people work here.

295
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:48,265
[SPEAKER_14]: That would give me much more confidence.

296
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:51,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Because right now, there's no way for me to find any of these people.

297
00:27:54,088 --> 00:28:07,754
[SPEAKER_14]: And that, but if I knew that, for example, let's say Michael Ruggiero, I don't want to name any names off the list, but let's say Michael Ruggiero, he works, he's a math teacher at the Roberts, that I would say, he's one of the names that I randomly drew from this page.

298
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:10,235
[SPEAKER_14]: I can check it if all 30 go through.

299
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,856
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm much more confident.

300
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:18,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I don't have to test an entire population to get some information about that population, man.

301
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Statistics.

302
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information heard.

303
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Russo.

304
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all set.

305
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a point of information?

306
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a point of information?

307
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:26,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

308
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz.

309
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,620
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

310
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,301
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to, you know, just... Oops, sorry.

311
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:31,041
[SPEAKER_18]: I just knocked that off.

312
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,562
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll put that back in a minute.

313
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:46,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Mention that when the payroll is sent into the Mass Teachers Retirement System, the total checks and everybody on that file, it's an electronic file, has to match up.

314
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:50,086
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's audited at the Mass Teachers Retirement System.

315
00:28:52,641 --> 00:29:22,288
[SPEAKER_18]: well, the reporting system that we have, has checks and balances in place to pick up on, for example, if somebody went on a leave of absence, or if somebody maybe got an extra check, and something like that might kick out, and that gets audited by the employer services area, and then questions are sent down to the school, and either it's explained, or maybe somebody got an extra check because they were working in one department, they earned the stipend,

316
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,541
[SPEAKER_18]: and the other person didn't get turned off, so there might be an adjustment on one person, and then a correction made.

317
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:30,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Things like that happen very often.

318
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:46,184
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know that our payroll software, when it comes through, picks up deductions omitted if somebody is missing and their deductions weren't turned on, which means they might be getting paid, but no deductions were taken.

319
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,064
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is just generic.

320
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:51,785
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just talking about I have a lot of districts, and we do...

321
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:59,934
[SPEAKER_18]: a very detailed audit and audit every single report in all the, you know, all the public schools.

322
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:07,636
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we are audited by, you know, PARAC and KPMG, you know what I mean?

323
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:14,277
[SPEAKER_18]: So the reports are going through those audits and so is Medford Public Schools or they randomly pick school districts to audit.

324
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:19,958
[SPEAKER_18]: KPMG does, you know, and they audit the reports that are sent in and they do an audit with you.

325
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:21,678
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know what questions they're asking.

326
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:25,303
[SPEAKER_18]: and they do not with us, and you don't know what questions that they're asking us.

327
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:28,464
[SPEAKER_18]: And then both of us have to give back up to the auditors.

328
00:30:29,224 --> 00:30:29,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

329
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:30,564
[SPEAKER_18]: And it has to match up.

330
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:31,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

331
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:32,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Russo, are you all set?

332
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:33,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all set.

333
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:34,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all set.

334
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:35,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

335
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:35,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

336
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:46,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So as my colleague was saying about taking 30 random names, last year that's exactly what I had done and compared it to

337
00:30:46,955 --> 00:31:04,771
[SPEAKER_04]: the budget book and there were discrepancies in a few people's salaries and steps were given out of time frame that should have been and we had a meeting about it and that's why this report was requested.

338
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:10,416
[SPEAKER_04]: But this document doesn't give us enough information and that's why I'm asking to table it

339
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:17,948
[SPEAKER_04]: so we can get more information than what's presented at this time in a way that we can, you know, just pick a few things.

340
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:25,670
[SPEAKER_04]: If every one of us picked three and just said, you know, my three were great, then, you know, we're doing our due diligence in moving forward.

341
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:34,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I want to see happen, and I want to ask a few questions.

342
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some principals are supposed to be making the same

343
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,319
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of money we made changes at the beginning of that this year.

344
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:46,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at those two principles, they're not on this base salary in here.

345
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:51,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to do all of that on camera for the whole city.

346
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:56,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's fair to name names in someone's salary all the time in this forum.

347
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to table it.

348
00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:00,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like a little bit more.

349
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:07,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to look at my notes because they may be different from what you had written down.

350
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:11,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And I definitely need a little bit more information than what's presented in this.

351
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:12,577
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

352
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,519
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion on the floor to table the paper.

353
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

354
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:17,962
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a second by Mr. Russo.

355
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:18,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

356
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:22,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Undebatable on the motion to table this paper to our next meeting.

357
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:23,627
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

358
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:24,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

359
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:25,969
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

360
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion granted.

361
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:28,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

362
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:29,292
[SPEAKER_06]: The paper's tabled.

363
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:29,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the work.

364
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:31,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

365
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:36,397
[SPEAKER_06]: report of the outgoing secretary.

366
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,060
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to congratulate Ms.

367
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Stone on her nomination.

368
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:44,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to wish you the best.

369
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:46,226
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can always help out and train.

370
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I know if you need me, just text me.

371
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:58,756
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to extend my thanks to all the girls at City Hall and the Finance Auditing Department for being so accommodating, sharing their office space and treats.

372
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,977
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a lot of good candies in there.

373
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:02,199
[SPEAKER_18]: I really enjoyed seeing them every week.

374
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,180
[SPEAKER_18]: And I owe the girls a bag of candy.

375
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll probably bring one in sometime.

376
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:13,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, thank you to all the girls in the finance and accounts payable offices at Medford High School for organizing the batches and ensuring all the backup is provided.

377
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:19,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Lastly, I want to thank the custodial department for delivering the package to City Hall in a timely manner every week.

378
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:29,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Cynthia Burke, Tawana Dubrow, Michelle Kingdon, Fiona Maxwell, Shab Khan, Aleesha Nunley, Joanne Mortel, Erin Carson, Christine Patterson, and John Howard.

379
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:30,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all.

380
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:34,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

381
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:35,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

382
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

383
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:38,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot.

384
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:39,436
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

385
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:40,717
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

386
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:41,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

387
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:42,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Report of committees.

388
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,178
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rules Subcommittee, December 17, 2018.

389
00:33:46,918 --> 00:33:49,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I'll be reporting on that.

390
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,599
[SPEAKER_18]: The Rules Subcommittee had a meeting on December 17.

391
00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:01,642
[SPEAKER_18]: The purpose of our subcommittee meeting was to take a roll call vote on the final draft copy of the functions of the school committee and move the draft over to the regular meeting on December 17.

392
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:09,018
[SPEAKER_18]: I explained to the subcommittee that the week before, I had met with City Solicitor Mark Rumley on December 10th.

393
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:14,520
[SPEAKER_18]: He reviewed the draft and he helped make corrections so we would not be in violation with the law or the First Amendment.

394
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:21,203
[SPEAKER_18]: A motion was made at the regular meeting to move the draft to the Committee of the Whole so that we can discuss it with the entire committee.

395
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:26,525
[SPEAKER_18]: This weekend, Superintendent Dr. Maurice, she sent out a doodle email note to everyone.

396
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:32,706
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think sometime over the next couple of days, we'll find out what date the Committee of the Whole meeting will be.

397
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:33,747
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

398
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:34,047
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

399
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:40,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero?

400
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:41,253
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

401
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:42,814
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

402
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

403
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Committee of the Whole.

404
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:56,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Also last Monday, January 7, in room 207, we had a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the Alliance for Inclusion and Prevention.

405
00:34:56,705 --> 00:35:03,449
[SPEAKER_06]: that conducted a trauma assessment, a health assessment on the McGlynn Middle and the McGlynn Elementary School.

406
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:24,882
[SPEAKER_06]: We have about three or so pages of notes that were taken at the meeting, but it really went through the detailed information of the various surveys that were furnished to the children, their parents, teachers and staff, and also next step suggestions on how to potentially improve climate, not only at those two schools, but throughout the district.

407
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will be working steadfast on moving forward.

408
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:36,348
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that the school has had a tremendous turnaround over the last several months, so we're really thrilled with the perception.

409
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:48,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And just for all those at home, parents are really, really happy with the McGlynn, how their kids felt that they were, how the kids felt supported.

410
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:51,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And the teachers were all invested in their children.

411
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:54,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So overall, it was a very good, positive report.

412
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:58,200
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, there are areas that need to be addressed.

413
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will do so moving forward.

414
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:06,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

415
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:07,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

416
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:08,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Ms.

417
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:08,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz.

418
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

419
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:10,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero.

420
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,728
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

421
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:12,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

422
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:13,369
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

423
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

424
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:16,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

425
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Community participation.

426
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:24,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Report of the superintendent.

427
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:26,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent's update and comments.

428
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:27,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Superintendent.

429
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:30,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening everyone.

430
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:43,810
[SPEAKER_12]: So this past week, it's only been one week, but there's still a lot happening in the district.

431
00:36:46,109 --> 00:37:00,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming up very soon, I just want to, in light of last week's presentation, I wanted to let parents know and the community, all of you know, that there will be a presentation about what parents need to know about vaping and hidden in plain sight.

432
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:07,674
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be on Thursday, February 7th at 5.30 at the McGlynn School Auditorium.

433
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:14,256
[SPEAKER_12]: This presentation will be provided to parents and guardians about the new look of nicotine addiction

434
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:20,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Parents will learn about these harmful products and how to protect their children from this latest trend.

435
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:24,441
[SPEAKER_12]: There will also be a hidden in plain sight area.

436
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:31,425
[SPEAKER_12]: This invitation is to all parents and guardians in the district who might be interested, and it is an adult-only event.

437
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:42,133
[SPEAKER_12]: The presentation is in collaboration with Toni Wray of our health department from the district and Team Medford, Medford's Board of Health Prevention Office.

438
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:47,392
[SPEAKER_12]: So please save the date, Thursday, February 7th at 5.30 p.m.

439
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,473
[SPEAKER_12]: at the McGlynn School Auditorium.

440
00:37:51,373 --> 00:38:02,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week on Tuesday, Mayor Burke and myself, we had the opportunity to go downtown Boston to meet with Mayor Walsh at City Hall.

441
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:10,539
[SPEAKER_12]: We attended a meeting to discuss the potential overhaul of the state's 26-year-old funding formula.

442
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:20,528
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our hope that it will be updated so all students can benefit and bridge between urban and suburban school performances.

443
00:38:21,928 --> 00:38:26,830
[SPEAKER_12]: This potential funding will benefit Medford greatly.

444
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:34,472
[SPEAKER_12]: And in addition to that, last Wednesday, Mayor Burke and Assistant Superintendent Christine Patterson

445
00:38:34,947 --> 00:39:01,392
[SPEAKER_12]: They went to the State House, Senator Chang-Diaz and many other mayors and superintendents and school administrators, members of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, Massachusetts Association of School Committees, and others were there in support of the revamped version of the Senate's funding bill from last session.

446
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:04,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the proposed bill will be called

447
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,510
[SPEAKER_12]: the Education Promise Act.

448
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:13,472
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this will hugely benefit our district and correct some historic funding inequities.

449
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:19,635
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm very optimistic and hopeful that this bill will go through and benefit Medford.

450
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:30,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Last Wednesday, I also attended NSSEP training as it was my fifth session of one-year training.

451
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,532
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I continue to work with a group of cohorts

452
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:41,740
[SPEAKER_12]: of close to 40 superintendents across the state where we participate in professional development.

453
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:52,412
[SPEAKER_12]: We have opportunities to look at our district's vision, looking at data and what potential theories of action can be for each respective district.

454
00:39:52,975 --> 00:40:14,022
[SPEAKER_12]: So as I continue to work on looking at Medford and making Medford stronger and continuing to improve our schools, I continue to learn a lot from being at those professional development sessions, hearing from other superintendents and other leaders within the state to help inform and guide the work that I'm doing.

455
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:18,503
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was last week, Wednesday, and I was in Marlborough for the entire day.

456
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:23,565
[SPEAKER_12]: My next meeting with them will be in February, on February 6th.

457
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:29,849
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is frequent, but it's making sure that we're all moving at the same pace.

458
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:38,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that's happening right now in Medford, we have a wonderful computer science curriculum.

459
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:44,678
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are expanding our K-12 computer science learning for our students.

460
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:52,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year, Edison Robotics, Edbots, were integrated into our technology curriculum.

461
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:57,193
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, coding and robotics have been expanded to all K-8 schools.

462
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:12,622
[SPEAKER_12]: The Edison devices have a variety of programming languages that are appropriate for younger and older learners and teaches students computational thinking and computer programming in an age-appropriate way and with plenty of hands-on learning.

463
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:20,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Students were able to code the robots to respond to light and sound, follow lines, and avoid obstacles.

464
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:27,971
[SPEAKER_12]: The students can also code the robots to communicate with each other or to respond to claps or music.

465
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,272
[SPEAKER_12]: These robots are ideal for STEM projects

466
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:34,833
[SPEAKER_12]: and are suitable for students from kindergarten all the way through high school.

467
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:43,675
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this is preparing our students for tomorrow, artificial intelligence and things along those lines.

468
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:59,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Additionally, I just wanted to give an update about Priscilla's Pantry, the Medford High School Hope Chest and Priscilla's Pantry, a free food pantry at Medford High School that assists Medford High and Medford Vocational Technical High School students.

469
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:05,458
[SPEAKER_12]: We hosted a free chili, they hosted a free chili lunch on early release Wednesday.

470
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:10,759
[SPEAKER_12]: No school lunches are traditionally offered on early release days.

471
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:21,261
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the assistance of the food pantry, Red Smith, our district nutritionist, made two types of chili, meat and bean, and vegetarian chili.

472
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:29,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Students not only were able to grab a steaming bowl of chili, but also left with the ingredients needed to make the same meal at their homes.

473
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:36,330
[SPEAKER_12]: So Priscilla's Pantry hopes to not only feed hungry students, but empower students to cook for themselves.

474
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:41,612
[SPEAKER_12]: They hope to provide this interactive lunch experience on future early release days.

475
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:51,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week, for our students, we also had a special presentation, ending distracted driving presentation.

476
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:57,206
[SPEAKER_12]: So this presentation was for our sophomore class at the high school.

477
00:42:57,986 --> 00:43:05,510
[SPEAKER_12]: And the students listened to an end distracting driving presentation provided by the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys.

478
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:15,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Attorney Joel Feldman, who began the end distracted driving program 10 years ago in memory of his daughter, Casey Feldman, opened the program.

479
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:21,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Casey was 21 years old and in a crosswalk when a distracted driver hit and killed her.

480
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:30,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford resident, Emily Stein, the president of Safe Roads Alliance, lost her dad to a distracted driver.

481
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Both of the speakers explained how a few seconds can change everything.

482
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:42,808
[SPEAKER_12]: They urged the students to pay attention on the road and focus on the task at hand, which should be driving only.

483
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:48,972
[SPEAKER_12]: During the presentation, the speakers asked the students if their parents texted while driving.

484
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:51,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, a number of hands did go up.

485
00:43:52,892 --> 00:44:01,175
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't tell our children to stay safe, and not to text and drive, and then witness us doing exactly what we told them not to do.

486
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:10,819
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was a very powerful and very important presentation for our students, and we did have support, I believe Ms.

487
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:17,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Dever from the mayor's office, Dever Wood came to support us for that presentation.

488
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:43,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I just wanted to announce that at the end of this month coming up before January ends We have four dates slated for math learning walk to as you know in collaboration and partnership with Lesley University We did baseline data in the fall and so we are now getting ready to do our mid-year check-in update for all of our elementary schools and so

489
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:47,400
[SPEAKER_12]: We are in the process of combining teams.

490
00:44:47,540 --> 00:45:05,106
[SPEAKER_12]: We will be having directors and administrators and leaders on the Lesley University side coming to support our learning walk as we continue to gather data to look at the progress that we've made from the start of school year to the midpoint.

491
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,067
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are my announcements for today.

492
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:08,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, thank you.

493
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:11,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero.

494
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:13,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for that.

495
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:20,849
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a question about the vaping that you have on Thursday, February 7th.

496
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,072
[SPEAKER_14]: How is this event being advertised to parents?

497
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:29,117
[SPEAKER_12]: We will have this on our website.

498
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:31,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it may already be posted.

499
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:40,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they are notifying parents at the school there's going to be a dance happening at the same time.

500
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:48,456
[SPEAKER_12]: So as parents go to the school to drop their children off for the event, while the students are

501
00:45:49,597 --> 00:46:07,367
[SPEAKER_12]: enjoying themselves at the dance, parents will be able to go to the auditorium and participate in this very informative presentation to really help them be aware of what's happening and for the hidden and plain sight for the parents to be able to see

502
00:46:08,587 --> 00:46:11,168
[SPEAKER_12]: what could be right under their noses and they're not aware of.

503
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:37,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to make sure that we just announce this to the community and as you talk with people, and you can have it on the blog spot in the website, but to continue to just let people know that this is happening, let the community know, and I think it's just another opportunity to continue to inform the community about these addictions and how we can work together

504
00:46:38,445 --> 00:46:40,185
[SPEAKER_12]: support our youngsters.

505
00:46:40,985 --> 00:46:41,245
Thank you.

506
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

507
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:48,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to elaborate a little bit more on the foundation budget and the education bill, the Promise Act that's been put forth.

508
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:59,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you looked at the city of Medford over the last several years, when you net out what we get in Chapter 70, which is school funding against our charter school expenses, we're negative.

509
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:01,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Every year we've been going down lower and lower.

510
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:04,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So the state is contributing less and less to the school system.

511
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:07,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore, the property tax burden really is covering

512
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 87% of our school costs are covered through the tax bills.

513
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:15,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a huge burden on us.

514
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:19,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's very disparate when you compare the urban-suburban.

515
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:27,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's frustrating, because we really are educating the most vulnerable in the Commonwealth, similar to Boston.

516
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:30,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need that extra help.

517
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:37,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So I urge you, as this bill progresses, to really push hard and call your legislators to tell them you're on board.

518
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:41,944
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point in time, we'll do a shout out to parents and educators as well.

519
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,844
[SPEAKER_06]: MTA was on board with this.

520
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:47,485
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mass Association of School Committees was there as well to support it.

521
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:51,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Cross channels and charter schools do not get hindered by this.

522
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:52,426
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get hurt.

523
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:54,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really lifts everyone up.

524
00:47:54,927 --> 00:48:02,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So please stay apprised and tune in for further discussions because we're going to need everybody to push for this bill to pass.

525
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:07,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know, Madam Mayor, do you know for the Education Promise Act, do you know the house number?

526
00:48:07,788 --> 00:48:09,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Senate number, and I can look it up.

527
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:10,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I can send it to you tomorrow.

528
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

529
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:13,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

530
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:14,472
[SPEAKER_04]: DiBenedetto.

531
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:16,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

532
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:36,486
[SPEAKER_04]: First, going back to the in plain sight thing, maybe an auto call to just both middle schools, like the night before, as a reminder to parents that this program is happening, just to say, hey, while you're bringing your children to the dance, or for the other school as well.

533
00:48:37,658 --> 00:48:45,145
[SPEAKER_04]: that we'd love to see you and it's a great opportunity to mingle with other middle school parents because they take the bus, you don't get to do that.

534
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:46,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was one thing.

535
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:52,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two is I really like the superintendent updates.

536
00:48:52,691 --> 00:49:02,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I gather a lot of information and it's really informative and not only to me as a committee member but I'm sure anybody watching.

537
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:07,143
[SPEAKER_04]: to just hear highlights of what's happening all over the district.

538
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:08,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really appreciate them.

539
00:49:08,764 --> 00:49:13,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So take your time and do as long as you need to, because it's really, really fun for me.

540
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:17,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that you needed that.

541
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:22,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I forget what the third thing was, so I'll just pass the floor along.

542
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:23,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

543
00:49:23,952 --> 00:49:31,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And the distracted driving session, Emily Stein is actually a mom at the Brooks School, so she has a direct connection with medical kids.

544
00:49:31,623 --> 00:49:36,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a point of information, I just wanted to let you know that an auto call is going out that's already been planned.

545
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,532
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

546
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:38,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

547
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:39,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Vandekloot.

548
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:51,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to remind the committee that we had voted to do a meet and greet prior to the Medford Family Network Valentine's Family Festival.

549
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:58,366
[SPEAKER_11]: It was advertised, or the Valentine's Festival has been advertised between 11 and 1 p.m.

550
00:49:58,406 --> 00:49:58,747
[SPEAKER_11]: this year.

551
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:03,956
[SPEAKER_11]: which means that our meet and greet, when we were talking about it, would be the hour before 10.

552
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:14,929
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we must ask Superintendent that we have Lisa Evangelista, please, if she would write an article, and we have other advertising going out.

553
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,611
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea was that the...

554
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:26,774
[SPEAKER_11]: school committee would be available to meet and greet, and in no way would whatever room we're set up with, would that interfere with any of the setup for the Valentine Festival.

555
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:30,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to make sure that it's advertised, though.

556
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:34,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to remind the membership that we said we would do that.

557
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:36,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

558
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:37,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

559
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:39,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

560
00:50:39,756 --> 00:50:40,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz.

561
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:40,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

562
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:41,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

563
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:45,717
[SPEAKER_18]: So I actually got to attend the distracted driving seminar last week.

564
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:52,512
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that I like to go to because it reminds me that I don't want to drive distracted.

565
00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:56,253
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've spoken with Emily before.

566
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,613
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just really, I go to support.

567
00:50:58,774 --> 00:51:05,475
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's just really, it's a very good, moving, interactive presentation that they do.

568
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:13,158
[SPEAKER_18]: And just walking right up to kids to ask them, if your friend was drinking, would you let them get in the car?

569
00:51:13,678 --> 00:51:13,818
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

570
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,342
[SPEAKER_18]: If your friend is texting, would you let them drive?

571
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:21,025
[SPEAKER_18]: And they did a lot of little skits with some of the kids.

572
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:23,107
[SPEAKER_18]: And they do a great, great job.

573
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,410
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's really very moving.

574
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:31,133
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had a tear in my eye, because it's just so sad.

575
00:51:31,173 --> 00:51:33,495
[SPEAKER_18]: And your life can be taken away in seconds.

576
00:51:34,136 --> 00:51:38,139
[SPEAKER_18]: And they were just both unfortunate, distracted driving accidents.

577
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,141
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very sad, very moving.

578
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:42,903
[SPEAKER_18]: But all the trial attorneys just do

579
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:47,189
[SPEAKER_18]: great job explaining the distracted driving presentations.

580
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Just it's incredible.

581
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:49,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just texting.

582
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:50,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

583
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:51,050
[SPEAKER_18]: It's makeup.

584
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:51,630
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

585
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:52,290
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coffee.

586
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,870
[SPEAKER_18]: And GPS and yes.

587
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:54,250
[SPEAKER_18]: GPS.

588
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Checking mail.

589
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:55,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything.

590
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Like physical opening letters and yeah.

591
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:01,572
[SPEAKER_18]: It's go into your pocketbook and it's everything.

592
00:52:02,172 --> 00:52:02,392
[SPEAKER_18]: So.

593
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Ms.

594
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:03,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Croston.

595
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:05,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

596
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:05,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

597
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:07,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I remembered what my other item was.

598
00:52:10,433 --> 00:52:11,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Priscilla's Pantry.

599
00:52:12,194 --> 00:52:12,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the name too.

600
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:17,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many children attended that?

601
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:21,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like how many people are we serving?

602
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any numbers yet?

603
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:32,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's early, but, and I also, I think I requested a number of like how many homeless families or students we're serving in the community.

604
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:36,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we have a, glad that I asked for that a couple weeks, maybe a month ago.

605
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:37,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you were saying?

606
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:38,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

607
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I don't know if we could know that.

608
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

609
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:46,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I work with homeless population at the school district I work at.

610
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:58,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So this time of year, all through the year, more and more families and children are having difficult time paying their rent and becoming homeless.

611
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:06,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So things like Priscilla's Pantry, I'm very happy to see our school district, you know, take initiative with that stuff.

612
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:14,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And just some follow-up, like just some understanding of this population that we're serving is helpful to me.

613
00:53:14,748 --> 00:53:21,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're requesting, I will get the exact number of students that participated in the last early release?

614
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:21,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

615
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious how many homeless families or homeless students that this district is serving.

616
00:53:26,511 --> 00:53:29,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can probably find that by the homeless transportation numbers.

617
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That would give you an estimate.

618
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:38,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Priscilla's Pantry is in coordination with the YMCA.

619
00:53:38,734 --> 00:53:39,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

620
00:53:39,154 --> 00:53:39,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that.

621
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: They partnered with us on that project.

622
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:47,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great, the fact that you're teaching them how to cook and be independent people is very impressive to me.

623
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just curious how many people we're serving.

624
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:58,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know what it starts at so then as we watch it grow we can say, remember there was 8 kids and now there's 80 kids.

625
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:02,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

626
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:02,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Ruggiero.

627
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:09,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burkett, but also Madam Superintendent, it would be interesting to know how many parents or families have been affected by the government shutdown.

628
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:17,504
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I've been hearing that there have been a lot of reports, sort of, no one affected by me directly, but sort of secondhand information.

629
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:23,826
[SPEAKER_14]: And it'd be interesting to know if we could do more, either through Priscilla's Pantry, if we could figure something out.

630
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:28,008
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will try to find out that information.

631
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:32,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to express a little level of concern.

632
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:37,321
[SPEAKER_11]: While I'm interested in those numbers, I'm more interested in the confidentiality of the students.

633
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:43,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wouldn't want any reporting out to put pressure.

634
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:46,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so just that balance.

635
00:54:46,427 --> 00:54:53,452
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just a total number of homeless within the district and total number of students served?

636
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:54,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Utilizing the pantry.

637
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:57,955
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to keep in mind, for instance, there was a photo of

638
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:07,694
[SPEAKER_11]: the event that you referenced about the, that not every one of those students necessarily was homeless or whatever, and that it's open to students and whatever.

639
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:19,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted, you know, I'm just concerned that because we're interested in the numbers and in due diligence and all the rest, we don't then discourage kids who really need to go from going.

640
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:24,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So hot off the press, I was texted some intel.

641
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:26,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Approximately 15 students

642
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:31,375
[SPEAKER_12]: participated and had some chili.

643
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:36,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's approximately around 15, but I will get a confirmation.

644
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:48,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

645
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:51,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, report on kindergarten registration.

646
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:51,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

647
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:51,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldwell.

648
00:55:53,735 --> 00:55:54,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.

649
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:56,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's that time of year again.

650
00:55:56,916 --> 00:56:04,699
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to start preparing for our two, I know it sounds amazing, 2019-20 kindergartners coming in.

651
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:11,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to provide you with a packet that I'd like you to endorse so that I can put it up on the website for our families.

652
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:18,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford Public Schools will begin kindergarten registration the week of March 4th, 2019.

653
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:22,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Informational packets with required documentation and registration

654
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: will be available on the Medford Public Schools website, as well as at the Parent Information Center.

655
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,641
[SPEAKER_03]: at Medford High School, and we hope to do this by the end of January.

656
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:38,663
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, we'll present Building Bridges to Kindergarten on the following dates.

657
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:42,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is important for our families to come to these presentations.

658
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:48,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Maria Michelli is a veteran kindergarten teacher at the Brooks Elementary School.

659
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:53,207
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to present to our families what it's like to be in kindergarten.

660
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:54,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a slideshow.

661
00:56:55,164 --> 00:57:03,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encourage you to come because it shows all about the classrooms and the little learning centers that they have in the classrooms.

662
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:09,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about school safety and the curriculum, so it's a good find for our families.

663
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of questions that they ask, especially about buses, getting your children on buses.

664
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:24,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So the dates for building bridges will be Thursday, March 7th, and Tuesday, April 9th from 7 to 8 at Medford High School.

665
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:33,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will do an additional building bridges on Wednesday, May 1st from 7 to 8 at the McGlynn Elementary School.

666
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:39,497
[SPEAKER_03]: We also will provide free child care for our families who have little ones at home.

667
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:43,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And they need to contact Marie Cassidy so that she can

668
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:48,053
[SPEAKER_03]: get her people up so we can provide child care.

669
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:56,954
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a kindergarten open house on Wednesday, May 8th, at each of our elementary schools, which run from two to three.

670
00:57:57,294 --> 00:58:04,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And the principals have the families come in with the children, and they can take a walk through the kindergarten classrooms.

671
00:58:05,036 --> 00:58:10,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your package, you have the registration form, which all parents need to

672
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,763
[SPEAKER_03]: see what kind of documents they need to register their children.

673
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:22,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have the Parent Information Center open a couple of days for extended hours on the dates of building bridges.

674
00:58:24,009 --> 00:58:33,575
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a flyer for building bridges to kindergarten that we would like to put up on the website for our families to read and to participate in.

675
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:34,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ms.

676
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:40,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray has also provided me with health information that our kindergartners need

677
00:58:40,557 --> 00:58:41,818
[SPEAKER_03]: coming into our schools.

678
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:46,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So with your permission, I'd like to put this on the website.

679
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:46,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

680
00:58:46,742 --> 00:58:47,342
[SPEAKER_04]: DiBenedetto.

681
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:47,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

682
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:57,069
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great, a good way to welcome families into their first experience with our school district.

683
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a few questions.

684
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:03,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Will interpreters be present at any of the open house?

685
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:07,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, there will be interpreters there.

686
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:10,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Haitian, Creole, and Portuguese.

687
00:59:11,145 --> 00:59:11,585
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

688
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:13,887
[SPEAKER_04]: That represents the Neenah community.

689
00:59:14,268 --> 00:59:30,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'm wondering if the registration office, the Parent Information Center, is going to have more staffing this year, later hours, and interpreters available, because last year there were some needs of

690
00:59:31,415 --> 00:59:33,375
[SPEAKER_04]: families that came to my attention?

691
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:35,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will have the interpreters.

692
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:42,077
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do extended hours three different times, especially during vacation week in April.

693
00:59:42,097 --> 00:59:45,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I've asked Anne to stay on so we have at least two.

694
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:52,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Families can actually call in and make appointments, which might make it easier for them, especially our working families.

695
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:55,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will have two.

696
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:57,239
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't have any more than two.

697
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,060
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have to have nurses available to

698
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,095
[SPEAKER_03]: do some of the health stuff with it.

699
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:03,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my next question.

700
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:04,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

701
01:00:04,636 --> 01:00:04,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

702
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray provides us with a nurse.

703
01:00:07,096 --> 01:00:08,497
[SPEAKER_03]: At all of the peak times?

704
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:08,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

705
01:00:08,957 --> 01:00:10,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not at the third one.

706
01:00:10,657 --> 01:00:10,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

707
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:16,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray, we have them for the first two, but not at the McGlynn Elementary School, for the building bridges.

708
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:18,039
OK.

709
01:00:19,479 --> 01:00:29,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm more curious about the Parent Information Center and when parents need to access that and if there's any way we can streamline that and be really prepared

710
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:34,198
[SPEAKER_04]: for new families to make it as easy for them as possible.

711
01:00:34,279 --> 01:00:40,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for some families, getting up to the high school is difficult back and forth.

712
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:51,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they have to go repeatedly because they forgot paperwork or they don't understand everything, a few families ran into that last year.

713
01:00:51,453 --> 01:00:54,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that a few did run into that.

714
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:54,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

715
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:57,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we would like to provide them with as much help as we can.

716
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:05,781
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually going to set up the foyer so that if the children come with them, we have coloring books and things for the kids to do while they wait.

717
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:11,984
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as there's interpreters and health person there that can help them with the health documents.

718
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:16,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're very clear in our packets of what they need to bring.

719
01:01:16,787 --> 01:01:26,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe staff more, because a lot of this information takes a while to process with each parent.

720
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:33,686
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's only one person there, or if they step out for lunch, or to go to the bathroom, and if someone comes and it's not there.

721
01:01:35,227 --> 01:01:40,330
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two people working, but we need to have people working who understand the process as well.

722
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just can't put somebody in there.

723
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:44,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But I understand your concerns.

724
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:45,493
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

725
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:46,494
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

726
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:47,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

727
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:48,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for listening.

728
01:01:49,516 --> 01:01:50,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one suggestion.

729
01:01:51,117 --> 01:01:51,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

730
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:55,139
[SPEAKER_11]: On the kindergarten registration parent, the form.

731
01:01:57,215 --> 01:02:04,957
[SPEAKER_11]: The next to the last paragraph, it should be Medford Public Schools offers a before and after school program for registered students.

732
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:09,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Registration for both programs will begin on Monday, April 1st, 2019.

733
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:16,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Registration forms and pricing information will be available on the Medford Public Schools website.

734
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:21,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Somewhere you need to indicate that it is not free.

735
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:24,093
[SPEAKER_11]: or that there is a cost involved.

736
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:25,254
[SPEAKER_11]: So... Great suggestion.

737
01:02:25,294 --> 01:02:25,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

738
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:25,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll put that in.

739
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:26,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Suggestion.

740
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:32,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I haven't figured out how to put it in, but it's not guaranteed.

741
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:38,924
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not... We've had years where a wait list has needed to be developed.

742
01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:45,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's important that parents available on a first come, first serve basis or something.

743
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you would take a look at that, please.

744
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:48,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly will do that.

745
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:49,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

746
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:51,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

747
01:02:51,113 --> 01:02:51,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Russo.

748
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:53,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for this.

749
01:02:54,371 --> 01:03:10,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Without making this first page into a seven-page document, I do note that the McGlynn is referenced and the Brooks is referenced, and it would not be illogical to conclude that this is a notice about these two elementary schools and that maybe there'll be another one coming later.

750
01:03:10,846 --> 01:03:11,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

751
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me what page you're on?

752
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:13,288
[SPEAKER_13]: The very first page.

753
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:14,769
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

754
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,972
[SPEAKER_13]: There's Building Bridges to Kindergarten at the McGlynn.

755
01:03:18,012 --> 01:03:18,873
[SPEAKER_13]: There's one at the Brooks.

756
01:03:19,336 --> 01:03:20,396
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no one at the Brooks.

757
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:24,358
[SPEAKER_03]: The building bridges, two at the high school, and then at the McGlynn.

758
01:03:24,378 --> 01:03:26,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And we try to round-robin them every year.

759
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year it was at the Roberts, the year before I think we were at the Columbus.

760
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:42,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it needs to be explicit that no matter where you're, like if your kid is zoned for the Columbus because you live across the street, you might read this and decide, oh well this isn't, this is the McGlynn one.

761
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:44,505
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll wait for the

762
01:03:44,982 --> 01:03:48,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'll try to figure out what to put in there for language.

763
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:53,788
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the report to us, the cover sheet.

764
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:58,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's just mine to you, so you know.

765
01:03:58,572 --> 01:04:12,041
[SPEAKER_13]: But what's on the website, you know, if it says at the McGlynn Elementary is where this is taking place, it needs to be explicit that it's for all kindergartners regardless of where they're zoned.

766
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:13,630
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe it already says that.

767
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see if I can make that clearer than this.

768
01:04:16,392 --> 01:04:16,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

769
01:04:20,033 --> 01:04:20,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

770
01:04:20,934 --> 01:04:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would solve it.

771
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:32,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Where it says up on the top?

772
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I can certainly make that change.

773
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:40,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, something like that.

774
01:04:41,602 --> 01:04:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

775
01:04:42,262 --> 01:04:42,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

776
01:04:42,822 --> 01:04:43,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

777
01:04:45,023 --> 01:04:45,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

778
01:04:46,803 --> 01:05:05,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting back to the language that my colleague was talking about, about the after school program, there are some families that didn't even get added to a wait list at the beginning of this year when they tried to add their children on.

779
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:10,401
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure we are meeting the needs of our families in that way.

780
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:27,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like a report or I would like some information on the numbers of students in the wait list for after school and before school programming so we can maybe start addressing the needs of the district in hiring

781
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:29,052
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier.

782
01:05:29,072 --> 01:05:31,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I know hiring is very difficult.

783
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:33,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you know, you understand the process.

784
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:37,460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult right now to start to hire people.

785
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can see what our needers know.

786
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:47,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so when parents come to register their children, they have to register in the proximity zone of their children.

787
01:05:47,449 --> 01:05:48,130
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of

788
01:05:48,571 --> 01:06:00,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Families like to request other schools, but when they register, if you're in the Columbus School neighborhood, then you register there and you can apply for before and after school in that building.

789
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:12,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that our before and after school coordinator is doing, Megan's doing a fantastic job trying to make sure that she includes as many students as she can.

790
01:06:14,165 --> 01:06:17,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It is difficult to get people to work because the hours are very,

791
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:21,844
[SPEAKER_03]: challenging, you can say, you know, 1.30 to 6 o'clock.

792
01:06:22,724 --> 01:06:24,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to get people to work those hours.

793
01:06:25,426 --> 01:06:27,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that Megan will look into it.

794
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:30,249
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we can try to get that information.

795
01:06:30,649 --> 01:06:38,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know what we need to meet the need of the current families on the wait list, even without worrying about kindergartners coming in.

796
01:06:38,614 --> 01:06:39,795
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think Ms.

797
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:45,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Fidler-Carey was going to find out if we still had people wait listed, but I can certainly ask her.

798
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:46,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would be great.

799
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

800
01:06:47,658 --> 01:06:48,198
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

801
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:49,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Ruggiero.

802
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:54,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry to keep giving you little corrections or suggestions to the board.

803
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:54,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you so much.

804
01:06:54,883 --> 01:06:55,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

805
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:58,786
[SPEAKER_14]: This is on the second page under section one.

806
01:06:59,707 --> 01:07:05,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it possible you could just include the exact URL that they need to download it so they could just click on that?

807
01:07:06,372 --> 01:07:07,853
[SPEAKER_14]: It says medfordpublicschools.org.

808
01:07:07,873 --> 01:07:09,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you just do the black slash?

809
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:15,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Because our website can be a little difficult, especially for someone who has limited English skills.

810
01:07:17,812 --> 01:07:19,794
[SPEAKER_14]: More detailed.

811
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:21,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Such as myself, perhaps.

812
01:07:21,815 --> 01:07:24,137
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, I'd like to recommend that we put this online.

813
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,058
[SPEAKER_14]: I motion to approve.

814
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:31,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I motion that this report be accepted and that the revised versions be posted to the website.

815
01:07:31,662 --> 01:07:33,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Mr. Matadetto.

816
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:33,804
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

817
01:07:33,824 --> 01:07:34,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

818
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:35,145
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

819
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:35,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

820
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:36,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

821
01:07:36,506 --> 01:07:36,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldwell.

822
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:43,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, recommendation to approve field trip, Medford High School science and leadership enrichment trip.

823
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:47,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's a motion on the floor to approve.

824
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:52,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to talk to us?

825
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:53,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Please tell us about the job.

826
01:07:54,483 --> 01:07:56,644
[SPEAKER_16]: For those who don't know me, my name is Audrey Fator.

827
01:07:56,664 --> 01:07:58,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a science teacher at the high school.

828
01:07:58,685 --> 01:08:01,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I teach environmental science and biology, and this is my 20th year there.

829
01:08:04,308 --> 01:08:05,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is weird to say.

830
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,972
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a great number.

831
01:08:09,573 --> 01:08:14,257
[SPEAKER_16]: So some of you might be familiar with, I have done this trip before.

832
01:08:14,297 --> 01:08:15,838
[SPEAKER_16]: This will be my third time doing it.

833
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,521
[SPEAKER_16]: So I went this past February 2018.

834
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,722
[SPEAKER_16]: I went in 2016.

835
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,485
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've been doing it every other year just because it's a lot of

836
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,753
[SPEAKER_16]: planning ahead of time.

837
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:33,439
[SPEAKER_16]: This year for next time I'm going to try April just to try something a little different and not worry about the snow as much getting out of here.

838
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:46,048
[SPEAKER_16]: So what do you have the packet you have is my proposal that I put together based on the newer guidelines that the committee approved last year for the updated guidelines for the proposal.

839
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:48,610
[SPEAKER_16]: So basically

840
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:59,197
[SPEAKER_16]: What the trip entails is that Disney YES program is a youth education series program, and they have all sorts of courses, of course, being science, that's what I'm gearing towards.

841
01:09:00,037 --> 01:09:07,020
[SPEAKER_16]: And basically, the students go to about three-hour courses where it's all hands-on learning with different fields.

842
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:18,285
[SPEAKER_16]: So I tend to pick two of the different fields of physical science and zoology and wildlife conservation, and then the third one being leadership and teamwork.

843
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:27,617
[SPEAKER_16]: So throughout the course of the week, they go to these classes, and then they have some free time after that they can enjoy themselves and relax a little bit.

844
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:32,598
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, this will be my third time doing the trip.

845
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:40,540
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the packet, what you have is just some information about the youth education series, the programs that I am anticipating.

846
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,741
[SPEAKER_16]: They are pending approval from Disney, but I don't really see an issue because I usually

847
01:09:45,631 --> 01:09:48,532
[SPEAKER_16]: way ahead of the curve in applying and getting everything done.

848
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:58,376
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the reasons why I'm here today, and I appreciate you hearing me out today, is because I do like to give parents as much notice as possible to budget and save for the trip.

849
01:09:58,456 --> 01:10:01,518
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to get the ball rolling soon.

850
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:04,259
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll have my first student interest meeting next week.

851
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:09,900
[SPEAKER_16]: just to inform the students and give them a lot of this information, and then I'll have a parent meeting early February.

852
01:10:10,221 --> 01:10:14,663
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they can decide if it's something that's a right fit for them and their child.

853
01:10:14,863 --> 01:10:17,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if the sweat is subtle, but it does look like Mickey Mouse.

854
01:10:18,604 --> 01:10:18,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

855
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:19,525
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

856
01:10:21,246 --> 01:10:23,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I didn't want to embarrass you if it wasn't.

857
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:26,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I have lots of Disney clothes that I wear.

858
01:10:26,048 --> 01:10:26,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Cute.

859
01:10:33,043 --> 01:10:36,486
[SPEAKER_16]: So the last trip we just had this year, well, let me back up.

860
01:10:36,506 --> 01:10:39,008
[SPEAKER_16]: So 2016, we had 14 students go.

861
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:40,570
[SPEAKER_16]: This past year, in 2018, we had 27 go.

862
01:10:42,722 --> 01:10:44,023
[SPEAKER_16]: I put on here estimated 30.

863
01:10:44,164 --> 01:10:45,685
[SPEAKER_16]: I really can't predict.

864
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:49,849
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm guessing it's going to be at least the same amount as it was this past year.

865
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Traditionally in the past, I've taken juniors and seniors.

866
01:10:53,513 --> 01:10:56,676
[SPEAKER_16]: This year I am, for next year, I'm going to do 10 through 12.

867
01:10:56,736 --> 01:10:58,558
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to open it to the sophomores as well.

868
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:00,900
[SPEAKER_16]: So I anticipate that will probably bump the numbers.

869
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:06,666
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the chaperone number will be based on the total number of students that we have going on the trip.

870
01:11:08,414 --> 01:11:17,440
[SPEAKER_16]: What I also included for you was the estimated trip costs, which, again, I'm estimating because it's hard to know exactly between airfare, inflation.

871
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,182
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, unfortunately, they push the airfare up for vacation weeks.

872
01:11:22,563 --> 01:11:30,928
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I have included here is everything, and it does include the insurance, which is mandatory, and I would do that anyway, even if it wasn't suggested.

873
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:37,216
[SPEAKER_16]: As soon as I do the deposit, the insurance is the first thing that I put the policies in place for the students.

874
01:11:39,136 --> 01:11:44,737
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I also have listed what's not covered, and then my estimated dates for the parents.

875
01:11:45,577 --> 01:11:47,798
[SPEAKER_16]: I will give this document to the parents as well at that meeting.

876
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:56,299
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I printed out just four pages or two back-to-back of the insurance policy and the rider.

877
01:11:56,599 --> 01:12:00,940
[SPEAKER_16]: It's 11 pages long, so being an environmental science teacher, I couldn't really bear to print out 11 pages.

878
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:06,946
[SPEAKER_16]: So I did the first board which covers the nuts and bolts of it.

879
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:10,267
[SPEAKER_16]: The rest is the legal definitions and all that stuff on there.

880
01:12:12,407 --> 01:12:15,428
[SPEAKER_16]: And then these are the school rules that I used last time on the trip.

881
01:12:15,628 --> 01:12:20,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll look them over again before we go just to make sure it lines up with anything that might change in the handbook.

882
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:26,685
[SPEAKER_16]: that's in alignment with that time we go, but I just printed out the one that we used last time for this.

883
01:12:27,485 --> 01:12:30,147
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's pretty much the gist of what's in the packet for you.

884
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:30,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

885
01:12:30,907 --> 01:12:31,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

886
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

887
01:12:32,588 --> 01:12:35,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto, you got a motion on for approval?

888
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:37,312
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion to approval and to volunteer as a...

889
01:12:42,472 --> 01:12:43,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Chaperone.

890
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:44,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Chaperone.

891
01:12:44,254 --> 01:12:45,515
[SPEAKER_04]: At every trip.

892
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:46,776
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a second by Ms.

893
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:47,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot.

894
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

895
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:48,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone.

896
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:49,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

897
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:51,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot, do you have a dad on the line?

898
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:51,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

899
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:52,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

900
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:52,741
[SPEAKER_06]: McCracken?

901
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:52,841
Yes.

902
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:53,021
Ms.

903
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:54,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone, yes.

904
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:54,142
Ms.

905
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:54,562
[SPEAKER_06]: O'Neill, zero.

906
01:12:54,602 --> 01:12:54,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

907
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:54,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

908
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Moore, seven.

909
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:55,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a state.

910
01:12:55,643 --> 01:12:56,784
[SPEAKER_03]: On the field trip?

911
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:56,924
Yes.

912
01:12:59,507 --> 01:13:00,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.

913
01:13:00,447 --> 01:13:00,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do.

914
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:03,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a state.

915
01:13:06,693 --> 01:13:06,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

916
01:13:06,933 --> 01:13:07,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot?

917
01:13:07,594 --> 01:13:07,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

918
01:13:09,395 --> 01:13:12,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one abstain, motion passes.

919
01:13:12,918 --> 01:13:13,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

920
01:13:13,658 --> 01:13:13,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

921
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:14,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun.

922
01:13:18,463 --> 01:13:23,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Report on English language learners from Mr. Teixeira.

923
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:29,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

924
01:13:29,932 --> 01:13:30,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

925
01:13:40,356 --> 01:13:41,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need it just yet.

926
01:13:41,637 --> 01:13:43,359
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the tail end of this.

927
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:05,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe everyone has a copy of the report in your packet, so I'm not going to read it to you, but just to give you the high-level parts.

928
01:14:06,103 --> 01:14:15,647
[SPEAKER_00]: The CPR, the EL department is in compliance and is out of corrective action as of November 15th.

929
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:24,810
[SPEAKER_00]: For the McGlynn redesign update, as I said, I've been meeting with teachers to, you know, get their feedback.

930
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,953
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what improvements or changes need to be made.

931
01:14:29,454 --> 01:14:30,555
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on that.

932
01:14:30,635 --> 01:14:40,309
[SPEAKER_00]: We started a professional development program to help the co-teachers who are working with EL teachers that now have level one students in their classrooms.

933
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,531
[SPEAKER_00]: That's new for everyone.

934
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:56,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I've received the evaluations and I've received positive feedback on the program that's being put into place to support both the EL teachers and the science teachers and obviously the students.

935
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:01,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry?

936
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:02,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that with Lesley?

937
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:23,473
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a different, that was with, it's an organization, they're an EL consulting group called Confianza, and they specialize in working with English learners and co-teaching models, and it was actually perfect for what we brought to the McGlynn for our changes.

938
01:15:24,528 --> 01:15:28,570
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lesley University partnership is an internship partnership.

939
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:42,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lesley University has a program where teacher candidates can get their elementary certification as well as their EL certification in like a 15-month period.

940
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:42,958
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty intense.

941
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:53,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do a year-long internship with a duly certified EL and content teacher, elementary certified teacher.

942
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:57,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have one at the McGlynn and one at the Roberts.

943
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,197
[SPEAKER_00]: They work Monday through Friday.

944
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:01,718
[SPEAKER_00]: They started in August.

945
01:16:01,838 --> 01:16:02,879
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll finish in June.

946
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:06,001
[SPEAKER_00]: They take all of their classes after school hours.

947
01:16:06,281 --> 01:16:07,762
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the intense part.

948
01:16:09,223 --> 01:16:22,293
[SPEAKER_00]: But what works out really well is not only is it a benefit to those buildings and those schools having another person in, they get an educational experience that's, it's like coming in as a second year teacher in your first year.

949
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:23,554
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing.

950
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:33,402
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, you know, we'll continue that partnership next year and as numbers continue to grow, we can spread it into other buildings.

951
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,569
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently in the middle of our access testing.

952
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:45,377
[SPEAKER_00]: If all goes according to plan, we will be done by January 26th, which I think is the earliest we've ever been done in the district.

953
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:49,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology department, I have to give them credit.

954
01:16:49,722 --> 01:16:55,828
[SPEAKER_00]: They really busted to make sure that we got everything up and running.

955
01:16:56,228 --> 01:17:07,360
[SPEAKER_00]: The additional devices that have been purchased over the years also have contributed to us being able to decrease the number of days we're actually testing our students, and then we can get back to teaching them.

956
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:13,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did put on here 2018, last year's access data.

957
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:15,624
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the chart.

958
01:17:16,204 --> 01:17:20,505
[SPEAKER_00]: And in every single building, we either met or exceeded our targets.

959
01:17:21,605 --> 01:17:27,947
[SPEAKER_00]: DESE has a very complex system for establishing these targets, and they changed again for 2019.

960
01:17:29,087 --> 01:17:31,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what they'll look like next year.

961
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally like trying to hit a moving target.

962
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:43,392
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes from year to year, but just looking at the growth, that's kind of what I was focusing on.

963
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:48,153
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth in all of the buildings was incredible.

964
01:17:49,674 --> 01:17:53,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though at the middle school level we may have gone down, we still met the target.

965
01:17:54,516 --> 01:18:00,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be curious next year to see how this redesign of the middle school program will change that.

966
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:07,200
[SPEAKER_00]: We get these results in June, like last day of May, first day of June.

967
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,801
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't actually give us these targets.

968
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:12,744
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't get that till over the summer.

969
01:18:12,944 --> 01:18:14,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the summer, we'll get that.

970
01:18:14,425 --> 01:18:18,748
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll give you a similar report next year to see where that lands.

971
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions on any of this?

972
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:22,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

973
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:22,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Mestone.

974
01:18:24,352 --> 01:18:25,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a report.

975
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:33,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just explain to me how the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts all have taken the access test in 2017 and 2018, but not the Brooks?

976
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:35,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the N.A.

977
01:18:35,455 --> 01:18:43,398
[SPEAKER_00]: means that there's not a large enough population to get the data to make a target and submit the target.

978
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:45,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know the number that you need?

979
01:18:46,842 --> 01:18:57,251
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because the numbers are so small, it's statistically insignificant and the department doesn't actually give us any data for that.

980
01:18:58,252 --> 01:18:59,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do take it.

981
01:19:00,594 --> 01:19:12,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And the struggle that we have with the Brooks is because the newcomers program is first and second grade, which is now our larger population, their first year was last year.

982
01:19:14,452 --> 01:19:15,293
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 2018.

983
01:19:15,353 --> 01:19:16,074
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 2018.

984
01:19:16,214 --> 01:19:16,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

985
01:19:18,076 --> 01:19:30,911
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the other grade levels, there may only be five students in fifth grade, four students in fourth grade, and that's not enough data to actually put, to build the targets or to give us any

986
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:38,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that data, but I can look at individual students to see who's making progress and who's not making progress.

987
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:41,037
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something that we did at the beginning of this year.

988
01:19:41,758 --> 01:19:49,942
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the teachers received a progress monitoring form, regardless of whether it was the Brooks or the Roberts or the McGlynn.

989
01:19:50,882 --> 01:19:57,806
[SPEAKER_00]: They received a progress monitoring form for all the students who didn't make progress, all of the individual students who didn't make progress.

990
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:08,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Roberts has the newcomers for third, fourth, and fifth.

991
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:12,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And to place out of newcomers, they take the access test.

992
01:20:14,186 --> 01:20:15,266
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one factor.

993
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:16,046
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

994
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:23,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So then how do the children at the Columbus and the McGlynn take the access test?

995
01:20:23,128 --> 01:20:24,989
[SPEAKER_08]: They cannot be in the newcomers class.

996
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:26,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Access isn't just for newcomers.

997
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:30,910
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for any student who is currently listed as an English learner in the district.

998
01:20:31,663 --> 01:20:48,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so there's English learners in the Columbus and the McGlynn, but not newcomers programs, that are a significant amount of students that they can take the, they have the data to give you a MET target or a C target, but there's not the number at the Brooks.

999
01:20:48,946 --> 01:20:50,708
[SPEAKER_08]: That is English language learners.

1000
01:20:50,968 --> 01:20:55,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Of total population of English learners at the Brooks is not high enough.

1001
01:20:56,353 --> 01:21:03,319
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the first and second grade, which is our higher number, the students if they're first year?

1002
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:03,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1003
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,804
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, it's based on their growth from the previous year.

1004
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:16,410
[SPEAKER_00]: So those students can't be calculated into it, just like the students in the third grade at the Roberts can't be calculated into it.

1005
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:22,855
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are enough other students in grade three to get that statistical figure.

1006
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:26,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And because it's percents, I don't know the number of actual students.

1007
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:29,901
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you know, do the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts have

1008
01:21:30,243 --> 01:21:34,504
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty similar numbers of students who take the access test?

1009
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:36,565
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes.

1010
01:21:36,645 --> 01:21:50,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the McGlynn, the Roberts, Columbus, they're all anywhere from 75 to 90 students.

1011
01:21:52,488 --> 01:21:58,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously, kindergarten isn't included in this either, because that would be the first year, regardless of what building they're in.

1012
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1013
01:22:08,627 --> 01:22:09,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1014
01:22:10,348 --> 01:22:12,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe this will be covered in the report.

1015
01:22:12,749 --> 01:22:14,010
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see it here on the slide.

1016
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:18,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you give us like the top five languages spoken by percent, is that?

1017
01:22:19,445 --> 01:22:32,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not by percent, but I can tell you Portuguese is our number one language, followed by Haitian Creole, and then Spanish and Arabic are kind of tied neck and neck for third, and then everything else is, yeah.

1018
01:22:34,073 --> 01:22:36,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you give us a sense of how many students speak Arabic?

1019
01:22:37,734 --> 01:22:38,674
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to look it up.

1020
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:40,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be able to guess that.

1021
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:50,437
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why I ask is for the prior mentioned kindergarten affair might be if we have a large percentage of Arabic speakers it might be useful to have translators for them available as well.

1022
01:22:51,057 --> 01:22:54,278
[SPEAKER_14]: It's possible we could find someone in the community that would be willing to volunteer.

1023
01:22:56,447 --> 01:22:58,708
[SPEAKER_00]: With a registration process, I'm not quite sure.

1024
01:22:58,728 --> 01:22:59,348
[SPEAKER_14]: For kindergarten.

1025
01:22:59,368 --> 01:23:01,649
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not your, this is the prior presentation.

1026
01:23:01,929 --> 01:23:02,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1027
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:03,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

1028
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:07,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we know if we have many Arabic-speaking kindergarten students or first grade students?

1029
01:23:07,951 --> 01:23:11,492
[SPEAKER_00]: For incoming, I wouldn't be able to determine that number.

1030
01:23:11,592 --> 01:23:17,113
[SPEAKER_00]: But for kindergarten, I can figure out how many we have currently this year.

1031
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:20,074
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to venture a guess.

1032
01:23:20,614 --> 01:23:22,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you find that information out for us next time?

1033
01:23:22,295 --> 01:23:23,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it would be interesting for me.

1034
01:23:23,335 --> 01:23:23,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you speak to Ms.

1035
01:23:23,775 --> 01:23:25,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldwell if you feel there's a need?

1036
01:23:29,362 --> 01:23:40,680
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to our Arabic-speaking families, because most of our Arabic-speaking families are coming here for medical reasons, there's an organization called, I think it's International House,

1037
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always send translators with our Arabic-speaking families.

1038
01:23:45,343 --> 01:23:49,745
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare that we need to, for the registration process.

1039
01:23:50,306 --> 01:23:56,209
[SPEAKER_00]: The Parent Information Center has gotten to know many of the translators from this organization very well.

1040
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1041
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:11,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1042
01:24:11,123 --> 01:24:11,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostow.

1043
01:24:11,403 --> 01:24:18,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell us how many EL teachers you have at each of the four elementary schools?

1044
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:22,349
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hang on, let me just go down my list.

1045
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:30,573
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say, point of clarification, that not all schools carry the same amount of EL teachers because they don't carry the full program.

1046
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:48,460
[SPEAKER_08]: going or what I'm wondering is if the Roberts, the McGlynn, and the Columbus have more teachers, more resources, do children who are in the neighborhood of Brooks not go to the Brooks because there's more EL teachers at the Roberts, the Columbus, and the McGlynn?

1047
01:24:49,321 --> 01:24:52,984
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be a factor on which school the students go to.

1048
01:24:53,204 --> 01:24:54,886
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still based on their neighborhood.

1049
01:24:55,346 --> 01:24:59,870
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference would be for the newcomer students where we funnel them to

1050
01:25:00,655 --> 01:25:05,499
[SPEAKER_00]: The Brooks for grades one and two, and then the Roberts for grades three to five.

1051
01:25:05,719 --> 01:25:06,059
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1052
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you know, though, how many EL teachers are at each elementary?

1053
01:25:10,303 --> 01:25:25,616
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the newcomer program, so at the Brooks, grade one has a teacher, grade two has a teacher, and then there's a pull-out, what we call pull-out EL, and she services grades three through five.

1054
01:25:25,796 --> 01:25:27,317
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three teachers at the Brooks.

1055
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:28,398
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.

1056
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:30,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1057
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:30,673
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1058
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:37,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the McGlynn Elementary is all pullout.

1059
01:25:37,519 --> 01:25:52,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these figures are determined, I mean, the number of staff that we have in each building is determined not only by grade level, but we have service hours that we're required to provide to EL students based on their level.

1060
01:25:52,271 --> 01:25:52,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1061
01:25:54,272 --> 01:26:04,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Levels, you know three four and five students which require one to two periods a day depending upon their level So we have three teachers at the McGlynn elementary and they're all pull out and they're all pull out.

1062
01:26:04,877 --> 01:26:05,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and

1063
01:26:06,865 --> 01:26:18,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at Columbus Elementary, we have three, same setup, three teachers, and same setup as the McGlynn, where they're mostly levels three, four, or five students.

1064
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:24,838
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Roberts, we have one dedicated teacher per grade level, grade three, four, and five.

1065
01:26:25,879 --> 01:26:30,262
[SPEAKER_00]: For the newcomers program, one teacher in each grade level, and two pull-out teachers.

1066
01:26:31,238 --> 01:26:33,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So three newcomers, two pull-outs.

1067
01:26:33,283 --> 01:26:33,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Pull-outs, right.

1068
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:34,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1069
01:26:34,525 --> 01:26:35,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

1070
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:39,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will look like, well, the Roberts has five teachers, but three of those grade levels are for newcomers.

1071
01:26:39,896 --> 01:26:40,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1072
01:26:40,257 --> 01:26:40,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1073
01:26:41,019 --> 01:26:41,319
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1074
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:41,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1075
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:48,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion?

1076
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:50,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you still have a presentation.

1077
01:26:50,363 --> 01:26:50,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1078
01:26:50,984 --> 01:26:53,466
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just put together this PowerPoint.

1079
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:57,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did it for my department and thought you might find this interesting.

1080
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:02,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is on a federal level.

1081
01:27:02,353 --> 01:27:04,495
[SPEAKER_00]: There are almost 5 million English learners.

1082
01:27:05,015 --> 01:27:07,437
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from data from 2014 to 15.

1083
01:27:08,318 --> 01:27:12,922
[SPEAKER_00]: But English learners are the fastest growing population of students in grades K through 12.

1084
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:20,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationwide, about 10% of the population are English learners.

1085
01:27:21,788 --> 01:27:24,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this is what it looks like on the state level.

1086
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:29,914
[SPEAKER_00]: So the graph on the top shows the total number of students in K to 12 schools.

1087
01:27:30,314 --> 01:27:34,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see it was going up from 2012, and it peaked in 2015.

1088
01:27:35,038 --> 01:27:43,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And something happened in 2016 where the overall numbers just dropped for total enrollment.

1089
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:47,050
[SPEAKER_00]: in public schools, so I'm guessing baby boom years or something.

1090
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:53,357
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's on a steady, now it's going up from 2016, it's on the rise again.

1091
01:27:53,898 --> 01:28:00,126
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the percentage, the graph on the left, the percentage of English learners in Massachusetts public schools,

1092
01:28:01,102 --> 01:28:03,602
[SPEAKER_00]: The line has steadily been going up.

1093
01:28:03,762 --> 01:28:14,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So Medford is reflective of what's happening in the country at large in terms of being the fastest growing population of students, school-age students in public schools.

1094
01:28:16,285 --> 01:28:19,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the state, we have about 100,000 English learners.

1095
01:28:22,026 --> 01:28:24,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's Medford's data.

1096
01:28:25,686 --> 01:28:26,406
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about 11%.

1097
01:28:27,347 --> 01:28:29,447
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little bit higher than the state average.

1098
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:33,471
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the federal average.

1099
01:28:34,931 --> 01:28:47,074
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of this, which was I think October, we had 456 students currently receiving English learner services, in addition to 235 students who are what we call fell students.

1100
01:28:47,094 --> 01:28:49,095
[SPEAKER_00]: These are former English learner students.

1101
01:28:50,355 --> 01:28:57,137
[SPEAKER_00]: After a student is exited from an English learner program, we monitor them for a four-year period, just to make sure that

1102
01:28:58,783 --> 01:28:59,604
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing's come up.

1103
01:29:00,766 --> 01:29:07,434
[SPEAKER_00]: With our younger students who are learning to read, you know, sometimes it's like, oh, yeah, they're proficient, and the data shows it.

1104
01:29:07,494 --> 01:29:08,615
[SPEAKER_00]: The access test shows it.

1105
01:29:08,655 --> 01:29:10,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Their class, you know, their classwork shows it.

1106
01:29:11,038 --> 01:29:15,664
[SPEAKER_00]: We might find out, oh, no, they still need some support, so we can bring them back into the fold.

1107
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:29,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this, again, talking about trying to hit moving targets in terms of trying to figure out what our numbers are and where they're going.

1108
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:33,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot going on on this slide, so I'll try to explain it best.

1109
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:36,825
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, we have it broken down by elementary, middle, and high school.

1110
01:29:37,225 --> 01:29:40,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to focus on the total ELs in the district.

1111
01:29:40,988 --> 01:29:44,331
[SPEAKER_00]: But I use October as my...

1112
01:29:45,585 --> 01:29:49,187
[SPEAKER_00]: moment in time, because that's when we submit our October SIMS.

1113
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:55,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first band, the dark orange color, was October 2017.

1114
01:29:55,510 --> 01:30:00,513
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had 403 students.

1115
01:30:00,553 --> 01:30:02,594
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we started the year with last year.

1116
01:30:03,495 --> 01:30:07,077
[SPEAKER_00]: By June, we had 487 English learners.

1117
01:30:07,457 --> 01:30:10,639
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our increase from October.

1118
01:30:10,659 --> 01:30:11,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that again.

1119
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:11,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, those numbers.

1120
01:30:12,099 --> 01:30:12,820
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 487.

1121
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And what was the prior number?

1122
01:30:15,975 --> 01:30:16,055
[SPEAKER_00]: 403.

1123
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:16,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1124
01:30:17,596 --> 01:30:21,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're constantly testing students throughout the school year.

1125
01:30:21,799 --> 01:30:23,640
[SPEAKER_00]: We're constantly adding students.

1126
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Our numbers are growing.

1127
01:30:25,661 --> 01:30:28,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our number in June was 487.

1128
01:30:28,644 --> 01:30:38,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Now through, you know, at the high school, obviously 12th grade students when they leave, any students that we reclassify as a FAL, a former English learner, they come out.

1129
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:42,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we're still monitoring them, they're not actively receiving the EL services.

1130
01:30:43,594 --> 01:30:48,839
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the following October, we started the year with 456 students.

1131
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:57,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I use that October moment in time as my gauge, we're increasing about 20% each year.

1132
01:30:57,406 --> 01:31:07,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions on this?

1133
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:09,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1134
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,793
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall population?

1135
01:31:25,554 --> 01:31:28,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been collecting that data.

1136
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:39,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I've only been looking at the English.

1137
01:31:39,881 --> 01:31:43,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't looked at total numbers, so I can't comment on that.

1138
01:31:46,552 --> 01:31:47,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1139
01:31:47,572 --> 01:31:51,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

1140
01:31:51,134 --> 01:31:52,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Placed it on file.

1141
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:55,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1142
01:31:56,035 --> 01:31:56,796
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1143
01:31:56,816 --> 01:31:58,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was the second?

1144
01:31:58,436 --> 01:31:59,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Russo.

1145
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:00,097
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1146
01:32:00,717 --> 01:32:01,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1147
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:02,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1148
01:32:04,798 --> 01:32:06,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow-up report on obesity numbers.

1149
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

1150
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:09,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1151
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:14,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So last month, I presented information about a donation from Hallmark Health.

1152
01:32:15,861 --> 01:32:18,943
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're using to fund a grade four fitness program.

1153
01:32:19,063 --> 01:32:25,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And the committee requested additional information about our mandated screenings for growth.

1154
01:32:26,027 --> 01:32:37,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, the two tables that you have show the data from the 2018 end of the year status report that's given to the Department of Public Health.

1155
01:32:38,015 --> 01:32:44,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see from the report that for children that are categorized as in the overweight category, that's

1156
01:32:45,673 --> 01:32:47,533
[SPEAKER_02]: a BMI between 85 and 95%.

1157
01:32:50,494 --> 01:32:57,135
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a short burst increase in around grade four, and then their growth steadily declines.

1158
01:32:57,215 --> 01:33:00,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's very consistent with the normal growth pattern of children.

1159
01:33:02,396 --> 01:33:12,998
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did notice is that students that start out at a young age, categorized in the obese category, a BMI over 95%, their growth trajectory

1160
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: just continues on a steady increase through grade 10.

1161
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:41,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So we say there's reason for schools to offer physical fitness programs and to encourage the adoption of healthy, long-lasting health habits and physical fitness, which we do through our recess programs, our health ed and physical education programs that we offer in the district.

1162
01:33:43,771 --> 01:33:49,052
[SPEAKER_02]: One new, actually I have some flyers to pass out.

1163
01:33:52,213 --> 01:33:59,594
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new community partnership with the Malden YMCA.

1164
01:34:01,515 --> 01:34:06,736
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sponsoring a healthy living program for families.

1165
01:34:07,696 --> 01:34:13,157
[SPEAKER_02]: The Malden YMCA is now the parent organization for the

1166
01:34:13,812 --> 01:34:15,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Boys and Girls Club.

1167
01:34:16,092 --> 01:34:23,654
[SPEAKER_02]: This program is offered to Medford residents, and it's a 25-session course.

1168
01:34:23,754 --> 01:34:33,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for families to attend together, and it marries physical education with nutrition, meal planning, and healthy eating habits.

1169
01:34:34,076 --> 01:34:41,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have advertised the program on our website and made information available in all the school nurses' offices.

1170
01:34:42,537 --> 01:34:47,342
[SPEAKER_02]: all families can be informed about this and take advantage of the opportunity.

1171
01:34:55,229 --> 01:34:57,050
[SPEAKER_14]: These statistics are really concerning to me.

1172
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,192
[SPEAKER_14]: These aren't unique to Medford, of course.

1173
01:34:59,572 --> 01:35:00,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.

1174
01:35:00,672 --> 01:35:01,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at an epidemic.

1175
01:35:01,973 --> 01:35:04,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they're reflective of the United States.

1176
01:35:05,295 --> 01:35:05,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1177
01:35:05,656 --> 01:35:12,460
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking at an epidemic of obesity in this country, which have, as everyone here I'm sure knows, has long-lasting health effects.

1178
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:24,127
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to suggest to the committee that we create a community of the whole when possible, perhaps whenever you think we could put together something to see how we could tackle this problem.

1179
01:35:25,248 --> 01:35:31,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps we could welcome in some experts in childhood obesity to speak with us.

1180
01:35:32,175 --> 01:35:39,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there have to be some schools in America that are beginning to figure this problem out.

1181
01:35:40,062 --> 01:35:40,883
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't do nothing.

1182
01:35:42,745 --> 01:35:47,890
[SPEAKER_14]: For children to have these issues going forward, they might have health issues the rest of their life.

1183
01:35:50,365 --> 01:35:51,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we're doing nothing.

1184
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look for people to come speak.

1185
01:35:59,793 --> 01:36:09,261
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple programs through Children's Hospital that we can certainly approach the organizers of.

1186
01:36:10,558 --> 01:36:11,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I want to clarify.

1187
01:36:11,318 --> 01:36:13,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mean to imply that you're not doing anything.

1188
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:14,779
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the wrong idea.

1189
01:36:15,319 --> 01:36:20,920
[SPEAKER_14]: This statistic is deeply frustrating to me, because I know how this can affect children as a prior educator myself.

1190
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:29,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also know the health outcomes that children with this condition, once those fat cells are in there, they have to fight them their whole life.

1191
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:33,402
[SPEAKER_14]: So I really hope that we could do that.

1192
01:36:33,422 --> 01:36:35,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking for a second on the motion, if possible.

1193
01:36:37,383 --> 01:36:37,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

1194
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:51,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to repeat the motion, the motion is to have a committee of the whole to address what policies we can put in place to tackle the obesity epidemic in our district.

1195
01:36:55,652 --> 01:36:58,174
[SPEAKER_06]: The date, we can all triangulate the date together.

1196
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:12,822
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we have a nutrition subcommittee.

1197
01:37:12,902 --> 01:37:14,882
[SPEAKER_14]: The curriculum would be the closest I can think of.

1198
01:37:14,942 --> 01:37:18,583
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it would be best served if we were all there to talk about this issue.

1199
01:37:18,604 --> 01:37:23,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we're looking at almost 300 kids that are either overweight or obese.

1200
01:37:24,025 --> 01:37:26,886
[SPEAKER_14]: And the obesity rates, we're looking at like 250 kids here.

1201
01:37:27,446 --> 01:37:29,607
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's just my back of the envelope calculation.

1202
01:37:29,627 --> 01:37:31,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a scary statistic.

1203
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,663
[SPEAKER_14]: The health outcomes of these children are severe.

1204
01:37:37,063 --> 01:37:44,172
[SPEAKER_14]: And whatever kind of solutions we have to think of outside of the box, welcome in other committees that maybe have some ideas.

1205
01:37:45,013 --> 01:37:52,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope that we as a committee can at least begin to think outside the box on this one, because America is, we're having trouble.

1206
01:37:53,766 --> 01:38:04,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the motion on the floor that this paper be sent to Committee of the Whole to explore options and policies, which is school committee purview policies, in this arena.

1207
01:38:04,955 --> 01:38:05,755
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1208
01:38:06,296 --> 01:38:06,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1209
01:38:06,996 --> 01:38:07,737
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1210
01:38:09,178 --> 01:38:09,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1211
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:11,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1212
01:38:12,221 --> 01:38:15,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1213
01:38:16,184 --> 01:38:18,906
[SPEAKER_08]: For grade 10, there's 104 males that were screened and 114 females.

1214
01:38:23,529 --> 01:38:27,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the grade 10 class is more around the 300 number.

1215
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:29,912
[SPEAKER_08]: So was it optional if the kids were screened?

1216
01:38:30,433 --> 01:38:33,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Some students and some families do opt out.

1217
01:38:33,714 --> 01:38:34,034
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1218
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:39,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So would you say you had 100 students opt out, or is it just a sampling?

1219
01:38:40,298 --> 01:38:42,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't dig that far into that.

1220
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:47,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I purely looked at the number of students that we screened that year.

1221
01:38:49,122 --> 01:38:51,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It's likely some students may have opted out.

1222
01:38:54,343 --> 01:38:55,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Some families may have opted out.

1223
01:38:55,664 --> 01:38:57,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have missed some absentee students.

1224
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the information.

1225
01:39:02,249 --> 01:39:07,773
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm just wondering, would people who are suffering with obesity opt out?

1226
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Would the numbers be worse?

1227
01:39:09,214 --> 01:39:09,655
[SPEAKER_02]: They may.

1228
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:10,215
[SPEAKER_02]: They may.

1229
01:39:10,295 --> 01:39:23,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And since the initiation of the Affordable Care Act, more and more students are receiving primary care through a pediatrician or a family physician.

1230
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Growth monitoring is part of that.

1231
01:39:27,864 --> 01:39:39,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So families that are taking advantage of a yearly physical are receiving that monitoring and those types of education through their primary care physician.

1232
01:39:41,318 --> 01:39:41,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1233
01:39:42,419 --> 01:39:42,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1234
01:39:46,922 --> 01:39:50,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Informational report on Attorney General's PTO webinar.

1235
01:39:50,665 --> 01:39:50,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1236
01:39:50,805 --> 01:39:51,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Patterson.

1237
01:40:08,074 --> 01:40:14,975
[SPEAKER_19]: This information session has been drafted and shared by the Attorney General's Office.

1238
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:24,577
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have just submitted the link and information to be posted within the blog and the Medford website.

1239
01:40:24,697 --> 01:40:28,277
[SPEAKER_19]: So you'll have access to click on that and sign up and enroll.

1240
01:40:28,838 --> 01:40:35,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Additionally, they will have a community engagement segment of additional webinars that will be accessible.

1241
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:36,899
[SPEAKER_19]: And they are all for free.

1242
01:40:37,403 --> 01:40:44,004
[SPEAKER_19]: You just have to access them from your computer screen and register in order to connect on that link.

1243
01:40:44,464 --> 01:40:46,945
[SPEAKER_19]: So they did change the time frame slightly.

1244
01:40:47,325 --> 01:40:50,665
[SPEAKER_19]: It's January 22nd at 1030 AM.

1245
01:40:51,205 --> 01:40:58,087
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, this is the first segment of the nonprofit and public charities board member training.

1246
01:40:58,527 --> 01:41:04,728
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are encouraging all of our PTO groups, anybody that's looking to formalize a 501c3,

1247
01:41:06,262 --> 01:41:16,325
[SPEAKER_19]: or additional group as part of the participation and verification of your commitment to Medford Public Schools in any of those capacities.

1248
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:22,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, reminding those board members to register with the superintendent's office.

1249
01:41:22,788 --> 01:41:26,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Emily Lazzaro is taking all of that information in.

1250
01:41:27,489 --> 01:41:31,691
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, the training date that will be posted is Wednesday at 10.30 a.m.

1251
01:41:37,013 --> 01:41:38,354
[SPEAKER_19]: The 22nd of January.

1252
01:41:41,756 --> 01:41:46,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this is from the AG's office, so they might have put the wrong day.

1253
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:57,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so they must have put the wrong date on their segment, so I can let them know they have the wrong... So it's January 27th.

1254
01:41:57,545 --> 01:42:00,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Either the date or day listed.

1255
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:01,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, yep.

1256
01:42:04,754 --> 01:42:05,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

1257
01:42:06,735 --> 01:42:31,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we reached out to our 5013Cs, our PTOs, our friends of, and told, informed them that they are required to register with the Medford Public Schools in order to utilize and fundraise using our... So again, we don't have all of their direct contact information and that's the purpose of gathering it at this point in time.

1258
01:42:31,546 --> 01:42:32,226
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have

1259
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:37,182
[SPEAKER_19]: They are the information that was identified through the AG's office.

1260
01:42:37,642 --> 01:42:47,205
[SPEAKER_19]: We are looking at this format to become a formalized process that they are encouraged to take part in and to register themselves.

1261
01:42:47,265 --> 01:42:55,628
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a self-reporting function at this point in time because, again, we don't know necessarily what name they have registered under.

1262
01:42:56,188 --> 01:42:58,969
[SPEAKER_19]: It could be Medford Public Schools, the Brooks.

1263
01:42:59,089 --> 01:42:59,849
[SPEAKER_19]: It could be a Brooks.

1264
01:43:01,693 --> 01:43:03,514
[SPEAKER_19]: combination there too.

1265
01:43:03,674 --> 01:43:11,340
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are requesting that all of our community members are addressing and coming forward to us.

1266
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:19,806
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of just realizing who could be part of Medford, that's what we have engaged in at this point in time.

1267
01:43:20,967 --> 01:43:29,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, what this committee voted was that it was mandatory for all, and it shouldn't say PTO training update, it should be

1268
01:43:30,683 --> 01:43:35,645
[SPEAKER_04]: 5013C, PTO, and Friends Of, because it's not that one small group.

1269
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:44,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do, and I think our principals know a lot about who's raising money in these groups.

1270
01:43:45,048 --> 01:43:59,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And we should be reaching out to contact them that they have a deadline to register with our online program through Emily, because a lot of them haven't, that I've talked to recently, haven't heard that they're supposed to do this.

1271
01:44:00,017 --> 01:44:12,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we need to do more because it was mandated by this body that it was a mandatory, it wasn't volunteer.

1272
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And I keep hearing that at updates and stuff.

1273
01:44:15,341 --> 01:44:16,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not voluntary.

1274
01:44:16,901 --> 01:44:25,103
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to do business and raise money using Medford Public Schools or students of Medford Public Schools in any way, shape, or form, you are to be

1275
01:44:25,734 --> 01:44:33,237
[SPEAKER_04]: listed with us who is on your bank accounts, who is the president of your group, who is the contact person, and what their phone number.

1276
01:44:33,257 --> 01:44:34,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Janine.

1277
01:44:34,217 --> 01:44:34,797
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is different.

1278
01:44:34,938 --> 01:44:36,158
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a training session.

1279
01:44:36,618 --> 01:44:43,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand, but the deadlines, they go hand in hand, and the deadline for that is soon, February 1st.

1280
01:44:44,521 --> 01:44:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we haven't started reaching out to them, we need to.

1281
01:44:47,802 --> 01:44:50,303
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something I'm going to follow up on.

1282
01:44:51,084 --> 01:44:54,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people I have talked to haven't heard anything yet.

1283
01:44:55,472 --> 01:44:59,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how extensive it goes to.

1284
01:44:59,853 --> 01:45:04,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know that we need to take action and move forward.

1285
01:45:04,935 --> 01:45:08,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mandated by this body, and I want to see movement.

1286
01:45:08,416 --> 01:45:16,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do know that there's supposed to be an update to us mid to late February as to how many people who have signed up.

1287
01:45:16,938 --> 01:45:23,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Member DiBenedetto, we do have it down for February to present the status of the information that we have for 501c3s.

1288
01:45:25,209 --> 01:45:31,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and the groups I have talked to haven't even been informed that they're supposed to have this information to the school district as of yet.

1289
01:45:31,453 --> 01:45:47,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the piece I'm concerned about at this point, because we're halfway through January, and they have a February 1st enrollment, and if they're not even aware they're supposed to, they have to pull those documents while they're doing their taxes for their 5013Cs.

1290
01:45:47,865 --> 01:45:51,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we gave it this deadline and this timeline.

1291
01:45:54,238 --> 01:46:00,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope that we can make this a priority in the next few weeks so that way we have that.

1292
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:01,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1293
01:46:01,861 --> 01:46:01,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1294
01:46:02,601 --> 01:46:02,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1295
01:46:02,801 --> 01:46:03,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Kurtz.

1296
01:46:03,241 --> 01:46:03,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1297
01:46:03,601 --> 01:46:04,361
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had a question.

1298
01:46:05,162 --> 01:46:13,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Is the webinar going to be recorded so that members could watch it at their convenience at another time if they're unavailable at 10.30 a.m.? ?

1299
01:46:15,061 --> 01:46:17,803
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this is a function of the Attorney General's office.

1300
01:46:17,843 --> 01:46:19,384
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not Medford.

1301
01:46:20,005 --> 01:46:22,967
[SPEAKER_19]: This is them creating this webinar.

1302
01:46:23,287 --> 01:46:28,511
[SPEAKER_19]: And their intent is to have live engagement, question and answer timeline.

1303
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:31,934
[SPEAKER_19]: So it is right now slated.

1304
01:46:31,994 --> 01:46:35,437
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the date and time.

1305
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:38,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1306
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:38,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Van Kloot.

1307
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:39,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1308
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:57,419
[SPEAKER_11]: To follow up on that, I would like to ask to reach out back to the Attorney General's office and ask them to, in fact, record it so that somebody who's interested but who cannot go at 10.30, I mean, who cannot be in front of a computer screen at 10.30 on January 22nd

1309
01:46:59,223 --> 01:47:02,045
[SPEAKER_11]: could watch it that evening or watch it sometime other to the week.

1310
01:47:02,946 --> 01:47:17,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I would really ask if you would go back and at least give them that suggestion and plea because it just seems that, you know, it's just not real to sort of say, oh, everybody, you've got to be available at this time, you know, to do this thing.

1311
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:20,721
[SPEAKER_19]: I would certainly inquire on that.

1312
01:47:20,781 --> 01:47:25,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, their intent was to have it engaging and to have a real

1313
01:47:26,422 --> 01:47:30,926
[SPEAKER_19]: real-time feedback, a question and answer, and to really engage.

1314
01:47:31,006 --> 01:47:35,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone who's watching other people engage actively could learn a great deal.

1315
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:41,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe we could put a quick letter together from the Medford School Committee asking that they would please

1316
01:47:43,113 --> 01:47:49,657
[SPEAKER_11]: tape it and have it available at other times for people who can't make it.

1317
01:47:50,537 --> 01:48:00,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought this was actually a pilot training, so you wouldn't want to record the pilot training, in which case the trainers don't really know what they're doing and people are asking questions off topic.

1318
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:04,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't this a pilot training?

1319
01:48:04,219 --> 01:48:07,261
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the first time that this particular training is going out, yes.

1320
01:48:07,361 --> 01:48:08,842
[SPEAKER_19]: That's their intent.

1321
01:48:09,022 --> 01:48:16,967
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I can certainly reach out and request and or make that suggestion.

1322
01:48:17,327 --> 01:48:25,332
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, however, this is a totally separate department and entity and not subject to our initial request.

1323
01:48:25,372 --> 01:48:27,413
[SPEAKER_19]: But I can certainly make that suggestion.

1324
01:48:27,433 --> 01:48:28,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1325
01:48:28,374 --> 01:48:28,574
[SPEAKER_06]: All set?

1326
01:48:31,272 --> 01:48:33,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is there a motion to accept this report?

1327
01:48:34,653 --> 01:48:37,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Moved by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1328
01:48:37,773 --> 01:48:38,393
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1329
01:48:38,413 --> 01:48:38,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1330
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:39,693
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1331
01:48:39,733 --> 01:48:40,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1332
01:48:40,414 --> 01:48:40,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1333
01:48:43,674 --> 01:48:45,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Report on high school heating.

1334
01:48:45,274 --> 01:48:48,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. McLaughlin or... Yes, he's here.

1335
01:48:53,576 --> 01:48:56,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Here he comes.

1336
01:48:58,357 --> 01:48:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Mr. McLaughlin.

1337
01:49:02,481 --> 01:49:05,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, superintendent, school committee.

1338
01:49:07,328 --> 01:49:08,870
[SPEAKER_15]: You've had a chance to read the report.

1339
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:10,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any questions that I can answer?

1340
01:49:10,532 --> 01:49:17,601
[SPEAKER_06]: The theater, you've done all that work, so now the theater has heat.

1341
01:49:22,516 --> 01:49:25,478
[SPEAKER_15]: We got the theater running again.

1342
01:49:25,778 --> 01:49:31,503
[SPEAKER_15]: The coil had to be replaced, custom-made coil, very expensive.

1343
01:49:32,123 --> 01:49:32,884
[SPEAKER_15]: It's running again.

1344
01:49:33,584 --> 01:49:34,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it's too hot.

1345
01:49:36,462 --> 01:49:44,487
[SPEAKER_15]: They asked me to turn it off the other night so but we didn't because somebody has to go out onto the roof So we're right in the process.

1346
01:49:44,527 --> 01:49:54,833
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the electrician coming He's gonna set up a thermostat in the back so that we can regulate it a little bit better so if people are feeling uncomfortable we can start to turn it down, but

1347
01:49:55,837 --> 01:50:03,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, in some of the areas, the pneumatics that we have, they just don't operate properly.

1348
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:13,503
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've been taking the time to try to figure out ways that we could just use what we have left to make it operational.

1349
01:50:16,144 --> 01:50:16,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1350
01:50:16,364 --> 01:50:18,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Kreatz?

1351
01:50:18,485 --> 01:50:20,365
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to know, because I read the report.

1352
01:50:21,286 --> 01:50:23,707
[SPEAKER_18]: So it mentions in the report that

1353
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:30,083
[SPEAKER_18]: We got the chart with what the minimum heat guidelines are for offices.

1354
01:50:30,183 --> 01:50:38,989
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wanted to know, are there any classrooms or buildings that are so cold that the students and teachers have to wear their coats?

1355
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:40,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I've heard that.

1356
01:50:41,191 --> 01:50:44,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, part of this report, we talk a little bit about the vocational school.

1357
01:50:45,134 --> 01:50:52,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, this year has been a very tricky year in the vocational school with the pipes, because every time a pipe breaks,

1358
01:50:53,776 --> 01:51:01,138
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to shut the system down, stop the heat for the day, fix the pipe, then refill the system again.

1359
01:51:01,638 --> 01:51:04,859
[SPEAKER_15]: So there has been some instances where it's been cold.

1360
01:51:04,919 --> 01:51:06,480
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been cold in some of the classrooms.

1361
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:08,601
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been very good in understanding.

1362
01:51:08,861 --> 01:51:10,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody understands it's an old building.

1363
01:51:11,101 --> 01:51:16,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody realizes that we're working as fast and as hard as we can to get it back online.

1364
01:51:19,984 --> 01:51:21,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week, for instance, it broke again.

1365
01:51:24,099 --> 01:51:27,287
[SPEAKER_15]: It was breaking up by the electrical shop for a couple of times.

1366
01:51:27,307 --> 01:51:30,635
[SPEAKER_15]: So we kept replacing 10 feet of pipe at a time, 10 feet of pipe at a time.

1367
01:51:31,228 --> 01:51:33,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Then it started to break a little bit near the Cosmo Shop.

1368
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:35,531
[SPEAKER_15]: So that happened for a couple of days.

1369
01:51:36,092 --> 01:51:41,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, today was a very cold day, and it seemed to be holding its own pretty well.

1370
01:51:41,796 --> 01:51:46,900
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can, you know, knock on wood, cross our fingers that, you know, we can get through the rest of it.

1371
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:52,764
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think we all know Medford High School and what Medford High School needs in the end game.

1372
01:51:55,173 --> 01:51:56,854
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks very nice when you walk in.

1373
01:51:57,294 --> 01:51:57,954
[SPEAKER_15]: It's clean.

1374
01:51:58,274 --> 01:51:59,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything's clean.

1375
01:51:59,175 --> 01:52:04,877
[SPEAKER_15]: But I always say it's like the person that never smokes that has a heart attack.

1376
01:52:05,417 --> 01:52:05,997
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

1377
01:52:06,857 --> 01:52:11,899
[SPEAKER_15]: The inside of the building, the decor, it's due.

1378
01:52:12,019 --> 01:52:13,300
[SPEAKER_15]: It's due for replacement.

1379
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:14,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Things like that happen.

1380
01:52:15,137 --> 01:52:22,261
[SPEAKER_08]: When you say you had to replace 10 feet of pipes, is it a plumbing subcontractor?

1381
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:22,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1382
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:31,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you ask, so we are not playing catch up with classrooms every winter, what would the cost be to replace?

1383
01:52:31,746 --> 01:52:32,146
[SPEAKER_15]: All of it.

1384
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:34,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I can certainly ask.

1385
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:35,631
[SPEAKER_15]: It'd be substantial.

1386
01:52:36,311 --> 01:52:37,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Very substantial.

1387
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:39,253
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a capital improvement.

1388
01:52:39,273 --> 01:52:42,094
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a major capital improvement.

1389
01:52:42,354 --> 01:52:43,955
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least we have a number to start with.

1390
01:52:44,555 --> 01:52:45,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's every year.

1391
01:52:45,795 --> 01:52:47,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is only my third year.

1392
01:52:47,176 --> 01:52:51,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And every year, parents talk about whether their kids are freezing or too hot.

1393
01:52:51,818 --> 01:52:54,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't we just bite the bullet somehow in planning?

1394
01:52:54,339 --> 01:52:56,380
[SPEAKER_08]: At least if we have a number, we know what we're aiming for.

1395
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1396
01:52:59,421 --> 01:52:59,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Big number.

1397
01:53:01,182 --> 01:53:02,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to hear it.

1398
01:53:05,036 --> 01:53:06,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Russo.

1399
01:53:06,657 --> 01:53:07,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the heat.

1400
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:10,680
[SPEAKER_13]: It was lovely on Thursday and Saturday night.

1401
01:53:10,961 --> 01:53:12,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Were you in the theater?

1402
01:53:12,162 --> 01:53:13,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I was.

1403
01:53:13,362 --> 01:53:20,828
[SPEAKER_13]: I sat at the very top because it was sold out practically, or it was sold out, and it was so hot.

1404
01:53:20,848 --> 01:53:23,650
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking about one year prior for the inauguration.

1405
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:24,771
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so cold.

1406
01:53:25,332 --> 01:53:26,573
[SPEAKER_13]: I was joking with people that

1407
01:53:27,196 --> 01:53:29,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't complain about the heat in here right now.

1408
01:53:29,638 --> 01:53:32,200
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to let it be warm for a while before we complain.

1409
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:35,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, like I said, we have the electrician coming and he's just waiting for the pot.

1410
01:53:35,282 --> 01:53:42,187
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to put a little, like a thermostat down below where we can, so we don't have to normally to regulate the heat in the theater.

1411
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:52,027
[SPEAKER_15]: for the past few years would have to go out on the roof, go into the penthouse, and shut the disconnect off, which is, you know, then somebody goes out in the penthouse, shuts the disconnect off.

1412
01:53:52,467 --> 01:53:53,288
[SPEAKER_15]: It's late at night.

1413
01:53:53,808 --> 01:53:58,631
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't expect them heading back out there again on the roof and the dock to turn it back on.

1414
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:00,913
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and the same thing sort of happens in the gym.

1415
01:54:01,754 --> 01:54:06,277
