1
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,849
The meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:28,850
The Secretary will call the roll.

3
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,810
Mr. Benjamin?

4
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,310
I'm present.

5
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,211
Mrs. Kratz?

6
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,551
Here.

7
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:33,631
Mr. Stone?

8
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:33,832
Here.

9
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,712
Mr. Ritchie?

10
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:35,432
Here.

11
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:35,632
Present.

12
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:36,593
Mr. Newsom?

13
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:37,293
Present.

14
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,593
Mrs. Vanden Heuvel?

15
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:39,194
Present.

16
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,014
Van Buren?

17
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:40,714
Present.

18
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,055
Seven present, none absent.

19
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:43,595
All please rise and salute our flag.

20
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:50,758
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

21
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,462
One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:10,947
Before we move to the approval of the minutes, we are at the start of our school year, of our calendar year, and we need to nominate a new secretary and vice chair of the school committee.

23
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:17,429
At this point in time, I'd like to open up nominations for the vice chair of the Medford School Committee for the calendar year 19.

24
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:22,504
There's a nomination for Kathy Kretz.

25
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,805
Is there any other nominations that you'd like to put in?

26
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:25,946
No?

27
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,707
There's a second on the floor by Ms.

28
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:28,288
Van de Kloet.

29
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:31,610
I'll close that portion of the nominations.

30
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,311
Roll call vote, please.

31
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:35,572

32
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:37,053
Mrs. Kretz, yes.

33
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,554
Mrs. DeSouza, yes.

34
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:40,015
Mr. Materi, yes.

35
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,340
Kathy Kretz.

36
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,101
Unanimous vote.

37
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:00,564
Kathy Kretz, our new Vice Chair of the Medford School Committee.

38
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:01,304
Yay, Kathy!

39
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:10,171
And now at this time we would like to open up nominations for the Secretary of the Medford School Committee for 2019.

40
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:13,794
Is there a name you'd like to put in nomination?

41
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:16,312
Ms.

42
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,133
Kretz nominates Miyama Stone.

43
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:20,194
This is second on the floor by Ms.

44
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:20,654
VanDekloot.

45
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,095
Any other names for nomination?

46
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:26,257
Hearing and seeing none, I'll close that portion of the nominations.

47
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:27,518
Roll call vote please.

48
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:28,618
Ms.

49
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,379
DeVetta, Miyama Stone.

50
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,460
Ms.

51
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,001
Kretz, Miyama Stone.

52
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:34,221
Ms.

53
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:36,623
DeVetta, Miyama Stone.

54
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:37,483
Ms.

55
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:43,066
VanDekloot, Miyama Stone.

56
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,974
Mia Mustone, unanimous vote.

57
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,834
Mia Mustone, our new secretary.

58
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:49,854
Congratulations, Ms.

59
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:50,854
Mustone.

60
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:53,495
Ms.

61
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:58,736
Kritz, if you will give the sheets over to your colleague for the rest of the meeting.

62
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,098
Trial by fire.

63
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,940
Next up, approval of the minutes of the January 7, 2019 meeting.

64
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,488
Is the motion for approval by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo?

65
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:19,089
All those in favor?

66
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:19,169
Aye.

67
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:20,609
All those opposed?

68
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:21,970
Motion passes.

69
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,331
Approval of Bills Transfer of Funds.

70
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,812
Motion to approve by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

71
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:30,713
Roll call vote, please.

72
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,880
Remember it's even and odd.

73
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,800
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

74
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:11,746
Next up is the approval of payrolls and actually if you can, if someone could move suspension to take the item that's under eight negotiations and legal matters, it's payroll update, if we can move that up to this section.

75
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,891
Motion to suspend the rules by Ms.

76
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:17,412
Kretz, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

77
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:18,792
That paper is now before us.

78
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,353
The approval of the payrolls were provided by Ms.

79
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:21,933
Patterson.

80
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,314
Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

81
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:25,274
Mr. Benedetto.

82
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:37,799
I motion to approve the payroll for this quarter, but I also have questions about the report presented and a request to have a little bit more information.

83
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,820
First of all, I want to thank you for presenting it.

84
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:56,736
When we asked for this quarterly, I know it was a long time ago, we asked for the job title and the annual salaries be listed next to the gross for the pay period.

85
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:03,279
I don't think that was requested and I don't think our system can pull that information into it.

86
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,041
Okay.

87
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:09,683
The job descriptions can be added?

88
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,423
No, there's no type.

89
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:19,635
Because I remember the last one, we would say, it doesn't say what, like some people have four paid checks.

90
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,218
I did refer to the last one.

91
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:21,979
I'm sorry.

92
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,730
Thank you.

93
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,011
I did refer to the last report presented, and this is the same format.

94
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,812
This is exactly directly from the export from our financial system.

95
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:42,694
So in terms of having job description, things of that sort, or title, it's not part of the payroll system, and that's not part of this particular report.

96
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:50,216
I know, but I know it can be downloaded to an Excel document, and those job descriptions can be there, because you have people's names.

97
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,056
Like, some people get four paychecks.

98
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,728
So I know some of its longevity, but I don't know what the other things are.

99
00:11:57,088 --> 00:12:05,918
So, you know, and we are supposed to be able to look at this and look at our budget book to see if we're on track, and that's really the goal here.

100
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:14,487
So I would just like to table this so I can check my notes from the last meeting and the formal request that I made at that time.

101
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:18,484
And if that's OK, should we table in this report?

102
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,664
You can make a motion to table.

103
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,344
Is there a second to table?

104
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,144
Mr. Ruggiero, before the tabling.

105
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:28,525
Before the tabling, I just have a couple of questions about the formatting, because I had a similar concern or idea, I guess.

106
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:38,327
Is it possible, if not department heads, or different departments, is it possible for us to list the departments that they receive their paycheck from?

107
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:43,848
So the department is not going to reflect anything that is going to,

108
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:50,759
It's a three-digit code that is only meaningful to our payroll department, so it's not going to reference.

109
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,889
And if somebody's working in multiple buildings, they may have different department codes.

110
00:12:55,602 --> 00:13:05,348
So I'm not sure what the value of having a department code would be, and that would be a lot more information to be derived.

111
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:15,655
So our financial reporting only provides minimal information, which is what has been provided here, as well as what was provided last year for the review.

112
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:20,658
In terms of base salary, again, I think I indicated on the summary report

113
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:36,487
We still have many collective bargaining agreements that have not been completed, so there are many that are still not going to be reflective of any fiscal year 2018-19 COLA that could be applied.

114
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:48,113
All of the steps have been increased as they would be in their particular collective bargaining agreement, but there are still a number of items that would not be, and again,

115
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:54,249
Looking at a budget document, that was a plan and we did not include COLAs in that budget document.

116
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:58,072
So it's not going to tie out directly from what was presented in the budget.

117
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:04,617
As you recall, we did have a holder, a placeholder in there for negotiation amounts.

118
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,399
In good faith, that's the process that we identify.

119
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:14,784
So we would only put in their step and lane depending on their particular collective bargaining agreement.

120
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:16,225
So no COLAs were identified.

121
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:34,589
If you do look at what is their base salary annualized across 26 pays, it will likely not match what the budget included last year, because we had a holding bucket of funds based on negotiations in anticipation for this fiscal year.

122
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:34,869
Yeah.

123
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,970
Can you still ask questions?

124
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,732
So I'm just trying to understand the data frames that you draw this from.

125
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:47,390
So to pull out this spreadsheet here, these columns, you drew that from your payroll system, is that correct?

126
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:52,273
This is one pay period, and that was the pay period January 3rd of 2019.

127
00:14:52,773 --> 00:15:06,320
And I reverted you back to when that was reported previously on the bills and payrolls, so that you could see that the number ties out to what is reported to you biweekly in that regard.

128
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,102
Well, I guess the reason why I'm trying to understand the challenge of this

129
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:19,224
So you have these numbers also cross-referenced to another data frame that where the warrants are drawn from that pay all these people, right?

130
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:21,945
No.

131
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:30,427
So what I'm trying to understand is that if there's someone being paid, let's say, in the high school,

132
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:32,459
How do they draw their check?

133
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,561
They draw their check from just payroll and that's where it's come from?

134
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:41,924
Or does it go that there's a warrant drawn from the high school and that goes to pay off the payroll?

135
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:42,685
No.

136
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:43,665
I'm sorry.

137
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:47,288
This is your warrant of which it is processed from.

138
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:52,070
So this is the total warrant of payments going out to personnel.

139
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:56,133
So under your payroll line item, that's what you are approving.

140
00:15:56,917 --> 00:16:00,099
during each cycle of bills and payroll approval.

141
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:05,602
So this was the total gross wages for earnings for the entire district.

142
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:07,243
Alphabetically.

143
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,204
Alpha, from January 3rd.

144
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:17,529
I guess what I'm trying to understand is, because I've worked with a little data myself, so I'm trying to understand why is it difficult to pull out the department?

145
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:23,432
Because I would imagine that these numbers must correspond to a different data set that you have, right?

146
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:29,248
So this is their employee number, and this is referenced in payroll, a separate payroll system.

147
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:32,971
The payroll itself includes deductions.

148
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:42,679
It includes multiple facets that would be even more complex in order to describe and get to the gross amount.

149
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:52,387
It comprises of seven different batches of groupings of different pay types, pay cycles, different employee bargaining units.

150
00:16:52,847 --> 00:17:03,511
So in order to provide that detail would essentially be a phone book's worth of information.

151
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:14,456
Yeah, I mean, I understand that there must be many different data frames, but what I'm trying to understand is why is it, I still, maybe it's just because my head's so thick here, so maybe you could just go through it with me a couple of times.

152
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:21,336
So if, and I'm not saying that this is the case, but let's say there's Dr., I don't know, Ghostface.

153
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,878
How do, you know, someone who just ended up in the payroll system.

154
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,879
You hear about stories about this every so often.

155
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:33,343
You read the news that there's some mystery person that's been drawing payroll for years and years and years, even though they're not on the system anymore.

156
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:35,264
That couldn't happen to us, right?

157
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:43,609
No, this is your gross listing based on who is active, actively in our payroll system.

158
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,570
How do you know they're active?

159
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:49,990
They're active by virtue of being paid on the biweekly or weekly schedule.

160
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,214
So within our payroll system.

161
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,656
To answer your question, we have two separate systems.

162
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:00,639
They're not concurrent.

163
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:01,800
They're not the same system.

164
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,523
So we get a complex data feed out of our payroll.

165
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:24,643
that's based on all of our active employees from every employee type from after school earnings to regular coverages to full base salaries, longevity, all of that for active employees is then filtered into the financial software reporting piece that you see in front of you.

166
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:29,948
This is the gross payroll that is essentially what is paid out.

167
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:35,480
on a weekly, biweekly cycle based on the number of employees.

168
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:43,063
So yes, if there was somebody here listed that should not be, then we would know that.

169
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:43,903
How would you know that?

170
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:46,524
We go through the payroll as we're processing it.

171
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:47,905
Ms.

172
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:50,226
Patterson, could you describe how the payroll gets to you?

173
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,591
I think this is the end result, so it goes through phases to get to you.

174
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:59,292
We approve this every week, so I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on the process.

175
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:00,192
Sure.

176
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:06,573
So payroll itself has auto payments for known base salaries and longevity.

177
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:14,755
All of your 26 pay periods that are your regular folks, your administrators, your teachers, your paras, everybody that's on a salary schedule.

178
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,268
It's automatic payment.

179
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,610
So they are processed automatically.

180
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,211
Their additional earnings would be paid separately.

181
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:31,754
So if they had an additional coverage, they did some extra teaching or had a stipend assignment, that would be another line item.

182
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,875
So all of that is filtered in.

183
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,755
Timesheets are submitted.

184
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:40,257
All of that is processed through the payroll that we review.

185
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:42,137
We look at their deductions.

186
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:43,598
There's a number of

187
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:52,599
components that each person's pay report on a weekly, bi-weekly cycle is in the payroll system.

188
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:52,879
Right.

189
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,183
I understand that people might have different deductions, and that changes the gross wages.

190
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:00,323
I completely understand that.

191
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:02,785
What I'm having trouble understanding.

192
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:06,207
It changes the net wages, not the gross.

193
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:06,507
Yeah.

194
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:06,967
I'm sorry.

195
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:07,347
Excuse me.

196
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:07,627
Yes.

197
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:11,850
So what I'm trying to understand is, so there's data coming to you.

198
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:14,064
then you filter that data and make this report.

199
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:20,786
So there's no column about where that person works or what that person's title or role is in the company?

200
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:26,928
So again, this is coming from our financial software reporting, not the payroll system itself.

201
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:29,589
Those two systems do not speak to one another.

202
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,670
What are the data frames?

203
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,170
I mean, I'm trying to understand.

204
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,471
It's a pay period.

205
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:36,091
He's talking about the named list.

206
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,991
That's from payroll.

207
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,232
This is the employee number.

208
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:39,852
That's it.

209
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:41,393
This is from admins.

210
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:53,535
This is the report from admins that is processed by... I can't see names in our ledgers on the city side.

211
00:20:54,176 --> 00:21:00,763
This is what's provided by the audit office based on the payroll that's submitted.

212
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,485
I think it's the payroll system.

213
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:22,124
My challenge here is it seems that there must be some sort of data frame of some sort, whether it's something like some SQL database or some database where this employee has all the facts about that employee are in a column on some sort of database.

214
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:22,484
Yeah.

215
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:26,826
It's a very complex database that's not as

216
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,474
easily manipulated, if you will.

217
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,274
What's the format of the database?

218
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,535
There's multiple tabs across.

219
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:38,036
So there's one tab for certain areas, one tab for another.

220
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:44,997
If it's MTRS, so it's not just one set of demographic for one employee.

221
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:50,879
So we're talking 15 to 20 tabs going across for your data point of one particular person.

222
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:59,314
With all due respect, so the only assurance that we have that we don't have some sort of ghost member on the payroll is that the program tells us so?

223
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:01,916
The program does not.

224
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:04,958
We verify that as we're processing payroll.

225
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:16,505
So yes, there has to be some confidence that the office itself is reviewing the information and going through any applicable changes in staffing that have occurred.

226
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:21,708
So no, a system itself is not going to know if there's somebody artificially in that system.

227
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:29,671
That's based on the human factor of the business office that we have to monitor, which we do each pay period, each cycle.

228
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:30,692
I have no question.

229
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:36,115
I want to make clear to everyone, I'm not implying that I think that there's any malfeasance.

230
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:36,475
I don't.

231
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:40,377
What I'm trying to understand is the difficulty in drawing the data.

232
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:47,982
Because for me, I would, whatever data frame you're working on, you should be able to draw these columns.

233
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:49,587
and the columns come out.

234
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:53,249
Like, that's all the database experience I've ever had.

235
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,490
And in all due respect, there's no simplistic.

236
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,192
Even if, let's say, code 010 meant the superintendent's office.

237
00:22:59,272 --> 00:22:59,432
Right.

238
00:22:59,532 --> 00:22:59,773
Sure.

239
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:00,913
You might get a report.

240
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:05,836
You could get this report, and then divvied out by the people in the superintendent's office, sort of a different way.

241
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:07,657
I'm sure you can get something like that.

242
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:10,679
But then you have people that work in different departments.

243
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:13,541
So they would just have multiple entries on the column.

244
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,922
See, that seems to be the solution to the problem.

245
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:23,866
If you had someone who works at both the Andrews and the Roberts, they would just have a comma in between the two places.

246
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,227
That's not going to assist.

247
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,869
Does that help you to know that they're at the superintendent's office?

248
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,034
Well, I mean, we have a fiduciary responsibility to the voters of Medford.

249
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:34,035
I mean, that's our job, right?

250
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,390
I mean, that's what we vote on, is to make sure that these people vote here.

251
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:50,060
The idea is that we have a report, but you're missing a key actual value on this data frame, which is to know where this person works in our system.

252
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,703
I have, you know, there are many, many names here, and I'm sure they all work hard.

253
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:59,068
I'm not, I wanna make absolutely clear, I'm not implying anything, but on the same token,

254
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:04,900
I mean, there's a crucial, I mean, why not just, why have the employee number or even the name?

255
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,383
Can you look into, by our next meeting, whether or not you can add a column that shows the location?

256
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:31,245
I can show the location but the report itself will not tie out because they will be in multiple locations because we have many people that work in multiple buildings and that's the that's the issue if you give me a spreadsheet I will make a beautiful report if you give me I wish it was that simplistic okay there's a motion on the table miss bandicoot

257
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:32,446
Just a question.

258
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:39,089
When we have our budget book, we have a name, we have a department, and we have an amount of money.

259
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,750
How come it works then?

260
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,871
That's not from the payroll system.

261
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:47,613
This is a very challenging payroll system.

262
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:56,417
And it's a farm-grown payroll system, and it does not necessarily tie to our program codes or to our general ledger codes, to those types of things.

263
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:59,938
We have crosswalks that we... That's why there's a continual...

264
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:14,177
correction and or if there's any movement, if somebody moves from one building to another, it's imperative that payroll knows so that we can change their location, change their building, change where they're being charged within the general fund.

265
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:26,120
So the budget book, again, in and of itself, is a moving document because there's been transition since we solidified it back last June.

266
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,901
There were people that moved simply locations.

267
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,801
Well, that changes your budget book.

268
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,262
That changes the department.

269
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:34,223
That changes their location.

270
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:40,146
So again, it's not just a quick Excel spit out.

271
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,167
There's a lot of different things.

272
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:47,570
And unfortunately, there are limitations to what we can produce within our payroll system.

273
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:54,014
It's a little bit rudimentary in terms of certain specifics that you're looking for.

274
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:59,137
And that's the reality, that we do have limitations within our own reporting capacity.

275
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:00,775
in this particular system.

276
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:16,364
So what I've tried to prepare for you is a simplistic version for ease of reviewing so that you could see that the dollars themselves tie out to the gross wages that are reported for review on each pay period and each cycle as they come through.

277
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:22,107
And we have biweekly cycles that include the weekly cycles on every given pay period.

278
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:24,809
Mr. Russo.

279
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,330
Thank you.

280
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:40,986
not disagree that we have a fiduciary responsibility here, but that responsibility does not mean that I'm supposed to know that each individual in this list works here and is actually pulling a salary, because they should.

281
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:45,707
That's beyond imagination that that could happen.

282
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:51,769
That's not my responsibility to know every person here, every time we get one of these, actually works here.

283
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:57,030
My responsibility, as I see it, is to make sure that there's a process in place

284
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,622
And there are staff that are making sure that that's happening.

285
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:05,643
And I think that is, we can all agree, what we want to know for sure.

286
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:13,906
But I can't attest that these people work here and that they should get a salary.

287
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:18,787
That's craziness to think that we would go through a list with hundreds and hundreds of people.

288
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:23,449
And each week, I'm going to go know that they actually still get work here.

289
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,421
Point of information, Mr. Ruggiero.

290
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:32,703
With all due respect to your point, which I understand where you're coming from, we don't have to take the entire population and test it.

291
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,103
We would test a sample.

292
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:39,004
So we could take 30 people from this list, and I could double check it.

293
00:27:39,484 --> 00:27:44,925
That would give me a reasonable set of understanding, well, I picked 30 names at random off this list.

294
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,705
All these people work here.

295
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:48,265
That would give me much more confidence.

296
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:51,746
Because right now, there's no way for me to find any of these people.

297
00:27:54,088 --> 00:28:07,754
And that, but if I knew that, for example, let's say Michael Ruggiero, I don't want to name any names off the list, but let's say Michael Ruggiero, he works, he's a math teacher at the Roberts, that I would say, he's one of the names that I randomly drew from this page.

298
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:10,235
I can check it if all 30 go through.

299
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,856
I'm much more confident.

300
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:18,679
Like, I don't have to test an entire population to get some information about that population, man.

301
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,379
Statistics.

302
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,319
Point of information heard.

303
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,380
Mr. Russo.

304
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,860
I'm all set.

305
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,039
Is it a point of information?

306
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,840
Is it a point of information?

307
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:26,880
Ms.

308
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,240
Kretz.

309
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,620
Yes.

310
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,301
I just wanted to, you know, just... Oops, sorry.

311
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:31,041
I just knocked that off.

312
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,562
I'll put that back in a minute.

313
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:46,926
Mention that when the payroll is sent into the Mass Teachers Retirement System, the total checks and everybody on that file, it's an electronic file, has to match up.

314
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:50,086
And it's audited at the Mass Teachers Retirement System.

315
00:28:52,641 --> 00:29:22,288
well, the reporting system that we have, has checks and balances in place to pick up on, for example, if somebody went on a leave of absence, or if somebody maybe got an extra check, and something like that might kick out, and that gets audited by the employer services area, and then questions are sent down to the school, and either it's explained, or maybe somebody got an extra check because they were working in one department, they earned the stipend,

316
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,541
and the other person didn't get turned off, so there might be an adjustment on one person, and then a correction made.

317
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:30,861
Things like that happen very often.

318
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:46,184
But I know that our payroll software, when it comes through, picks up deductions omitted if somebody is missing and their deductions weren't turned on, which means they might be getting paid, but no deductions were taken.

319
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,064
But this is just generic.

320
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:51,785
I'm just talking about I have a lot of districts, and we do...

321
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:59,934
a very detailed audit and audit every single report in all the, you know, all the public schools.

322
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:07,636
And then we are audited by, you know, PARAC and KPMG, you know what I mean?

323
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:14,277
So the reports are going through those audits and so is Medford Public Schools or they randomly pick school districts to audit.

324
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:19,958
KPMG does, you know, and they audit the reports that are sent in and they do an audit with you.

325
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:21,678
We don't know what questions they're asking.

326
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:25,303
and they do not with us, and you don't know what questions that they're asking us.

327
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:28,464
And then both of us have to give back up to the auditors.

328
00:30:29,224 --> 00:30:29,604
Very good.

329
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:30,564
And it has to match up.

330
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:31,344
Thank you.

331
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:32,905
Mr. Russo, are you all set?

332
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:33,385
I'm all set.

333
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:34,345
You're all set.

334
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:35,325
Mr. Benedetto.

335
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:35,925
Thank you.

336
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:46,068
So as my colleague was saying about taking 30 random names, last year that's exactly what I had done and compared it to

337
00:30:46,955 --> 00:31:04,771
the budget book and there were discrepancies in a few people's salaries and steps were given out of time frame that should have been and we had a meeting about it and that's why this report was requested.

338
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:10,416
But this document doesn't give us enough information and that's why I'm asking to table it

339
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:17,948
so we can get more information than what's presented at this time in a way that we can, you know, just pick a few things.

340
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:25,670
If every one of us picked three and just said, you know, my three were great, then, you know, we're doing our due diligence in moving forward.

341
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:34,231
So that's all I want to see happen, and I want to ask a few questions.

342
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,792
Like some principals are supposed to be making the same

343
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,319
amount of money we made changes at the beginning of that this year.

344
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:46,963
And if you look at those two principles, they're not on this base salary in here.

345
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:51,927
And I don't want to do all of that on camera for the whole city.

346
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:56,910
I don't think it's fair to name names in someone's salary all the time in this forum.

347
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,572
So I'd like to table it.

348
00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:00,853
I'd like a little bit more.

349
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:07,238
I'd like to look at my notes because they may be different from what you had written down.

350
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:11,977
And I definitely need a little bit more information than what's presented in this.

351
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:12,577
OK.

352
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,519
There's a motion on the floor to table the paper.

353
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,460
Is there a second?

354
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:17,962
There's a second by Mr. Russo.

355
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:18,222
Thank you.

356
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:22,246
Undebatable on the motion to table this paper to our next meeting.

357
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:23,627
All those in favor?

358
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:24,047
Aye.

359
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:25,969
All those opposed?

360
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,630
Motion granted.

361
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:28,691
Thank you.

362
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:29,292
The paper's tabled.

363
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:29,972
Thank you for the work.

364
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:31,053
Thank you.

365
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:36,397
report of the outgoing secretary.

366
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,060
I want to congratulate Ms.

367
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,962
Stone on her nomination.

368
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:44,324
I just wanted to wish you the best.

369
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:46,226
And I can always help out and train.

370
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,628
I know if you need me, just text me.

371
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:58,756
I want to extend my thanks to all the girls at City Hall and the Finance Auditing Department for being so accommodating, sharing their office space and treats.

372
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,977
They have a lot of good candies in there.

373
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:02,199
I really enjoyed seeing them every week.

374
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,180
And I owe the girls a bag of candy.

375
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,981
I'll probably bring one in sometime.

376
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:13,422
Also, thank you to all the girls in the finance and accounts payable offices at Medford High School for organizing the batches and ensuring all the backup is provided.

377
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:19,024
Lastly, I want to thank the custodial department for delivering the package to City Hall in a timely manner every week.

378
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:29,946
Thank you, Cynthia Burke, Tawana Dubrow, Michelle Kingdon, Fiona Maxwell, Shab Khan, Alicia Nunley, Joanne Mortel, Erin Carson, Christine Patterson, and John Howard.

379
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:30,466
Thank you all.

380
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:34,215
Thank you.

381
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:35,775
Is there a motion to receive this report?

382
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,176
Place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

383
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:38,656
Van de Kloot.

384
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:39,436
All those in favor?

385
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:40,717
All those opposed?

386
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:41,417
Motion passes.

387
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:42,877
Report of committees.

388
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,178
The Rules Subcommittee, December 17, 2018.

389
00:33:46,918 --> 00:33:49,099
Yes, I'll be reporting on that.

390
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,599
The Rules Subcommittee had a meeting on December 17.

391
00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:01,642
The purpose of our subcommittee meeting was to take a roll call vote on the final draft copy of the functions of the school committee and move the draft over to the regular meeting on December 17.

392
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:09,018
I explained to the subcommittee that the week before, I had met with City Solicitor Mark Rumley on December 10th.

393
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:14,520
He reviewed the draft and he helped make corrections so we would not be in violation with the law or the First Amendment.

394
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:21,203
A motion was made at the regular meeting to move the draft to the Committee of the Whole so that we can discuss it with the entire committee.

395
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:26,525
This weekend, Superintendent Dr. Maurice, she sent out a doodle email note to everyone.

396
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:32,706
So I think sometime over the next couple of days, we'll find out what date the Committee of the Whole meeting will be.

397
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:33,747
That's it.

398
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:34,047
Very good.

399
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:40,152
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero?

400
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:41,253
All those in favor?

401
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:42,814
All those opposed?

402
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,435
Motion passes.

403
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,298
Committee of the Whole.

404
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:56,145
Also last Monday, January 7, in room 207, we had a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the Alliance for Inclusion and Prevention.

405
00:34:56,705 --> 00:35:03,449
that conducted a trauma assessment, a health assessment on the McGlynn Middle and the McGlynn Elementary School.

406
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:24,882
We have about three or so pages of notes that were taken at the meeting, but it really went through the detailed information of the various surveys that were furnished to the children, their parents, teachers and staff, and also next step suggestions on how to potentially improve climate, not only at those two schools, but throughout the district.

407
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,782
So we will be working steadfast on moving forward.

408
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:36,348
We know that the school has had a tremendous turnaround over the last several months, so we're really thrilled with the perception.

409
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:48,416
And just for all those at home, parents are really, really happy with the McGlynn, how their kids felt that they were, how the kids felt supported.

410
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:51,877
And the teachers were all invested in their children.

411
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:54,838
So overall, it was a very good, positive report.

412
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:58,200
But of course, there are areas that need to be addressed.

413
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,861
And we will do so moving forward.

414
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:06,725
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

415
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:07,085
Yes.

416
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:08,226
Motion by Ms.

417
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:08,546
Kretz.

418
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,247
Is there a second?

419
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:10,727
Mr. Ruggiero.

420
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,728
All those in favor?

421
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:12,528
Aye.

422
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:13,369
All those opposed?

423
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,370
Motion passes.

424
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:16,971
Thank you.

425
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,472
Community participation.

426
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:24,465
Report of the superintendent.

427
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:26,546
Superintendent's update and comments.

428
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:27,766
Madam Superintendent.

429
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:30,127
Good evening everyone.

430
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:43,810
So this past week, it's only been one week, but there's still a lot happening in the district.

431
00:36:46,109 --> 00:37:00,513
Coming up very soon, I just want to, in light of last week's presentation, I wanted to let parents know and the community, all of you know, that there will be a presentation about what parents need to know about vaping and hidden in plain sight.

432
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:07,674
It will be on Thursday, February 7th at 5.30 at the McGlynn School Auditorium.

433
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:14,256
This presentation will be provided to parents and guardians about the new look of nicotine addiction

434
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:20,118
Parents will learn about these harmful products and how to protect their children from this latest trend.

435
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:24,441
There will also be a hidden in plain sight area.

436
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:31,425
This invitation is to all parents and guardians in the district who might be interested, and it is an adult-only event.

437
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:42,133
The presentation is in collaboration with Tony Ray of our health department from the district and Team Medford, Medford's Board of Health Prevention Office.

438
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:47,392
So please save the date, Thursday, February 7th at 5.30 p.m.

439
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,473
at the McGlynn School Auditorium.

440
00:37:51,373 --> 00:38:02,317
Last week on Tuesday, Mayor Burke and myself, we had the opportunity to go downtown Boston to meet with Mayor Walsh at City Hall.

441
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:10,539
We attended a meeting to discuss the potential overhaul of the state's 26-year-old funding formula.

442
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:20,528
It's our hope that it will be updated so all students can benefit and bridge between urban and suburban school performances.

443
00:38:21,928 --> 00:38:26,830
This potential funding will benefit Medford greatly.

444
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:34,472
And in addition to that, last Wednesday, Mayor Burke and Assistant Superintendent Christine Patterson

445
00:38:34,947 --> 00:39:01,392
They went to the State House, Senator Chang-Diaz and many other mayors and superintendents and school administrators, members of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, Massachusetts Association of School Committees, and others were there in support of the revamped version of the Senate's funding bill from last session.

446
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:04,453
And so the proposed bill will be called

447
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,510
the Education Promise Act.

448
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:13,472
And again, this will hugely benefit our district and correct some historic funding inequities.

449
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:19,635
So I'm very optimistic and hopeful that this bill will go through and benefit Medford.

450
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:30,069
Last Wednesday, I also attended NSSEP training as it was my fifth session of one-year training.

451
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,532
And again, I continue to work with a group of cohorts

452
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:41,740
of close to 40 superintendents across the state where we participate in professional development.

453
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:52,412
We have opportunities to look at our district's vision, looking at data and what potential theories of action can be for each respective district.

454
00:39:52,975 --> 00:40:14,022
So as I continue to work on looking at Medford and making Medford stronger and continuing to improve our schools, I continue to learn a lot from being at those professional development sessions, hearing from other superintendents and other leaders within the state to help inform and guide the work that I'm doing.

455
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:18,503
So that was last week, Wednesday, and I was in Marlborough for the entire day.

456
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:23,565
My next meeting with them will be in February, on February 6th.

457
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:29,849
So it is frequent, but it's making sure that we're all moving at the same pace.

458
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:38,574
Something that's happening right now in Medford, we have a wonderful computer science curriculum.

459
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:44,678
And we are expanding our K-12 computer science learning for our students.

460
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:52,010
Last year, Edison Robotics, Edbots, were integrated into our technology curriculum.

461
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:57,193
This year, coding and robotics have been expanded to all K-8 schools.

462
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:12,622
The Edison devices have a variety of programming languages that are appropriate for younger and older learners and teaches students computational thinking and computer programming in an age-appropriate way and with plenty of hands-on learning.

463
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:20,948
Students were able to code the robots to respond to light and sound, follow lines, and avoid obstacles.

464
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:27,971
The students can also code the robots to communicate with each other or to respond to claps or music.

465
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,272
These robots are ideal for STEM projects

466
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:34,833
and are suitable for students from kindergarten all the way through high school.

467
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:43,675
And again, this is preparing our students for tomorrow, artificial intelligence and things along those lines.

468
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:59,680
Additionally, I just wanted to give an update about Priscilla's Pantry, the Medford High School Hope Chest and Priscilla's Pantry, a free food pantry at Medford High School that assists Medford High and Medford Vocational Technical High School students.

469
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:05,458
We hosted a free chili, they hosted a free chili lunch on early release Wednesday.

470
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:10,759
No school lunches are traditionally offered on early release days.

471
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:21,261
And with the assistance of the food pantry, Red Smith, our district nutritionist, made two types of chili, meat and bean, and vegetarian chili.

472
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:29,643
Students not only were able to grab a steaming bowl of chili, but also left with the ingredients needed to make the same meal at their homes.

473
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:36,330
So Priscilla's Pantry hopes to not only feed hungry students, but empower students to cook for themselves.

474
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:41,612
They hope to provide this interactive lunch experience on future early release days.

475
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:51,636
Last week, for our students, we also had a special presentation, ending distracted driving presentation.

476
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:57,206
So this presentation was for our sophomore class at the high school.

477
00:42:57,986 --> 00:43:05,510
And the students listened to an end distracting driving presentation provided by the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys.

478
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:15,055
Attorney Joel Feldman, who began the end distracted driving program 10 years ago in memory of his daughter, Casey Feldman, opened the program.

479
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:21,678
Casey was 21 years old and in a crosswalk when a distracted driver hit and killed her.

480
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:30,378
Medford resident, Emily Stein, the president of Safe Roads Alliance, lost her dad to a distracted driver.

481
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,342
Both of the speakers explained how a few seconds can change everything.

482
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:42,808
They urged the students to pay attention on the road and focus on the task at hand, which should be driving only.

483
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:48,972
During the presentation, the speakers asked the students if their parents texted while driving.

484
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:51,875
Unfortunately, a number of hands did go up.

485
00:43:52,892 --> 00:44:01,175
We can't tell our children to stay safe, and not to text and drive, and then witness us doing exactly what we told them not to do.

486
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:10,819
So this was a very powerful and very important presentation for our students, and we did have support, I believe Ms.

487
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:17,382
Dever from the mayor's office, Dever Wood came to support us for that presentation.

488
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:43,519
Also, I just wanted to announce that at the end of this month coming up before January ends We have four dates slated for math learning walk to as you know in collaboration and partnership with Lesley University We did baseline data in the fall and so we are now getting ready to do our mid-year check-in update for all of our elementary schools and so

489
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:47,400
We are in the process of combining teams.

490
00:44:47,540 --> 00:45:05,106
We will be having directors and administrators and leaders on the Lesley University side coming to support our learning walk as we continue to gather data to look at the progress that we've made from the start of school year to the midpoint.

491
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,067
So those are my announcements for today.

492
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:08,347
Very good, thank you.

493
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:11,668
Mr. Ruggiero.

494
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:13,549
Thank you very much for that.

495
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:20,849
I had a question about the vaping that you have on Thursday, February 7th.

496
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,072
How is this event being advertised to parents?

497
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:29,117
We will have this on our website.

498
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:31,900
I believe it may already be posted.

499
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:40,508
I know they are notifying parents at the school there's going to be a dance happening at the same time.

500
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:48,456
So as parents go to the school to drop their children off for the event, while the students are

501
00:45:49,597 --> 00:46:07,367
enjoying themselves at the dance, parents will be able to go to the auditorium and participate in this very informative presentation to really help them be aware of what's happening and for the hidden and plain sight for the parents to be able to see

502
00:46:08,587 --> 00:46:11,168
what could be right under their noses and they're not aware of.

503
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:37,622
So I wanted to make sure that we just announce this to the community and as you talk with people, and you can have it on the blog spot in the website, but to continue to just let people know that this is happening, let the community know, and I think it's just another opportunity to continue to inform the community about these addictions and how we can work together

504
00:46:38,445 --> 00:46:40,185
support our youngsters.

505
00:46:40,985 --> 00:46:41,245
Thank you.

506
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:41,886
Great.

507
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:48,347
I just wanted to elaborate a little bit more on the foundation budget and the education bill, the Promise Act that's been put forth.

508
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:59,069
And if you looked at the city of Medford over the last several years, when you net out what we get in Chapter 70, which is school funding against our charter school expenses, we're negative.

509
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:01,549
Every year we've been going down lower and lower.

510
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:04,549
So the state is contributing less and less to the school system.

511
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:07,810
And therefore, the property tax burden really is covering

512
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,711
I think 87% of our school costs are covered through the tax bills.

513
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:15,772
So it's a huge burden on us.

514
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:19,873
And then it's very disparate when you compare the urban-suburban.

515
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:27,155
And it's frustrating, because we really are educating the most vulnerable in the Commonwealth, similar to Boston.

516
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:30,316
So we need that extra help.

517
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:37,398
So I urge you, as this bill progresses, to really push hard and call your legislators to tell them you're on board.

518
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:41,944
At that point in time, we'll do a shout out to parents and educators as well.

519
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,844
MTA was on board with this.

520
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:47,485
The Mass Association of School Committees was there as well to support it.

521
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:51,726
Cross channels and charter schools do not get hindered by this.

522
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:52,426
They don't get hurt.

523
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:54,847
So it really lifts everyone up.

524
00:47:54,927 --> 00:48:02,449
So please stay apprised and tune in for further discussions because we're going to need everybody to push for this bill to pass.

525
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:07,450
Do you know, Madam Mayor, do you know for the Education Promise Act, do you know the house number?

526
00:48:07,788 --> 00:48:09,329
It's a Senate number, and I can look it up.

527
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:10,390
I can send it to you tomorrow.

528
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,090
Thank you so much.

529
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:13,952
Ms.

530
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:14,472
DiBenedetto.

531
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:16,353
Thank you, Mayor Burke.

532
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:36,486
First, going back to the in plain sight thing, maybe an auto call to just both middle schools, like the night before, as a reminder to parents that this program is happening, just to say, hey, while you're bringing your children to the dance, or for the other school as well.

533
00:48:37,658 --> 00:48:45,145
that we'd love to see you and it's a great opportunity to mingle with other middle school parents because they take the bus, you don't get to do that.

534
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:46,145
So that was one thing.

535
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:52,371
Number two is I really like the superintendent updates.

536
00:48:52,691 --> 00:49:02,859
I gather a lot of information and it's really informative and not only to me as a committee member but I'm sure anybody watching.

537
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:07,143
to just hear highlights of what's happening all over the district.

538
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:08,724
So I really appreciate them.

539
00:49:08,764 --> 00:49:13,627
So take your time and do as long as you need to, because it's really, really fun for me.

540
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:17,069
Not that you needed that.

541
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:22,592
And then I forget what the third thing was, so I'll just pass the floor along.

542
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:23,533
Thank you.

543
00:49:23,952 --> 00:49:31,603
And the distracted driving session, Emily Stein is actually a mom at the Brooks School, so she has a direct connection with medical kids.

544
00:49:31,623 --> 00:49:36,170
So just a point of information, I just wanted to let you know that an auto call is going out that's already been planned.

545
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,532
OK, great.

546
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:38,894
Ms.

547
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:39,375
Vandekloot.

548
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:51,198
I wanted to remind the committee that we had voted to do a meet and greet prior to the Medford Family Network Valentine's Family Festival.

549
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:58,366
It was advertised, or the Valentine's Festival has been advertised between 11 and 1 p.m.

550
00:49:58,406 --> 00:49:58,747
this year.

551
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:03,956
which means that our meet and greet, when we were talking about it, would be the hour before 10.

552
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:14,929
However, we must ask Superintendent that we have Lisa Evangelista, please, if she would write an article, and we have other advertising going out.

553
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,611
The idea was that the...

554
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:26,774
school committee would be available to meet and greet, and in no way would whatever room we're set up with, would that interfere with any of the setup for the Valentine Festival.

555
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:30,714
So we need to make sure that it's advertised, though.

556
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:34,535
And I just want to remind the membership that we said we would do that.

557
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:36,975
Very good.

558
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:37,595
Thank you.

559
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:39,616
Ms.

560
00:50:39,756 --> 00:50:40,096
Kretz.

561
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:40,536
Sorry.

562
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:41,596
Yep.

563
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:45,717
So I actually got to attend the distracted driving seminar last week.

564
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:52,512
It's something that I like to go to because it reminds me that I don't want to drive distracted.

565
00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:56,253
And I've spoken with Emily before.

566
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,613
And I just really, I go to support.

567
00:50:58,774 --> 00:51:05,475
And it's just really, it's a very good, moving, interactive presentation that they do.

568
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:13,158
And just walking right up to kids to ask them, if your friend was drinking, would you let them get in the car?

569
00:51:13,678 --> 00:51:13,818
No.

570
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,342
If your friend is texting, would you let them drive?

571
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:21,025
And they did a lot of little skits with some of the kids.

572
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:23,107
And they do a great, great job.

573
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,410
And it's really very moving.

574
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:31,133
And I had a tear in my eye, because it's just so sad.

575
00:51:31,173 --> 00:51:33,495
And your life can be taken away in seconds.

576
00:51:34,136 --> 00:51:38,139
And they were just both unfortunate, distracted driving accidents.

577
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,141
It's very sad, very moving.

578
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:42,903
But all the trial attorneys just do

579
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:47,189
great job explaining the distracted driving presentations.

580
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,429
Just it's incredible.

581
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:49,869
And it's not just texting.

582
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:50,389
Yeah.

583
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:51,050
It's makeup.

584
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:51,630
Yes.

585
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:52,290
It's coffee.

586
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,870
And GPS and yes.

587
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:54,250
GPS.

588
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,090
Checking mail.

589
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:55,430
Anything.

590
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,251
Like physical opening letters and yeah.

591
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:01,572
It's go into your pocketbook and it's everything.

592
00:52:02,172 --> 00:52:02,392
So.

593
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:03,272
Thank you Ms.

594
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:03,652
Croston.

595
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:05,172
Mr. Benedetto.

596
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:05,773
Thank you.

597
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:07,673
I remembered what my other item was.

598
00:52:10,433 --> 00:52:11,694
Priscilla's Pantry.

599
00:52:12,194 --> 00:52:12,994
I love the name too.

600
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:17,203
So how many children attended that?

601
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:21,324
And, you know, like how many people are we serving?

602
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,364
Do we have any numbers yet?

603
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:32,008
I know it's early, but, and I also, I think I requested a number of like how many homeless families or students we're serving in the community.

604
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:36,509
I don't know if we have a, glad that I asked for that a couple weeks, maybe a month ago.

605
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:37,990
Is that what you were saying?

606
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:38,430
Yeah.

607
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,411
Just, I don't know if we could know that.

608
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:42,812
I don't know.

609
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:46,713
I work with homeless population at the school district I work at.

610
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:58,654
So this time of year, all through the year, more and more families and children are having difficult time paying their rent and becoming homeless.

611
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:06,779
So things like Priscilla's Pantry, I'm very happy to see our school district, you know, take initiative with that stuff.

612
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:14,344
And just some follow-up, like just some understanding of this population that we're serving is helpful to me.

613
00:53:14,748 --> 00:53:21,130
So you're requesting, I will get the exact number of students that participated in the last early release?

614
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:21,410
Right.

615
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,171
I'm just curious how many homeless families or homeless students that this district is serving.

616
00:53:26,511 --> 00:53:29,812
And you can probably find that by the homeless transportation numbers.

617
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,633
That would give you an estimate.

618
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:38,174
Priscilla's Pantry is in coordination with the YMCA.

619
00:53:38,734 --> 00:53:39,134
Oh, OK.

620
00:53:39,154 --> 00:53:39,875
I didn't realize that.

621
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:41,195
They partnered with us on that project.

622
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:47,346
I think it's great, the fact that you're teaching them how to cook and be independent people is very impressive to me.

623
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:51,250
I was just curious how many people we're serving.

624
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:58,877
I want to know what it starts at so then as we watch it grow we can say, remember there was 8 kids and now there's 80 kids.

625
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:02,018
Okay.

626
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:02,639
Mr. Ruggiero.

627
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:09,881
Mayor Burkett, but also Madam Superintendent, it would be interesting to know how many parents or families have been affected by the government shutdown.

628
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:17,504
I mean, I've been hearing that there have been a lot of reports, sort of, no one affected by me directly, but sort of secondhand information.

629
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:23,826
And it'd be interesting to know if we could do more, either through Priscilla's Pantry, if we could figure something out.

630
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:28,008
And I will try to find out that information.

631
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:32,097
I just want to express a little level of concern.

632
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:37,321
While I'm interested in those numbers, I'm more interested in the confidentiality of the students.

633
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:43,905
And I wouldn't want any reporting out to put pressure.

634
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:46,407
Yeah, so just that balance.

635
00:54:46,427 --> 00:54:53,452
So it's just a total number of homeless within the district and total number of students served?

636
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:54,653
Utilizing the pantry.

637
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:57,955
We need to keep in mind, for instance, there was a photo of

638
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:07,694
the event that you referenced about the, that not every one of those students necessarily was homeless or whatever, and that it's open to students and whatever.

639
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:19,719
I just wanted, you know, I'm just concerned that because we're interested in the numbers and in due diligence and all the rest, we don't then discourage kids who really need to go from going.

640
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:24,481
So hot off the press, I was texted some intel.

641
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:26,822
Approximately 15 students

642
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:31,375
participated and had some chili.

643
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:36,437
So it's approximately around 15, but I will get a confirmation.

644
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:48,341
Wonderful.

645
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:51,162
Next up, report on kindergarten registration.

646
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:51,422
Ms.

647
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:51,922
Caldwell.

648
00:55:53,735 --> 00:55:54,575
Good evening, everyone.

649
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:56,856
Well, it's that time of year again.

650
00:55:56,916 --> 00:56:04,699
We have to start preparing for our two, I know it sounds amazing, 2019-20 kindergartners coming in.

651
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:11,581
So I just wanted to provide you with a packet that I'd like you to endorse so that I can put it up on the website for our families.

652
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:18,364
Medford Public Schools will begin kindergarten registration the week of March 4th, 2019.

653
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:22,465
Informational packets with required documentation and registration

654
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:29,015
will be available on the Medford Public Schools website, as well as at the Parent Information Center.

655
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,641
at Medford High School, and we hope to do this by the end of January.

656
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:38,663
In addition, we'll present Building Bridges to Kindergarten on the following dates.

657
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:42,464
And this is important for our families to come to these presentations.

658
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:48,105
Maria Michelli is a veteran kindergarten teacher at the Brooks Elementary School.

659
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:53,207
She's going to present to our families what it's like to be in kindergarten.

660
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:54,047
It's a slideshow.

661
00:56:55,164 --> 00:57:03,113
And I encourage you to come because it shows all about the classrooms and the little learning centers that they have in the classrooms.

662
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:09,039
We talk about school safety and the curriculum, so it's a good find for our families.

663
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,724
And there are a lot of questions that they ask, especially about buses, getting your children on buses.

664
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:24,691
So the dates for building bridges will be Thursday, March 7th, and Tuesday, April 9th from 7 to 8 at Medford High School.

665
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:33,295
And then we will do an additional building bridges on Wednesday, May 1st from 7 to 8 at the McGlynn Elementary School.

666
00:57:34,175 --> 00:57:39,497
We also will provide free child care for our families who have little ones at home.

667
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:43,619
And they need to contact Marie Cassidy so that she can

668
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:48,053
get her people up so we can provide child care.

669
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:56,954
We do have a kindergarten open house on Wednesday, May 8th, at each of our elementary schools, which run from two to three.

670
00:57:57,294 --> 00:58:04,076
And the principals have the families come in with the children, and they can take a walk through the kindergarten classrooms.

671
00:58:05,036 --> 00:58:10,017
So in your package, you have the registration form, which all parents need to

672
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,763
see what kind of documents they need to register their children.

673
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:22,968
We will have the Parent Information Center open a couple of days for extended hours on the dates of building bridges.

674
00:58:24,009 --> 00:58:33,575
You have a flyer for building bridges to kindergarten that we would like to put up on the website for our families to read and to participate in.

675
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:34,776
And Ms.

676
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:40,019
Ray has also provided me with health information that our kindergartners need

677
00:58:40,557 --> 00:58:41,818
coming into our schools.

678
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:46,021
So with your permission, I'd like to put this on the website.

679
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:46,722
Ms.

680
00:58:46,742 --> 00:58:47,342
DiBenedetto.

681
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:47,922
Thank you.

682
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:57,069
This is great, a good way to welcome families into their first experience with our school district.

683
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,570
I just have a few questions.

684
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:03,694
Will interpreters be present at any of the open house?

685
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:07,337
So yes, there will be interpreters there.

686
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:10,219
We have Haitian, Creole, and Portuguese.

687
00:59:11,145 --> 00:59:11,585
That's great.

688
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:13,887
That represents the Neenah community.

689
00:59:14,268 --> 00:59:30,942
Also, I'm wondering if the registration office, the Parent Information Center, is going to have more staffing this year, later hours, and interpreters available, because last year there were some needs of

690
00:59:31,415 --> 00:59:33,375
families that came to my attention?

691
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:35,356
So we will have the interpreters.

692
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:42,077
We're going to do extended hours three different times, especially during vacation week in April.

693
00:59:42,097 --> 00:59:45,857
I've asked Anne to stay on so we have at least two.

694
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:52,659
Families can actually call in and make appointments, which might make it easier for them, especially our working families.

695
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:55,999
So we will have two.

696
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:57,239
We won't have any more than two.

697
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,060
But we also have to have nurses available to

698
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,095
do some of the health stuff with it.

699
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:03,776
That was my next question.

700
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:04,496
Yeah.

701
01:00:04,636 --> 01:00:04,916
Ms.

702
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,276
Ray provides us with a nurse.

703
01:00:07,096 --> 01:00:08,497
At all of the peak times?

704
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:08,877
Yes.

705
01:00:08,957 --> 01:00:10,497
Well, not at the third one.

706
01:00:10,657 --> 01:00:10,817
Ms.

707
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:16,918
Ray, we have them for the first two, but not at the McGlynn Elementary School, for the building bridges.

708
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:18,039
OK.

709
01:00:19,479 --> 01:00:29,601
So I'm more curious about the Parent Information Center and when parents need to access that and if there's any way we can streamline that and be really prepared

710
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:34,198
for new families to make it as easy for them as possible.

711
01:00:34,279 --> 01:00:40,984
Because for some families, getting up to the high school is difficult back and forth.

712
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:51,413
And if they have to go repeatedly because they forgot paperwork or they don't understand everything, a few families ran into that last year.

713
01:00:51,453 --> 01:00:54,055
Yeah, I understand that a few did run into that.

714
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:54,415
Yeah.

715
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:57,578
Well, we would like to provide them with as much help as we can.

716
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:05,781
We're actually going to set up the foyer so that if the children come with them, we have coloring books and things for the kids to do while they wait.

717
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:11,984
As long as there's interpreters and health person there that can help them with the health documents.

718
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:16,067
And we're very clear in our packets of what they need to bring.

719
01:01:16,787 --> 01:01:26,352
And maybe staff more, because a lot of this information takes a while to process with each parent.

720
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:33,686
So if there's only one person there, or if they step out for lunch, or to go to the bathroom, and if someone comes and it's not there.

721
01:01:35,227 --> 01:01:40,330
We have two people working, but we need to have people working who understand the process as well.

722
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,452
So I just can't put somebody in there.

723
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:44,973
But I understand your concerns.

724
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:45,493
OK.

725
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:46,494
All right.

726
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:47,375
Thank you.

727
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:48,535
Thank you for listening.

728
01:01:49,516 --> 01:01:50,817
Just one suggestion.

729
01:01:51,117 --> 01:01:51,257
Yes.

730
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:55,139
On the kindergarten registration parent, the form.

731
01:01:57,215 --> 01:02:04,957
The next to the last paragraph, it should be Medford Public Schools offers a before and after school program for registered students.

732
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:09,639
Registration for both programs will begin on Monday, April 1st, 2019.

733
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:16,421
Registration forms and pricing information will be available on the Medford Public Schools website.

734
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:21,362
Somewhere you need to indicate that it is not free.

735
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:24,093
or that there is a cost involved.

736
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:25,254
So... Great suggestion.

737
01:02:25,294 --> 01:02:25,575
Thank you.

738
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:25,995
I'll put that in.

739
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:26,515
Suggestion.

740
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:32,039
Also, I haven't figured out how to put it in, but it's not guaranteed.

741
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:38,924
It's not... We've had years where a wait list has needed to be developed.

742
01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:45,849
So I think it's important that parents available on a first come, first serve basis or something.

743
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,930
So if you would take a look at that, please.

744
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:48,991
I certainly will do that.

745
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:49,351
Thank you.

746
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:51,092
Thank you.

747
01:02:51,113 --> 01:02:51,433
Mr. Russo.

748
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:53,491
Thank you for this.

749
01:02:54,371 --> 01:03:10,826
Without making this first page into a seven-page document, I do note that the McGlynn is referenced and the Brooks is referenced, and it would not be illogical to conclude that this is a notice about these two elementary schools and that maybe there'll be another one coming later.

750
01:03:10,846 --> 01:03:11,146
I'm sorry.

751
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,247
Can you tell me what page you're on?

752
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:13,288
The very first page.

753
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:14,769
OK.

754
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,972
There's Building Bridges to Kindergarten at the McGlynn.

755
01:03:18,012 --> 01:03:18,873
There's one at the Brooks.

756
01:03:19,336 --> 01:03:20,396
There's no one at the Brooks.

757
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:24,358
The building bridges, two at the high school, and then at the McGlynn.

758
01:03:24,378 --> 01:03:26,218
And we try to round-robin them every year.

759
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,280
Last year it was at the Roberts, the year before I think we were at the Columbus.

760
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:42,404
I just think it needs to be explicit that no matter where you're, like if your kid is zoned for the Columbus because you live across the street, you might read this and decide, oh well this isn't, this is the McGlynn one.

761
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:44,505
I'll wait for the

762
01:03:44,982 --> 01:03:48,645
Okay, so I'll try to figure out what to put in there for language.

763
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:53,788
This is the report to us, the cover sheet.

764
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:58,371
Yes, that's just mine to you, so you know.

765
01:03:58,572 --> 01:04:12,041
But what's on the website, you know, if it says at the McGlynn Elementary is where this is taking place, it needs to be explicit that it's for all kindergartners regardless of where they're zoned.

766
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:13,630
And maybe it already says that.

767
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,252
I'll see if I can make that clearer than this.

768
01:04:16,392 --> 01:04:16,672
Yes.

769
01:04:20,033 --> 01:04:20,253
Yes.

770
01:04:20,934 --> 01:04:28,277
Yeah, that would solve it.

771
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:32,198
Where it says up on the top?

772
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,961
I can certainly make that change.

773
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:40,022
Yeah, something like that.

774
01:04:41,602 --> 01:04:41,962
All right.

775
01:04:42,262 --> 01:04:42,802
Thank you.

776
01:04:42,822 --> 01:04:43,422
Thank you.

777
01:04:45,023 --> 01:04:45,843
Mr. Benedetto.

778
01:04:46,803 --> 01:05:05,107
Getting back to the language that my colleague was talking about, about the after school program, there are some families that didn't even get added to a wait list at the beginning of this year when they tried to add their children on.

779
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:10,401
So I'm not sure we are meeting the needs of our families in that way.

780
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:27,952
And I would like a report or I would like some information on the numbers of students in the wait list for after school and before school programming so we can maybe start addressing the needs of the district in hiring

781
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:29,052
earlier.

782
01:05:29,072 --> 01:05:31,794
I know hiring is very difficult.

783
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:33,916
I know you know, you understand the process.

784
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:37,460
It's very difficult right now to start to hire people.

785
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,982
But we can see what our needers know.

786
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:47,429
Well, so when parents come to register their children, they have to register in the proximity zone of their children.

787
01:05:47,449 --> 01:05:48,130
A lot of

788
01:05:48,571 --> 01:06:00,458
Families like to request other schools, but when they register, if you're in the Columbus School neighborhood, then you register there and you can apply for before and after school in that building.

789
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:12,104
I have to say that our before and after school coordinator is doing, Megan's doing a fantastic job trying to make sure that she includes as many students as she can.

790
01:06:14,165 --> 01:06:17,487
It is difficult to get people to work because the hours are very,

791
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:21,844
challenging, you can say, you know, 1.30 to 6 o'clock.

792
01:06:22,724 --> 01:06:24,745
So it's hard to get people to work those hours.

793
01:06:25,426 --> 01:06:27,267
And I know that Megan will look into it.

794
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:30,249
But yeah, we can try to get that information.

795
01:06:30,649 --> 01:06:38,234
I just want to know what we need to meet the need of the current families on the wait list, even without worrying about kindergartners coming in.

796
01:06:38,614 --> 01:06:39,795
You know, I think Ms.

797
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:45,399
Fidler-Carey was going to find out if we still had people wait listed, but I can certainly ask her.

798
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:46,680
Yeah, that would be great.

799
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,180
Thank you.

800
01:06:47,658 --> 01:06:48,198
You're welcome.

801
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:49,139
Mr. Ruggiero.

802
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:54,123
I'm sorry to keep giving you little corrections or suggestions to the board.

803
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:54,803
Oh, thank you so much.

804
01:06:54,883 --> 01:06:55,204
I love it.

805
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:58,786
This is on the second page under section one.

806
01:06:59,707 --> 01:07:05,812
Is it possible you could just include the exact URL that they need to download it so they could just click on that?

807
01:07:06,372 --> 01:07:07,853
It says medfordpublicschools.org.

808
01:07:07,873 --> 01:07:09,454
Could you just do the black slash?

809
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:15,019
Because our website can be a little difficult, especially for someone who has limited English skills.

810
01:07:17,812 --> 01:07:19,794
More detailed.

811
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:21,235
Such as myself, perhaps.

812
01:07:21,815 --> 01:07:24,137
And with that, I'd like to recommend that we put this online.

813
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,058
I motion to approve.

814
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:31,162
I motion that this report be accepted and that the revised versions be posted to the website.

815
01:07:31,662 --> 01:07:33,003
Seconded by Mr. Matadetto.

816
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:33,804
All those in favor?

817
01:07:33,824 --> 01:07:34,184
Aye.

818
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:35,145
All those opposed?

819
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:35,765
Motion passes.

820
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:36,426
Thank you, Ms.

821
01:07:36,506 --> 01:07:36,926
Caldwell.

822
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:43,671
Next up, recommendation to approve field trip, Medford High School science and leadership enrichment trip.

823
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:47,979
Oh, there's a motion on the floor to approve.

824
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:52,001
Would you like to talk to us?

825
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:53,902
Please tell us about the job.

826
01:07:54,483 --> 01:07:56,644
For those who don't know me, my name is Audrey Fator.

827
01:07:56,664 --> 01:07:58,645
I'm a science teacher at the high school.

828
01:07:58,685 --> 01:08:01,867
I teach environmental science and biology, and this is my 20th year there.

829
01:08:04,308 --> 01:08:05,329
Which is weird to say.

830
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,972
It's a great number.

831
01:08:09,573 --> 01:08:14,257
So some of you might be familiar with, I have done this trip before.

832
01:08:14,297 --> 01:08:15,838
This will be my third time doing it.

833
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,521
So I went this past February 2018.

834
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,722
I went in 2016.

835
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,485
So I've been doing it every other year just because it's a lot of

836
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,753
planning ahead of time.

837
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:33,439
This year for next time I'm going to try April just to try something a little different and not worry about the snow as much getting out of here.

838
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:46,048
So what do you have the packet you have is my proposal that I put together based on the newer guidelines that the committee approved last year for the updated guidelines for the proposal.

839
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:48,610
So basically

840
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:59,197
What the trip entails is that Disney YES program is a youth education series program, and they have all sorts of courses, of course, being science, that's what I'm gearing towards.

841
01:09:00,037 --> 01:09:07,020
And basically, the students go to about three-hour courses where it's all hands-on learning with different fields.

842
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:18,285
So I tend to pick two of the different fields of physical science and zoology and wildlife conservation, and then the third one being leadership and teamwork.

843
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:27,617
So throughout the course of the week, they go to these classes, and then they have some free time after that they can enjoy themselves and relax a little bit.

844
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:32,598
So again, this will be my third time doing the trip.

845
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:40,540
So in the packet, what you have is just some information about the youth education series, the programs that I am anticipating.

846
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,741
They are pending approval from Disney, but I don't really see an issue because I usually

847
01:09:45,631 --> 01:09:48,532
way ahead of the curve in applying and getting everything done.

848
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:58,376
And one of the reasons why I'm here today, and I appreciate you hearing me out today, is because I do like to give parents as much notice as possible to budget and save for the trip.

849
01:09:58,456 --> 01:10:01,518
So I wanted to get the ball rolling soon.

850
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:04,259
I'll have my first student interest meeting next week.

851
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:09,900
just to inform the students and give them a lot of this information, and then I'll have a parent meeting early February.

852
01:10:10,221 --> 01:10:14,663
And then they can decide if it's something that's a right fit for them and their child.

853
01:10:14,863 --> 01:10:17,924
And I don't know if the sweat is subtle, but it does look like Mickey Mouse.

854
01:10:18,604 --> 01:10:18,885
It is.

855
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:19,525
OK.

856
01:10:21,246 --> 01:10:23,186
I'm like, I didn't want to embarrass you if it wasn't.

857
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:26,028
I have lots of Disney clothes that I wear.

858
01:10:26,048 --> 01:10:26,548
Cute.

859
01:10:33,043 --> 01:10:36,486
So the last trip we just had this year, well, let me back up.

860
01:10:36,506 --> 01:10:39,008
So 2016, we had 14 students go.

861
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:40,570
This past year, in 2018, we had 27 go.

862
01:10:42,722 --> 01:10:44,023
I put on here estimated 30.

863
01:10:44,164 --> 01:10:45,685
I really can't predict.

864
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:49,849
I'm guessing it's going to be at least the same amount as it was this past year.

865
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,413
Traditionally in the past, I've taken juniors and seniors.

866
01:10:53,513 --> 01:10:56,676
This year I am, for next year, I'm going to do 10 through 12.

867
01:10:56,736 --> 01:10:58,558
So I'm going to open it to the sophomores as well.

868
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:00,900
So I anticipate that will probably bump the numbers.

869
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:06,666
And then the chaperone number will be based on the total number of students that we have going on the trip.

870
01:11:08,414 --> 01:11:17,440
What I also included for you was the estimated trip costs, which, again, I'm estimating because it's hard to know exactly between airfare, inflation.

871
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,182
You know, unfortunately, they push the airfare up for vacation weeks.

872
01:11:22,563 --> 01:11:30,928
But what I have included here is everything, and it does include the insurance, which is mandatory, and I would do that anyway, even if it wasn't suggested.

873
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:37,216
As soon as I do the deposit, the insurance is the first thing that I put the policies in place for the students.

874
01:11:39,136 --> 01:11:44,737
And then I also have listed what's not covered, and then my estimated dates for the parents.

875
01:11:45,577 --> 01:11:47,798
I will give this document to the parents as well at that meeting.

876
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:56,299
And then I printed out just four pages or two back-to-back of the insurance policy and the rider.

877
01:11:56,599 --> 01:12:00,940
It's 11 pages long, so being an environmental science teacher, I couldn't really bear to print out 11 pages.

878
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:06,946
So I did the first board which covers the nuts and bolts of it.

879
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:10,267
The rest is the legal definitions and all that stuff on there.

880
01:12:12,407 --> 01:12:15,428
And then these are the school rules that I used last time on the trip.

881
01:12:15,628 --> 01:12:20,030
I'll look them over again before we go just to make sure it lines up with anything that might change in the handbook.

882
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:26,685
that's in alignment with that time we go, but I just printed out the one that we used last time for this.

883
01:12:27,485 --> 01:12:30,147
So that's pretty much the gist of what's in the packet for you.

884
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:30,487
Very good.

885
01:12:30,907 --> 01:12:31,588
Thank you very much.

886
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:31,988
Yes.

887
01:12:32,588 --> 01:12:35,150
Mr. Benedetto, you got a motion on for approval?

888
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:37,312
A motion to approval and to volunteer as a...

889
01:12:42,472 --> 01:12:43,032
Chaperone.

890
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:44,153
Chaperone.

891
01:12:44,254 --> 01:12:45,515
At every trip.

892
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:46,776
There's a second by Ms.

893
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:47,276
Van de Kloet.

894
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,437
Roll call vote, please, Ms.

895
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:48,918
Mustone.

896
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:49,418
Ms.

897
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:51,300
Van de Kloet, do you have a dad on the line?

898
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:51,540
Yes.

899
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:52,260
Ms.

900
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:52,741
McCracken?

901
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:52,841
Yes.

902
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:53,021
Ms.

903
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:54,082
Mustone, yes.

904
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:54,142
Ms.

905
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:54,562
O'Neill, zero.

906
01:12:54,602 --> 01:12:54,662
Yes.

907
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:54,743
Ms.

908
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,143
Moore, seven.

909
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:55,523
I have a state.

910
01:12:55,643 --> 01:12:56,784
On the field trip?

911
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:56,924
Yes.

912
01:12:59,507 --> 01:13:00,407
Yes, you do.

913
01:13:00,447 --> 01:13:00,688
Yes, I do.

914
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:03,030
I have a state.

915
01:13:06,693 --> 01:13:06,833
Ms.

916
01:13:06,933 --> 01:13:07,514
Van de Kloet?

917
01:13:07,594 --> 01:13:07,734
Yes.

918
01:13:09,395 --> 01:13:12,417
Yes, six in the affirmative, one abstain, motion passes.

919
01:13:12,918 --> 01:13:13,258
Thank you.

920
01:13:13,658 --> 01:13:13,999
Thank you.

921
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:14,799
Have fun.

922
01:13:18,463 --> 01:13:23,867
Report on English language learners from Mr. Teixeira.

923
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:29,712
Good evening.

924
01:13:29,932 --> 01:13:30,433
Good evening.

925
01:13:40,356 --> 01:13:41,557
I don't need it just yet.

926
01:13:41,637 --> 01:13:43,359
That's kind of the tail end of this.

927
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:05,543
I believe everyone has a copy of the report in your packet, so I'm not going to read it to you, but just to give you the high-level parts.

928
01:14:06,103 --> 01:14:15,647
The CPR, the EL department is in compliance and is out of corrective action as of November 15th.

929
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:24,810
For the McGlynn redesign update, as I said, I've been meeting with teachers to, you know, get their feedback.

930
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,953
to see what improvements or changes need to be made.

931
01:14:29,454 --> 01:14:30,555
We've been working on that.

932
01:14:30,635 --> 01:14:40,309
We started a professional development program to help the co-teachers who are working with EL teachers that now have level one students in their classrooms.

933
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,531
That's new for everyone.

934
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:56,896
I've received the evaluations and I've received positive feedback on the program that's being put into place to support both the EL teachers and the science teachers and obviously the students.

935
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:01,239
I'm sorry?

936
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:02,140
Is that with Lesley?

937
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:23,473
No, that's a different, that was with, it's an organization, they're an EL consulting group called Confianza, and they specialize in working with English learners and co-teaching models, and it was actually perfect for what we brought to the McGlynn for our changes.

938
01:15:24,528 --> 01:15:28,570
The Lesley University partnership is an internship partnership.

939
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:42,017
So Lesley University has a program where teacher candidates can get their elementary certification as well as their EL certification in like a 15-month period.

940
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:42,958
It's pretty intense.

941
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:53,952
So they do a year-long internship with a duly certified EL and content teacher, elementary certified teacher.

942
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:57,415
So we have one at the McGlynn and one at the Roberts.

943
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,197
They work Monday through Friday.

944
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:01,718
They started in August.

945
01:16:01,838 --> 01:16:02,879
They'll finish in June.

946
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:06,001
They take all of their classes after school hours.

947
01:16:06,281 --> 01:16:07,762
So that's the intense part.

948
01:16:09,223 --> 01:16:22,293
But what works out really well is not only is it a benefit to those buildings and those schools having another person in, they get an educational experience that's, it's like coming in as a second year teacher in your first year.

949
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:23,554
It's pretty amazing.

950
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:33,402
So hopefully, you know, we'll continue that partnership next year and as numbers continue to grow, we can spread it into other buildings.

951
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,569
We're currently in the middle of our access testing.

952
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:45,377
If all goes according to plan, we will be done by January 26th, which I think is the earliest we've ever been done in the district.

953
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:49,582
Technology department, I have to give them credit.

954
01:16:49,722 --> 01:16:55,828
They really busted to make sure that we got everything up and running.

955
01:16:56,228 --> 01:17:07,360
The additional devices that have been purchased over the years also have contributed to us being able to decrease the number of days we're actually testing our students, and then we can get back to teaching them.

956
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:13,523
And then I did put on here 2018, last year's access data.

957
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:15,624
It's on the chart.

958
01:17:16,204 --> 01:17:20,505
And in every single building, we either met or exceeded our targets.

959
01:17:21,605 --> 01:17:27,947
DESE has a very complex system for establishing these targets, and they changed again for 2019.

960
01:17:29,087 --> 01:17:31,148
So I don't know what they'll look like next year.

961
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,689
It's literally like trying to hit a moving target.

962
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:43,392
It changes from year to year, but just looking at the growth, that's kind of what I was focusing on.

963
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:48,153
The growth in all of the buildings was incredible.

964
01:17:49,674 --> 01:17:53,976
Even though at the middle school level we may have gone down, we still met the target.

965
01:17:54,516 --> 01:18:00,038
I will be curious next year to see how this redesign of the middle school program will change that.

966
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:07,200
We get these results in June, like last day of May, first day of June.

967
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,801
They won't actually give us these targets.

968
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:12,744
We won't get that till over the summer.

969
01:18:12,944 --> 01:18:14,285
Over the summer, we'll get that.

970
01:18:14,425 --> 01:18:18,748
But I'll give you a similar report next year to see where that lands.

971
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,650
Any questions on any of this?

972
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:22,431
Ms.

973
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:22,911
Mestone.

974
01:18:24,352 --> 01:18:25,293
I have a report.

975
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:33,454
Can you just explain to me how the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts all have taken the access test in 2017 and 2018, but not the Brooks?

976
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:35,415
Oh, the N.A.

977
01:18:35,455 --> 01:18:43,398
means that there's not a large enough population to get the data to make a target and submit the target.

978
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:45,980
Do you know the number that you need?

979
01:18:46,842 --> 01:18:57,251
No, because the numbers are so small, it's statistically insignificant and the department doesn't actually give us any data for that.

980
01:18:58,252 --> 01:18:59,353
So they do take it.

981
01:19:00,594 --> 01:19:12,625
And the struggle that we have with the Brooks is because the newcomers program is first and second grade, which is now our larger population, their first year was last year.

982
01:19:14,452 --> 01:19:15,293
It was 2018.

983
01:19:15,353 --> 01:19:16,074
It was 2018.

984
01:19:16,214 --> 01:19:16,455
Okay.

985
01:19:18,076 --> 01:19:30,911
And then in the other grade levels, there may only be five students in fifth grade, four students in fourth grade, and that's not enough data to actually put, to build the targets or to give us any

986
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:38,376
I don't have that data, but I can look at individual students to see who's making progress and who's not making progress.

987
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:41,037
And that was something that we did at the beginning of this year.

988
01:19:41,758 --> 01:19:49,942
And all of the teachers received a progress monitoring form, regardless of whether it was the Brooks or the Roberts or the McGlynn.

989
01:19:50,882 --> 01:19:57,806
They received a progress monitoring form for all the students who didn't make progress, all of the individual students who didn't make progress.

990
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:08,845
So the Roberts has the newcomers for third, fourth, and fifth.

991
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:12,606
And to place out of newcomers, they take the access test.

992
01:20:14,186 --> 01:20:15,266
That's one factor.

993
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:16,046
OK.

994
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:23,088
So then how do the children at the Columbus and the McGlynn take the access test?

995
01:20:23,128 --> 01:20:24,989
They cannot be in the newcomers class.

996
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:26,969
Access isn't just for newcomers.

997
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:30,910
It's for any student who is currently listed as an English learner in the district.

998
01:20:31,663 --> 01:20:48,181
Okay, so there's English learners in the Columbus and the McGlynn, but not newcomers programs, that are a significant amount of students that they can take the, they have the data to give you a MET target or a C target, but there's not the number at the Brooks.

999
01:20:48,946 --> 01:20:50,708
That is English language learners.

1000
01:20:50,968 --> 01:20:55,872
Of total population of English learners at the Brooks is not high enough.

1001
01:20:56,353 --> 01:21:03,319
And with the first and second grade, which is our higher number, the students if they're first year?

1002
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:03,499
Yes.

1003
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,804
There's no, it's based on their growth from the previous year.

1004
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:16,410
So those students can't be calculated into it, just like the students in the third grade at the Roberts can't be calculated into it.

1005
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:22,855
But there are enough other students in grade three to get that statistical figure.

1006
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:26,218
And because it's percents, I don't know the number of actual students.

1007
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:29,901
So do you know, do the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts have

1008
01:21:30,243 --> 01:21:34,504
pretty similar numbers of students who take the access test?

1009
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:36,565
So yes.

1010
01:21:36,645 --> 01:21:50,748
I mean, the McGlynn, the Roberts, Columbus, they're all anywhere from 75 to 90 students.

1011
01:21:52,488 --> 01:21:58,830
And then obviously, kindergarten isn't included in this either, because that would be the first year, regardless of what building they're in.

1012
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,724
Thank you.

1013
01:22:08,627 --> 01:22:09,448
Mr. Ruggiero.

1014
01:22:10,348 --> 01:22:12,709
And maybe this will be covered in the report.

1015
01:22:12,749 --> 01:22:14,010
I didn't see it here on the slide.

1016
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:18,972
Could you give us like the top five languages spoken by percent, is that?

1017
01:22:19,445 --> 01:22:32,541
Well, not by percent, but I can tell you Portuguese is our number one language, followed by Haitian Creole, and then Spanish and Arabic are kind of tied neck and neck for third, and then everything else is, yeah.

1018
01:22:34,073 --> 01:22:36,474
Can you give us a sense of how many students speak Arabic?

1019
01:22:37,734 --> 01:22:38,674
I'd have to look it up.

1020
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:40,115
I wouldn't be able to guess that.

1021
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:50,437
The reason why I ask is for the prior mentioned kindergarten affair might be if we have a large percentage of Arabic speakers it might be useful to have translators for them available as well.

1022
01:22:51,057 --> 01:22:54,278
It's possible we could find someone in the community that would be willing to volunteer.

1023
01:22:56,447 --> 01:22:58,708
With a registration process, I'm not quite sure.

1024
01:22:58,728 --> 01:22:59,348
For kindergarten.

1025
01:22:59,368 --> 01:23:01,649
This is not your, this is the prior presentation.

1026
01:23:01,929 --> 01:23:02,249
Right.

1027
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:03,009
I'm not sure.

1028
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:07,510
Do we know if we have many Arabic-speaking kindergarten students or first grade students?

1029
01:23:07,951 --> 01:23:11,492
For incoming, I wouldn't be able to determine that number.

1030
01:23:11,592 --> 01:23:17,113
But for kindergarten, I can figure out how many we have currently this year.

1031
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:20,074
I wouldn't want to venture a guess.

1032
01:23:20,614 --> 01:23:22,275
Could you find that information out for us next time?

1033
01:23:22,295 --> 01:23:23,315
Because it would be interesting for me.

1034
01:23:23,335 --> 01:23:23,755
Can you speak to Ms.

1035
01:23:23,775 --> 01:23:25,436
Caldwell if you feel there's a need?

1036
01:23:29,362 --> 01:23:40,680
With regard to our Arabic-speaking families, because most of our Arabic-speaking families are coming here for medical reasons, there's an organization called, I think it's International House,

1037
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,283
And they always send translators with our Arabic-speaking families.

1038
01:23:45,343 --> 01:23:49,745
It's very rare that we need to, for the registration process.

1039
01:23:50,306 --> 01:23:56,209
The Parent Information Center has gotten to know many of the translators from this organization very well.

1040
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,451
Yep.

1041
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:11,103
Ms.

1042
01:24:11,123 --> 01:24:11,383
Mostow.

1043
01:24:11,403 --> 01:24:18,247
Can you tell us how many EL teachers you have at each of the four elementary schools?

1044
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:22,349
So, hang on, let me just go down my list.

1045
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:30,573
I just want to say, point of clarification, that not all schools carry the same amount of EL teachers because they don't carry the full program.

1046
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:48,460
going or what I'm wondering is if the Roberts, the McGlynn, and the Columbus have more teachers, more resources, do children who are in the neighborhood of Brooks not go to the Brooks because there's more EL teachers at the Roberts, the Columbus, and the McGlynn?

1047
01:24:49,321 --> 01:24:52,984
That wouldn't be a factor on which school the students go to.

1048
01:24:53,204 --> 01:24:54,886
It is still based on their neighborhood.

1049
01:24:55,346 --> 01:24:59,870
The only difference would be for the newcomer students where we funnel them to

1050
01:25:00,655 --> 01:25:05,499
The Brooks for grades one and two, and then the Roberts for grades three to five.

1051
01:25:05,719 --> 01:25:06,059
OK.

1052
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,923
So do you know, though, how many EL teachers are at each elementary?

1053
01:25:10,303 --> 01:25:25,616
So for the newcomer program, so at the Brooks, grade one has a teacher, grade two has a teacher, and then there's a pull-out, what we call pull-out EL, and she services grades three through five.

1054
01:25:25,796 --> 01:25:27,317
So there are three teachers at the Brooks.

1055
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:28,398
OK, great.

1056
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:30,313
Okay.

1057
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:30,673
All right.

1058
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:37,058
And then the McGlynn Elementary is all pullout.

1059
01:25:37,519 --> 01:25:52,070
And so all of these figures are determined, I mean, the number of staff that we have in each building is determined not only by grade level, but we have service hours that we're required to provide to EL students based on their level.

1060
01:25:52,271 --> 01:25:52,491
Okay.

1061
01:25:54,272 --> 01:26:04,697
Levels, you know three four and five students which require one to two periods a day depending upon their level So we have three teachers at the McGlynn elementary and they're all pull out and they're all pull out.

1062
01:26:04,877 --> 01:26:05,217
Okay, and

1063
01:26:06,865 --> 01:26:18,333
And then at Columbus Elementary, we have three, same setup, three teachers, and same setup as the McGlynn, where they're mostly levels three, four, or five students.

1064
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:24,838
And then the Roberts, we have one dedicated teacher per grade level, grade three, four, and five.

1065
01:26:25,879 --> 01:26:30,262
For the newcomers program, one teacher in each grade level, and two pull-out teachers.

1066
01:26:31,238 --> 01:26:33,262
So three newcomers, two pull-outs.

1067
01:26:33,283 --> 01:26:33,864
Pull-outs, right.

1068
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:34,485
Thank you.

1069
01:26:34,525 --> 01:26:35,086
I appreciate it.

1070
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:39,816
So it will look like, well, the Roberts has five teachers, but three of those grade levels are for newcomers.

1071
01:26:39,896 --> 01:26:40,137
Right.

1072
01:26:40,257 --> 01:26:40,437
Right.

1073
01:26:41,019 --> 01:26:41,319
OK.

1074
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:41,780
Thank you.

1075
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:48,402
Is there a motion?

1076
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:50,323
Oh, you still have a presentation.

1077
01:26:50,363 --> 01:26:50,624
I'm sorry.

1078
01:26:50,984 --> 01:26:53,466
So I just put together this PowerPoint.

1079
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:57,389
I actually did it for my department and thought you might find this interesting.

1080
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:02,133
So this is on a federal level.

1081
01:27:02,353 --> 01:27:04,495
There are almost 5 million English learners.

1082
01:27:05,015 --> 01:27:07,437
This is from data from 2014 to 15.

1083
01:27:08,318 --> 01:27:12,922
But English learners are the fastest growing population of students in grades K through 12.

1084
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:20,306
Nationwide, about 10% of the population are English learners.

1085
01:27:21,788 --> 01:27:24,370
So then this is what it looks like on the state level.

1086
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:29,914
So the graph on the top shows the total number of students in K to 12 schools.

1087
01:27:30,314 --> 01:27:34,198
And you see it was going up from 2012, and it peaked in 2015.

1088
01:27:35,038 --> 01:27:43,025
And something happened in 2016 where the overall numbers just dropped for total enrollment.

1089
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:47,050
in public schools, so I'm guessing baby boom years or something.

1090
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:53,357
And now it's on a steady, now it's going up from 2016, it's on the rise again.

1091
01:27:53,898 --> 01:28:00,126
But if you look at the percentage, the graph on the left, the percentage of English learners in Massachusetts public schools,

1092
01:28:01,102 --> 01:28:03,602
The line has steadily been going up.

1093
01:28:03,762 --> 01:28:14,904
So Medford is reflective of what's happening in the country at large in terms of being the fastest growing population of students, school-age students in public schools.

1094
01:28:16,285 --> 01:28:19,405
Across the state, we have about 100,000 English learners.

1095
01:28:22,026 --> 01:28:24,506
And then here's Medford's data.

1096
01:28:25,686 --> 01:28:26,406
So we have about 11%.

1097
01:28:27,347 --> 01:28:29,447
We're a little bit higher than the state average.

1098
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:33,471
as well as the federal average.

1099
01:28:34,931 --> 01:28:47,074
So as of this, which was I think October, we had 456 students currently receiving English learner services, in addition to 235 students who are what we call fell students.

1100
01:28:47,094 --> 01:28:49,095
These are former English learner students.

1101
01:28:50,355 --> 01:28:57,137
After a student is exited from an English learner program, we monitor them for a four-year period, just to make sure that

1102
01:28:58,783 --> 01:28:59,604
nothing's come up.

1103
01:29:00,766 --> 01:29:07,434
With our younger students who are learning to read, you know, sometimes it's like, oh, yeah, they're proficient, and the data shows it.

1104
01:29:07,494 --> 01:29:08,615
The access test shows it.

1105
01:29:08,655 --> 01:29:10,678
Their class, you know, their classwork shows it.

1106
01:29:11,038 --> 01:29:15,664
We might find out, oh, no, they still need some support, so we can bring them back into the fold.

1107
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:29,038
And then this, again, talking about trying to hit moving targets in terms of trying to figure out what our numbers are and where they're going.

1108
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:33,542
And there's a lot going on on this slide, so I'll try to explain it best.

1109
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:36,825
But obviously, we have it broken down by elementary, middle, and high school.

1110
01:29:37,225 --> 01:29:40,328
I'm just going to focus on the total ELs in the district.

1111
01:29:40,988 --> 01:29:44,331
But I use October as my...

1112
01:29:45,585 --> 01:29:49,187
moment in time, because that's when we submit our October SIMS.

1113
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:55,030
So the first band, the dark orange color, was October 2017.

1114
01:29:55,510 --> 01:30:00,513
And we had 403 students.

1115
01:30:00,553 --> 01:30:02,594
That's what we started the year with last year.

1116
01:30:03,495 --> 01:30:07,077
By June, we had 487 English learners.

1117
01:30:07,457 --> 01:30:10,639
So that was our increase from October.

1118
01:30:10,659 --> 01:30:11,139
Say that again.

1119
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:11,879
Sorry, those numbers.

1120
01:30:12,099 --> 01:30:12,820
We had 487.

1121
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,601
And what was the prior number?

1122
01:30:15,975 --> 01:30:16,055
403.

1123
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:16,055
Wow.

1124
01:30:17,596 --> 01:30:21,739
So we're constantly testing students throughout the school year.

1125
01:30:21,799 --> 01:30:23,640
We're constantly adding students.

1126
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,901
Our numbers are growing.

1127
01:30:25,661 --> 01:30:28,423
So that was our number in June was 487.

1128
01:30:28,644 --> 01:30:38,411
Now through, you know, at the high school, obviously 12th grade students when they leave, any students that we reclassify as a FAL, a former English learner, they come out.

1129
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:42,974
Even though we're still monitoring them, they're not actively receiving the EL services.

1130
01:30:43,594 --> 01:30:48,839
So then the following October, we started the year with 456 students.

1131
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:57,386
So if I use that October moment in time as my gauge, we're increasing about 20% each year.

1132
01:30:57,406 --> 01:31:07,994
Any questions on this?

1133
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:09,075
Thank you.

1134
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,793
The overall population?

1135
01:31:25,554 --> 01:31:28,075
I haven't been collecting that data.

1136
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:39,741
I've only been looking at the English.

1137
01:31:39,881 --> 01:31:43,543
I haven't looked at total numbers, so I can't comment on that.

1138
01:31:46,552 --> 01:31:47,232
Thank you very much.

1139
01:31:47,572 --> 01:31:51,094
Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

1140
01:31:51,134 --> 01:31:52,174
Placed it on file.

1141
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:55,355
So moved by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1142
01:31:56,035 --> 01:31:56,796
All those in favor?

1143
01:31:56,816 --> 01:31:58,296
Who was the second?

1144
01:31:58,436 --> 01:31:59,076
Mr. Russo.

1145
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:00,097
All those opposed?

1146
01:32:00,717 --> 01:32:01,417
Motion passes.

1147
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:02,498
Thank you.

1148
01:32:04,798 --> 01:32:06,779
Follow-up report on obesity numbers.

1149
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,420
Good evening.

1150
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:09,760
Hi.

1151
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:14,942
So last month, I presented information about a donation from Hallmark Health.

1152
01:32:15,861 --> 01:32:18,943
that we're using to fund a grade four fitness program.

1153
01:32:19,063 --> 01:32:25,107
And the committee requested additional information about our mandated screenings for growth.

1154
01:32:26,027 --> 01:32:37,154
So essentially, the two tables that you have show the data from the 2018 end of the year status report that's given to the Department of Public Health.

1155
01:32:38,015 --> 01:32:44,819
And we can see from the report that for children that are categorized as in the overweight category, that's

1156
01:32:45,673 --> 01:32:47,533
a BMI between 85 and 95%.

1157
01:32:50,494 --> 01:32:57,135
They have a short burst increase in around grade four, and then their growth steadily declines.

1158
01:32:57,215 --> 01:33:00,216
And that's very consistent with the normal growth pattern of children.

1159
01:33:02,396 --> 01:33:12,998
What I did notice is that students that start out at a young age, categorized in the obese category, a BMI over 95%, their growth trajectory

1160
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:18,733
just continues on a steady increase through grade 10.

1161
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:41,500
So we say there's reason for schools to offer physical fitness programs and to encourage the adoption of healthy, long-lasting health habits and physical fitness, which we do through our recess programs, our health ed and physical education programs that we offer in the district.

1162
01:33:43,771 --> 01:33:49,052
One new, actually I have some flyers to pass out.

1163
01:33:52,213 --> 01:33:59,594
We have a new community partnership with the Malden YMCA.

1164
01:34:01,515 --> 01:34:06,736
They're sponsoring a healthy living program for families.

1165
01:34:07,696 --> 01:34:13,157
The Malden YMCA is now the parent organization for the

1166
01:34:13,812 --> 01:34:15,152
Medford Boys and Girls Club.

1167
01:34:16,092 --> 01:34:23,654
This program is offered to Medford residents, and it's a 25-session course.

1168
01:34:23,754 --> 01:34:33,676
It's for families to attend together, and it marries physical education with nutrition, meal planning, and healthy eating habits.

1169
01:34:34,076 --> 01:34:41,077
So we have advertised the program on our website and made information available in all the school nurses' offices.

1170
01:34:42,537 --> 01:34:47,342
all families can be informed about this and take advantage of the opportunity.

1171
01:34:55,229 --> 01:34:57,050
These statistics are really concerning to me.

1172
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,192
These aren't unique to Medford, of course.

1173
01:34:59,572 --> 01:35:00,132
Not at all.

1174
01:35:00,672 --> 01:35:01,953
We're looking at an epidemic.

1175
01:35:01,973 --> 01:35:04,995
Unfortunately, they're reflective of the United States.

1176
01:35:05,295 --> 01:35:05,515
Right.

1177
01:35:05,656 --> 01:35:12,460
We're looking at an epidemic of obesity in this country, which have, as everyone here I'm sure knows, has long-lasting health effects.

1178
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:24,127
So I'd like to suggest to the committee that we create a community of the whole when possible, perhaps whenever you think we could put together something to see how we could tackle this problem.

1179
01:35:25,248 --> 01:35:31,294
Perhaps we could welcome in some experts in childhood obesity to speak with us.

1180
01:35:32,175 --> 01:35:39,241
Because there have to be some schools in America that are beginning to figure this problem out.

1181
01:35:40,062 --> 01:35:40,883
We can't do nothing.

1182
01:35:42,745 --> 01:35:47,890
For children to have these issues going forward, they might have health issues the rest of their life.

1183
01:35:50,365 --> 01:35:51,726
I don't think we're doing nothing.

1184
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:59,453
We can look for people to come speak.

1185
01:35:59,793 --> 01:36:09,261
There's a couple programs through Children's Hospital that we can certainly approach the organizers of.

1186
01:36:10,558 --> 01:36:11,278
Yeah, I want to clarify.

1187
01:36:11,318 --> 01:36:13,679
I didn't mean to imply that you're not doing anything.

1188
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:14,779
That was the wrong idea.

1189
01:36:15,319 --> 01:36:20,920
This statistic is deeply frustrating to me, because I know how this can affect children as a prior educator myself.

1190
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:29,521
And I also know the health outcomes that children with this condition, once those fat cells are in there, they have to fight them their whole life.

1191
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:33,402
So I really hope that we could do that.

1192
01:36:33,422 --> 01:36:35,703
I'm looking for a second on the motion, if possible.

1193
01:36:37,383 --> 01:36:37,983
Is there a second?

1194
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:51,128
Just to repeat the motion, the motion is to have a committee of the whole to address what policies we can put in place to tackle the obesity epidemic in our district.

1195
01:36:55,652 --> 01:36:58,174
The date, we can all triangulate the date together.

1196
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:12,822
I don't think we have a nutrition subcommittee.

1197
01:37:12,902 --> 01:37:14,882
The curriculum would be the closest I can think of.

1198
01:37:14,942 --> 01:37:18,583
But I think it would be best served if we were all there to talk about this issue.

1199
01:37:18,604 --> 01:37:23,925
Because we're looking at almost 300 kids that are either overweight or obese.

1200
01:37:24,025 --> 01:37:26,886
And the obesity rates, we're looking at like 250 kids here.

1201
01:37:27,446 --> 01:37:29,607
I mean, that's just my back of the envelope calculation.

1202
01:37:29,627 --> 01:37:31,928
And that's a scary statistic.

1203
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,663
The health outcomes of these children are severe.

1204
01:37:37,063 --> 01:37:44,172
And whatever kind of solutions we have to think of outside of the box, welcome in other committees that maybe have some ideas.

1205
01:37:45,013 --> 01:37:52,403
I really hope that we as a committee can at least begin to think outside the box on this one, because America is, we're having trouble.

1206
01:37:53,766 --> 01:38:04,134
Here's the motion on the floor that this paper be sent to Committee of the Whole to explore options and policies, which is school committee purview policies, in this arena.

1207
01:38:04,955 --> 01:38:05,755
All those in favor?

1208
01:38:06,296 --> 01:38:06,416
Aye.

1209
01:38:06,996 --> 01:38:07,737
All those opposed?

1210
01:38:09,178 --> 01:38:09,839
Motion passes.

1211
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:11,560
Thank you.

1212
01:38:12,221 --> 01:38:15,803
Thank you.

1213
01:38:16,184 --> 01:38:18,906
For grade 10, there's 104 males that were screened and 114 females.

1214
01:38:23,529 --> 01:38:27,691
And I think the grade 10 class is more around the 300 number.

1215
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:29,912
So was it optional if the kids were screened?

1216
01:38:30,433 --> 01:38:33,334
Some students and some families do opt out.

1217
01:38:33,714 --> 01:38:34,034
OK.

1218
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:39,937
So would you say you had 100 students opt out, or is it just a sampling?

1219
01:38:40,298 --> 01:38:42,579
I didn't dig that far into that.

1220
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:47,341
I purely looked at the number of students that we screened that year.

1221
01:38:49,122 --> 01:38:51,623
It's likely some students may have opted out.

1222
01:38:54,343 --> 01:38:55,624
Some families may have opted out.

1223
01:38:55,664 --> 01:38:57,766
We may have missed some absentee students.

1224
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,169
So that's the information.

1225
01:39:02,249 --> 01:39:07,773
But I'm just wondering, would people who are suffering with obesity opt out?

1226
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,194
Would the numbers be worse?

1227
01:39:09,214 --> 01:39:09,655
They may.

1228
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:10,215
They may.

1229
01:39:10,295 --> 01:39:23,165
And since the initiation of the Affordable Care Act, more and more students are receiving primary care through a pediatrician or a family physician.

1230
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,202
Growth monitoring is part of that.

1231
01:39:27,864 --> 01:39:39,676
So families that are taking advantage of a yearly physical are receiving that monitoring and those types of education through their primary care physician.

1232
01:39:41,318 --> 01:39:41,699
Thank you.

1233
01:39:42,419 --> 01:39:42,740
Thank you.

1234
01:39:46,922 --> 01:39:50,625
Informational report on Attorney General's PTO webinar.

1235
01:39:50,665 --> 01:39:50,765
Ms.

1236
01:39:50,805 --> 01:39:51,245
Patterson.

1237
01:40:08,074 --> 01:40:14,975
This information session has been drafted and shared by the Attorney General's Office.

1238
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:24,577
And I have just submitted the link and information to be posted within the blog and the Medford website.

1239
01:40:24,697 --> 01:40:28,277
So you'll have access to click on that and sign up and enroll.

1240
01:40:28,838 --> 01:40:35,879
Additionally, they will have a community engagement segment of additional webinars that will be accessible.

1241
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:36,899
And they are all for free.

1242
01:40:37,403 --> 01:40:44,004
You just have to access them from your computer screen and register in order to connect on that link.

1243
01:40:44,464 --> 01:40:46,945
So they did change the time frame slightly.

1244
01:40:47,325 --> 01:40:50,665
It's January 22nd at 1030 AM.

1245
01:40:51,205 --> 01:40:58,087
And again, this is the first segment of the nonprofit and public charities board member training.

1246
01:40:58,527 --> 01:41:04,728
So we are encouraging all of our PTO groups, anybody that's looking to formalize a 501c3,

1247
01:41:06,262 --> 01:41:16,325
or additional group as part of the participation and verification of your commitment to Medford Public Schools in any of those capacities.

1248
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:22,287
Again, reminding those board members to register with the superintendent's office.

1249
01:41:22,788 --> 01:41:26,689
Emily Lazaro is taking all of that information in.

1250
01:41:27,489 --> 01:41:31,691
And again, the training date that will be posted is Wednesday at 10.30 a.m.

1251
01:41:37,013 --> 01:41:38,354
The 22nd of January.

1252
01:41:41,756 --> 01:41:46,839
Well, this is from the AG's office, so they might have put the wrong day.

1253
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:57,425
Okay, so they must have put the wrong date on their segment, so I can let them know they have the wrong... So it's January 27th.

1254
01:41:57,545 --> 01:42:00,266
Either the date or day listed.

1255
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:01,667
Okay, yep.

1256
01:42:04,754 --> 01:42:05,594
Mr. Benedetto.

1257
01:42:06,735 --> 01:42:31,466
Have we reached out to our 5013Cs, our PTOs, our friends of, and told, informed them that they are required to register with the Meffitt Public Schools in order to utilize and fundraise using our... So again, we don't have all of their direct contact information and that's the purpose of gathering it at this point in time.

1258
01:42:31,546 --> 01:42:32,226
So we have

1259
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:37,182
They are the information that was identified through the AG's office.

1260
01:42:37,642 --> 01:42:47,205
We are looking at this format to become a formalized process that they are encouraged to take part in and to register themselves.

1261
01:42:47,265 --> 01:42:55,628
It's a self-reporting function at this point in time because, again, we don't know necessarily what name they have registered under.

1262
01:42:56,188 --> 01:42:58,969
It could be Medford Public Schools, the Brooks.

1263
01:42:59,089 --> 01:42:59,849
It could be a Brooks.

1264
01:43:01,693 --> 01:43:03,514
combination there too.

1265
01:43:03,674 --> 01:43:11,340
So we are requesting that all of our community members are addressing and coming forward to us.

1266
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:19,806
In terms of just realizing who could be part of Medford, that's what we have engaged in at this point in time.

1267
01:43:20,967 --> 01:43:29,273
Actually, what this committee voted was that it was mandatory for all, and it shouldn't say PTO training update, it should be

1268
01:43:30,683 --> 01:43:35,645
5013C, PTO, and Friends Of, because it's not that one small group.

1269
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:44,388
And we do, and I think our principals know a lot about who's raising money in these groups.

1270
01:43:45,048 --> 01:43:59,533
And we should be reaching out to contact them that they have a deadline to register with our online program through Emily, because a lot of them haven't, that I've talked to recently, haven't heard that they're supposed to do this.

1271
01:44:00,017 --> 01:44:12,600
So I think we need to do more because it was mandated by this body that it was a mandatory, it wasn't volunteer.

1272
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,241
And I keep hearing that at updates and stuff.

1273
01:44:15,341 --> 01:44:16,461
It's not voluntary.

1274
01:44:16,901 --> 01:44:25,103
If you're going to do business and raise money using Medford Public Schools or students of Medford Public Schools in any way, shape, or form, you are to be

1275
01:44:25,734 --> 01:44:33,237
listed with us who is on your bank accounts, who is the president of your group, who is the contact person, and what their phone number.

1276
01:44:33,257 --> 01:44:34,197
I mean, Janine.

1277
01:44:34,217 --> 01:44:34,797
But this is different.

1278
01:44:34,938 --> 01:44:36,158
This is a training session.

1279
01:44:36,618 --> 01:44:43,921
I understand, but the deadlines, they go hand in hand, and the deadline for that is soon, February 1st.

1280
01:44:44,521 --> 01:44:47,562
So if we haven't started reaching out to them, we need to.

1281
01:44:47,802 --> 01:44:50,303
This is something I'm going to follow up on.

1282
01:44:51,084 --> 01:44:54,565
And the people I have talked to haven't heard anything yet.

1283
01:44:55,472 --> 01:44:59,693
I'm not sure how extensive it goes to.

1284
01:44:59,853 --> 01:45:04,855
I just know that we need to take action and move forward.

1285
01:45:04,935 --> 01:45:08,256
It was mandated by this body, and I want to see movement.

1286
01:45:08,416 --> 01:45:16,298
And I do know that there's supposed to be an update to us mid to late February as to how many people who have signed up.

1287
01:45:16,938 --> 01:45:23,860
Member DiBenedetto, we do have it down for February to present the status of the information that we have for 501c3s.

1288
01:45:25,209 --> 01:45:31,153
Okay, and the groups I have talked to haven't even been informed that they're supposed to have this information to the school district as of yet.

1289
01:45:31,453 --> 01:45:47,845
So that's the piece I'm concerned about at this point, because we're halfway through January, and they have a February 1st enrollment, and if they're not even aware they're supposed to, they have to pull those documents while they're doing their taxes for their 5013Cs.

1290
01:45:47,865 --> 01:45:51,307
That's why we gave it this deadline and this timeline.

1291
01:45:54,238 --> 01:46:00,520
I just hope that we can make this a priority in the next few weeks so that way we have that.

1292
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:01,821
Thank you.

1293
01:46:01,861 --> 01:46:01,921
Yes.

1294
01:46:02,601 --> 01:46:02,781
Ms.

1295
01:46:02,801 --> 01:46:03,101
Kurtz.

1296
01:46:03,241 --> 01:46:03,421
Yes.

1297
01:46:03,601 --> 01:46:04,361
I just had a question.

1298
01:46:05,162 --> 01:46:13,985
Is the webinar going to be recorded so that members could watch it at their convenience at another time if they're unavailable at 10.30 a.m.? ?

1299
01:46:15,061 --> 01:46:17,803
No, this is a function of the Attorney General's office.

1300
01:46:17,843 --> 01:46:19,384
This is not Medford.

1301
01:46:20,005 --> 01:46:22,967
This is them creating this webinar.

1302
01:46:23,287 --> 01:46:28,511
And their intent is to have live engagement, question and answer timeline.

1303
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:31,934
So it is right now slated.

1304
01:46:31,994 --> 01:46:35,437
That is the date and time.

1305
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:38,010
Ms.

1306
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:38,510
Van Kloot.

1307
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:39,031
Yes.

1308
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:57,419
To follow up on that, I would like to ask to reach out back to the Attorney General's office and ask them to, in fact, record it so that somebody who's interested but who cannot go at 10.30, I mean, who cannot be in front of a computer screen at 10.30 on January 22nd

1309
01:46:59,223 --> 01:47:02,045
could watch it that evening or watch it sometime other to the week.

1310
01:47:02,946 --> 01:47:17,458
I would really ask if you would go back and at least give them that suggestion and plea because it just seems that, you know, it's just not real to sort of say, oh, everybody, you've got to be available at this time, you know, to do this thing.

1311
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:20,721
I would certainly inquire on that.

1312
01:47:20,781 --> 01:47:25,324
Again, their intent was to have it engaging and to have a real

1313
01:47:26,422 --> 01:47:30,926
real-time feedback, a question and answer, and to really engage.

1314
01:47:31,006 --> 01:47:35,530
Someone who's watching other people engage actively could learn a great deal.

1315
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:41,374
So maybe we could put a quick letter together from the Medford School Committee asking that they would please

1316
01:47:43,113 --> 01:47:49,657
tape it and have it available at other times for people who can't make it.

1317
01:47:50,537 --> 01:48:00,484
I thought this was actually a pilot training, so you wouldn't want to record the pilot training, in which case the trainers don't really know what they're doing and people are asking questions off topic.

1318
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:04,179
Isn't this a pilot training?

1319
01:48:04,219 --> 01:48:07,261
This is the first time that this particular training is going out, yes.

1320
01:48:07,361 --> 01:48:08,842
That's their intent.

1321
01:48:09,022 --> 01:48:16,967
And so I can certainly reach out and request and or make that suggestion.

1322
01:48:17,327 --> 01:48:25,332
Again, however, this is a totally separate department and entity and not subject to our initial request.

1323
01:48:25,372 --> 01:48:27,413
But I can certainly make that suggestion.

1324
01:48:27,433 --> 01:48:28,354
Thank you.

1325
01:48:28,374 --> 01:48:28,574
All set?

1326
01:48:31,272 --> 01:48:33,052
Okay, is there a motion to accept this report?

1327
01:48:34,653 --> 01:48:37,293
Moved by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1328
01:48:37,773 --> 01:48:38,393
All those in favor?

1329
01:48:38,413 --> 01:48:38,473
Aye.

1330
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:39,693
All those opposed?

1331
01:48:39,733 --> 01:48:40,374
Motion passes.

1332
01:48:40,414 --> 01:48:40,894
Thank you.

1333
01:48:43,674 --> 01:48:45,194
Report on high school heating.

1334
01:48:45,274 --> 01:48:48,875
Mr. McLaughlin or... Yes, he's here.

1335
01:48:53,576 --> 01:48:56,776
Here he comes.

1336
01:48:58,357 --> 01:48:59,477
Hello, Mr. McLaughlin.

1337
01:49:02,481 --> 01:49:05,425
Good evening, Mayor Burke, superintendent, school committee.

1338
01:49:07,328 --> 01:49:08,870
You've had a chance to read the report.

1339
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:10,512
Is there any questions that I can answer?

1340
01:49:10,532 --> 01:49:17,601
The theater, you've done all that work, so now the theater has heat.

1341
01:49:22,516 --> 01:49:25,478
We got the theater running again.

1342
01:49:25,778 --> 01:49:31,503
The coil had to be replaced, custom-made coil, very expensive.

1343
01:49:32,123 --> 01:49:32,884
It's running again.

1344
01:49:33,584 --> 01:49:34,325
Now it's too hot.

1345
01:49:36,462 --> 01:49:44,487
They asked me to turn it off the other night so but we didn't because somebody has to go out onto the roof So we're right in the process.

1346
01:49:44,527 --> 01:49:54,833
We have the electrician coming He's gonna set up a thermostat in the back so that we can regulate it a little bit better so if people are feeling uncomfortable we can start to turn it down, but

1347
01:49:55,837 --> 01:50:03,260
Unfortunately, in some of the areas, the pneumatics that we have, they just don't operate properly.

1348
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:13,503
So we've been taking the time to try to figure out ways that we could just use what we have left to make it operational.

1349
01:50:16,144 --> 01:50:16,344
Ms.

1350
01:50:16,364 --> 01:50:18,465
Kratz?

1351
01:50:18,485 --> 01:50:20,365
I wanted to know, because I read the report.

1352
01:50:21,286 --> 01:50:23,707
So it mentions in the report that

1353
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:30,083
We got the chart with what the minimum heat guidelines are for offices.

1354
01:50:30,183 --> 01:50:38,989
And I wanted to know, are there any classrooms or buildings that are so cold that the students and teachers have to wear their coats?

1355
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:40,871
Because I've heard that.

1356
01:50:41,191 --> 01:50:44,613
Well, part of this report, we talk a little bit about the vocational school.

1357
01:50:45,134 --> 01:50:52,699
Now, this year has been a very tricky year in the vocational school with the pipes, because every time a pipe breaks,

1358
01:50:53,776 --> 01:51:01,138
We have to shut the system down, stop the heat for the day, fix the pipe, then refill the system again.

1359
01:51:01,638 --> 01:51:04,859
So there has been some instances where it's been cold.

1360
01:51:04,919 --> 01:51:06,480
It's been cold in some of the classrooms.

1361
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:08,601
They've been very good in understanding.

1362
01:51:08,861 --> 01:51:10,661
Everybody understands it's an old building.

1363
01:51:11,101 --> 01:51:16,303
Everybody realizes that we're working as fast and as hard as we can to get it back online.

1364
01:51:19,984 --> 01:51:21,945
Last week, for instance, it broke again.

1365
01:51:24,099 --> 01:51:27,287
It was breaking up by the electrical shop for a couple of times.

1366
01:51:27,307 --> 01:51:30,635
So we kept replacing 10 feet of pipe at a time, 10 feet of pipe at a time.

1367
01:51:31,228 --> 01:51:33,850
Then it started to break a little bit near the Cosmo Shop.

1368
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:35,531
So that happened for a couple of days.

1369
01:51:36,092 --> 01:51:41,255
Right now, today was a very cold day, and it seemed to be holding its own pretty well.

1370
01:51:41,796 --> 01:51:46,900
So we can, you know, knock on wood, cross our fingers that, you know, we can get through the rest of it.

1371
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:52,764
But I think we all know Meffitt High School and what Meffitt High School needs in the end game.

1372
01:51:55,173 --> 01:51:56,854
It looks very nice when you walk in.

1373
01:51:57,294 --> 01:51:57,954
It's clean.

1374
01:51:58,274 --> 01:51:59,095
Everything's clean.

1375
01:51:59,175 --> 01:52:04,877
But I always say it's like the person that never smokes that has a heart attack.

1376
01:52:05,417 --> 01:52:05,997
You know what I mean?

1377
01:52:06,857 --> 01:52:11,899
The inside of the building, the decor, it's due.

1378
01:52:12,019 --> 01:52:13,300
It's due for replacement.

1379
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:14,300
Things like that happen.

1380
01:52:15,137 --> 01:52:22,261
When you say you had to replace 10 feet of pipes, is it a plumbing subcontractor?

1381
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:22,721
Yes.

1382
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:31,265
Could you ask, so we are not playing catch up with classrooms every winter, what would the cost be to replace?

1383
01:52:31,746 --> 01:52:32,146
All of it.

1384
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:34,570
I can certainly ask.

1385
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:35,631
It'd be substantial.

1386
01:52:36,311 --> 01:52:37,152
Very substantial.

1387
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:39,253
It would be a capital improvement.

1388
01:52:39,273 --> 01:52:42,094
It would be a major capital improvement.

1389
01:52:42,354 --> 01:52:43,955
But at least we have a number to start with.

1390
01:52:44,555 --> 01:52:45,695
Because it's every year.

1391
01:52:45,795 --> 01:52:47,076
I mean, this is only my third year.

1392
01:52:47,176 --> 01:52:51,778
And every year, parents talk about whether their kids are freezing or too hot.

1393
01:52:51,818 --> 01:52:54,319
So why don't we just bite the bullet somehow in planning?

1394
01:52:54,339 --> 01:52:56,380
At least if we have a number, we know what we're aiming for.

1395
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,120
Yeah.

1396
01:52:59,421 --> 01:52:59,941
Big number.

1397
01:53:01,182 --> 01:53:02,062
I can't wait to hear it.

1398
01:53:05,036 --> 01:53:06,617
Mr. Russo.

1399
01:53:06,657 --> 01:53:07,378
Thank you for the heat.

1400
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:10,680
It was lovely on Thursday and Saturday night.

1401
01:53:10,961 --> 01:53:12,041
Were you in the theater?

1402
01:53:12,162 --> 01:53:13,182
I was.

1403
01:53:13,362 --> 01:53:20,828
I sat at the very top because it was sold out practically, or it was sold out, and it was so hot.

1404
01:53:20,848 --> 01:53:23,650
I was thinking about one year prior for the inauguration.

1405
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:24,771
It was so cold.

1406
01:53:25,332 --> 01:53:26,573
I was joking with people that

1407
01:53:27,196 --> 01:53:29,538
I can't complain about the heat in here right now.

1408
01:53:29,638 --> 01:53:32,200
We've got to let it be warm for a while before we complain.

1409
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:35,242
Well, like I said, we have the electrician coming and he's just waiting for the pot.

1410
01:53:35,282 --> 01:53:42,187
We're going to put a little, like a thermostat down below where we can, so we don't have to normally to regulate the heat in the theater.

1411
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:52,027
for the past few years would have to go out on the roof, go into the penthouse, and shut the disconnect off, which is, you know, then somebody goes out in the penthouse, shuts the disconnect off.

1412
01:53:52,467 --> 01:53:53,288
It's late at night.

1413
01:53:53,808 --> 01:53:58,631
You don't expect them heading back out there again on the roof and the dock to turn it back on.

1414
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:00,913
So, and the same thing sort of happens in the gym.

1415
01:54:01,754 --> 01:54:06,277
With the two units in the gym, when there's a basketball game, the two units are pumping away.

1416
01:54:06,737 --> 01:54:08,198
Then the next thing you know, everybody's hot.

1417
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:09,099
Can you shut it off?

1418
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:10,019
We shut it off.

1419
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:12,261
Somebody forgets to turn it back on.

1420
01:54:12,631 --> 01:54:15,313
Then they come in on Saturday, and it's cold for the young kids.

1421
01:54:15,933 --> 01:54:16,313
We can.

1422
01:54:17,154 --> 01:54:17,434
Yeah.

1423
01:54:18,255 --> 01:54:18,735
Not for free.

1424
01:54:18,775 --> 01:54:20,496
No, I agree.

1425
01:54:20,536 --> 01:54:21,737
Like I said, we're working on it.

1426
01:54:23,658 --> 01:54:28,521
You know, Kirstine has been excellent as far as finding the money for us to keep rolling.

1427
01:54:28,821 --> 01:54:29,982
The superintendent as well.

1428
01:54:30,282 --> 01:54:35,045
We talk about these things all the time, and we talk about how we can make them better.

1429
01:54:35,506 --> 01:54:47,312
And even if we just make some minor adjustments here and there, for a little bit here and a little bit here, until we can figure out what's going to happen in the long run at some point.

1430
01:54:48,052 --> 01:54:48,632
Very good.

1431
01:54:49,973 --> 01:54:50,493
Thank you, John.

1432
01:54:50,713 --> 01:54:51,054
Thank you.

1433
01:54:51,114 --> 01:54:51,974
Mr. McLaughlin.

1434
01:54:52,895 --> 01:54:56,076
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

1435
01:54:56,116 --> 01:54:56,896
Mustone?

1436
01:54:57,697 --> 01:54:58,377
Seconded by Ms.

1437
01:54:58,417 --> 01:54:58,737
Kretz.

1438
01:54:59,018 --> 01:54:59,718
All those in favor?

1439
01:54:59,738 --> 01:54:59,818
Aye.

1440
01:55:00,498 --> 01:55:01,199
All those opposed?

1441
01:55:01,799 --> 01:55:02,579
Motion passes.

1442
01:55:04,463 --> 01:55:08,906
Someone could make a motion to move negotiation and legal matters to the end of the docket.

1443
01:55:09,666 --> 01:55:10,327
So moved by Ms.

1444
01:55:10,367 --> 01:55:11,448
Villanueva, seconded by Ms.

1445
01:55:11,468 --> 01:55:11,888
DeRusso.

1446
01:55:11,928 --> 01:55:12,668
All those in favor?

1447
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:12,768
Aye.

1448
01:55:13,709 --> 01:55:15,330
That is now moved to the very end.

1449
01:55:16,491 --> 01:55:17,792
School committee resolution.

1450
01:55:17,872 --> 01:55:30,160
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Florence DeMartino, the grandmother of City Councilor Adam Knight, and a longtime employee of the City of Somerville's Hot Lunch Program.

1451
01:55:31,272 --> 01:55:33,853
could all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of Ms.

1452
01:55:33,874 --> 01:55:34,234
DiMartino.

1453
01:55:34,254 --> 01:55:34,474
Thank you.

1454
01:55:34,494 --> 01:55:34,554
Ms.

1455
01:55:36,235 --> 01:55:36,535
Van de Kloet.

1456
01:55:36,555 --> 01:55:56,006
I would just like to make a note that there were several letters in the background that were at a request of us to send letters on behalf of the committee.

1457
01:55:56,947 --> 01:56:00,709
However, I would like to please ask that our names be listed

1458
01:56:10,473 --> 01:56:19,358
Would you like to sign all of them moving forward Very good.

1459
01:56:19,438 --> 01:56:19,799
Thank you

1460
01:56:20,964 --> 01:56:23,025
Now into negotiations and legal matters.

1461
01:56:23,105 --> 01:56:25,147
Is there a motion to go into executive session?

1462
01:56:25,867 --> 01:56:28,469
So moved by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1463
01:56:28,489 --> 01:56:30,530
Roll call vote please, Madam Secretary.

1464
01:56:39,556 --> 01:56:41,498
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1465
01:56:41,638 --> 01:56:42,418
The motion carries.

1466
01:56:42,438 --> 01:56:49,523
We will now enter executive session and we will open up session from room 207 and depart from there.
