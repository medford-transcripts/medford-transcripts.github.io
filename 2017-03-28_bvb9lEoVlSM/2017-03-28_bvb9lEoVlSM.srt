00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:39,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

10
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:54,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I ask to suspend the rules to allow one of our prestigious Medford public school teachers to come up and address the council relative to a fundraising drive that he is participating in in the memory of one of our deceased Medford public school students.

11
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:57,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to call Anthony Petrellis to the podium, Mr. President.

12
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:01,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

13
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

14
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Anthony Petralas.

15
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fifth grade teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School.

16
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't live in Mefford, but I'm a teacher here.

17
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:20,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am here for the One Mission Buzz Off, which is taking place June 4th at Gillette Stadium.

18
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:23,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank Council and Knight for putting us on the agenda tonight.

19
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:29,748
[SPEAKER_07]: We were able to come here last year, and after being here, we had a lot of community

20
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:34,898
[SPEAKER_07]: reach out to us about being involved and getting involved in donations and everything else.

21
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,560
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you guys are a pretty popular show, I guess.

22
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's a great thing.

23
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:42,103
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, thank you guys for taking the time to have us.

24
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,605
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, this takes place June 4th at Gillette Stadium.

25
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the One Mission Buzz Off.

26
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:54,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And we buzz in honor of Hemal Abdul Faraj, who was a student who passed away in third grade at the McGlynn Elementary School of Spinal Cancer.

27
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:59,595
[SPEAKER_07]: A few years after that, we hosted a basketball game in our school in his honor.

28
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,339
[SPEAKER_07]: fifth grade versus teacher's game.

29
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:07,604
[SPEAKER_07]: And since then, we have now kind of moved and shifted to participating in the One Mission Buzz Off.

30
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:13,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, we were able to raise over $15,000.

31
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,470
[SPEAKER_07]: The year before, it was over $10,000.

32
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So the past few years, we've raised over $25,000 in his honor.

33
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:27,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So what One Mission does, which is so great, is it's one of those charities that gives to the families in need

34
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:31,250
[SPEAKER_07]: as the children and the family are going through the cancer.

35
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So they donate a lot to the hospitals.

36
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,470
[SPEAKER_07]: They bring Christmas to the hospitals.

37
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,851
[SPEAKER_07]: They bring birthdays to the hospitals.

38
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,332
[SPEAKER_07]: They help parents with costs, parking garage if you're, you know, with the Mass General or the Children's Hospital, and it can get very pricey.

39
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:53,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So the money is given to the families who are directly affected, which is kind of, you know, very rare of a lot of charities and something that just really stood out to us as a great mission statement for them.

40
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:56,199
[SPEAKER_07]: In the past, we've had teachers buzz.

41
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,219
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, we are fortunate enough to have the word spread.

42
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,080
[SPEAKER_07]: We have currently five teachers.

43
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:08,222
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a police officer, the athletic director, the hockey coach, the baseball coach, several baseball players, and this year, even some students.

44
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,363
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our team members has been doing it since he's been in kindergarten.

45
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:14,224
[SPEAKER_07]: He's now in second grade, and he looks forward to it.

46
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:19,345
[SPEAKER_07]: He starts growing his hair in October, and his mom takes pictures every month to see how much his hair has grown.

47
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,576
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing to get the kids really involved in the city.

48
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:27,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Our goal next year is to actually host our own Buzz Off here in Medford.

49
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:34,118
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this year the word has gotten out a lot and we've gotten contacted by so many different people to see how they could be a part of it.

50
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't have to shave your head to be a part of the team and be a part of the cause and help out.

51
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:48,321
[SPEAKER_07]: This year we're having our first annual fundraiser for the One Mission Buzz Off and we are having a John Brewer's April 13th on a Thursday.

52
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:52,139
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Holy Thursday, I believe, is the day.

53
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to have over 25 different raffles there.

54
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,100
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have a DJ there.

55
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, price of the door, we ask is $15 donation at the door.

56
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:03,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're really excited about this.

57
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:13,725
[SPEAKER_07]: We have over about 125 people that have already committed to coming, and a lot of people from the community just reaching out on Facebook and email, asking to donate raffles and baskets and so on.

58
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:17,346
[SPEAKER_07]: So we couldn't be happier that the community is so behind us.

59
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,863
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, too, we also try to get the schools really involved in it.

60
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:25,527
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the Method Vote Tech actually create our t-shirt design.

61
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:31,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put it out to them a couple of weeks ago, and over 15 students submitted t-shirt designs to us.

62
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:34,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And we picked through the team.

63
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:35,277
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Jackson.

64
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,519
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our second grade I was just talking about here.

65
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:39,461
[SPEAKER_07]: That's quite a nice set of hair he's got there.

66
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:49,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and we, we had over 15 different t-shirt designs and we ended up picking a senior at the method.

67
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Vogue, Liam Spellman, who came up with our t-shirt design.

68
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:53,536
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our t-shirt from last year.

69
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:56,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, this year we're doing more of the method blue and white colors.

70
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:03,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, um, we're very thankful that, you know, miss Rachel at the, at the Vogue, um, was able to help us out.

71
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:10,479
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the video production, um, students creating a big video that's going to be put on the city Facebook page very soon.

72
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:15,633
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have a meeting with the mayor tomorrow to kind of get a couple words from her to be putting on the video.

73
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:25,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're hoping to have it wrapped up in the next couple of weeks that it will be put on every social media page, I'm sure, out there so people can, you know, really see and learn about the cause and what we're doing.

74
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,384
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, the baseball team is participating this year.

75
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:32,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I reached out to Coach Nestor very early in January.

76
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:35,669
[SPEAKER_07]: He was very receptive towards it and is very excited.

77
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:40,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're also going to be hanging a banner in front of city hall fairly soon.

78
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:45,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, once it comes in to, um, you know, for people to drive by and see what this event is and what we're doing.

79
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:52,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of all I have here, but I just wanted to spread the awareness and I want to thank everybody.

80
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,878
[SPEAKER_07]: There's several council people here that have donated to us already.

81
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and really helped us spread the word.

82
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:05,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were very thankful last year and we thought it'd be great to come back and a say thank you and be spread the word even more of what,

83
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,497
[SPEAKER_07]: how much we've grown over the course of the year.

84
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:10,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

85
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's April 13th.

86
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts at seven o'clock.

87
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:18,304
[SPEAKER_05]: John Brewers?

88
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:18,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

89
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:25,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I hear you correctly when you said the athletic director was going to be participating in this event?

90
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, offsite.

91
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Him and the hockey coach are going to be buzzing offsite.

92
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:39,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can't wait to see that.

93
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:45,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony, thank you very much for what you do in the community.

94
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:55,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Also you have here with you is Chris Murphy, one of the members of the park commission here in the city of Medford who's been a long time activist in the community and someone that's given so much back to the city of Medford.

95
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:59,417
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to thank you guys for coming down here this evening and thank you for the work that you do.

96
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:05,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I am interested to hear from a friend here about what he thinks about the buzz off and how much fun he's had in participating.

97
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:07,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Jackson, that's your buddy.

98
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:09,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

99
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So how much money have you got?

100
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:13,568
[SPEAKER_13]: What is your name, young man?

101
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:14,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackson.

102
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for coming down tonight, Jackson.

103
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,589
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got a pretty good head of hair.

104
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:19,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

105
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:20,229
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom did it.

106
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:23,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Jackson, can I come down so you can shave my head?

107
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,030
Sure.

108
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack, how long have you been growing your hair?

109
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:31,433
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you start growing your hair?

110
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:32,433
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

111
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:33,874
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you start growing your hair?

112
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, a couple months ago.

113
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:38,517
Wow.

00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:39,798
[SPEAKER_07]: October?

115
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, October.

116
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that when you started?

117
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:48,404
[SPEAKER_13]: October of 69.

118
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:52,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much for indulging me and allowing me the opportunity to suspend the rules.

119
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, Anthony, Chris, and Jackson, thank you very much for coming down here tonight.

120
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And to all the rest of the members of Team Hemo, thank you very much for

121
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:06,986
[SPEAKER_13]: what you do to keep the memory and spirit of a good boy who was taken from us too soon, Mr. President.

122
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:08,766
[SPEAKER_13]: So I motion to receive and place on file.

123
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:15,489
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Layton, Councilor Falcons, Councilor Scarpelli, get the rest of the hair cut off at the bazaar.

124
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, thank you very much for coming down.

125
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:21,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

126
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,712
[SPEAKER_10]: See you guys in two weeks.

127
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:23,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

128
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:29,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, motion to refer back to the regular order of business?

129
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:29,535
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

130
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:31,425
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you push?

131
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:37,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

132
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:41,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

133
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:57,450
[SPEAKER_01]: No, George and I were going to just say a few words, but I just want to thank everything that the fifth grade teacher Anthony does for the students and this great fundraiser and Chris Murphy and Jackson as well.

134
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

135
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:08,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck, and hopefully, I was going to ask them how we could let the public know where to donate, but I'm sure there'll be Facebook links and a number of different ways you can reach out.

136
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:14,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he sent a mass email around, so hopefully, you can get out and donate to a great cause.

137
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:16,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Counsel.

138
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:17,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Counsel Scarpelli.

139
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:19,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Mox.

140
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate an opportunity for Mr. just, I know Mr. Petrell has left, but you know, it's amazing to me when you have milk and teach you the year award.

141
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:32,852
[SPEAKER_08]: recipients like Mr. Petrelis, who were named a few years ago, named the Teacher of the Year.

142
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's done so many great, great, put so many great initiatives in place.

143
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:45,258
[SPEAKER_08]: What's amazing is when we lost Hemo at the McGlynn, that class still today celebrates his birthday.

144
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Every year, they have a birthday cake.

145
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,943
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that's so special that they took something as horrible as death, and they learned how to celebrate it.

146
00:14:55,511 --> 00:15:00,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And Anthony carries that his memory, uh, he most memory alive with the buzz off.

147
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:06,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I think this is the only time this is when I really want here so I can be involved.

148
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:08,178
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, I appreciate everything he's done.

149
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, and I think the city should rally around.

150
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:11,440
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great cause.

151
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

152
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

153
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:16,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Council council president.

154
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:17,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

155
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:24,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I want to echo my other, uh, uh, Councilors, uh, condolence, uh, uh, congratulations for Chris.

156
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,207
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been a good kid and, uh,

157
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:31,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year he, we, we all helped raise a lot of money from his endeavor and I hope he, uh, I hope he does equally as well this year.

158
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

159
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:36,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, motion to receive in place on file.

160
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Second by council on occur.

161
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:39,358
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

162
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:39,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

163
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:40,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys have it.

164
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:45,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, revert motion to revert back to the regular audit business by Councilor at night.

165
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:45,901
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

166
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:47,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

167
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:48,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have it.

168
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, audits and resolutions.

169
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:54,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper 17, I'm sorry, 17-three one seven.

170
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,210
[SPEAKER_05]: offered by President Caraviello.

171
00:15:57,011 --> 00:16:09,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Be resolved that the rules of the Medford City Council be amended to allow video recording of the Medford City Council meetings in accordance with Massachusetts general law and that it be sent to the rules committee for adoption.

172
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Council President Caraviello.

173
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:17,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, last week we had some people filming here, uh, and walking around.

175
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:20,118
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that I got some calls from people that they weren't comfortable with.

176
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:24,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, in accordance with the, with the mass general laws, open meeting laws,

177
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:27,812
[SPEAKER_04]: which actually we don't even need to put them in our rules.

178
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:31,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that they will be enforced in the future.

179
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:36,018
[SPEAKER_04]: We've designated some areas where people can stand now and film.

180
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:44,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, all I'm saying is going forward, we're going to ask everyone to comply with the open meeting law.

181
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:54,117
[SPEAKER_04]: when they want to film here, and we will announce that the meeting is being filmed other than by our TV cameras.

182
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:59,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyone who wants to buy a copy can buy a copy of the tape for $5.

183
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:09,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, like I said, there were some people here that weren't comfortable with where the filming was happening, and I wanted to just make sure that we adhere to the open meeting laws.

184
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:11,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

185
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:11,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

186
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this issue forward.

187
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:32,967
[SPEAKER_13]: If we take a look at the Attorney General's Guide to the Open Meeting Law, published in March of 2017, there's a section entitled Public Participation, and in this section it reads, any member of the public has the right to make an audio or video recording of an open session of a public meeting.

188
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:36,570
[SPEAKER_13]: A member of the public who wishes to record a meeting must first notify the chair,

189
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:43,336
[SPEAKER_13]: and comply with reasonable requirements regarding audio or video equipment established by the Chair as not to interfere with the meeting.

190
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:45,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I commend Councilor Caraviello for bringing this resolution forward.

191
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:55,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I too got a number of calls relative to the recording of the meeting last week and some people feeling uncomfortable that certain individuals putting a camera in their face and following them around.

192
00:17:55,285 --> 00:18:03,211
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that this is a good proactive measure to ensure that we have full participation and that individuals that want to come down to the Medford City Council meetings are not

193
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,660
[SPEAKER_13]: feeling intimidated or frightened to do so.

194
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,941
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

195
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:12,603
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate your leadership on this issue and I look forward to the final product that the chair puts out as the presiding officer underneath the open meeting law.

196
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:15,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

197
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

198
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:17,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

199
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:22,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I too want to congratulate the president on this measure.

200
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:32,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that in our meetings and committee that we can also address the issue of taping in committee meetings.

201
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:50,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it is in the context of those meetings that I've received a comment from people who have, uh, uh, felt as they've told me creeped out by the manner, uh, in which some people have exercised, uh, uh, their rights in that forum, uh, with regards to taping.

202
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:57,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, uh, so, uh, I think that that needs to be a matter for discussion and policy.

203
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:01,267
[SPEAKER_11]: as well, so we'll talk that out in committee.

204
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

205
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:03,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

206
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:05,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor.

207
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:06,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor, one go current.

208
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vice President Marks.

209
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a question about exactly what the Mass General Law stated, but I think Councilor Knight answered that.

210
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:23,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So going forward until this rule committee gets set up, as long as they ask you, President Caraviello, and then where would the designated areas be that they can videotape?

211
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:26,779
[SPEAKER_04]: The designated areas that we've selected

212
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: will be where the chair is, which is going to be in the middle of both windows and around the outside corridor.

213
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:39,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And not in the middle where people will be waiting to stand and speak.

214
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:48,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And we prefer that it would be a fixed camera, not someone just walking around with a phone, just taking pictures of people's faces.

215
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:51,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we will look and get it done in a professional manner.

216
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:55,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same thing when we go into the committee of the halls and subcommittee meetings,

217
00:19:56,167 --> 00:20:00,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, those are open meetings and same rules will apply in there as they do in this room.

218
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

219
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:01,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

220
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:06,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree that it should go to, to committee just for vetting purposes.

221
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:11,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we let the public know the rules that we're going to implement or that we are implementing.

222
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,839
[SPEAKER_04]: The rules are already in place by the mass general law on the open meeting law.

223
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So all we're doing is just sort of bringing them into our rules just to have them in place, but their rules supersede our rules anyway.

224
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

225
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:24,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor, report of information.

226
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:29,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on the reading of it, the Medford City Council's already governed and subject to the open meeting laws.

227
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:34,889
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that this is something that can be done absent a change to our rules or even meeting in subcommittee.

228
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:43,053
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the sole discretion of the chair to establish the criteria for which the reasonable use of recording equipment can be done.

229
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:49,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that this could certainly be taken care of sooner rather than later just by way of a policy that's been implemented and submitted to this council for review.

230
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:56,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Personally, I think that we should have maybe four designated areas that individuals can record from.

231
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,255
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's also important that the cameras be stationary.

232
00:20:59,855 --> 00:21:03,137
[SPEAKER_13]: There are certain aspects of this, if we're going to implement the policy, that I think are important.

233
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:08,160
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that they can be done absent the adoption of the Medford City Council rules, number one.

234
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:16,265
[SPEAKER_13]: And number two, based upon my reading of the language in the Open Meeting Law Guide, I feel as though it's at the sole discretion of the presiding officer, not that of the body.

235
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

236
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:25,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, Vice President Marks, I think it's important with regards to the subcommittee meetings that they do get recorded.

237
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,378
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something this council has asked for.

238
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:28,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Councilor Falco brought it up.

239
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:37,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we're hopefully in the works of getting a meeting together to figure out how much cameras will cost in room 207.

240
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:45,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think any subcommittee meeting that takes place or committee of the whole meeting that takes place in the chambers here should be recorded and should be

241
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:55,608
[SPEAKER_01]: put on display, because I did get a couple responses from last week, subcommittee meeting being, Committee of the Whole meeting being taped, and people were happy they were able to view it online.

242
00:21:55,948 --> 00:22:13,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand where it can be intrusive, but at the same time, people should be able to view every public meeting that goes on in City Hall, and I think getting cameras in some of the essential rooms, especially room 207, and where the Zoning Board of Appeals meets, or we need to be able to do, we need to

243
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,239
[SPEAKER_01]: look into doing that further.

244
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very important for transparency and open government.

245
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:38,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would hope that we can implement some sort of resolution for room 207 and create good guidelines that are going to kind of be best for everybody in room 207 if somebody does want to come in and film and post it on whether that be Facebook or YouTube because people are interested in

246
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:42,465
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of meetings in this community and they're important to, to go public.

247
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,866
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important for them to go public.

248
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand both sides.

249
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure we vet it well and do the right thing.

250
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:49,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

251
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:49,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor.

252
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

253
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:52,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

254
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and I also want to thank a Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

255
00:22:55,914 --> 00:23:02,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, with regard to, uh, um, the meetings that are held in room 207, I'm in a full agreement that those meetings should be on tape.

256
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:05,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, or actually they should be filmed in some capacity.

257
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:05,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh,

258
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:14,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Those meetings are open to the public, but, you know, there are many meetings that happen in that conference room that the public doesn't necessarily know about.

259
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:18,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we should be doing is we should be making sure that we're transparent.

260
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:22,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making sure that government is easily accessible to everyone in this community.

261
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:31,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's important that we do have a camera in that room and that it's easy to operate and that all the meetings can be filmed and people can participate.

262
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been in contact with the vendor.

263
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:37,679
[SPEAKER_06]: The vendor was supposed to come in in February, but they had to cancel.

264
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:44,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm working on getting them to hopefully come in soon to give us a price on that and to just let us know how it would work.

265
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:50,804
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm in full agreement that rooms in room 207 should be filmed.

266
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Meetings should be filmed in there.

267
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:57,807
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many boards and commissions that meet on a monthly basis, and those

268
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,824
[SPEAKER_06]: those meetings should be filmed, that people should be able to see those.

269
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:06,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward, and in full support.

270
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:06,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

271
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:08,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council.

272
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,533
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Council President Caraviello, amended by Councilor Lungo and Councilor Falco.

273
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:14,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

274
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:22,120
[SPEAKER_13]: So the motion would be to send the paper to the Rules Committee as opposed to the President exercising his discretion under the law and putting something together for us to review?

275
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:26,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Be up to the committee.

276
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:27,845
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, I think it should.

277
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:43,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think the act would indicate... Right, but the open meeting law would say that it's the sole discretion of the chair to establish the acceptable areas.

278
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:44,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

279
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:51,175
[SPEAKER_13]: So the committee creating the acceptable areas is really in contradiction to what the act says, in my opinion.

280
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:53,497
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I'll proceed however the body feels fit.

281
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:57,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that this is something that the president could propose and then we could either adopt it as something we want to

282
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,407
[SPEAKER_13]: encompass into our rules right away.

283
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make amendments to it.

284
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:07,233
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if you want to, if you want to propose it tonight and then go into subcommittee process, I think you could probably adopt an interim policy or something like that.

285
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:10,335
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, to govern the meetings, cause it's going to have to go through the legislative process.

286
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:11,196
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want.

287
00:25:11,616 --> 00:25:26,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm proposing that, uh, as, as the room is marked now with where the middle of the second window on both sides and around the outer perimeter of the back of the back wall, uh, and no filming be allowed in the middle, uh, corridor where people, where people stand to come up to speak at the podium.

288
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:34,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, we prefer if it would be a fixed, uh, location versus standing around, walking around and filming people.

289
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:35,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

290
00:25:35,274 --> 00:25:38,537
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as we have an understanding going forward that there are some restrictions in place right now.

291
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:51,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Before the meeting, before the meeting, uh, as long as I'm notified, I can let the people in the room that let the people know in the room know that, uh, someone other than TV three will be filming the meeting, which is the, which is what's the law says.

292
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:56,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Because ultimately, Mr. President, my concern would be that, number one, we have an obligation to comply with the open meeting law.

293
00:25:56,873 --> 00:26:04,615
[SPEAKER_13]: And the open meeting law requires the chairman to notify other members in the facility or in the locale that they are being recorded.

294
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:09,777
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's very important that as we move forward and have our meetings that we are in compliance with the open meeting law.

295
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:15,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And by designating certain areas, it'll make us a little bit easier for the president to identify, number one, and number two,

296
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:33,284
[SPEAKER_05]: The city messengers the meeting has already started to identify individuals And as you state at the beginning that's up to the discretion of the chair exactly So it's an unwritten rule by the discretion of the chair exactly and I think would be important that we do add it to our rules To further clarify I make my concern was just between then and now what's gonna happen.

297
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:35,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Council longer current.

298
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:35,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

299
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:37,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm vice president Marx.

300
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:38,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fine with all that.

301
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:38,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think

302
00:26:39,324 --> 00:26:45,046
[SPEAKER_01]: having something stationary is something that a lot of people can't afford, having a tripod.

303
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:50,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people want to film with their phones or a camera or a video recorder.

304
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,909
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a tripod, something stationary.

305
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:58,091
[SPEAKER_01]: So I disagree with that portion of how we're going to move forward.

306
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's unrealistic.

307
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:04,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that the one person that's tried to film is doing it from a cell phone.

308
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:08,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand maybe designating areas, but to not allow somebody to

309
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:09,943
[SPEAKER_01]: film us with a cell phone.

310
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're elected to do the people's business.

311
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:17,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody wants to live stream it on Facebook, I don't see a problem with allowing them to do so.

312
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:19,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have no cameras in room 207.

313
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:29,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they want to do it with a cell phone, as long as they're stationary, not in the way, they're not impeding somebody's safety with regards to moving around, I don't see the problem.

314
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:34,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have to voice my concern there, because I know people are happy with

315
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the meetings live streamed and I agree with council Falco.

316
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:48,971
[SPEAKER_01]: We need video cameras in room 207, which That's the only way we got something videoed in the last couple weeks Even people aren't happy with who who videoed it.

317
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:52,074
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it is what it is Thank You

318
00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:18,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me clarify when I said the word stationary I don't mean that someone needs to buy a tripod or someone needs to you know what I mean by this elaborate TV 3 or you know channel 56 WLVI Saturday Night Live David Letterman it's on the shoulder it's on it's on a tripod I just mean that the individual that's recording shouldn't be walking around putting the camera recording here recording here recording here over here over there over there over here over here walking all around the place because the intent is that the meeting does not get disrupted we allow audio and video recording

319
00:28:18,992 --> 00:28:20,813
[SPEAKER_13]: But the meeting is not interfered with or disrupted.

320
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,436
[SPEAKER_13]: And that can be a disruption when someone's walking around with a camera and pointing in people's faces.

321
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:25,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

322
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:27,018
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we should add to this.

323
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:31,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when one of us is talking, maybe the other councillors can't be like hysterically laughing.

324
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:33,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because that's disruptive.

325
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a councillor to, you know.

326
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:36,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information, Mr. President.

327
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:39,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, point of information.

328
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:42,329
[SPEAKER_13]: The open meeting law in this section of the open meeting law speaks to public participation.

329
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:43,750
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't speak to the conduct of councillors.

330
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,271
[SPEAKER_13]: The conduct of councillors is governed under a different chapter of the general laws.

331
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:46,812
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's chapter 43.

332
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask it and I think that's why I think we do need to have a committee on the rules so we can get together.

333
00:28:53,903 --> 00:29:04,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, uh, there's also a sign at the entrance to the Alderman chambers that says, uh, no cell phone usage, uh, or electronic devices, I believe it mentions.

334
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, that is also something that I think we need to look in as a council.

335
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:16,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion by a council president Caraviello, uh, that this be sent to committee on rules, uh, and furthermore by council of Falco and council Lungo-Koehn,

336
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:19,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

337
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:19,985
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

338
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:20,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

339
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:21,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

340
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The ayes have it.

341
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:23,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion is adopted.

342
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:35,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

343
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,108
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-318 offered by Vice President Mox.

344
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford Housing Authority be discussed.

345
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:42,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Mox.

346
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

347
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:54,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a few days ago, I received a call from a resident that resides in one of our housing developments.

348
00:29:55,823 --> 00:30:09,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And the resident brought up a very valid concern, stating that during the snowstorm we had two weeks back, a little over two weeks back, that she is a handicapped resident.

349
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:12,036
[SPEAKER_05]: of this particular development.

350
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:15,697
[SPEAKER_05]: She resides on, I believe, the fourth floor.

351
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:24,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And during this latest snowstorm, the power went out at the building for several hours.

352
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And she happens to have a lifeline that she uses a medical alert.

353
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: When the power went out, her lifeline no longer worked.

354
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:37,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And the elevators in the building

355
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:48,506
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have a backup generator and her phone, based on the type of phone you have, her particular phone wasn't working either.

356
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:59,131
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was confined to her floor of the building for a three or four hour span with no communication and she was very concerned that

357
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:03,934
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, her building did not have a backup generator for the elevator.

358
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:14,136
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a small generator that has the capacity to handle small lights at the entrance to each doorway inside the building.

359
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:19,897
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, there is no backup generator to handle the elevator capacity.

360
00:31:20,397 --> 00:31:24,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made a call to Medford Housing yesterday.

361
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:28,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to Joseph McRitchie.

362
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:31,623
[SPEAKER_05]: who is the interim director, executive director.

363
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who are not aware, Mr. John Coddington, the executive director, decided not to seek reappointment to the position.

364
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:47,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now the housing board is currently looking at three different candidates for the executive director position.

365
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:55,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. McRitchie is here in the interim for about a month from what he told me.

366
00:31:56,403 --> 00:32:06,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked him, Mr. President, what is the, first of all, which of our eight developments in the city have backup generators for the elevators?

367
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And he mentioned that the only building is the main high-rise in the square.

368
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:15,447
[SPEAKER_05]: The Salt and Stall does have a backup generator.

369
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:21,051
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an 11-story elevator with 200 units in that particular building.

370
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:29,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So if power does go out, residents from any of the floors can get down to the main floor if need be in a time of concern.

371
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went through the list of buildings, Mr. President.

372
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:46,610
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this may be helpful to some of the new colleagues, uh, because when people hear about method housing right away, they think, oh, that's under the guise and control of the city of method.

373
00:32:47,372 --> 00:32:48,654
[SPEAKER_05]: And it absolutely has.

374
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:51,019
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing to do with the city of Medford.

375
00:32:51,479 --> 00:33:00,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are astonished when I say that, but the Housing Authority is a quasi-agency that's run by the state and federal government.

376
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:10,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, out of the eight developments we have, we only have one state unit that's funded by the state, and that's Walkland Court.

377
00:33:10,565 --> 00:33:14,927
[SPEAKER_05]: The other seven are federal-funded buildings.

378
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you would just indulge me, Mr. President, I think it's important

379
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:30,995
[SPEAKER_05]: to go through the list of housing that we have in this community, and then in order to move forward on a resolution that needs to take place, I think it's helpful.

380
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:33,576
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the Saltonstall building.

381
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:36,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an 11-story development here on Riverside Ave.

382
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 200 units.

383
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:43,121
[SPEAKER_05]: of elderly and disabled units, and it's federally funded.

384
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:45,962
[SPEAKER_05]: LaPreece Village is on Riverside Ave.

385
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:48,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a family development.

386
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 142 units, and it's federally funded.

387
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:56,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Fells Way West, there's the Dougherty Apartments.

388
00:33:56,625 --> 00:34:01,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a three-story elevated building, which is elderly and disabled.

389
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has 17 units, and it's funded by the federal government.

390
00:34:05,974 --> 00:34:11,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Weldon Gardens, which is on Bradley Road, five-story elevated building for elderly and disabled.

391
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,801
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 75 units funded by the federal government.

392
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:20,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Tamponi Manor, Alston Street, it's a three-story elevated building.

393
00:34:21,747 --> 00:34:27,070
[SPEAKER_05]: with elderly and disabled residents, and it has 100 units, and it's funded by the federal government.

394
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Canal Street, Phillips Apartments, it's a two-story building.

395
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:35,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's elderly and disabled, and has 15 units, and funded by the federal government.

396
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:42,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have Willis Ave Development, which is a family development that's on Barnard and Willis.

397
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 150 units, and it's funded by the federal government.

398
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I stated, Walkland Court,

399
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:55,261
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a two-story building, elderly and disabled, 144 units, and it's funded by the state.

400
00:34:56,061 --> 00:35:08,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Combined total, we have 843 of housing units in our community, of which a lion's share are dedicated to the elderly and disabled.

401
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:11,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I brought up this resolution is

402
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Upon inquiry to the method housing I asked what is their emergency plan in times of power outages with people that are on these elevated floors that are disabled and don't have a means to gain access to the first floor and Secondly may have a medical condition that requires them to have electricity and I was told that they were going to look into it

403
00:35:38,682 --> 00:36:05,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And to date, I still haven't received a response, but I'm hoping tonight through this resolution that my first motion, Mr. President, is that this council receive a response from Medford Housing Authority on the emergency plan, evacuation plan in times of power outages or other catastrophes in this community to deal with the disabled.

404
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:12,656
[SPEAKER_05]: that are living within the buildings in particular, and an emergency plan in general for everyone living in the building.

405
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:31,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And secondly, Mr. President, the fact that only one building out of one, two, three, four, five, six buildings that have, I'm sorry, one, two, three, four, five buildings, only one has an emergency backup generated for the elevator.

406
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:43,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, my second motion is, um, out of the five buildings that have elevators currently, why are only one building equipped with an emergency backup generator?

407
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:57,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are the plans, uh, to, um, address needs of residents that are in the building that may or may not be disabled, Mr. President, in time of power outages or other safety needs.

408
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:00,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my two questions, Mr. President.

409
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:07,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the interim director, Mac Ritchie, has only been around for a short period of time, and he was very prompt in getting back to me.

410
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:08,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to thank him.

411
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:22,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told him I was going to be offering this resolution to address the needs of the 843 different units we have throughout this community and the safety concern that potentially could exist, Mr. President.

412
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:24,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

413
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:26,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Dello Russo.

414
00:37:26,773 --> 00:37:27,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

415
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:46,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Just by way of information, I was under the impression that after our last major power outage, the city suffered some years back, that there was indeed a emergency plan that was under the supervision of the director.

416
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:54,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we call them emergency management or civil defense had contingencies for these matters.

417
00:37:54,632 --> 00:38:19,743
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is alarming to note that in housing that caters to largely elderly and disabled and people with critical medical conditions, especially people that need in their domicile machines that generate oxygen for their breathing, to be without the aid of those machines for even a brief period of time

418
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,788
[SPEAKER_11]: um, might be life threatening and certainly injurious to their health.

419
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:29,889
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, I, uh, uh, second approval on this, uh, motion, Mr. President.

420
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:31,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

421
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

422
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

423
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I'd like to thank, uh, Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

424
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:41,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the, uh, resident, um, uh, actually gave me a call as well.

425
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:45,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, there's some, uh, really legitimate concerns here that need to be addressed.

426
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:54,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Councilor Mark said, there are hundreds of units here with elderly people and disabled people, and we need to make sure there's a plan in place.

427
00:38:55,458 --> 00:39:05,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to see if we could amend the resolution to actually see if actually the fire department is aware of a plan, if they have a copy of the plan, if they could send it to us.

428
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:13,808
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't, if we could have the housing authority send that emergency plan to the fire department, I would think that as first responders,

429
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:18,939
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, the fire department and the police department should have a copy of the emergency plan.

430
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I thank the council for bringing this forward and I support it.

431
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:22,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

432
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:23,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

433
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:23,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

434
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:24,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Nice.

435
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:26,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

436
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:28,765
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to commend Councilor Marks for putting this resolution forward.

437
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:29,646
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great idea.

438
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, certainly questions that need to be answered.

439
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:40,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, whereas we have an interim director right now, I think it would also be important that, um, we send copies of the resolution to each member of the Medford housing authority board.

440
00:39:40,738 --> 00:39:45,060
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also think it would be important that we send a copy to the Director of Civil Defense, which is coming out of the Board of Health right now.

441
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:51,784
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just ask that the paper be amended to include those individuals to receive copies of the resolution.

442
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:54,565
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully we can get an answer within 10 days or so, Mr. President.

443
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:55,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Move for approval.

444
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:56,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

445
00:39:57,426 --> 00:40:00,728
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended.

446
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:03,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks.

447
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:10,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if we could, if we can also get the name of the person, if anyone behind the railing knows of the civil defense person,

448
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:15,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the position has been vacant for several years now.

449
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would be curious.

450
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:22,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Dello Russo.

451
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,524
[SPEAKER_11]: The qualifications and duties of that person have been assumed into the role of the director of health.

452
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:31,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

453
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:32,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

454
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:35,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said, Councilor Dello Russo.

455
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:41,066
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended.

456
00:40:43,947 --> 00:40:44,728
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

457
00:40:45,668 --> 00:40:46,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

458
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:51,752
[SPEAKER_04]: 17.319 offered by Vice President Mox.

459
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:55,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the issue of natural gas leaks

460
00:40:56,396 --> 00:40:58,718
[SPEAKER_04]: in the city of Medford be discussed?

461
00:40:59,138 --> 00:41:00,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Mox.

462
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

463
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:04,322
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very important subject.

464
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:20,095
[SPEAKER_05]: On March 20th of this year, National Grid came out to the McGlynn Middle School to talk to residents about their natural gas bills and concerns and any questions they may have.

465
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:23,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that particular meeting, Mr. President,

466
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:34,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Residents raised a number of very valid questions, but one that kept on coming up over and over again was natural gas leaks within the community.

467
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:41,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the meeting, it was explained that natural gas leaks contain CO2 and methane.

468
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:52,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And a result of corroded pipes, which we know many of the pipes that are under our roads and streets, are many, many years old.

469
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:57,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And after a while, the joints become faulty.

470
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:59,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And they end up fractioning.

471
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:06,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's typically caused by heavy trucking that may go up and down streets.

472
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:09,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It's caused by digging in particular areas.

473
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:15,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But National Grid has a report, and that's why I offered this resolution tonight.

474
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:19,526
[SPEAKER_05]: They categorize the type of leaks that are in every community.

475
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:28,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And they categorize them as grade one, which is eminent threat of explosion, grade two,

476
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:32,413
[SPEAKER_05]: threatens the health of property in grade three.

477
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:34,514
[SPEAKER_05]: No threat to health or property.

478
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:52,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And according to National Grid, Medford currently has zero grade one and two leaks, which I guess is great news, but has over 260 plus grade three leaks that, according to them, are decades old.

479
00:42:52,983 --> 00:42:56,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I offer this tonight, Mr. President, is that

480
00:42:56,558 --> 00:43:09,262
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, knowing how the infrastructure works in the community, knowing how water and sewer and the pipes that are underground, uh, as they age, uh, don't get, uh, less leaky, they become more leaky.

481
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:17,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, knowing that we have over 260, uh, leaks currently in the city, many of which may be decades old.

482
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:22,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I would venture to say that these leaks are no longer grade three leaks,

483
00:43:23,323 --> 00:43:25,284
[SPEAKER_05]: but could be grade one or two leaks.

484
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:27,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And how often are we looking at these leaks?

485
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:29,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they re-inspected every year?

486
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

487
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:32,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my question tonight, Mr. President.

488
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:50,153
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could get a report back from National Grid on how often grade three leaks in the city of Medford are being monitored, if we can get that particular reporting on how frequent they are monitored, and also, Mr. President,

489
00:43:51,130 --> 00:44:10,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have to talk to our state delegation because as part of the meeting that was held, they said currently grade 3 leaks are not prioritized by National Grid because they don't receive any type of reimbursement on grade 3 leaks.

490
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:15,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Grade 1 and 2 leaks, they receive reimbursement either from the state or federal government.

491
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:16,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not quite sure on that.

492
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:19,334
[SPEAKER_05]: So grade 3 leaks are not a priority.

493
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:22,803
[SPEAKER_05]: We happen to be inundated with grade three leaks.

494
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:41,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And knowing they're not a priority, knowing that many of these leaks have been out there for decades, I'm very concerned, Mr. President, that if National Grid is not on their game, these leaks could be turning into grade one and grade two leaks, which pose an imminent threat to health and safety and property of this community.

495
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that would be my motion tonight, Mr. President.

496
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:48,844
[SPEAKER_05]: We see reporting and potentially

497
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:59,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if a representative from National Grid can come before this council to give us an explanation on the current condition of leaks within our community.

498
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Mox.

499
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:06,473
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

500
00:45:06,513 --> 00:45:07,214
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

501
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:11,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to speak in this matter?

502
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:13,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

503
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:30,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Boddandy.

504
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:34,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

505
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:36,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford.

506
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Council President.

507
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:39,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your attention.

508
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:45,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought I'd share some information about this gas leak situation.

509
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 15 years ago, my wife said there was a gas leak in front of the house, but I couldn't tell.

510
00:45:52,965 --> 00:45:56,167
[SPEAKER_00]: She can smell a cigarette from a mile away, but I really can't.

511
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:59,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So sure enough, a gas leak.

512
00:46:01,148 --> 00:46:14,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Our employee, National Grid, came in front of the house, and they didn't notice my new tree on Cushion Street was dwarfed, and it looked like it was dying compared to the others that were newly planted.

513
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:23,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, across the street, they had gone through multiple trees, about number 26 Cushion.

514
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:29,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guest gentleman said to me, listen,

515
00:46:30,403 --> 00:46:39,631
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I thought he said stage one, stage two, stage three, or I said grade, you said stage, whatever it is, there's one, two, and three.

516
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:41,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which was the worst.

517
00:46:41,793 --> 00:46:45,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you counsel much, you know better, and your mind is refreshed.

518
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:49,379
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he said it was not so bad.

519
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:58,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so he also says to me, don't say I said it, so I'm not quoting his name, I probably have it in my notes.

520
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:02,399
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Medford is known as the gassy city.

521
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like shocked me.

522
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:07,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I presume it has nothing to do with Boston baked beans, mind you.

523
00:47:09,084 --> 00:47:17,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I've been seeing them walking around and driving around with their scanners and snifters, whatever they hang from their bumpers.

524
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:23,955
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, they did come and replace the whole main for the entire street.

525
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:27,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been fortunate.

526
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:29,399
[SPEAKER_00]: We have new infrastructure on that street.

527
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:36,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And they replanted new trees, because they also did the sidewalks.

528
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:47,325
[SPEAKER_00]: And our tree in the front seems a little bit more dwarfed than the other one we have on the front, which is more on the Abbott's corner.

529
00:47:47,985 --> 00:47:57,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And across the street, where they already went through three trees prior to the replacement of the new line, their tree looks more dwarfed than mine.

530
00:47:57,151 --> 00:48:00,574
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's ready to go to De La Rusal's pretty soon.

531
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:09,611
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered the information I'd like to share.

532
00:48:11,132 --> 00:48:17,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And just think, these pipes are probably 100 years old or more, give or take 20 years.

533
00:48:19,317 --> 00:48:24,200
[SPEAKER_00]: God forbid if we ever had to do entire re-digging the infrastructure.

534
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:31,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this country could afford such a thing and the inconvenience.

535
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:37,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're gonna have to do a piece when it becomes a stage one, as you say, Councilor Marks.

536
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:46,510
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to re-quote this gentleman, just don't quote me, but Medford is known as the gassy city.

537
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:48,331
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to offer.

538
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:49,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

539
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:52,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor, Vice President Marks.

540
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:53,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

541
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:59,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, you know, another point that I didn't bring up, uh, is the fact that, you know,

542
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:06,457
[SPEAKER_05]: The gas that's coming into the community is meted in outer parts of the city.

543
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have giant gas lines.

544
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:10,901
[SPEAKER_05]: They know exactly how much gas is coming into the community.

545
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:14,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's broken up by the individual businesses, homes, and so forth.

546
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:21,390
[SPEAKER_05]: What is not going into your home or your business is unaccounted for gas that's leaking, these 260 plus

547
00:49:23,405 --> 00:49:25,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be 300, 400, who knows?

548
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:29,887
[SPEAKER_05]: But that cost is not picked up by National Grid.

549
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:31,708
[SPEAKER_05]: That's picked up by the consumer.

550
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:36,529
[SPEAKER_05]: That's picked up by URI, all these different leaks similar to the water and sewer.

551
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:39,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We have unaccounted for water in this community.

552
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not water I'm using or any other rate payer.

553
00:49:44,372 --> 00:49:47,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It's water that's leaking directly into the ground that we're paying for.

554
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:52,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is not a win-win for our community, the fact that

555
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,581
[SPEAKER_05]: These are low-grade leaks.

556
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:58,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's costing us, Mr. President, to pay for the leaks.

557
00:49:58,584 --> 00:50:09,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also costing us, Mr. President, as we heard, within our environment, and also the potential threat from these decade-old leaks that we have in the community.

558
00:50:10,051 --> 00:50:11,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to bring up that point.

559
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:12,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

560
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:16,896
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

561
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:17,656
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

562
00:50:17,676 --> 00:50:17,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

563
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:19,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes. 17.

564
00:50:23,072 --> 00:50:24,393
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 offered by Councilor Knight.

565
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:29,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council adopt the following law.

566
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:37,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. I'm just going to read the beginning of it.

567
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:39,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, be it resolved.

568
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:45,747
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford city council adopt the following ordinance regulating the use of security bars and grates in the city of Medford.

569
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:53,166
[SPEAKER_04]: In order that we get regular integrates on commercial properties and industrial properties in the city of Medford.

570
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:57,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to waive the reading.

571
00:50:58,271 --> 00:50:58,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

572
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:06,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much and Councilor Caraviello, thank you for making that motion so we didn't have to read this long and

573
00:51:06,923 --> 00:51:09,344
[SPEAKER_13]: voluminous piece of language here.

574
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:19,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, ultimately this is a draft proposal that I would expect to go through the legislative process, through the subcommittee process, the committee of the whole process, and make it back here to the council floor after deliberation.

575
00:51:19,687 --> 00:51:28,030
[SPEAKER_13]: But what it is, is it is an attempt to regulate security bars and grates on commercial and industrial properties that abide the public way.

576
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,530
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a beautification initiative, Mr. President.

577
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:35,512
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel as though right now in the day and age that we're in with the technological advances that we have,

578
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:41,406
[SPEAKER_13]: and the fact that a number of these security grates aren't being utilized in a fashion that would be neighborly.

579
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:44,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes they don't go up at all during working hours when they're graffitied.

580
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:48,810
[SPEAKER_13]: The graffiti doesn't come off, and at the end of the day, the grate comes down and the graffiti remains on.

581
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,092
[SPEAKER_13]: The security grate, I think that there are certain issues that we need to look at in this regard, Mr. President.

582
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:57,494
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I drafted a proposal, and it's a phase-in proposal.

583
00:51:57,734 --> 00:52:03,477
[SPEAKER_13]: It calls for any existing commercial or industrially zoned property that has a security bars, grills, or grates

584
00:52:03,813 --> 00:52:07,615
[SPEAKER_13]: that were properly permitted to have a 10-year window to remove those from the community.

585
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:15,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And any location that has security grates that were not installed in compliance with the building code is five years to remove those.

586
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:25,824
[SPEAKER_13]: So existing structures that have these security bars, grills, or grates that are up would have 10 years if they were put in there in a conforming basis and five years in a non-conforming basis to take it off.

587
00:52:25,844 --> 00:52:31,627
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also some restrictions in there relative to whether or not a permit's pulled and a requirement to take the security grates down.

588
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:45,553
[SPEAKER_13]: But ultimately, this is, Mr. President, an attempt to start a discussion on the issue of security grates, grills, and the like that cover windows of commercial and industrial properties that are but public ways that provide an unsightly appearance to individuals driving into the community.

589
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:53,496
[SPEAKER_13]: If we take a look at our zoning map, we'll see that there are many commercial and industrially zoned areas that lie on the fringes and the periphery of our community, the gateways to our community.

590
00:52:53,857 --> 00:53:00,740
[SPEAKER_13]: And the impression that we want to give people coming to Medford isn't that it's an unsafe community that requires security grates, bars, and grills on your windows, Mr. President.

591
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,700
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the intent of this.

592
00:53:02,172 --> 00:53:07,094
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, proposal, I would move that the matter be sent to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances of further improper vetting.

593
00:53:07,694 --> 00:53:07,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

594
00:53:08,014 --> 00:53:08,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor.

595
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:09,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

596
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:11,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I, uh, thank you, Mr. President.

597
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:11,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

598
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:13,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

599
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:31,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what's great with resolutions like this and the next resolution is that, uh, you get the dialogue started and I think I'm, I'd second the, the subcommittee, uh, motion to move to subcommittee because these are the discussions that, that when they go into that other room that hopefully a televised soon that people can see the real work getting done.

600
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:38,679
[SPEAKER_08]: and understanding that, um, I got a few phone calls and some phone calls will jeopardize the security.

601
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:45,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have other, I had a few phone calls saying that's great because a lot of people that do have the greats are keeping the greats down.

602
00:53:45,341 --> 00:53:49,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where the graffiti artists are really tagging those areas.

603
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:57,245
[SPEAKER_08]: And which that brings up another point in, I think is probably the greatest points is our ordinance is focusing on, on graffiti throughout the community.

604
00:53:57,685 --> 00:53:58,645
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, um,

605
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:04,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is a great start for many different issues that we can, it could morph into.

606
00:54:04,562 --> 00:54:07,884
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I second that motion to, uh, move to subcommittee.

607
00:54:08,684 --> 00:54:09,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

608
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:10,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

609
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:11,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

610
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:12,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

611
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:14,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank, uh, council and I for bringing this forward.

612
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:18,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I think this is a good resolution that will, uh, help beautify the city.

613
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:23,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I'm in full agreement that this is something that would benefit the whole community.

614
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:28,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I look forward to this, uh, moving to the, uh, zoning and ordinance subcommittee.

615
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:31,189
[SPEAKER_06]: where we can get to work on it, hopefully right away.

616
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:37,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a lot going on in that subcommittee, but I may get to work on this, and I think it will benefit everyone.

617
00:54:37,651 --> 00:54:38,251
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

618
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:39,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

619
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:42,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Castagnetti, would you like to speak?

620
00:54:42,632 --> 00:54:42,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

621
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:44,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

622
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:47,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

623
00:54:49,193 --> 00:54:57,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate Councilor Knight's concern about keeping a more of a Winchester-type atmosphere versus a Chelsea-type atmosphere.

624
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:02,177
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thought, glad you respect the city.

625
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:08,041
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me most people in the world, including in our community, are good people.

626
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:27,633
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some that have issues, and maybe they do bad things, and I'm not sure if we can, if someone can dictate, even through an ordinance, and you probably can, but to whether they should have grates or not, especially if they're carrying 24 karat gold bullion or jewelry,

627
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about ice cream parlors.

628
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:50,431
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think in order to avoid possibly more of the secondhand shops and massage parlors, which kept Medford hopping until after 8 o'clock at night, but they had to go, I guess.

629
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:54,012
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had them roll up the sidewalks at 4 PM at least.

630
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:57,654
[SPEAKER_00]: However, all kidding aside,

631
00:55:58,783 --> 00:56:13,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's more important for the leadership in the city to make better amends to beautify our city, and at least clean up the trash.

632
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:22,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not Winchester, but I fear it might become like the communities on the East Coast, as late as I'm planning.

633
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:39,215
[SPEAKER_00]: behind Mystic River Bend Park, for example, that parking lot, and I've said it to many people, leaders in this community, it's insane.

634
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:41,856
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a war zone.

635
00:56:42,096 --> 00:56:45,798
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these cement things that are supposed to stop the cars from hitting the curb.

636
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:50,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've been plowed over and broken in half, and you have rebar sticking up.

637
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid someone's going to end up in a wheelchair

638
00:56:56,218 --> 00:57:01,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of debris back there, and it's just, that's only one location.

639
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:05,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, what's her name, Aretha Franklin, R-E-S.

640
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:07,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect the city.

641
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:10,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Do something.

642
00:57:13,311 --> 00:57:19,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides the great work you're doing, we gotta have respect.

643
00:57:20,097 --> 00:57:25,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind picking up papers in the street, pieces of plywood in Medford Square on Salem Street, Riverside Ave,

644
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:28,468
[SPEAKER_00]: But what am I going to put in my pocket?

645
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:43,198
[SPEAKER_00]: The city could do a better job, although DPW employees have a shortage of manpower, in my estimation, and they're tired after a snowstorm.

646
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:51,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of spending money for the high execs, maybe we should hire a few Indians, so to speak.

647
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:55,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of that free cash.

648
00:57:56,186 --> 00:58:01,671
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean up the neighborhood, and maybe people will stop throwing their chewing gum wrappers on the street.

649
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:04,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thinking out loud, sir.

650
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:05,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

651
00:58:05,955 --> 00:58:08,438
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, a second and by?

652
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:08,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

653
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,460
[SPEAKER_04]: By Councilor Falco.

654
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:12,822
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

655
00:58:12,842 --> 00:58:12,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

656
00:58:14,063 --> 00:58:17,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

657
00:58:17,386 --> 00:58:21,550
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-321, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved

658
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:29,101
[SPEAKER_04]: that the City of Medford adopt the following ordinances, re-regulating donation boxes in the City of Medford.

659
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:33,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitions.

660
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:40,166
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Falco that we waive the reading.

661
00:58:45,408 --> 00:58:49,129
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

662
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

663
00:58:50,872 --> 00:58:53,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much and Councilor Falco, thank you as well.

664
00:58:54,333 --> 00:59:06,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Similar to the preceding matter that was on the agenda and that was just discussed, this is nothing more than an opportunity for us to start a discussion and it's a proposal to regulate donation drop boxes across the community.

665
00:59:06,898 --> 00:59:19,162
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all of us behind this rail have been contacted by a number of individuals that are concerned about this proposal and the effect that it will have on our public schools and the fundraising drive that they have going on with Bay State Textiles.

666
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:26,515
[SPEAKER_13]: And this proposal in no way was designed to hurt that effort in any way.

667
00:59:28,016 --> 00:59:34,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Since the filing of the proposal, Mr. President, I've had discussions with several of my colleagues as well as members of the general public.

668
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:35,762
[SPEAKER_13]: It was my intention and my intent.

669
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is a beautification initiative.

670
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:43,728
[SPEAKER_13]: The intent of the ordinance is to put some restrictions around donation drop boxes to ensure that we have opportunities

671
00:59:44,235 --> 00:59:50,862
[SPEAKER_13]: and abilities to keep areas clean, to keep neighborhood quality of life and beautification at the forefront, Mr. President.

672
00:59:51,382 --> 00:59:53,404
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, this is also a paper that

673
00:59:53,791 --> 01:00:05,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd request to get sent to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances but ultimately what it does is it requires a permitting process for those entities that wish to utilize a donation drop box.

674
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:19,223
[SPEAKER_13]: It requires a sketch of the spot, the dimensions of the box, where it's going to be placed and approval by the building department so that we're sure that this donation drop box, number one, is authorized by the property owner and number two, doesn't provide a risk to public safety.

675
01:00:19,777 --> 01:00:26,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but again, it's an opportunity for us to Scott, it's not a discussion, Mr. President, I'd ask that the matter be sent to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

676
01:00:27,443 --> 01:00:38,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's in no way an effort to earn attempt to restrict the, um, great work that the Metro public schools and base day textile have done in cooperation, um, as fundraising drives for our PTOs.

677
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:46,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's more or less an initiative to address a matter that's been before this council, um, at least three times this term and at least four times last term, Mr. President.

678
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:48,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, council.

679
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:48,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And I,

680
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:50,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

681
01:00:50,554 --> 01:00:51,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

682
01:00:51,395 --> 01:00:54,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I second the motion that this move to the zoning and ordinance subcommittee.

683
01:00:55,256 --> 01:00:58,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, this is a process, uh, it's a, it's a proposed, uh, resolution.

684
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:05,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, uh, there are many changes and adjustments that can be made, uh, to make this an effective resolution.

685
01:01:05,801 --> 01:01:14,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, one of the big concerns from many of the parents in the community, um, and from the PTOs is that, uh, it will, um, have an impact on the Bay state textiles.

686
01:01:14,564 --> 01:01:19,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do not want, uh, that to have, um, a negative impact, uh,

687
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,340
[SPEAKER_06]: on that program.

688
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:25,603
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a program that raises money for the various PTOs throughout the city.

689
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:32,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself and I know Councilor Scarpelli, when we were on this school committee, this is a program that we supported 100%.

690
01:01:33,347 --> 01:01:40,110
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a program that gives back $7,000 over the past 30 months.

691
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,210
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty significant.

692
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a significant income for the PTOs.

693
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:49,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to make sure that if we draft an ordinance, or we're going to draft an ordinance, that we make sure we do it right.

694
01:01:49,763 --> 01:01:52,684
[SPEAKER_06]: and we make sure that it doesn't impact this program that's already in place.

695
01:01:53,165 --> 01:01:59,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely second that this move to the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee and move for approval.

696
01:01:59,288 --> 01:02:00,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Favreau.

697
01:02:00,308 --> 01:02:01,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lococo-Kurin.

698
01:02:01,569 --> 01:02:03,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

699
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:18,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I did receive a number of, I think, three phone calls on this and a number of emails, the same as my colleagues from Concerned Parents, members of the PTO, I believe the two creators of the Bay State textiles Dropboxes,

700
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:22,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a number of things that do concern me, especially a fee.

701
01:02:22,297 --> 01:02:29,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe the fee of $100 that might be required if we do create an ordinance with this language.

702
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:37,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important that we vet this out completely, whether that be in subcommittee or in committee of the whole, because of the grave controversy.

703
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:46,183
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that one thing that should be done before we have a committee meeting is that we research what boxes are out there, who owns them,

704
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:55,370
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure we understand the legalities and the agreements they have with whether it be the school or the city or commercial property.

705
01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:09,659
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand what it is these contracts state and how we can regulate them and whether or not we should regulate them in different ways depending on where they're located because we definitely don't want the PTOs to lose money, fundraising money.

706
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was over $7,000 that the PTOs have

707
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,203
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to obtain from Bay State textiles.

708
01:03:18,663 --> 01:03:27,168
[SPEAKER_01]: So creating this fee per box may hinder that money that goes to the PTOs, and you've got a good 10 people that are really concerned about it.

709
01:03:27,248 --> 01:03:35,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that we can potentially do this together, whether that be in the Committee of the Whole or in a subcommittee, and really vet this process out.

710
01:03:36,734 --> 01:03:37,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor McLaren.

711
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:39,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

712
01:03:39,296 --> 01:03:40,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

713
01:03:41,542 --> 01:04:04,038
[SPEAKER_08]: The the spirit of this this resolution, I believe that I too got the phone calls and emails and And being on the school committee and understanding that at the time how important this initiative was for our PTOs and I think that the focus that I was really looking at with this this resolution is Really getting a database in place where as you see in different neighborhoods.

714
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:06,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I know in the Heights we have one

715
01:04:07,098 --> 01:04:09,899
[SPEAKER_08]: next to a convenience store that's overflowing onto the sidewalk.

716
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really poses a real eyesore.

717
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:16,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And neighbors there had concerns where it butts their driveways.

718
01:04:16,303 --> 01:04:26,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that's where really having understanding who the contact person is, how we can remedy some of these solutions.

719
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:32,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's probably the biggest and most aggressive campaign with this resolution.

720
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:36,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I, too, support this to go to subcommittee.

721
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,801
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to be vetted like President, excuse me, Councilor Lungo-Koehns mentioned.

722
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:57,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I think that to all the phone calls and emails that, rest assured, this committee is all in favor of making sure that it doesn't affect with partners like we have with the Bay State Textiles.

723
01:04:57,307 --> 01:04:58,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So we appreciate their effort.

724
01:04:59,007 --> 01:04:59,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

725
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

726
01:05:02,516 --> 01:05:03,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

727
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:04,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

728
01:05:04,697 --> 01:05:09,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the textile recycling is something that's certainly on the forefront right now of everybody's mind.

729
01:05:09,998 --> 01:05:14,939
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that the Mass DEP has been very focused on promoting throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

730
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:18,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Here this evening we have Catherine Larson as well from Baystate Textiles.

731
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:32,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, she dropped off a nice packet of information for me and she's agreed to become a resource of technical assistance moving forward to ensure that we craft language in an ordinance for the city that does not impact the work of

732
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,982
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very simple fix, Mr. President.

733
01:05:36,002 --> 01:05:42,945
[SPEAKER_13]: We just put language in there that says nothing in this article shall apply to the Medford Public Schools or the property that's under their control and direction, and then it's over.

734
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:45,946
[SPEAKER_13]: So I certainly think it's something that we can address in subcommittee.

735
01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:49,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly think that it's something that's an easy fix, not a hard one, Mr. President.

736
01:05:49,548 --> 01:06:01,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, the intention legislatively was not to restrict or impede upon the fundraising abilities of our public schools, and it's certainly not to have a negative impact on Bay State Textiles and the

737
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,931
[SPEAKER_13]: relationship and partnership that they've been able to forge with our public schools.

738
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:06,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

739
01:06:06,991 --> 01:06:07,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

740
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

741
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:15,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting both these resolutions on.

742
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:27,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just, you know, I need to state that I think what's being offered now on our council agendas are no longer resolutions.

743
01:06:29,038 --> 01:06:29,698
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular,

744
01:06:30,162 --> 01:06:35,824
[SPEAKER_05]: when we receive a two-page ordinance, that's really not a resolution.

745
01:06:36,824 --> 01:06:49,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can get the same outcome by putting on a resolution that we need to explore drop-off boxes in the community and then discuss it in the council and decide if we want to send it to subcommittee.

746
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:59,772
[SPEAKER_05]: But to get a two-page ordinance, I think, honestly, it does an injustice to, first of all, our process here as a council, because this is not the process

747
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:01,774
[SPEAKER_05]: in the way things should work.

748
01:07:02,795 --> 01:07:07,840
[SPEAKER_05]: An ordinance doesn't appear the first time on the council as a motion or a resolution.

749
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:10,142
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens down the line.

750
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:18,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what we saw just with this, and I'm not saying anything about the council or in particular, because I've probably been at fault doing this myself.

751
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:30,083
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, people read our, our agendas and look at it and say, Oh my goodness, it says the council, uh, be resolved that the city council adopt the following ordinance.

752
01:07:30,623 --> 01:07:31,864
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about this tonight.

753
01:07:31,884 --> 01:07:33,085
[SPEAKER_05]: They may adopt this tonight.

754
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:34,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even been able to read it.

755
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:35,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been able to discuss it.

756
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:45,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's alarming people to see this type of, uh, in depth, um, ordinance creation on the council agenda.

757
01:07:46,565 --> 01:07:56,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And my my just humble approach would be I would respectfully ask my colleagues that in the future We could discuss issues of ordinance change or anything.

758
01:07:56,471 --> 01:08:01,794
[SPEAKER_05]: We want without presenting You know a two or three page ordinance on the council agenda

759
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, so I would just state that I think these are worthy things that we should be looking at and discussing.

760
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to alarm people in the community.

761
01:08:12,042 --> 01:08:15,764
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something because potentially this is on the agenda tonight.

762
01:08:16,044 --> 01:08:23,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Potentially if you had, uh, four members of this council tonight, that's all we require can move this to a first reading tonight.

763
01:08:24,589 --> 01:08:27,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and the second reason newspaper and the third readings down the line.

764
01:08:28,091 --> 01:08:30,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I, I think that's where some of the concern comes in.

765
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:38,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to say that's going to happen because this council has been very thoughtful about sending things to subcommittee and vetting them all properly.

766
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, I would just caution my council colleagues that really, uh, the agenda is not the first place of two or three page ordinance should appear.

767
01:08:47,539 --> 01:08:53,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Mr. President, that should be released from subcommittee or committee of the whole and not on the council agenda.

768
01:08:54,821 --> 01:08:55,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, vice president of mocks.

769
01:08:56,782 --> 01:08:57,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

770
01:08:58,123 --> 01:08:59,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Mr. President,

771
01:08:59,757 --> 01:09:09,241
[SPEAKER_13]: As the legislative body in the community, we need to start somewhere, and that's what this attempt at this proposal was to do, to start somewhere, to have this discussion start.

772
01:09:10,001 --> 01:09:19,665
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's certain aspects of the proposal that people don't like or that are possibly ineffective or not suitable for MEDFED at this point in time, that's great.

773
01:09:19,705 --> 01:09:22,826
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we have the discussion and we go through the vetting process, Mr. President.

774
01:09:23,486 --> 01:09:25,307
[SPEAKER_13]: However, it's all too often that we

775
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:29,963
[SPEAKER_13]: put items on the agenda and we say, do this, do that, do this, do that, and then nothing ever happens with them.

776
01:09:30,683 --> 01:09:38,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And I figured that it might be more conducive to time and to getting things done to actually put some language on a piece of paper as a launching pad, as a starting point.

777
01:09:38,725 --> 01:09:40,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we can go from there, Mr. President.

778
01:09:40,506 --> 01:09:41,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, it's a proposal.

779
01:09:41,586 --> 01:09:43,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Proposals pass, proposals fail.

780
01:09:44,107 --> 01:09:55,970
[SPEAKER_13]: It's certainly something that I'm comfortable supporting with the fact that we can take it through the subcommittee process, that it's going to have to go to a committee of the whole after it goes through the subcommittee process, that it's going to have to come to this council.

781
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:01,062
[SPEAKER_13]: for a vote for a first reading, be advertised for a second reading, and then come back to the council for a third reading, Mr. President.

782
01:10:01,082 --> 01:10:08,645
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can certainly understand Councilor Marks's concern, because it did prompt some, I don't want to say fear, but certainly interest in the community.

783
01:10:09,665 --> 01:10:16,147
[SPEAKER_13]: However, you know, I felt as though it would be in the best interest of this body moving forward to put something with some language on a piece of paper.

784
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:19,709
[SPEAKER_13]: We've voted three or four times now to regulate donation drop boxes.

785
01:10:21,315 --> 01:10:23,156
[SPEAKER_13]: and nothing's ever come of it, Mr. President.

786
01:10:23,196 --> 01:10:28,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So I took some of the concerns that I heard over the last couple of years and I put them together and put pen to paper and made a proposal.

787
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:36,162
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where I was coming from with this, but I can certainly understand what the councillor is referring to in terms of, um, you know, shouting fire in a crowded movie theater.

788
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this isn't going to pass this evening.

789
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:40,024
[SPEAKER_13]: It was never an intention to have this matter pass this evening.

790
01:10:40,344 --> 01:10:42,846
[SPEAKER_13]: My intention was to have the matter go through the legislative process.

791
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:45,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, just like we do with most matters that come before this council.

792
01:10:45,847 --> 01:10:46,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

793
01:10:46,187 --> 01:10:46,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor.

794
01:10:46,768 --> 01:10:47,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Russo.

795
01:10:48,363 --> 01:10:56,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I don't want to seem argumentative in any way, but I think this is a demonstration of a way that legislative process works well.

796
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:05,156
[SPEAKER_11]: It works in other bodies this way, both on the local, state, and federal level, Mr. President.

797
01:11:05,536 --> 01:11:13,963
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think in recent years, we've seen a great use and work in subcommittee.

798
01:11:14,538 --> 01:11:36,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, Mr. President, in your chairmanship of several subcommittees and also under the chairmanship of Councilor Knight and Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Kern and Councilor Marks and the various roles and chairmanship of subcommittees, we've seen great work in the subcommittees in recent years.

799
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:41,888
[SPEAKER_11]: They've not worked this hard, in my estimation, in decades.

800
01:11:42,608 --> 01:11:43,549
[SPEAKER_11]: You're correct.

801
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:59,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, uh, I, uh, never thought that a Councilor Knight would, uh, um, uh, expect any type of, uh, decision making tonight other than to send these matters to subcommittee.

802
01:11:59,748 --> 01:11:59,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

803
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:28,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, and we've, uh, certainly received, uh, proposals of ordinance, uh, whether it be, uh, through a change in pay grades, uh, loan orders and, uh, any number of proposed ordinances come from the administrative side, uh, to us in the form of an ordinance proposed ordinance that we've, uh, uh, discussed delayed action on, uh, and then, uh, it was, uh, actually, uh, the good measure.

804
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:46,354
[SPEAKER_11]: of Councilor Marks who called to all of our attention, and we've held to this over the past two years, that we not pass matters of ordinance in a first reading in wave three.

805
01:12:46,855 --> 01:12:57,183
[SPEAKER_11]: And this body has stuck to that for two years, which I think is a very good measure and is sound principle in legislation, Mr. President.

806
01:12:58,134 --> 01:13:09,989
[SPEAKER_11]: So, my remarks aren't to be disagreeable, but only to point out my opinion on the way this process is working, and I think it's working well.

807
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:11,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Dela Rousseau.

808
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:14,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

809
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:18,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

810
01:13:19,573 --> 01:13:25,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I was reading this ordinance and I think it is definitely well written and the points are very well taken.

811
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:32,798
[SPEAKER_10]: There is one thing that I would like to suggest to add to this is simply the drop boxes.

812
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:38,080
[SPEAKER_10]: The biggest problem with the drop boxes is the amount of product that actually goes to those boxes and the overflow.

813
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:44,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe there's some way we can ask for some sort of a calendar or something of pickup

814
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:48,262
[SPEAKER_10]: when the pickups occur, how many pickups are for each individual box.

815
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:52,004
[SPEAKER_10]: That way there you have a monitoring system and you can hold people accountable for that.

816
01:13:52,444 --> 01:13:54,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's really the biggest issue of those boxes.

817
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:56,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of those boxes are pretty well kept.

818
01:13:56,706 --> 01:14:01,047
[SPEAKER_10]: They're clean, they're neat, they're well painted, they're not really too disastrous.

819
01:14:01,427 --> 01:14:04,769
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the amount of product that goes around those boxes.

820
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:11,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe there's that one window that you have an opportunity to kind of monitor that and maybe to have better control over that.

821
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:11,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

822
01:14:12,232 --> 01:14:13,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. McKillop.

823
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:21,827
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, that this be sent to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

824
01:14:22,507 --> 01:14:23,288
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

825
01:14:23,308 --> 01:14:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

826
01:14:25,289 --> 01:14:25,929
[SPEAKER_04]: No opposed?

827
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:27,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

828
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:42,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the city administration reach out to National Grid with issues dealing with the power outages around the city and report back to the city council.

829
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, yeah, we'll spend the rules out to take papers and answer the clerk.

830
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:49,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Layton.

831
01:14:50,193 --> 01:14:50,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

832
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:51,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

833
01:14:51,493 --> 01:15:09,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I apologize for not putting this on the agenda, but with the recent storm and the outages, mostly in north Medford and the Wellington area, I've received a few phone calls from people that live in the Felsway and the Salem Street area that they've been

834
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:18,114
[SPEAKER_08]: They've come across a few loud noise booms and then brief power outages.

835
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:33,344
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can have the city administration discuss this with the national grid and see what might be causing this so we can let our constituents know what are these issues.

836
01:15:33,424 --> 01:15:40,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's starting to alarm a few of our senior residents that have contacted me in the last couple of weeks.

837
01:15:40,692 --> 01:15:45,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And this isn't something that's been happening, I take it, just for the winter season.

838
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:47,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But this has been happening for a while now.

839
01:15:47,894 --> 01:15:53,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's alarming that it's a long period of outages.

840
01:15:53,315 --> 01:16:01,497
[SPEAKER_08]: But the hearing booms, and then you would have a brief outage for a minute or so.

841
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:02,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it would kick back on.

842
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:10,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there's something going on here, we need to know what the National Grid is doing in that area.

843
01:16:10,837 --> 01:16:18,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can have the city administration reach out to National Grid and give us a report on those outages, it would be greatly appreciated.

844
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

845
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:20,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

846
01:16:21,261 --> 01:16:22,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Dello Russo.

847
01:16:22,722 --> 01:16:23,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

848
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:30,765
[SPEAKER_11]: And perhaps if we could amend that, that the city develop a way of communicating with the public on this.

849
01:16:31,326 --> 01:16:33,967
[SPEAKER_11]: And the difficulty is your power is out.

850
01:16:36,062 --> 01:16:41,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Those of us who still have flip phones don't have the opportunity to check the internet.

851
01:16:43,827 --> 01:16:57,396
[SPEAKER_11]: However, in so many people's phones are now battery, if they have phones in their homes still, and not a old fashioned landline, it's hard to communicate out of that.

852
01:16:58,017 --> 01:17:03,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say this, in this last storm, as I put myself to sleep, I was listening to WBZ.

853
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:06,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Radio 1030, Dan Ray.

854
01:17:07,226 --> 01:17:10,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And he had a representative from National Grid on.

855
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:21,534
[SPEAKER_11]: And in live time, they kept giving updates through the whole show on what was going on throughout Massachusetts.

856
01:17:22,214 --> 01:17:25,636
[SPEAKER_11]: And as Towns Power was coming on, they were announcing it.

857
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:33,600
[SPEAKER_11]: So they, National Grid, to their credit, had a representative on the most listened to radio station

858
01:17:34,187 --> 01:17:48,711
[SPEAKER_11]: in the region and was updating people in real time as to, I heard it, the woman was there, she said, at nine o'clock, I think it was a section of Saugus was supposed to come back on.

859
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,312
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a woman who called who hadn't been listening.

860
01:17:51,992 --> 01:17:55,433
[SPEAKER_11]: She caught it, she says, I live in Saugus, I got no power, when's it coming on?

861
01:17:55,813 --> 01:17:59,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And she said, three, two, one, and boom, the ladies' lights came back on.

862
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:02,315
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty remarkable.

863
01:18:03,544 --> 01:18:06,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for this measure, because we do need clearer communication.

864
01:18:06,886 --> 01:18:08,066
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a major power outage.

865
01:18:08,587 --> 01:18:12,569
[SPEAKER_11]: It was still warm out, so I think it was at the end of the fall, and South Medford was down.

866
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:16,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Half the city was out, really, and it was a complete mess for people.

867
01:18:17,851 --> 01:18:18,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

868
01:18:18,252 --> 01:18:19,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

869
01:18:19,252 --> 01:18:26,916
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Dello Russo, all those in favor?

870
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:26,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

871
01:18:28,377 --> 01:18:30,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dello Russo, I don't know if they make FM radio now.

872
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:37,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so they may want to get a better phone.

873
01:18:37,984 --> 01:18:43,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's 2017.

874
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:47,046
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-323, offered by Vice President Marks and Councilor Knight.

875
01:18:47,726 --> 01:18:56,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Howell on his recent passing.

876
01:18:57,468 --> 01:19:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence

877
01:19:01,662 --> 01:19:02,382
[SPEAKER_04]: in his memory.

878
01:19:06,945 --> 01:19:07,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

879
01:19:07,846 --> 01:19:10,348
[SPEAKER_13]: I defer to the senior member, Mr. President.

880
01:19:10,388 --> 01:19:11,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

881
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:15,431
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a senior member in length of service, not age.

882
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:15,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

883
01:19:16,832 --> 01:19:17,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be me.

884
01:19:17,412 --> 01:19:18,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to clarify that.

885
01:19:21,154 --> 01:19:25,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, uh, Thomas Howell was a long time Method resident.

886
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:28,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he was a staple in this community in the West Method area.

887
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:35,523
[SPEAKER_05]: He worked for the Department of Revenue, don't hold that against him, for a number of years in this community.

888
01:19:36,284 --> 01:19:44,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was married for 50 years with his lovely wife, Mary Ann, and recently passed away.

889
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:52,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really lost a good gentleman in this community, and he will be sorely missed as a great guy, Mr. President.

890
01:19:52,857 --> 01:19:53,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilman.

891
01:19:53,718 --> 01:19:54,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilman Knight.

892
01:19:54,899 --> 01:20:00,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Councilor Marks certainly did a great job remembering Tom.

893
01:20:00,984 --> 01:20:02,945
[SPEAKER_13]: My relationship with Mr. Howell was a little different.

894
01:20:04,426 --> 01:20:10,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember Mr. Howell when he was the manager at Chisholm's Motel, and his nephew Jason and I were very close friends.

895
01:20:11,051 --> 01:20:20,979
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of our first summer jobs, when we were old enough to work, was going over to Chisholm's Motel on Route 1 and flipping mattresses, which that in itself was an experience, let me tell you, Mr. President.

896
01:20:21,713 --> 01:20:29,176
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember when Mr. Howell moved from Chisholm's Motel when he retired to 27 Pleistead Road, and we helped him move.

897
01:20:30,136 --> 01:20:36,318
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 27 Pleistead Road, Mr. President, and the House of the Karate's and the Howell's was one of those homes when we were kids.

898
01:20:36,338 --> 01:20:37,379
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't have to ring the doorbell.

899
01:20:37,719 --> 01:20:39,560
[SPEAKER_13]: We were walking by the house, and we needed to use the bathroom.

900
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,480
[SPEAKER_13]: We needed a drink of water.

901
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:45,401
[SPEAKER_13]: We banged twice, we opened the door, we walked in, we said our name, and she said, help yourself, I'll be right down, honey.

902
01:20:46,461 --> 01:20:49,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Mary Ann, Joanne, Ron, and Tom were the greatest.

903
01:20:49,461 --> 01:20:50,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Great neighbors, great people.

904
01:20:50,942 --> 01:20:53,062
[SPEAKER_13]: And Tom's going to be sadly missed.

905
01:20:53,122 --> 01:20:58,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish the Karate family and the Howell family all the strength that they need to get through this.

906
01:20:59,023 --> 01:21:04,264
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really want to thank them for allowing me to have the opportunity to become a friend of Tom's.

907
01:21:04,804 --> 01:21:06,564
[SPEAKER_13]: And he will be sadly missed, Mr. President.

908
01:21:06,624 --> 01:21:06,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

909
01:21:06,924 --> 01:21:07,725
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could all stand, please.

910
01:21:20,552 --> 01:21:29,498
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-324 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Firefighter Anthony Meyer on his recent promotion to Lieutenant.

911
01:21:29,678 --> 01:21:30,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

912
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:33,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

913
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:38,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Firefighter Meyer has been a long time firefighter in our community and recently he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.

914
01:21:38,824 --> 01:21:41,645
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to thank him for his service and congratulate him on his appointment.

915
01:21:41,765 --> 01:21:45,888
[SPEAKER_13]: It's obviously a testament to the hard work and dedication that he's put forward in his professional career.

916
01:21:46,385 --> 01:21:49,147
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to say thank you very much and congratulations to Anthony Meyer.

917
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:51,228
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd ask that my colleagues join me in doing the same.

918
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

919
01:21:55,651 --> 01:21:57,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

920
01:21:57,172 --> 01:21:57,813
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

921
01:21:59,254 --> 01:21:59,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

922
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:10,862
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-325, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Firefighter Stephen Bluth on his recent promotion to the position of captain.

923
01:22:10,922 --> 01:22:11,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

924
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:12,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Mr. President.

925
01:22:12,963 --> 01:22:15,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Similar to Firefighter Meyer, now Lieutenant Meyer.

926
01:22:16,585 --> 01:22:22,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Firefighter Blute was named a captain very recently, and again, it is also a testament to his dedication and hard work and his commitment to the community of Medford.

927
01:22:23,828 --> 01:22:25,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Great gentleman, long family relationship.

928
01:22:25,749 --> 01:22:28,831
[SPEAKER_13]: His mother and my grandmother go back a very, very long time.

929
01:22:29,831 --> 01:22:37,314
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's very encouraging and pleasing to see somebody with such a relationship to the family be so successful in their professional career.

930
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:43,037
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to congratulate Stephen on his promotion and thank him for his hard work, service, and dedication to the community of Medford.

931
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:46,291
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

932
01:22:46,371 --> 01:22:47,012
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

933
01:22:47,032 --> 01:22:47,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

934
01:22:48,332 --> 01:22:51,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to regular business.

935
01:22:52,355 --> 01:22:55,717

[SPEAKER_04]: 17-322 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Method City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Johnny Marr on his recent passing.

937
01:23:07,003 --> 01:23:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

938
01:23:08,464 --> 01:23:10,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, again, thank you very much.

939
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:18,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Many of us in this community, especially the South Medford area, we all know John Maher, Maher's service station right there across from Dunkin' Donuts.

940
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:21,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And for a number of years, this was a family-owned and operated business.

941
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:24,731
[SPEAKER_13]: And John Maher was a fixture in the community.

942
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:29,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I met him a number of years ago, Mr. President, when I was involved with Papawana football.

943
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:38,655
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mr. Maher was the best cheerleader that the city of Medford ever had when it came to Papawana football and cheering on his kids and the members of the team.

944
01:23:39,508 --> 01:23:41,170
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President.

945
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:44,152
[SPEAKER_13]: His impact on the community is certainly going to be noticed.

946
01:23:44,172 --> 01:23:55,982
[SPEAKER_13]: For the last — the better part of the last four years, he struggled significantly with cancer, and unfortunately, the disease got the better of his mind and body, but it did not get the best of his soul.

947
01:23:56,022 --> 01:24:00,786
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to be greatly remembered, Mr. President, as an individual who gave of himself.

948
01:24:01,267 --> 01:24:06,271
[SPEAKER_13]: For a number of years, he was involved with the Medford Elks and the Elks Organization and all the charitable work that they've done there.

949
01:24:06,738 --> 01:24:09,280
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's touched countless lives, Mr. President.

950
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,361
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to be sadly missed.

951
01:24:10,461 --> 01:24:15,905
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to extend the deepest condolences to his family in this time of loss and time of need, Mr. President.

952
01:24:16,025 --> 01:24:17,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd ask that my colleagues join me in doing the same.

953
01:24:17,546 --> 01:24:18,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

954
01:24:20,008 --> 01:24:20,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Cassidy.

955
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:22,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

956
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:24,892
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Councilor Knight.

957
01:24:24,912 --> 01:24:25,973
[SPEAKER_00]: That's news to me.

958
01:24:25,993 --> 01:24:27,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sorry to hear that John's gone.

959
01:24:28,558 --> 01:24:32,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I was a teenager, we used to get our cars fixed.

960
01:24:32,761 --> 01:24:39,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And if some of us didn't have enough funds, he was very nice about extending time.

961
01:24:40,528 --> 01:24:46,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually didn't really get to know him until I was a member of the Elks.

962
01:24:46,353 --> 01:24:50,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a stature of that organization.

963
01:24:50,196 --> 01:24:52,758
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a very, very good man.

964
01:24:53,483 --> 01:24:54,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sorry to hear it.

965
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:54,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

966
01:24:54,963 --> 01:24:55,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

967
01:24:55,284 --> 01:24:56,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

968
01:24:58,144 --> 01:24:58,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We all rise please.

969
01:25:13,449 --> 01:25:17,030
[SPEAKER_04]: The records of the meeting of March 21st, 2017 have been passed to vice president mocks.

970
01:25:20,087 --> 01:25:23,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Under your investigation, Mr. Councilor Marks, do you find the records in order?

971
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:27,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I just find an error in the records.

972
01:25:27,253 --> 01:25:28,014
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an error in the records.

973
01:25:28,034 --> 01:25:29,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you brought it to the clerk's attention?

974
01:25:29,435 --> 01:25:35,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I have brought it to the clerk's attention, so I ask that it be laid on the table for one week.

975
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,143
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, that the records be laid on the table for one week.

976
