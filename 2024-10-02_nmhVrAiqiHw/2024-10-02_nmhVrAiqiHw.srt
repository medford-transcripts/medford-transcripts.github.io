1
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:50,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Public Works and Facilities Committee of October 1st, 2024, at 6 p.m.

2
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:51,129
[SPEAKER_04]: in City Hall.

3
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, would you call the roll?

4
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:55,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

5
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:56,693
[SPEAKER_05]: President Bears?

6
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,655
[SPEAKER_05]: President Bears appears to be delayed.

7
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro?

8
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:03,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

9
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:04,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemmon?

10
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:04,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

11
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:05,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

12
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Kelly?

14
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:08,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

15
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:10,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

16
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:11,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we are talking about

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:21,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Resolution 24-422, resolution to host a discussion of MassDOT plans for Medford Square Main Street intersection.

18
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:29,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the Massachusetts Department of Transportation is planning to make changes to a busy intersection in the heart of Medford Square,

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,273
[SPEAKER_04]: which will impact drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians for many years to come.

20
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:56,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas the Medford Bicycle Commission attended an informational meeting and expressed concerns with the plans made thus far, now therefore be it resolved that a representative from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation familiar with the plan shall meet with the Medford City Council, a representative of the Medford Bicycle Commission, and a representative of the City of Medford Traffic and Transportation Department

21
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,310
[SPEAKER_04]: in committee to discuss said plans.

22
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,892
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a resolution of Councilor Lazzaro.

23
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:03,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I leave it to you.

24
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:04,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

25
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:17,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So per the Medford Bike Commission, I wanted to hold this committee meeting and give them an opportunity to have a public discussion about this intersection.

26
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:26,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, our representative from MassDOT was not available to meet, but he did send an email that I'd like to read

27
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,511
[SPEAKER_03]: into the record.

28
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:34,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that they'll be able to have another meeting there early in the process.

29
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:42,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was important for us to make sure that we were able to get these notes on the record from the bike commission.

30
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:53,821
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like 25% planning, and they do sort of public feedback, they factor in the feedback, they go back to planning, they

31
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,704
[SPEAKER_03]: do another sort of public meeting session, and then they do the next phase.

32
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:05,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So Greg Fraser is the project manager for this.

33
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:20,679
[SPEAKER_03]: To give some context, this is the intersection of Main Street and Route 16 as it goes sort of under the bridge where Route 16 goes over Main Street by the Mystic River.

34
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very

35
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,820
[SPEAKER_03]: well-traveled intersection, and it's also pretty dangerous.

36
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:36,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right by the, well, it's not like, it has potential to be problematic, let's say that.

37
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:40,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right across from the Medford Police Department headquarters.

38
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a fire station there.

39
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:44,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We have many medical offices.

40
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,174
[SPEAKER_03]: We have lots of businesses.

41
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:51,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's heavily traveled, and it's an intersection of many different

42
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:54,112
[SPEAKER_03]: modes of transportation.

43
00:03:54,452 --> 00:04:01,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, the message that I got from Greg Frazier was, um, sorry for a master.

44
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:02,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

45
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:03,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Project manager for this project.

46
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:14,466
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I have sent the 25% submission to Todd Blake, who is our, as we know, our, um, city, uh, our what's Todd's title.

47
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd's here on zoom.

48
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,048
[SPEAKER_03]: He can tell me his title.

49
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll speak in a minute.

50
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:22,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I've sent out a scheduling poll to meet with the city of Medford bike advisory committee.

51
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:32,088
[SPEAKER_03]: MassDOT highway design complete streets Todd Blake and the consultant Howard Stein Hudson to discuss the design further as agreed upon following the public informational meeting.

52
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:45,632
[SPEAKER_03]: This meeting will allow further discussions now that the design team has had an opportunity to further investigate the design following written comments received from the committee as well as other constituents following the public informational meeting.

53
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:47,032
[SPEAKER_03]: With

54
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:58,732
[SPEAKER_03]: further discussions as at the upcoming meeting, the design team will only have more opportunity to further look into design prior to going to a design public hearing and then continuing further in design.

55
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:00,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So that that's his statement.

56
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:05,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I, my understanding is there's intention to have this be a really fluid process.

57
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,817
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to break ground for quite a while.

58
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:14,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I found that encouraging, but I will go, uh, if I may to, um,

59
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:22,847
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Emily O'Brien, who is here on Zoom, uh, if that's through the chair.

60
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:32,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, she's the, uh, president of our president of our Medford bike commission, and she and I met and spoke at length about this.

61
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:42,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, she outlined the thoughts and, um, concerns that the bike commission had with the plans as they were at the earliest stages.

62
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I would love to hear her, um, perspective on,

63
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:48,637
[SPEAKER_03]: this project.

64
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:49,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

65
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:50,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Emily O'Brien.

66
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:54,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

67
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:54,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

68
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for having me.

69
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:04,147
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first saw these plans, it was in the first time we ever saw them was in the public meeting.

70
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:13,513
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that's challenging about that format is you don't ever get a chance to look at it in depth ahead of time and kind of

71
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:21,088
[SPEAKER_00]: take your time and pick it apart and really see what you're looking at and you get your one chance to say one thing in the public comment period.

72
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:32,459
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially the more we looked at the plans, there were a lot of major problems with the way that bicycles were being handled in this design.

73
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get too granular at the moment because

74
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:42,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, we did send a detailed description of some of the issues.

75
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:50,283
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't, I didn't want to write a whole long list of all of our problems with it because we figured it would be so long that nobody would read that.

76
00:06:51,558 --> 00:07:00,544
[SPEAKER_00]: So we listed some of the biggest problems and requested a meeting where we'd like to go over the rest of them in person.

77
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:04,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just gotten an invitation for a meeting as of this morning.

78
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:14,817
[SPEAKER_00]: In broad strokes, our issues with the designs as they are originally presented.

79
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:16,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, this is really three intersections.

80
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:22,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I can post a link to the presentation materials from that original meeting in the chat.

81
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,633
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's helpful, but that it's really three intersections.

82
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:33,116
[SPEAKER_00]: The first at the south end of the Craddock Bridge before the underpass, if you're leaving Medford Square.

83
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,258
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is after the overpass.

84
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:41,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Main Street and South Street, both of those places and both of those Route 16 ramp exits.

85
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:48,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing, the next one is where Riverside, not Riverside, Mystic Ave and Main Street diverge.

86
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:57,988
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the three big junctions that you see that are closest to the police station, it's really a corridor of three intersections.

87
00:07:58,488 --> 00:07:59,589
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really just one.

88
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:08,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had different plans of different drawings for each one of those spots.

89
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,832
[SPEAKER_00]: In broad strokes, our concerns were that

90
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:19,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of the motions, the movements that bicyclists would need to make through those intersections are being accounted for.

91
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:22,806
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Contraflow lane on South Street.

92
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:25,569
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Clippership connector that isn't finished yet.

93
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:31,073
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another pathway that is planned, but not there yet on this side.

94
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:35,717
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be a lot of ways that bicyclists and also pedestrians will be trying to cross

95
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:48,784
[SPEAKER_00]: in the east-west direction that is a big challenge now, and trying to make connections that don't exist yet, but we hope will exist in the near future, and certainly by the time they break ground on this.

96
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:55,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So, part of it was that not every movement was being accounted for.

97
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:59,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it was that the designs involve

98
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:09,688
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of additional delays so that if you're trying to bike in a straight line through this intersection if you were in the travel lane like a car.

99
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:18,397
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be able to go straight through if you basically if you waited for one red light you wouldn't you would probably not have to wait for all of them and.

100
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:33,652
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that they had outlined the bike facilities, you would end up having to pick your way through various crosswalks and probably end up waiting for several cycles of multiple lights.

101
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:36,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things do add up, and they make people frustrated.

102
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:40,855
[SPEAKER_00]: When those delays add up, it makes people more likely to cheat.

103
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:45,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Bicyclists aren't really any different from anybody else in that regard.

104
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's frustrating.

105
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:54,746
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can end up getting dangerous where you have a very short time to get across.

106
00:09:55,366 --> 00:10:00,668
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have cars turning right on red, now you've lost your short little time.

107
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:05,430
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you're trying to squeeze by and that can be a problem.

108
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,431
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also concerned with how they

109
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:20,748
[SPEAKER_00]: combined bicycle traffic with pedestrian traffic in what they're calling kind of multi-use path situations.

110
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:24,371
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of pathways often are really narrow.

111
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:36,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it in terms of design speed, this is a commuter who's biking to work and is in a hurry is probably going somewhere between 12 and 18 miles an hour.

112
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,716
[SPEAKER_00]: a person walking their dog is probably going two miles an hour.

113
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:45,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really big speed difference for a really small amount of space.

114
00:10:46,279 --> 00:11:06,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we already have some issues where the routes that bicyclists need to use, particularly immediately in the Medford Square area, are not wide enough to pass people going opposite directions, for example, or are not wide enough for a person on a bike to pass a person using a walker

115
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:13,351
[SPEAKER_00]: or to pass a person with a stroller, regardless of which direction you're going.

116
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:29,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're concerned that the amount of space that's devoted to car lanes is increasing while the bicycle and pedestrian traffic is being combined, which is only likely to increase conflicts.

117
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly the case as more and more people get e-bikes.

118
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:46,735
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they can go faster more easily, probably not quite fast enough easily enough to not get harassed if they choose to use the road instead.

119
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,711
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the other side of it.

120
00:11:52,811 --> 00:12:06,921
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide that you don't want to ride at pedestrian speed in order to be safe on these kind of side path areas, and you want to use the road, that's perfectly legal, that's perfectly allowable.

121
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,903
[SPEAKER_00]: except that the drivers behind you get really, really pissed off.

122
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:17,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody's enforcing the forefoot passing rule or anything like that either.

123
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:28,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're concerned that this is, that we get kind of the leftover space and that it's setting the situation up to fail.

124
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:32,928
[SPEAKER_00]: It's setting people up to be frustrated, run out of room.

125
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of what they designed also

126
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:40,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to go too into specifics because I hope that they have changed this by now.

127
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that this description is moot.

128
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:55,620
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of these places they had created this kind of weird chicane in a pedestrian island where it's like this kind of a situation in an island.

129
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:01,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at the place where there are currently barrels to stop people from going straight

130
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:06,586
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the ramp from South Street to go straight across Main Street.

131
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,206
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do understand why that was there.

132
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:19,708
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they put on the plan ends up being this really narrow space with tight corners that now needs to be shared by multiple travel modes.

133
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:29,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is also exactly the kind of place that probably is not going to be adequately kept clear of debris, or snow, or ice.

134
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means that the actual usable space will only shrink.

135
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:53,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some concerns about the maintenance of facilities like this too, that they end up being less than usable for large parts of the year, even at the point when the roads are completely dry and the roads are completely fine, some of these side areas

136
00:13:54,301 --> 00:14:02,647
[SPEAKER_00]: often don't get as good treatment, and so they can still be filled with snow or ice or debris and so forth.

137
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:11,873
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all our concerns, and we really are hoping that we can talk to the design team as soon as possible.

138
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:17,377
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that they're early in the process, and we just want to get at them while they're still early in the process.

139
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:25,260
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that this is only one intersection and it has one specific scope of work.

140
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:44,298
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are a bike commuter going from somewhere in Medford and you'd have maybe a five mile trip to somewhere closer into town, maybe Boston, Cambridge, Watertown, something like that, there's a good chance that this is not the only intersection with this kind of treatment that you go through.

141
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:51,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can say like, oh, these compromises are important here for this reason and this reason and this reason.

142
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:57,081
[SPEAKER_00]: But adding to people's level of frustration and adding to the amount of delays is that

143
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,088
[SPEAKER_00]: on an actual commute, you would go through a bunch of these.

144
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:05,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And those delays add up and the frustration factor adds up.

145
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:12,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, we're hoping that we can tell people, you know, biking is viable, it's efficient, it's fast, it's easy.

146
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,479
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to just be late to work if you do it.

147
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:25,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And 90 seconds at several different places each time, if you have four or five places like that, that adds up.

148
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:29,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a half hour trip, now it gets to be a 35, 40 minute trip.

149
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:41,319
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and in the meantime, it's kind of forcing you into a much slower speed than you otherwise would be going to.

150
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:47,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we understand everybody has to go slower on city streets than they want to go.

151
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:50,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And people in cars have to go slower than they want to go to.

152
00:15:52,014 --> 00:16:00,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we end up that the most efficient speeds for biking are too fast for bike paths and too slow for the road.

153
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:03,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And not really welcome anywhere.

154
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:05,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are, those are basically our concerns.

155
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:11,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we're hoping that we can get in while it's still early in the process.

156
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:13,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks.

157
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:16,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, uh, Councilor Lazzaro.

158
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:18,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Emily.

159
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:42,646
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few things that I want to highlight in what Emily said, which are that efficiency of cyclists is not just a matter of cyclists getting to work on time, but it's also the fact that we want to make our streets

160
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,032
[SPEAKER_03]: we want to make it easy to follow the laws of our streets.

161
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:54,779
[SPEAKER_03]: If we make it too difficult to follow the laws, then it just becomes more logical for people to break the rules.

162
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:03,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And then cyclists are like anybody and they would just go around it and it becomes a dangerous situation.

163
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:09,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes when you're on a bike, I can speak for myself because I ride a bike sometimes, but I get scared.

164
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,482
[SPEAKER_03]: of something that could happen to me.

165
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:16,968
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have to go too slow, it's more likely that I'll wobble, lose my balance and have to step down.

166
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:22,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if I step down in the middle of the street, I become, it becomes very dangerous.

167
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:26,818
[SPEAKER_03]: My daughter learned how to ride her bike recently and now she wants to ride her bike everywhere.

168
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:32,441
[SPEAKER_03]: She's seven years old and she's often like really wobbly and she wants to ride her bike to CVS to buy candy all the time.

169
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:37,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid to ride to the CVS on High Street because there's nowhere to ride.

170
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:40,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like cars packed real tight.

171
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:46,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's on the way to, you know, this connection here with, you know, 16 and Main Street and it's

172
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:56,890
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had to slow down too much, it would be scary and wobbly and, you know, it's easier to ride on the sidewalk, but when people are walking their dogs, it's not a safe space.

173
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:06,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I wanted to mention is there was a deadly accident recently in Cambridge where it was a shared space.

174
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:13,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same situation, but it was on Memorial Drive, I believe, and it was like,

175
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:19,478
[SPEAKER_03]: a bike path that merges into a sidewalk and they become a shared space.

176
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:28,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And people have been talking for a long time about how dangerous it is and something that had been on the radar of people wanting to change it.

177
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:35,063
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't want to increase the opportunity for fatalities to happen, obviously.

178
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:42,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that being said, I know that we sometimes these kinds of meetings can

179
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:58,610
[SPEAKER_03]: move forward things that are maybe going to happen anyway but you know can increase the urgency so now that

180
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:04,877
[SPEAKER_03]: the bike commission will have a meeting with MassDOT that is excellent.

181
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:22,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe some of this doesn't need to be as pressing that we discuss it right now, but I do, I would offer director Blake, if you have any, any response or anything you would want to add to the discussion that might be something that we wouldn't have thought of necessarily.

182
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, I would love to hear from you if you have anything that you'd like to add to it.

183
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:28,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor.

184
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:34,357
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think Emily covered a lot of what their concerns are and were.

185
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:35,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I think

186
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:45,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the Bicycle Commission and others will be pleased at the progress, even since the public information meeting.

187
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:57,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I do assure you that all of the points were taken seriously and that the team, the design team in Massa are taking that seriously and are trying to incorporate as much as they can.

188
00:19:58,457 --> 00:19:59,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to

189
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:02,232
[SPEAKER_01]: present or say anything that they're going to present.

190
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:08,993
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their project, but I do believe it's incorporating a lot of the elements that Emily had described.

191
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:10,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing.

192
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very encouraging.

193
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, through the chair.

194
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:19,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

195
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:25,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I am happy to hear that the meetings are going forward.

196
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:29,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm comfortable with how this is moving.

197
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:31,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

198
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:34,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any other councilors that want to speak on this topic?

199
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:36,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lennon?

200
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:44,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a question about, so to be clear, this is the resolution, host a future discussion, invite MassDOT to it.

201
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:47,372
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be the logistics of that?

202
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:53,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be another committee meeting that they and the Bicycle Commission are here?

203
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:56,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be a public forum, open meeting?

204
00:20:57,196 --> 00:20:58,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you clarify that a little bit?

205
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that it would have something to do with the progress.

206
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:18,156
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a very specific, I think there's a specific route that they have to take based on, sorry, the... Councilor Zara.

207
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:18,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

208
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:19,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

209
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:20,998
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may.

210
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:21,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

211
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,801
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the meeting we're having right now.

212
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:25,675
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this meeting.

213
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:27,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So this resolution isn't to have another meeting.

214
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:32,418
[SPEAKER_04]: The resolution which got passed through the city council was to have this meeting right here.

215
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Just asking for clarification on that.

216
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

217
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I will ask for any public participation.

218
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:48,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone in the chamber?

219
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone on Zoom?

220
00:21:58,214 --> 00:21:59,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Council President Zach Barrett.

221
00:22:02,602 --> 00:22:03,083
[SPEAKER_04]: The floor is yours.

222
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi there, sorry about that.

223
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I am currently sitting at the intersection of Main Street and South Street.

224
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:14,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So subject matter expert at the moment.

225
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:18,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to note a thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

226
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:24,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the Bike Commission and to Emily O'Brien for your work on this.

227
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:29,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to Todd for being our liaison with MassDOT.

228
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also just wanted to note

229
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's essential that we get this right.

230
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford wasn't built for the level of car volume that we have now.

231
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:52,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because we pasted an overpass of Route 16 and the highway through it doesn't mean that the rest of our streets can actually handle

232
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:55,236
[SPEAKER_02]: the car volume that we have today.

233
00:22:55,677 --> 00:23:04,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's essential that we move in the direction that we're moving to make Medford more accessible for all, not just people with cars.

234
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:14,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one who uses my car all the time, but I would use other modes of transportation if I felt like I could get where I was going in a reasonable amount of time.

235
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:24,856
[SPEAKER_02]: The Craddock Bridge is the only crossing of the Mystic River for about a mile or more on either side of the east or west.

236
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:35,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that it was deeply impacted by the massive volumes of car traffic that have been throughput through that bridge and through the intersections that we're talking about.

237
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:40,649
[SPEAKER_02]: by Interstate 93 and by the overbuilt Route 16 overpass.

238
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:56,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's essential that we get this signalization and rebuild of Main and Mystic right, because what we're talking about in Medford Square and what we're talking about on Mystic Ave is returning to a people-centered era, not a car-centered era.

239
00:23:56,787 --> 00:24:04,094
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the spots on Mystic Ave just south of the bridge and just south of the 16 overpass used to be a vibrant walkable neighborhood.

240
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:07,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Square used to be a vibrant walkable neighborhood.

241
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:15,004
[SPEAKER_02]: The car supremacy and the building of the highway destroyed so much of the community that was built there.

242
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:18,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that we're trying to restore it, this isn't the essential link.

243
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:19,288
[SPEAKER_02]: to making it work.

244
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:22,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate the bike commission's work.

245
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:25,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate everyone's conversation here in this meeting.

246
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:33,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think putting that layer of what do we want our community to look like and how do we want to make sure that it's safe for everyone to

247
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:41,251
[SPEAKER_02]: have community and link together in our squares is an important part of the conversation, too.

248
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:46,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the 25% design hit that mark, but I'm hopeful that upcoming designs will.

249
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:48,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

250
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:51,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

251
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:53,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else like to speak on this topic?

252
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:57,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do see Emily O'Brien.

253
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,729
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to speak one more time, go ahead.

254
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:01,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

255
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:07,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make one clarification on what Councilor Behr has mentioned.

256
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:12,358
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that there isn't another crossing for about a mile.

257
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,579
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not completely true.

258
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,741
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a crossing that bicyclists and pedestrians can take.

259
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:25,765
[SPEAKER_00]: The pipe bridge or the Adrian Hand footbridge goes over the river.

260
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:30,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a pedestrian crossing across Route 16 right there.

261
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:33,810
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the end of Shipyard Way at the bottom of Governors Ave.

262
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,411
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another possibility.

263
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:40,694
[SPEAKER_00]: But I bring it up because, unfortunately, it's also a very problematic possibility.

264
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,716
[SPEAKER_00]: The pipe bridge is divided in half.

265
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:47,419
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has one half with stairs and one half with a ramp.

266
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:48,679
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really narrow.

267
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's two people coming opposite directions, it's a little awkward for two people on foot coming opposite directions.

268
00:25:56,565 --> 00:26:01,809
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that way often, and I often have to wait for somebody to finish crossing before I start across the bridge.

269
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get to the pedestrian crossing across Route 16.

270
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:11,898
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a DCR road as opposed to MassDOT, which is what we're talking about in this main intersection project.

271
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:15,661
[SPEAKER_00]: But this DCR crossing is the alternative.

272
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:22,547
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see multiple people in motor vehicles running that red light.

273
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:25,750
[SPEAKER_00]: after I wait a long time for it, every day.

274
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:32,856
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, there is kind of an alternative, but the alternative is also

275
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,459
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the larger problem here.

276
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:52,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd also like to just draw your awareness to the fact that we have a lot of these state agency controlled roads that really are critical links through all of our neighborhoods.

277
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:59,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to think about how to address all of those in a holistic way.

278
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:00,164
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all of them.

279
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:05,870
[SPEAKER_00]: The state agencies are as much of a part of this as the city is.

280
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:06,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again.

281
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:08,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your attention to this.

282
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:10,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

283
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:14,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see that Todd Blake, Director of Traffic and Transportation, is raising his hand as well.

284
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:15,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Todd.

285
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thank you.

286
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:22,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a couple of procedural clarifications as well.

287
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:34,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So MassDOT typically has one design public hearing at 25% design stage, but at the city's request, they held the public information meeting, which was actually a pre 25% meeting.

288
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:39,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what they're working on is the 25%.

289
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:41,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still early enough.

290
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:46,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So that pre-meeting allowed us to have all this conversation and lead to a better 25% design.

291
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:56,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally they go straight to the public with 25%, but we were lucky that they agreed to have an extra process prior to that, which is where we are now.

292
00:27:56,815 --> 00:28:02,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next, the meeting that the bike commission has with them will be about the 25% submission.

293
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:04,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next time they go to the overall public,

294
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:10,122
[SPEAKER_01]: will be the 25% design hearing that they typically do.

295
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:12,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that makes sense.

296
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:15,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

297
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:19,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing that you're there to help us facilitate the extra meetings.

298
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:23,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other comments from the public or from councilors?

299
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:32,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much to everyone, Councilor Lazzaro, to Mr. Blake, Ms.

300
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:33,469
[SPEAKER_04]: O'Brien.

301
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Councilor Lazzaro, do you wanna go ahead?

302
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:39,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just gonna motion to adjourn when you are finished with your thankings.

303
00:28:39,774 --> 00:28:40,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful, thank you to everyone.

304
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:42,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And Councilor Lazzaro has motioned to adjourn.

305
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:43,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a second?

306
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:46,879
[SPEAKER_04]: No one is seconding the motion.

307
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

308
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

309
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:51,222
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

310
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:52,563
[SPEAKER_04]: All opposed?

311
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:52,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

312
00:28:56,328 --> 00:28:56,913
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an aye.

313
00:28:56,973 --> 00:28:57,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you very much.

314
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,826
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting is adjourned.
