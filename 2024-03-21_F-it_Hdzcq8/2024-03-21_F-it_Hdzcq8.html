    <p>[Skane]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=265.796s">Good</a>  evening, Mrs. Skane. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=267.477s">I</a>  am the principal of the Andrews Middle School, and I am excited to welcome all of you to the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=276.344s">Our</a>  open house is scheduled for May 6th, from 6 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=281.308s">So</a>  if you become an Andrews Middle School community member, we look forward to welcoming you that evening, and you will also receive some communications from me as well, and I look forward to meeting you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=295.179s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=296.954s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=297.795s">Gane.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=299.016s">And</a>  so without much further ado, since I appreciate everyone jumping on the call, I'm going to share my screen and start a presentation for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=346.755s">So</a>  good evening, again, this evening is going to be an information session about our middle school lottery process. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=353.801s">Again,</a>  as I start this presentation, I'm gonna go through and share a little bit of our history with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=362.107s">Medford</a>  Public Schools has two excellent middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=368.512s">And</a>  when I arrived here in 2018, <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=373.178s">There</a>  was a challenge going on between our two middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=378.861s">The</a>  two middle schools were not were not balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=387.867s">key</a>  differences that were highlighted between the two middle schools and it was a task that was given to me by the Medford School Committee to say how could the discrepancy and the imbalance between the two schools be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=407.884s">The</a>  imbalance involved not only socioeconomic differences, income differences, but it also involved racial differences that the schools were not evenly balanced to the extent that they could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=428.116s">And</a>  so that was what began the lottery process in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=437.045s">So</a>  I'm sharing some data with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=440.367s">To</a>  start on this slide, you can see 2019 and you can see 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=448.832s">Again,</a>  when the lottery went into place, the intention was to try to correct an imbalance. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=457.138s">And</a>  so shifts took place at both schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=461.44s">This</a>  is the data for the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=468.115s">2019,</a>  and it shows race and ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=472.239s">Purple</a>  representing white, turquoise, green, African-American, light blue, Asian, a darker green, Latino, and a darker purple for all other races. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=491.194s">And</a>  so at this point in time, when the lottery originally began, <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=497.602s">there</a>  was an over-representation of white students at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=503.723s">And</a>  that was something that was noted by the community and by the committee at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=517.146s">This</a>  slide shows the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=521.974s">This</a>  provides their race and ethnicity data in 2019 and 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=524.876s">So</a>  until 2019, non-white students were significantly overrepresented at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=541.377s">The</a>  2024 current statistics at the McGlynn Middle School closely reflect the overall racial and ethnic diversity of the entire Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=556.625s">And</a>  so this is similar data just for the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=560.848s">So</a>  you can see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=568.632s">From</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=571.348s">A</a>  socioeconomic standpoint, the terminology has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=576.412s">It</a>  used to be called economically disadvantaged, and now the official terminology, according to DESE, is low-income households. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=586.038s">This</a>  is what the data looked like in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=588.58s">On</a>  the left, your right Andrews was at 21%. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=590.982s">The</a>  McGlynn was at 37%. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=600.38s">And</a>  after the lottery, this is how the schools are more evenly balanced between the Andrews and the McGlynn in terms of low income households being distributed between both school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=621.491s">So</a>  this is the policy summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=624.272s">What</a>  happens when the middle school lottery takes place? <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=627.952s">This</a>  is what will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=629.673s">50%</a>  of students in fifth grade at each school will be assigned to the Andrews and 50% will be assigned to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=641.062s">Now</a>  there are a few exceptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=645.586s">If</a>  a student has a specific program level educational need, they're going to be placed at the school that offers that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=658.925s">Again,</a>  this is on an individualized basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=663.907s">Program</a>  level educational needs supersede sibling preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=673.031s">Parents</a>  may opt to have their fifth grade student attend the same school as a sibling, or parents may choose to have their fifth grade student enter the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=691.653s">The</a>  condition is that the older sibling must still be enrolled at that current middle school in August of 2024, meaning that they're currently a sixth grader or a seventh grader, and they would be moving up to those grades, seventh or eighth grade in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=714.591s">This</a>  year, sibling preference will not include younger siblings attending the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=725.295s">And</a>  that was, again, because there was a significant uptick in the amount of siblings that were there in the lower elementary schools that would impact the numbers and a lottery would not be able to take place for McGlynn families. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=745.032s">And</a>  in our attempt to provide 50% of seats at both schools to do our best to balance them equally, that was the reason why we had to stop younger siblings attending the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=764.259s">One</a>  other key piece about our policy is that for each school, we do add three buffer seats <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=775.14s">for</a>  our English learner population. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=778.164s">And</a>  I will continue to explain that on the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=784.091s">So</a>  this slide explains a sample school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=789.797s">In</a>  this sample school, we have 103 fifth grade students. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=798.399s">We</a>  add three buffer seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=801.22s">These</a>  three buffer seats are for people who don't exist, but we know that they may be coming on a rolling basis over the course of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=810.665s">So</a>  this simple school has a total of 106 seats that are allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=818.248s">And</a>  I want to just show you how these 106 total seats would be entered into the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=827.586s">In</a>  this particular sample school, 20 students are English learners, EL. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=835.53s">They</a>  will attend middle school A, which houses the EL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=842.634s">One</a>  student has a middle school A sibling preference, meaning a student that's either in sixth or seventh grade at the time of the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=856.061s">and</a>  the parents have chosen to activate sibling preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=860.903s">Seven</a>  students have a middle school B sibling preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=867.627s">So</a>  seven families from this particular school have activated sibling preference and they would like their child to attend middle school B. Two students have a special program requirement to go to a middle school A special education program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=888.508s">One</a>  student has a program requirement that allows them to attend middle school B. So those first set of students right there are going to be excluded from the lottery process in essence, because they have specific programs that require them to attend middle school A or middle school B. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=919.149s">12</a>  students have an IEP, and those students will need to have their own draw. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=926.513s">So</a>  this could be students that might receive resource room services, and resource room services are provided in both schools equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=940.333s">So</a>  where there are 12 students that are on an IEP, those 12 students would be entered into a separate drawing where six students would be assigned to middle school A and six students would be assigned to middle school B. Once all of those deductions are made, 60 students will be entered in the general lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=966.983s">Again,</a>  we were working with 106 total seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=972.865s">So</a>  the next slide I'm going to show you is the exact same information as a table. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=980.127s">Oops,</a>  I spoke too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=984.428s">50%</a>  of students from each school will be assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=987.409s">So</a>  I explained middle school A from the previous slide is going to receive 20 EL students <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=996.294s">two</a>  special education program students, one sibling preference, and six IEP students from that number of 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1008.617s">That</a>  means 29 students are already accounted for at middle school A. So there will be 21 students drawn from the lottery <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1020.814s">plus</a>  three buffer seats, equaling a total of 53 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1026.738s">Again,</a>  the number we were working with was 106 total students. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1032.662s">Middle</a>  school B is going to receive one special education student, program student, seven sibling preference, and six IEPs from a separate draw. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1044.61s">They</a>  will have 39 students <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1047.557s">that</a>  will be drawn from the lottery for a total of 53 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1052.142s">Again,</a>  53 plus 53 gives us that 106. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1057.948s">This</a>  is the information as a table. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1062.993s">So</a>  when the lottery takes place in Medford Public Schools, all of these data points are taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1073.058s">So</a>  each school will receive 53 students and the lottery takes place, middle school A, 21 students will be in the lottery and for middle school B, 39. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1092.013s">I</a>  want to note that the Medford Public Schools, we do have a growing EL population. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1099.281s">That's</a>  our English learner population across the entire district, K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1106.445s">So</a>  Medford Public Schools has specialized programming for our newcomers, students who arrive new to the country who do not have any English skills or maybe very limited English skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1122.755s">So</a>  during the lottery, we reserve <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1127.212s">12</a>  seats for students that can attend the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1132.077s">And</a>  in this context, it would be the McGlynn Middle School because the McGlynn Middle School houses the EL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1140.486s">And</a>  so when the lottery takes place, we hold open 12 seats for students that are to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1149.249s">And</a>  I can assure you, we receive more than 12 students, but we hold 12 students in order to try to maintain as much balance as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1162.429s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1166.059s">That</a>  allows the two schools to remain fairly balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1171.084s">And</a>  currently right now, our two schools, in terms of their enrollment numbers, they're fairly balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1183.138s">Andrews</a>  Middle School currently has 457 students in attendance, and the McGlynn Middle School has 454 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1192.6s">So</a>  the difference at this point in time is only three students. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1197.822s">In</a>  a month's time, it could be the reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1201.023s">The</a>  McGlynn could be three students over the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1204.964s">But</a>  I just wanted to let you know that by allowing these buffer seats, it does <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1210.532s">give</a>  us that little bit of wiggle room to keep the two schools as balanced as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1218.317s">So</a>  here's a timeline of key events. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1221.339s">Today</a>  is Wednesday, March 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1223.321s">Again,</a>  I thank you all for jumping on this Zoom call to provide the information about what to expect with the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1232.086s">This</a>  Friday, March 22nd, <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1235.796s">The</a>  sibling opt-in, opt-out form will be sent to parents through email. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1241.881s">The</a>  email is going to come from MS Lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1245.383s">That</a>  stands for middle school lottery at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1251.588s">And</a>  that sibling opt-in, opt-out form will contain a Google form link. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1258.871s">Kindly</a>  click on that link and complete the form electronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1263.335s">It</a>  will go to specific households. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1267.299s">Again,</a>  I wanna just remind everyone on the call that sibling preference will not include younger siblings attending McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1280.291s">Friday,</a>  March 29th, <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1283.544s">The</a>  sibling opt-in, opt-out forms are due for submission. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1288.608s">Again,</a>  it's a Google form, so we'll be on the lookout for that electronically, but we do need to put in a deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1295.973s">So</a>  Friday, March 29th, that form needs to be submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1301.298s">And</a>  there will be communications to remind you, all of our fifth grade parents, to be on the lookout for those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1310.967s">Thursday,</a>  April 4th, each grade five student entering the lottery will receive a lottery number in a letter sent to you, the parents and caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1324.218s">Students</a>  will carry this letter home. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1329.382s">On</a>  Tuesday, April 9th, that is the day that the drawing will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1335.727s">The</a>  drawing will take place on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1339.008s">The</a>  results will be posted on the district website at 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1345.574s">You</a>  will receive an email with a link to the results at three o'clock, and it will also be on the website, and you'll also, for fifth grade families, get a notification if you use that function, the text message notification, you'll receive that on Tuesday as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1367.364s">Wednesday,</a>  April 24th, that is the day that the official letters will be sent out with your middle school assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1377.309s">So</a>  you will know your middle school assignment on Tuesday, April 9th, and on Wednesday, April 24th, those school assignment letters will be sent out to you, the parents and caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1392.136s">Please</a>  mark your calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1395.429s">The</a>  two middle school open houses orientations, as both principals stated earlier, Thursday, May 2, is the McGlynn Middle School, and Monday, May 6, is the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1410.681s">Both</a>  orientations will take place from 6 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1415.324s">It's</a>  a fun time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1416.894s">to</a>  be had for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1417.875s">And</a>  again, I just want to end this presentation by saying that we know the lottery system is not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1426.04s">However,</a>  it's our attempt at balancing the scales and correcting the imbalance that was once in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1434.905s">And</a>  at this point in time, I will stop the screen share and say thank you for being an excellent listening audience, and I will respond to any questions or comments that you have, because we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1454.85s">more</a>  than one page of, as I'm looking at the Zoom link, if you're able to use the raise hand function and you're on the second page, please use that so you pop up to my front screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1469.339s">And</a>  if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1480.495s">Dr.</a>  Riccidelli has kindly added her email to the chat box. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1485.976s">If</a>  you are looking for Dr. Ricciadelli, it's B-R-I-C-C-I-A-R-D-E-L-L-I. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1497.239s">Briccidelli</a>  at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1506.761s">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1521.82s">Don't</a>  be shy. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1524.781s">From</a>  Deepa. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1531.562s">So</a>  the afterschool clubs, students definitely when the open houses take place, there are a lot of clubs and opportunities for students to actually participate in both programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1547.786s">Mr.</a>  Tucci, I don't know if you would like to like take a small stab at that one.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1551.877s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1552.397s">So,</a>  you know, all students at the McGlynn and Andrew schools are welcome to attend clubs and activities together. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1557.221s">That's</a>  one of the great ways that we can kind of bring the students together if they were kind of, you know, separated during the lottery system. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1563.687s">That's</a>  not only true for clubs or activities, but it's also true for sports too as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1567.95s">So,</a>  you know, we love and encourage students to get involved in clubs, activities and sports to find a way to get involved in the life of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1574.396s">In</a>  fact, that's one of my biggest suggestions for any incoming middle school student to get themselves in the life of the school and join a club activity sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1582.103s">And</a>  certainly it's a great way to connect with a student that may have been placed at the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1586.788s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1588.203s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Tucci for that, and I see we have two wonderful hands lifts live, raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1594.551s">I</a>  do want to just respond, thank you I hope I say it the right way deeper Thank you deeper shot for throwing that question in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1604.232s">Ken</a>  Ho has asked, are the two school buildings roughly the same age? <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1607.674s">Yes,</a>  they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1609.355s">And</a>  different layouts, but approximately the same age. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1615.818s">And</a>  Angela Mercer asked a wonderful question about twins. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1620.28s">And</a>  it's funny that I talked about twins earlier today when we were preparing for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1627.264s">We</a>  love twins in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1628.785s">We</a>  love all kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1629.665s">But</a>  twins are, if you have twins, <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1633.874s">You</a>  have double the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1637.396s">Both</a>  of your children are given their own lottery number. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1642.8s">And</a>  as a parent, if you are the parent of a twin, <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1649.196s">If</a>  by chance, both of your children do not get assigned to the same school, which has happened, then at that point in time, you as the parent, working with your children are able <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1665.802s">to</a>  keep your twins together, essentially activating sibling preference at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1671.525s">But</a>  we do allow each student to have their own number. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1676.227s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that each child goes into the lottery and some years both students get assigned to one school, some years one gets assigned to one school and another gets the other school and then <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1690.854s">we</a>  figure it out to keep the twins together. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1693.356s">So</a>  thank you for asking that question, Angela. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1697.758s">I</a>  definitely didn't have that in on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1699.96s">We</a>  probably should add that for the next go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1703.622s">And</a>  I want to ask Shelly and then Michelle. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1708.125s">Shelly,</a>  would you... Oh, it's Shelly, good to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1712.427s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1714.188s">Are</a>  you able to unmute yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1715.769s">I'm</a>  not sure.</p>

    <p>[Shelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1721.465s">Thank</a>  you, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1724.586s">My</a>  question, so my son has a quite robust IEP and I am wondering if there is a mechanism in place whereby the sort of elementary school IEP team has an opportunity to kind of communicate with the middle school team or if that's something that I can navigate or I'm just wondering what the options for scaffolding forward are.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1748.024s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1748.886s">So</a>  definitely for our students that do have IEPs and for any parents who are on the call, there are definite <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1756.957s">you</a>  know, depending on the program that the student is part of, that will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1765.182s">Once</a>  the assignments are made, the special education teams do work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1769.844s">And</a>  of course, we always encourage the parents to be involved as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1774.747s">But</a>  that is something that, you know, we take into special consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1780.71s">and</a>  work closely with the special education teams and the administrators on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1785.234s">So</a>  rest assured that the information, the appropriate and necessary information will travel with your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1796.403s">Thank</a>  you for that excellent question. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1798.345s">Michelle</a>  Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1802.188s">Oops.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1809.249s">Michelle,</a>  are you able to unmute? <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1810.71s">I'm</a>  not sure.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1819.753s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1820.593s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1821.074s">Sorry,</a>  it wasn't letting me unmute initially. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1823.775s">So</a>  one question was already answered, which was about extracurriculars. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1827.316s">But</a>  I also, you know, I'm a novice to the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1830.077s">I</a>  have not done enough background research, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1833.439s">In</a>  the classes as well, is there differences in, like, I don't know, are there language taught differently? <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1838.142s">Are</a>  there the same languages available at both schools as far as classroom curriculum? <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1842.706s">Is</a>  there any significant difference between the two?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1846.708s">There</a>  really isn't that much of a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1851.672s">Some</a>  of the schools have different programs, but in terms of curriculum, the schools are aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1858.917s">That's</a>  something that we worked really hard to do in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1863.46s">Each</a>  teacher delivers the instruction in an individualized way, their own personal style of delivery, but the content, the standards, the state standards that are being followed, everyone is following the state standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1877.991s">And</a>  again, if a student's on an IEP, then there will be accommodations made for those students, but they are the same programs that are being taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1890.38s">The</a>  teachers participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1892.862s">when</a>  they have district level, department head level meetings, they are together with the same department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1900.546s">So</a>  it is similar, the same program, just the delivery may be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1908.549s">Thank</a>  you for that question, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1909.79s">Clark.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1931.511s">Well,</a>  I want to say thank you to all of you again for jumping on this brief call. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1938.405s">Dr.</a>  Riccidelli has left her email. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1942.583s">in</a>  the chat box. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1943.384s">So</a>  you're able to grab her, um, contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1948.949s">And,</a>  um, you also should have received, you know, the letters and the notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1953.432s">And</a>  again, this Friday, um, will be the first form going out to, um, specific parents that have siblings that are already current, um, middle schoolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1965.504s">And</a>  that really is the end of my presentation for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1969.746s">I</a>  don't know, Dr. Riccadeli, if there's anything else that you wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1974.689s">Mr.</a>  Tucci, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/F-it_Hdzcq8&t=1975.669s">Gain,</a>  I don't know if there are any other comments you wanted to say to our wonderful fifth grade parents and caregivers that are on the call.</p>
