1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,621
Good evening, families.

2
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:09,301
I'm very happy to be here.

3
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:10,782
It's five o'clock on the dot.

4
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:19,646
I'm gonna wait about one more minute to two minutes just to allow a few more people to jump onto the call.

5
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:31,051
This call is being recorded, so it will be available after tonight's information session.

6
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:51,800
So good evening to everyone on the call.

7
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:59,991
I would like to open to say thank you first again for joining us this evening for our middle school lottery update.

8
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,538
I would like to recognize Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli.

9
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:16,722
who is the lead administrator where if there are questions or concerns regarding the lottery process, she will be responsive.

10
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:18,603
Also, we have Ms.

11
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:25,205
Kim Miles, who is one of our data analysts who works with us in the district.

12
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:30,747
She also will support middle school lottery questions.

13
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:40,956
I'd like to thank Mr. Thomas Dalton, our Communications Director, who was on the call this evening, and both of our middle school principals.

14
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:52,266
I'd like to recognize Principal of the McGlynn Middle School, Mr. Nick Tucci, and Principal of the Andrews Middle School, Ms.

15
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,187
Jennifer Skane.

16
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:56,110
I just want to recognize the both of you and

17
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:59,092
recognize that you're on the call.

18
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:06,158
Also, parents know that we have both of our wonderful middle school principals supporting us on this evening's call.

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:18,048
Dr. Riccadeli, I'm not sure if there are a few words or comments that you would like to share with the parents and community members that are on the call this evening.

20
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:19,846
Sure.

21
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:26,270
Good evening, everybody are actually it's still afternoon so good afternoon, it's great to see some familiar faces here.

22
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:35,335
And again I welcome you, this is a really exciting time for our grade five students, looking forward to middle school, the lottery.

23
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:39,639
is coming up soon and we are here to get you prepared.

24
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:45,864
I want you to know that there is a there's a team as the superintendent said behind this whole process.

25
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:47,725
There's a lot that goes into it.

26
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:52,769
There's a lot of reviewing that goes on behind the scenes so I just want to assure you that

27
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,511
We are here every step of the way.

28
00:02:55,891 --> 00:03:02,574
And as the superintendent said, if you have any questions about the process or concerns about anything, you certainly can reach out to me.

29
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:09,797
It's Bernadette Riccidelli, briccidelli, at medford.k12.ma.us.

30
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:14,960
So I will put that, if we have chat enabled, I will put that in the chat.

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,521
All right, so thank you again for joining us.

32
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:21,758
Thank you, Dr. Ricciardelli.

33
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,160
And Mr. Tucci and Ms.

34
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,663
Gain, I didn't know if you wanted to just say a few words since you both are on the call this evening.

35
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:30,664
Please feel free.

36
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:32,673
I'll start off.

37
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:33,774
Good evening, everybody.

38
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,634
My name is Nick Tucci.

39
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:36,715
I'm the principal at the John J. McGlynn Middle School.

40
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:40,577
I'm super excited to welcome in the incoming crop of students to the school.

41
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:42,778
This is my sixth year as the principal.

42
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:48,861
I'm a proud graduate of the Medford Public Schools and spent my entire career in education in the Medford Public Schools, so I'm a proud Mustang.

43
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:54,423
I can't wait to get to know your students, and I also want to welcome your students and you to our open house.

44
00:03:54,683 --> 00:04:00,066
If you're a chosen family to attend the McGlynn Middle School, our open house will be on May 2nd this year.

45
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:01,947
And it will take place from six to eight.

46
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:08,812
And soon after the lottery, he'll receive some communications from me, welcome you to understand a little bit about what that's going to be about.

47
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,375
And that will be the first start to acclimate your student to the middle school experience.

48
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,236
So thank you all for joining the call.

49
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:18,699
And I'm happy to be a good resource for you in future.

50
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:22,341
Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

51
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:22,822
Ms.

52
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:23,142
Gain.

53
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,237
Good evening, Mrs. Skane.

54
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:34,643
I am the principal of the Andrews Middle School, and I am excited to welcome all of you to the Andrews Middle School.

55
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:40,607
Our open house is scheduled for May 6th, from 6 to 8 p.m.

56
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:54,958
So if you become an Andrews Middle School community member, we look forward to welcoming you that evening, and you will also receive some communications from me as well, and I look forward to meeting you all.

57
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:55,499
Thank you.

58
00:04:56,954 --> 00:04:57,755
Thank you, Ms.

59
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:58,135
Gane.

60
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:10,269
And so without much further ado, since I appreciate everyone jumping on the call, I'm going to share my screen and start a presentation for you.

61
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:52,920
So good evening, again, this evening is going to be an information session about our middle school lottery process.

62
00:05:53,801 --> 00:06:00,085
Again, as I start this presentation, I'm gonna go through and share a little bit of our history with you.

63
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:06,991
Medford Public Schools has two excellent middle schools.

64
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:09,813
And when I arrived here in 2018,

65
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:17,881
There was a challenge going on between our two middle schools.

66
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:24,644
The two middle schools were not were not balanced.

67
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:46,543
key differences that were highlighted between the two middle schools and it was a task that was given to me by the Medford School Committee to say how could the discrepancy and the imbalance between the two schools be addressed.

68
00:06:47,884 --> 00:07:07,536
The imbalance involved not only socioeconomic differences, income differences, but it also involved racial differences that the schools were not evenly balanced to the extent that they could be.

69
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:12,759
And so that was what began the lottery process in 2019.

70
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,646
So I'm sharing some data with you.

71
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:26,291
To start on this slide, you can see 2019 and you can see 2024.

72
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:36,297
Again, when the lottery went into place, the intention was to try to correct an imbalance.

73
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:40,540
And so shifts took place at both schools.

74
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,223
This is the data for the Andrews Middle School.

75
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:50,977
2019, and it shows race and ethnicity.

76
00:07:52,239 --> 00:08:09,593
Purple representing white, turquoise, green, African-American, light blue, Asian, a darker green, Latino, and a darker purple for all other races.

77
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:15,178
And so at this point in time, when the lottery originally began,

78
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:22,063
there was an over-representation of white students at the Andrews.

79
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:31,585
And that was something that was noted by the community and by the committee at that time.

80
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:40,627
This slide shows the McGlynn Middle School.

81
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:44,816
This provides their race and ethnicity data in 2019 and 2024.

82
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:50,740
So until 2019, non-white students were significantly overrepresented at the McGlynn Middle School.

83
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:14,684
The 2024 current statistics at the McGlynn Middle School closely reflect the overall racial and ethnic diversity of the entire Medford Public Schools.

84
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,727
And so this is similar data just for the McGlynn Middle School.

85
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:21,768
So you can see that.

86
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:28,872
From

87
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:36,312
A socioeconomic standpoint, the terminology has changed.

88
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:44,597
It used to be called economically disadvantaged, and now the official terminology, according to DESE, is low-income households.

89
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:48,420
This is what the data looked like in 2019.

90
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,942
On the left, your right Andrews was at 21%.

91
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:53,724
The McGlynn was at 37%.

92
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:17,389
And after the lottery, this is how the schools are more evenly balanced between the Andrews and the McGlynn in terms of low income households being distributed between both school buildings.

93
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,692
So this is the policy summary.

94
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:27,014
What happens when the middle school lottery takes place?

95
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:29,153
This is what will take place.

96
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:38,640
50% of students in fifth grade at each school will be assigned to the Andrews and 50% will be assigned to the McGlynn.

97
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:43,684
Now there are a few exceptions.

98
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:57,055
If a student has a specific program level educational need, they're going to be placed at the school that offers that program.

99
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,046
Again, this is on an individualized basis.

100
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:09,189
Program level educational needs supersede sibling preference.

101
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:28,757
Parents may opt to have their fifth grade student attend the same school as a sibling, or parents may choose to have their fifth grade student enter the lottery.

102
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:52,505
The condition is that the older sibling must still be enrolled at that current middle school in August of 2024, meaning that they're currently a sixth grader or a seventh grader, and they would be moving up to those grades, seventh or eighth grade in August.

103
00:11:54,591 --> 00:12:03,534
This year, sibling preference will not include younger siblings attending the McGlynn Elementary School.

104
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:23,562
And that was, again, because there was a significant uptick in the amount of siblings that were there in the lower elementary schools that would impact the numbers and a lottery would not be able to take place for McGlynn families.

105
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:41,698
And in our attempt to provide 50% of seats at both schools to do our best to balance them equally, that was the reason why we had to stop younger siblings attending the McGlynn Elementary School.

106
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:53,403
One other key piece about our policy is that for each school, we do add three buffer seats

107
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,603
for our English learner population.

108
00:12:58,164 --> 00:13:01,548
And I will continue to explain that on the next slide.

109
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:07,194
So this slide explains a sample school.

110
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:12,941
In this sample school, we have 103 fifth grade students.

111
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,580
We add three buffer seats.

112
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:29,664
These three buffer seats are for people who don't exist, but we know that they may be coming on a rolling basis over the course of the year.

113
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:36,828
So this simple school has a total of 106 seats that are allocated.

114
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:45,932
And I want to just show you how these 106 total seats would be entered into the lottery.

115
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:53,489
In this particular sample school, 20 students are English learners, EL.

116
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,333
They will attend middle school A, which houses the EL program.

117
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:14,340
One student has a middle school A sibling preference, meaning a student that's either in sixth or seventh grade at the time of the lottery.

118
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:19,063
and the parents have chosen to activate sibling preference.

119
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:26,726
Seven students have a middle school B sibling preference.

120
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:45,496
So seven families from this particular school have activated sibling preference and they would like their child to attend middle school B. Two students have a special program requirement to go to a middle school A special education program.

121
00:14:48,508 --> 00:15:16,347
One student has a program requirement that allows them to attend middle school B. So those first set of students right there are going to be excluded from the lottery process in essence, because they have specific programs that require them to attend middle school A or middle school B.

122
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:26,453
12 students have an IEP, and those students will need to have their own draw.

123
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:39,420
So this could be students that might receive resource room services, and resource room services are provided in both schools equally.

124
00:15:40,333 --> 00:16:06,025
So where there are 12 students that are on an IEP, those 12 students would be entered into a separate drawing where six students would be assigned to middle school A and six students would be assigned to middle school B. Once all of those deductions are made, 60 students will be entered in the general lottery.

125
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:11,524
Again, we were working with 106 total seats.

126
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:18,126
So the next slide I'm going to show you is the exact same information as a table.

127
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:24,168
Oops, I spoke too soon.

128
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:27,049
50% of students from each school will be assigned.

129
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:34,011
So I explained middle school A from the previous slide is going to receive 20 EL students

130
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:46,156
two special education program students, one sibling preference, and six IEP students from that number of 12.

131
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:59,660
That means 29 students are already accounted for at middle school A. So there will be 21 students drawn from the lottery

132
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:05,857
plus three buffer seats, equaling a total of 53 students.

133
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:11,361
Again, the number we were working with was 106 total students.

134
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:23,049
Middle school B is going to receive one special education student, program student, seven sibling preference, and six IEPs from a separate draw.

135
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,531
They will have 39 students

136
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:31,401
that will be drawn from the lottery for a total of 53 students.

137
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:35,325
Again, 53 plus 53 gives us that 106.

138
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,490
This is the information as a table.

139
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:50,841
So when the lottery takes place in Medford Public Schools, all of these data points are taken into consideration.

140
00:17:53,058 --> 00:18:08,991
So each school will receive 53 students and the lottery takes place, middle school A, 21 students will be in the lottery and for middle school B, 39.

141
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:18,158
I want to note that the Medford Public Schools, we do have a growing EL population.

142
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:24,424
That's our English learner population across the entire district, K through 12.

143
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:41,354
So Medford Public Schools has specialized programming for our newcomers, students who arrive new to the country who do not have any English skills or maybe very limited English skills.

144
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,637
So during the lottery, we reserve

145
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:52,037
12 seats for students that can attend the Medford Public Schools.

146
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:59,565
And in this context, it would be the McGlynn Middle School because the McGlynn Middle School houses the EL program.

147
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:08,174
And so when the lottery takes place, we hold open 12 seats for students that are to come.

148
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:20,646
And I can assure you, we receive more than 12 students, but we hold 12 students in order to try to maintain as much balance as possible.

149
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:22,569
And

150
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:30,544
That allows the two schools to remain fairly balanced.

151
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:37,670
And currently right now, our two schools, in terms of their enrollment numbers, they're fairly balanced.

152
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:52,160
Andrews Middle School currently has 457 students in attendance, and the McGlynn Middle School has 454 students.

153
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,501
So the difference at this point in time is only three students.

154
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,942
In a month's time, it could be the reverse.

155
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:04,464
The McGlynn could be three students over the Andrews.

156
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:09,345
But I just wanted to let you know that by allowing these buffer seats, it does

157
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:15,235
give us that little bit of wiggle room to keep the two schools as balanced as possible.

158
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,779
So here's a timeline of key events.

159
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:23,140
Today is Wednesday, March 20th.

160
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:30,966
Again, I thank you all for jumping on this Zoom call to provide the information about what to expect with the lottery.

161
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:33,587
This Friday, March 22nd,

162
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:40,840
The sibling opt-in, opt-out form will be sent to parents through email.

163
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:45,003
The email is going to come from MS Lottery.

164
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:50,487
That stands for middle school lottery at medford.k12.ma.us.

165
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:57,232
And that sibling opt-in, opt-out form will contain a Google form link.

166
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,715
Kindly click on that link and complete the form electronically.

167
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,878
It will go to specific households.

168
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:16,628
Again, I wanna just remind everyone on the call that sibling preference will not include younger siblings attending McGlynn Elementary School.

169
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,312
Friday, March 29th,

170
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:27,887
The sibling opt-in, opt-out forms are due for submission.

171
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:35,853
Again, it's a Google form, so we'll be on the lookout for that electronically, but we do need to put in a deadline.

172
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:40,197
So Friday, March 29th, that form needs to be submitted.

173
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:49,464
And there will be communications to remind you, all of our fifth grade parents, to be on the lookout for those things.

174
00:21:50,967 --> 00:22:02,997
Thursday, April 4th, each grade five student entering the lottery will receive a lottery number in a letter sent to you, the parents and caregivers.

175
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:06,199
Students will carry this letter home.

176
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:15,127
On Tuesday, April 9th, that is the day that the drawing will take place.

177
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,649
The drawing will take place on Tuesday.

178
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:24,713
The results will be posted on the district website at 3 p.m.

179
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:45,312
You will receive an email with a link to the results at three o'clock, and it will also be on the website, and you'll also, for fifth grade families, get a notification if you use that function, the text message notification, you'll receive that on Tuesday as well.

180
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:57,229
Wednesday, April 24th, that is the day that the official letters will be sent out with your middle school assignment.

181
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:09,995
So you will know your middle school assignment on Tuesday, April 9th, and on Wednesday, April 24th, those school assignment letters will be sent out to you, the parents and caregivers.

182
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:13,597
Please mark your calendars.

183
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:30,100
The two middle school open houses orientations, as both principals stated earlier, Thursday, May 2, is the McGlynn Middle School, and Monday, May 6, is the Andrews Middle School.

184
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:34,544
Both orientations will take place from 6 to 8 p.m.

185
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:36,265
It's a fun time.

186
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:37,855
to be had for all.

187
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:45,379
And again, I just want to end this presentation by saying that we know the lottery system is not perfect.

188
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:54,005
However, it's our attempt at balancing the scales and correcting the imbalance that was once in Medford.

189
00:23:54,905 --> 00:24:13,070
And at this point in time, I will stop the screen share and say thank you for being an excellent listening audience, and I will respond to any questions or comments that you have, because we have.

190
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:28,199
more than one page of, as I'm looking at the Zoom link, if you're able to use the raise hand function and you're on the second page, please use that so you pop up to my front screen.

191
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:36,444
And if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.

192
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:45,896
Dr. Riccidelli has kindly added her email to the chat box.

193
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:56,198
If you are looking for Dr. Ricciadelli, it's B-R-I-C-C-I-A-R-D-E-L-L-I.

194
00:24:57,239 --> 00:25:01,900
Briccidelli at medford.k12.ma.us.

195
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:07,601
Any questions?

196
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,520
Don't be shy.

197
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:25,601
From Deepa.

198
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:46,486
So the afterschool clubs, students definitely when the open houses take place, there are a lot of clubs and opportunities for students to actually participate in both programs.

199
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:51,127
Mr. Tucci, I don't know if you would like to like take a small stab at that one.

200
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:52,357
Absolutely.

201
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:56,821
So, you know, all students at the McGlynn and Andrew schools are welcome to attend clubs and activities together.

202
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:03,106
That's one of the great ways that we can kind of bring the students together if they were kind of, you know, separated during the lottery system.

203
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,089
That's not only true for clubs or activities, but it's also true for sports too as well.

204
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:14,196
So, you know, we love and encourage students to get involved in clubs, activities and sports to find a way to get involved in the life of the school.

205
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:21,503
In fact, that's one of my biggest suggestions for any incoming middle school student to get themselves in the life of the school and join a club activity sport.

206
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:26,387
And certainly it's a great way to connect with a student that may have been placed at the other school.

207
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:27,008
Thank you.

208
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:33,890
Thank you, Mr Tucci for that, and I see we have two wonderful hands lifts live, raised.

209
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:42,021
I do want to just respond, thank you I hope I say it the right way deeper Thank you deeper shot for throwing that question in there.

210
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:47,614
Ken Ho has asked, are the two school buildings roughly the same age?

211
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:48,654
Yes, they are.

212
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:54,837
And different layouts, but approximately the same age.

213
00:26:55,818 --> 00:27:00,060
And Angela Mercer asked a wonderful question about twins.

214
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,123
And it's funny that I talked about twins earlier today when we were preparing for the presentation.

215
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:08,525
We love twins in Medford.

216
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:09,565
We love all kids.

217
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:12,787
But twins are, if you have twins,

218
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:16,156
You have double the opportunity.

219
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:21,599
Both of your children are given their own lottery number.

220
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,964
And as a parent, if you are the parent of a twin,

221
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:43,133
If by chance, both of your children do not get assigned to the same school, which has happened, then at that point in time, you as the parent, working with your children are able

222
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:51,485
to keep your twins together, essentially activating sibling preference at that point in time.

223
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:55,767
But we do allow each student to have their own number.

224
00:27:56,227 --> 00:28:10,234
So I just wanted to say that each child goes into the lottery and some years both students get assigned to one school, some years one gets assigned to one school and another gets the other school and then

225
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:12,895
we figure it out to keep the twins together.

226
00:28:13,356 --> 00:28:15,897
So thank you for asking that question, Angela.

227
00:28:17,758 --> 00:28:19,920
I definitely didn't have that in on the slide.

228
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,601
We probably should add that for the next go around.

229
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:27,564
And I want to ask Shelly and then Michelle.

230
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:32,407
Shelly, would you... Oh, it's Shelly, good to have you.

231
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:34,108
Okay.

232
00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:35,429
Are you able to unmute yourself?

233
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:36,350
I'm not sure.

234
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:42,785
Thank you, I'm sorry.

235
00:28:44,586 --> 00:29:07,234
My question, so my son has a quite robust IEP and I am wondering if there is a mechanism in place whereby the sort of elementary school IEP team has an opportunity to kind of communicate with the middle school team or if that's something that I can navigate or I'm just wondering what the options for scaffolding forward are.

236
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:08,305
Yes.

237
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:15,119
So definitely for our students that do have IEPs and for any parents who are on the call, there are definite

238
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:24,421
you know, depending on the program that the student is part of, that will take place.

239
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:29,604
Once the assignments are made, the special education teams do work together.

240
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:34,267
And of course, we always encourage the parents to be involved as well.

241
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:39,950
But that is something that, you know, we take into special consideration.

242
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,094
and work closely with the special education teams and the administrators on that.

243
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:55,322
So rest assured that the information, the appropriate and necessary information will travel with your child.

244
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:57,864
Thank you for that excellent question.

245
00:29:58,345 --> 00:29:59,886
Michelle Clark.

246
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:02,388
Oops.

247
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:10,690
Michelle, are you able to unmute?

248
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,510
I'm not sure.

249
00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:20,293
There we go.

250
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:20,973
Hi.

251
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:22,974
Sorry, it wasn't letting me unmute initially.

252
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:26,856
So one question was already answered, which was about extracurriculars.

253
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:30,057
But I also, you know, I'm a novice to the middle school.

254
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:32,578
I have not done enough background research, unfortunately.

255
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:38,102
In the classes as well, is there differences in, like, I don't know, are there language taught differently?

256
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:42,145
Are there the same languages available at both schools as far as classroom curriculum?

257
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:45,668
Is there any significant difference between the two?

258
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:51,372
There really isn't that much of a difference.

259
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:57,276
Some of the schools have different programs, but in terms of curriculum, the schools are aligned.

260
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:02,359
That's something that we worked really hard to do in terms of

261
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:17,351
Each teacher delivers the instruction in an individualized way, their own personal style of delivery, but the content, the standards, the state standards that are being followed, everyone is following the state standards.

262
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:30,060
And again, if a student's on an IEP, then there will be accommodations made for those students, but they are the same programs that are being taught.

263
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,541
The teachers participate.

264
00:31:32,862 --> 00:31:40,486
when they have district level, department head level meetings, they are together with the same department head.

265
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:47,949
So it is similar, the same program, just the delivery may be different.

266
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:49,770
Thank you for that question, Ms.

267
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,010
Clark.

268
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:16,802
Well, I want to say thank you to all of you again for jumping on this brief call.

269
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:20,549
Dr. Riccidelli has left her email.

270
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,344
in the chat box.

271
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:27,988
So you're able to grab her, um, contact information.

272
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:32,812
And, um, you also should have received, you know, the letters and the notification.

273
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:44,102
And again, this Friday, um, will be the first form going out to, um, specific parents that have siblings that are already current, um, middle schoolers.

274
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:49,686
And that really is the end of my presentation for you.

275
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:53,328
I don't know, Dr. Riccadeli, if there's anything else that you wanted to say.

276
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:55,589
Mr. Tucci, Ms.

277
00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:02,413
Gain, I don't know if there are any other comments you wanted to say to our wonderful fifth grade parents and caregivers that are on the call.

278
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:06,275
No?

279
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:08,196
I think you covered, I think you were pretty thorough.

280
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:09,717
I think you covered everything.

281
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,078
The questions were great.

282
00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:20,962
And we look forward to welcoming you to the middle schools at the open houses after you find out where you're going.

283
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:22,823
Thank you.

284
00:33:23,244 --> 00:33:25,105
And I'll echo from Dr. Riccadeli too as well.

285
00:33:25,165 --> 00:33:29,970
Certainly we're really enthusiastic about meeting our new students and families too as well.

286
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:39,137
And wanna highlight the importance of our open house orientation, which is a fantastic venue for you to be able to ask further questions to not just folks like myself,

287
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:48,201
but also our teachers, guidance counselors, and most importantly, our students who will be student ambassadors helping to lead folks throughout the building on a scavenger hunt.

288
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:54,543
That'll be really exciting and engaging that will help to inform you and your child to help them make this important transition.

289
00:33:54,883 --> 00:34:01,826
So welcome once again, I'm looking forward to being a resource for you if your child has been selected to attend the McGlynn Middle School.

290
00:34:03,987 --> 00:34:04,167
Ms.

291
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:04,407
Gain.

292
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:09,410
Yeah, I just wanna say thank you for the informative information.

293
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,154
I look forward to welcoming and meeting our families and students.

294
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:25,762
I'm excited and looking forward to supporting the transition to middle school, which can be exciting and also a little bit scary.

295
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:29,125
So we are happy to support that in every way we can.

296
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:30,546
So have a great day.

297
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:31,807
Thank you.

298
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,968
Mr. Ho, I saw that you raised your hand.

299
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:34,829
Are you able to speak?

300
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,791
Yes, I just have three simple questions.

301
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:42,314
A is air conditioning in both of the schools?

302
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:43,736
Yes.

303
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:44,617
Yes.

304
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:45,017
Okay.
