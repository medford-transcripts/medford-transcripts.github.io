1
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:30,877
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

2
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:39,830
Thank you, Mr. President.

3
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,471
Move suspension of Rule 33 to take 15-311 and 15-312.

4
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:13,706
at the 335 Main Street exit.

5
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:22,773
The council received a notice of announcement from the Massachusetts State Law Commission.

6
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:31,520
It is, sir, that the Massachusetts State Law Commission's penal order to insist on the motion of the court is displayed at the end of the delegation.

7
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,484
I can't hear you.

8
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:39,926
It's not working.

9
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:08,144
As the Councillors are all aware, Keynote to Go is installed by right and needs to be objected to in writing if there are any objections.

10
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:22,071
So the petition is... Motion to not object.

11
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:25,132
So on the motion of Councillor Camuso for non-objection,

12
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:31,221
If the petitioner wants to come forward to address the council.

13
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:37,450
Where is that?

14
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:15,540
Counselor Caraviello has that on the main paper.

15
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:20,684
Was that endorsed by... Mr. President, I just have one question.

16
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:24,447
Usually Keynote to Go doesn't involve a monitor.

17
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,190
Is that correct?

18
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,773
That's correct, Counselor, according to the clerk.

19
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:35,975
What is that monitor?

20
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,997
If you have a monitor, that means people will be staying there.

21
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:39,945
Excuse me, sir.

22
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:47,488
I was informed that when you have keynote to go, there's usually not a monitor on the site.

23
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,149
We don't have a monitor right now.

24
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,171
But will you be putting a monitor or will there be no monitor?

25
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,612
That we want a monitor, yeah.

26
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:58,852
I'm sorry, you said there will be a monitor?

27
00:04:59,333 --> 00:04:59,993
Yeah, we need it.

28
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:01,554
We don't have right now.

29
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:04,415
Mr. Clerk.

30
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,049
I'm a little confused with the information.

31
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:16,031
Well, if you want to read Paul Mulkey's letter on his decision, okay, that's a zoning matter, you know.

32
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:21,152
It says the only purpose, the purpose of it would be to purchase a ticket to go.

33
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:34,355
But according to the commonwealth, they don't, they're saying that you plan to install a monitor.

34
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:34,935
Yes.

35
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:43,365
I mean, I don't object to the monitor, but I don't know if that's the purpose of keynote to go.

36
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,667
I mean, I don't really care one way or the other.

37
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:52,933
I don't have any objection, but as I say, keynote to go is just to get a keynote ticket and leave.

38
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:57,437
So we have no objection from Councilor Cavillo.

39
00:05:57,577 --> 00:05:58,257
Councilor Knight?

40
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:07,616
Mr. President, Mr. President, please forgive my ignorance, but... The only purpose of the money would be to purchase... By right, it's allowed to have the operation of Keno2Go, correct?

41
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:08,737
Correct.

42
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:17,524
However, by right, it's not an effective operation of the Keno2Go Act that would allow them to also have a TV screen to display the winning numbers that are coming out at that point in time?

43
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:19,405
Is that all I'm understanding?

44
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:20,586
That's correct.

45
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,869
That's what I understood.

46
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:28,413
Keno2Go was originally designed like the Megabucks or whatever.

47
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,615
Mega bucks, whatever, you grab the ticket and you go.

48
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:35,937
And that's how it was designed.

49
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:46,385
Now Keno in the city, according to our zoning, is allowed in certain areas.

50
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:50,849
And Keno means pretty much you can stand around, watch the monitor, whatever.

51
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,995
In this particular area, according to Paul Mulkey's letter, and I don't have, he just wrote a decision.

52
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:10,552
The operation of a kino game at 355 Main Street is not allowed use in this zoning district.

53
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:25,084
However, a monitor installed to be used for the purpose of kino to go will not constitute a kino game being operated on site, provided no participants, that no one participates in any type of kino game.

54
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:26,701
I'd like to be.

55
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,071
Do we have to vote?

56
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:54,331
Yes.

57
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:54,591
Yeah.

58
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,673
So Mr. Clerk, will you please call the roll?

59
00:07:58,154 --> 00:07:58,554
A yes.

60
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:00,235
Just explain the vote.

61
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,578
A yes vote constitutes non-opposition.

62
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:08,341
So we are, by voting yes, we are not opposed to this operation.

63
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:13,405
Councilor Camuso?

64
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:14,005
Yes.

65
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:15,566
Councilor Caviello?

66
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:16,007
Yes.

67
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:17,688
Councilor Knight?

68
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:18,048
No.

69
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:20,410
Vice President Lowenkern?

70
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:21,451
Yes.

71
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,380
Councilor Marks?

72
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,220
Yes.

73
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:26,261
Councilor Penta?

74
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:26,381
Yes.

75
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,242
President De La Ruza?

76
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:29,722
Yes.

77
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:34,883
With the vote of six in the affirmative, none negative, the council is not opposed.

78
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:36,843
One negative.

79
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,284
Six to one.

80
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:38,144
What did I say?

81
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:39,184
One negative?

82
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:39,604
I'm sorry.

83
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:43,985
15-312, petition by William J. Jean of UnityCab,

84
00:08:56,208 --> 00:09:01,089
The 2003 Ford Crown Vittoria, bin number 205AFP71W63X104361 to a 2004 Chevy Impala, vehicle identification number 2G1WF55E749410308.

85
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:01,950
Counselor?

86
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,610
Paraphrase?

87
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,992
On the motion of Councilor Caravaglia for approval.

88
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:32,113
Councilor Knight.

89
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:35,075
I'd ask that the matter be tabled, Mr. President.

90
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:36,796
This evening we had a license committee meeting.

91
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:44,541
UnityCab was invited to attend the meeting because we have a number of items that we want to go over relative to our ordinance, and UnityCab failed to attend this evening.

92
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:47,943
Now they're here before this council requesting a transfer of a license.

93
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:56,428
I think that at the very least we should have our opportunity to discuss with UnityCab what our issues and concerns are prior to us actually authorizing this transfer.

94
00:09:57,486 --> 00:10:00,128
Motion to table is undebatable.

95
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,050
Motion to table by Councillor Knight.

96
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,890
All those in favour?

97
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:04,371
All those opposed?

98
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:05,572
Matter's tabled.

99
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:11,577
On the motion of Councillor Camuso to revert back to the regular order of business.

100
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:12,838
All those in favour?

101
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,079
All those opposed?

102
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,180
15-0.

103
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:25,228
Sir, because you were invited to attend a subcommittee meeting on licensing this evening to discuss your taxicab operation,

104
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:44,546
and weren't present in the council office at 5.30, the councillor thought it would be prudent not to allow for this transfer of license from one camp to another until the subcommittee on licensing has had the opportunity to share with you in discussion some questions that they have.

105
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:54,553
So when the subcommittee meets again, reconvenes, I'm sure you were notified of this meeting by the clerk's office a week or two ago,

106
00:10:55,225 --> 00:11:01,969
It would be advisable for you to be present at that meeting for there to be discussion before we can take up this matter.

107
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:13,015
As you're aware, there have been a longstanding number of concerns regarding practices of some of those who are licensed as hackney carriages in the city of Medford.

108
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:18,978
And there's also an ordinance review underway as it regards the taxi cabs.

109
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:23,220
So therefore, it would be appropriate for you to be present

110
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:28,521
at that next subcommittee meeting, which Councilor Caviello will call in the near future.

111
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:33,545
But until that time, it's been decided that this matter lay on the table.

112
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:35,566
Thank you.

113
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:36,587
Thank you for your patience.

114
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:43,372
Mr. President, if I may, I certainly have no objection to the transfer of the license after the gentleman does appear before the subcommittee and addresses the questions that we have for him.

115
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,251
Thank you, Counselor, and so noted.

116
00:11:46,212 --> 00:12:05,448
Uh, 15-089, uh, hearings, uh, public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council and the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, on Tuesday evening, March 24th, 2015, at 7 p.m., on a petition from Wendy's Restaurant for a special permit

117
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:19,830
to amend its hours of operation to operate its drive-thru at 330 Mystic Avenue, Medford, on said site, being located in an industrial zoning district as follows, Monday to Sunday drive-thru, 11 p.m.

118
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:30,135
to 3 a.m., in accordance with the provisions of Section 9401 of 45B of Chapter 94 of the revised ordinances of the City of Medford.

119
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:36,629
Petition and plan may be seen in the office of the Medford City Clerk, City Hall, Medford Mass.

120
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:43,155
Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations, aids, or further information.

121
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:50,482
By order of the Medford City Council, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, advertising the Medford Mercury, March

122
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:55,381
6th and March 16th, 2015.

123
00:12:56,021 --> 00:13:02,945
At this time we open the public hearing to all those in favor.

124
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:10,489
Would all those in favor of the drive-thru for Wendy's please step forward and identify yourself and state your intention.

125
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,973
Hi, my name is Anthony Donato with Bowler Engineer and I'm representing Wendy's.

126
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:20,994
Chad Adams, who's the local construction manager, couldn't make it tonight.

127
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:21,835
He apologizes.

128
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,156
He's from Pennsylvania.

129
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,938
But basically, Wendy's operates only a lunch and a dinner.

130
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,359
They don't have a breakfast.

131
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,742
And right now, they're- This is a public hearing just to open up.

132
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:39,847
So we just, at this point, allow you to state that you're in favor of this.

133
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:40,167
Yes?

134
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:40,467
Oh, okay.

135
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:40,747
Yes, I am.

136
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:41,047
Yes.

137
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,290
Anybody else in favor of the drive-through at Wendy's?

138
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,551
Hearing and seeing-

139
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:50,279
Do you wish to state that at the podium, sir?

140
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,682
Hearing and seeing none, that portion of the meeting is closed.

141
00:13:56,222 --> 00:14:01,606
All those opposed to a drive-through at Wendy's, please present yourself before the rail.

142
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:04,087
Those opposed.

143
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:13,273
Hearing and seeing none, the chair calls that portion of the meeting closed.

144
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,304
The chair awaits a motion for approval by this.

145
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,205
Councilor Longo-Kern.

146
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:34,725
Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

147
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:38,986
City Clerk Finn, is Kelly's Roast Beef 2 a.m.

148
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:39,726
or 3 a.m.?

149
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,007
No, it's Kelly's Roast Beef.

150
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:43,707
That's 3 a.m.? ?

151
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,253
Yeah.

152
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:48,295
Thank you.

153
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:51,197
As is Burger King.

154
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I knew there were two or three.

155
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,361
I just couldn't recall.

156
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:57,881
Burger King, yeah.

157
00:14:58,202 --> 00:14:58,982
I just wanted to make sure.

158
00:14:59,042 --> 00:14:59,382
Thank you.

159
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:04,466
Chair awaits a motion.

160
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:07,748
On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight.

161
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:10,750
Does this require a roll?

162
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,911
Well, it is.

163
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:13,472
Seconded by Councilor Camuso.

164
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,313
All those in favor?

165
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:16,449
All those opposed?

166
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:24,051
Motion carries for the extended hours of operation of a drive-thru.

167
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:28,091
If I may, from the chair on that?

168
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:28,571
Yes.

169
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:37,433
I'm just going to make sure that the property is well lit, you know, for the parking lot and, you know, obviously traversing the drive-thru just for safety purposes.

170
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:39,914
Thank you.

171
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:41,674
Your other petition will be taken up later.

172
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,463
A question on the approved item by Councillor Penta.

173
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:50,925
On the back portion, Mr. Wendy.

174
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:52,526
Mr. Wendy.

175
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:53,687
Mr. Wendy?

176
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:55,688
Big Dave, whatever your name is.

177
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:01,392
Behind Wendy's, isn't there an apartment complex being scheduled to be built there?

178
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,174
I understand there is, yes.

179
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:05,174
And how many units?

180
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,295
Do you have any idea how many units?

181
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,496
No, I don't.

182
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:14,045
I think one of the concerns before, just one council member just resurrected this in my head, on the lighting.

183
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:19,467
And they wanted to make sure it was not going to be intrusive to the apartment buildings to the immediate left of them.

184
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,609
I just don't know how the lighting is going to affect the apartments that are going to be behind you.

185
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,551
And can we get some kind of a lighting scheme as to what's going to go in there?

186
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:34,233
Because if it's going to be intrusive to the new development in the back, I think we're going to have to address that.

187
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:35,733
Certainly.

188
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:39,138
I don't believe there's any changes proposed for the lighting.

189
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:40,199
It's what there is now.

190
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:45,066
But if you want more information on the existing lighting, certainly provide it.

191
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:46,488
Okay.

192
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,852
Directly to Mr. Finn's office?

193
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:49,593
Sure.

194
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:50,114
Okay, great.

195
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:50,374
Thank you.

196
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:50,634
Thank you.

197
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:04,964
On that point, Mr. President, I do believe that the folks from Wendy's were before this council a couple of months ago requesting some sign variances.

198
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:08,746
And the discussion of lights came up at that point in time as well.

199
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:12,989
And I don't believe the council has received any type of response from the developer.

200
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:18,733
So I think that that would be certainly a nice good faith effort on their behalf, Mr. President.

201
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:35,216
I believe when you were here for the variance on the signage and we made the same exact recommendations and requests and we haven't gotten a response.

202
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:59,159
that, by order of the Medford City Council, a public hearing will be given at the Howard F. Alden Memorial Chambers, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, at 7 p.m.

203
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:14,687
on Tuesday, March 24, 2015, on a petition by National Grid of North Andover, Massachusetts, for permission to locate poles, wires, and fixtures, including the necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures, along and across the following public way.

204
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:28,769
Valley Place, National Grid to install one SO 1 south of Valley Place, beginning at a point approximately 58 feet south of the centerline of the intersection of the Felsway.

205
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:43,100
National Grid to install 35 foot class 3 SO pole, number two, 50 feet plus or minus from the pole at number one Valley Place towards Felsway

206
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,196
to service 727 Felsway.

207
00:18:46,876 --> 00:19:04,442
Wherefore, it prays that after due notice and hearings as provided by law, it be permitted to excavate the public highways and to run and maintain underground electrical conduits together with such sustaining and protecting fixtures as it may find necessary for the transmission of electricity.

208
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:06,503
Said underground conduits

209
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:27,259
to be located substantially in accordance with the plan filed herewith, marked National Grid, Valley Place, Medford, Massachusetts, number 17430506, December 17th, 2014, approved by the chief engineer, based on the review of the work of installation, the new pole and overhead wires only, i.e.

210
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:32,823
no underground conduits can proceed forthwith, provided the following requirements are met.

211
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,473
No city-owned or private utilities or other structures are adversely impacted.

212
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:47,258
National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.

213
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:53,902
Any disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind.

214
00:19:54,982 --> 00:20:02,967
Before beginning work, the contractor shall notify DIGSAFE and shall obtain applicable permits from the Engineering Division.

215
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:14,529
National Grid contractor shall utilize City of Medford regulations and standards, as well as for removing all debris related to its work.

216
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:17,151
Approved by the Superintendent of Wires.

217
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:22,536
Call 781-393-2425 for accommodations, aids, et cetera.

218
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:28,381
The public hearing is opened to all those in favor.

219
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:32,184
All those in favor, please present yourself, sir.

220
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:33,619
Good evening.

221
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:35,680
My name is John Jankowski.

222
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,741
I'm representing National Grid.

223
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:42,203
My address is 170 Medford Street in Malden, Mass.

224
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:54,448
Proposed petition is to install a wooden pole approximately 50 feet from pole one on Valley Street to provide service to 272 Felsway in Medford.

225
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:56,069
Thank you.

226
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:57,849
All those in favor?

227
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,070
Anybody else in favor?

228
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,487
Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting closed.

229
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:07,430
All those opposed, anybody opposed, please present yourself.

230
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:18,257
The chair hearing and seeing none, declares that portion of the meeting closed and opens up the floor to questioning or a motion.

231
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,178
Counselor Knight.

232
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:22,700
Mr. President, I certainly have no problem supporting this paper.

233
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,742
However, several months back we had requested from the city engineer

234
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:33,070
that she forwarded forward to us her policy relative to the city of Medford's regulations and standards for the street restoration and debris removal.

235
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,713
To date, I don't believe we've received that, Mr. President.

236
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:41,499
So I'd like to amend the paper by requesting that the city engineer once again send this materials to the Medford City Council for review.

237
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,201
Thank you, Councillor.

238
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:48,407
Councillor Marks.

239
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:53,048
Thank you, Mr. President, and I have no problem supporting this paper here tonight.

240
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:58,990
I did receive several calls from concerned residents of Bradbury Street.

241
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:11,995
There appears to be an electrical wire that's hanging from 64 Bradbury, about 12 feet from the sidewalk, and extends down Bradbury to the corner of 3rd Street.

242
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:16,177
And I know neighbors have made several calls to

243
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:24,794
The electrical company and have not received any feedback at all, Mr President.

244
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:29,077
So if we can make that as part of the committee report, it's 64 Bradbury.

245
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:35,100
It goes down Bradbury to the corner of Bradbury and 3rd St.

246
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:41,544
And it appears to be hanging from one of your glass insulators at the top.

247
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:44,786
It's probably going to be just a wire from the.

248
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:49,007
It's just a wire coming off, that's all.

249
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:49,828
We'll take care of it.

250
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:53,851
If you could take a look at that immediately, because residents are concerned.

251
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:55,812
I would motion for approval, Mr. President.

252
00:22:56,032 --> 00:23:05,599
On the motion of approval for this item as amended by Councilors Knight and Marks, Councilor, Vice President Longo Kern.

253
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:08,061
Thank you, President De La Russo.

254
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,302
About how long will the work take?

255
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:11,616
We have to call in a digsafe.

256
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:14,917
Hopefully most of the snow has gone.

257
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:18,218
So I would think probably within three weeks.

258
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:24,741
The 272s, they do have low voltage, so we want to kind of expedite the job too.

259
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:25,962
So about two to three weeks?

260
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:26,962
I would think so, yes.

261
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:31,344
And you'll start right after you call a digsafe?

262
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:37,866
Yeah, I would think probably two to three weeks, because obviously, you know, next week jobs are all lined up.

263
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:40,225
OK, thank you.

264
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,487
And on a side note, I also got a couple of concerned residents.

265
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:49,150
National Grid did some work on Parris Street and was supposed to repave.

266
00:23:49,750 --> 00:24:00,115
Can you just find out for the council if that project is— Well, it's probably this time of the year, there's probably going to be a patch on it, but once the asphalt plants start opening up, obviously we'll start repairing it.

267
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:04,798
Is there any way you could send the clerk just a written response on that, Parris Street repaving?

268
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:16,165
Residents were also told there was one side of the street, I forget if it was even or odd, was supposed to be filled in with cement like the other side, so if we could just get a response on that.

269
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,887
Is it electric or gas, do you know?

270
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,811
I believe it was gas.

271
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:23,395
Thank you.

272
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:29,718
Thank you.

273
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:36,443
So on the motion of approval by Councillor Marks, amended by Councillors Marks and Knight.

274
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:37,683
All those in favour?

275
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:39,345
All those opposed?

276
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:41,266
Thank you.

277
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:42,007
Dig safe.

278
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,933
Chair recognizes Councillor Caviello.

279
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:54,436
Motion to suspend the rules to take two papers out of order.

280
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:55,957
All those in favour?

281
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:56,898
All those opposed?

282
00:24:57,668 --> 00:24:58,468
The motion granted.

283
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:19,618
Items number under petitions, presentations, and similar matters, 15-309, petition for outdoor dining license by Wendy's Restaurant, 330 Mystic Avenue, Medford, on file recommendations from building commissioner, Board of Health, traffic impact report, ADA coordinator petition.

284
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:25,501
And this comes before the, does this before license?

285
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:37,815
So it comes before the licensing committee, so we allow the petitioner to address us, and then open the floor to Councilor Caraviello for recommendation.

286
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:39,616
Thank you, Mr. President.

287
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:41,497
Chair of the licensing committee.

288
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:42,217
Sir.

289
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:42,978
Hi, good evening.

290
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:46,020
Tony Donato with Buller Engineering, representing Wendy's.

291
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,965
And as shown on the rendering here, we'd like to include a patio outside.

292
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,987
Obviously, the products would be purchased outside.

293
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:01,841
to be self-serve and first-come, first-served for the seating outside.

294
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:20,972
There will be 12 seats, one of which will be accessible as per ADA requirements, and I believe this has been through your ADA coordinator in town, and she has, we've provided her additional information on the access aisles and widths, and it's been addressed adequately.

295
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:34,326
And again, these are just, it's going to be only during daylight hours and the seasonal, you know, summer hours and while it's light outside.

296
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:37,188
There's not going to be any exterior lighting for this seating area.

297
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:43,092
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello, Chair of the Licensing Commission.

298
00:26:43,112 --> 00:26:44,132
Thank you, Mr. President.

299
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:49,616
I reviewed the papers and I see the picture there.

300
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,438
Is that where the outdoor dining is going to be?

301
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:53,943
Yes, it is.

302
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:56,624
And what were the hours of operation, you said, for the outdoor?

303
00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:58,704
During the store hours, during daylight.

304
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,664
Only during daylight hours?

305
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:12,706
Well, yeah, there's not going to be any exterior other lighting during the store hours, I guess you would say, between, I think they're open until 11 right now, but I don't, they're not going to add any lighting to that.

306
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:21,748
And what that rendering does not show is that there was a request by the fire department or the building inspector to include some decorative bollards

307
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:26,391
just for pedestrian safety, which would be installed.

308
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:31,935
Mr. President, I reviewed the papers and I find everything in order.

309
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:33,856
And a motion for approval.

310
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:37,519
On the motion of approval by Councillor Caraviello.

311
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:38,660
Councillor Marks, please.

312
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,241
Thank you, Mr. President.

313
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:43,203
You know, I like the concept.

314
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:48,087
The one concern I have is the fact that that Wendy's closes at 11 o'clock.

315
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,528
So you can't go in and order after 11.

316
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:54,689
You can use the drive-thru, correct?

317
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,392
And after that time... Now till 3 o'clock.

318
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, after that time, even though that particular section, as the gentleman just alluded to, won't be lit, it will be lit from Middlesex Ave, with the lighting that's currently on Middlesex Ave.

319
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:18,406
And my concern is that at 1, 2, 3 in the morning, if people want to get out on a nice summer night,

320
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:31,623
That could turn into an area that people sit down and eat and so forth, which would pose a real concern for the area and also area residents.

321
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:40,570
So I have a little concern, Mr. President, unless they're going to take the furniture in after dark every night.

322
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,891
Is that gated off?

323
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:47,655
Well, I believe it's bolted, but I mean, we could add signage to then have them police it if that would address your concerns.

324
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:53,129
So your staff's going to go out there if someone's having a hamburger out there and talking, they're going to kick them out?

325
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,032
Well, I guess we could ask them to include a gate across there or a chain.

326
00:28:58,993 --> 00:28:59,473
That would help.

327
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:03,016
I just don't want it to turn into a hangout.

328
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:03,736
Exactly.

329
00:29:04,136 --> 00:29:07,139
After hours, especially where it's not going to be lit.

330
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:13,643
And I can see that particular area at 12, 1, 2 in the morning becoming a hangout.

331
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:16,625
And I have real concerns, Mr. President, with that.

332
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:28,756
So unless the furniture is going to be removed every night at dusk, I couldn't support that, Mr. President, in its current form.

333
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:45,590
So are you saying that would you be supportive to it on the condition that we amend the motion of approval that there be a condition added that the area be locked off by use of a gate at the end of its

334
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:47,968
its use period?

335
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,950
I may be amendable to that.

336
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,132
The gate, the fence itself only looks maybe three feet high.

337
00:29:57,152 --> 00:30:00,153
It doesn't look like much of a fence.

338
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:03,954
But, you know, noise travels, especially on a warm summer night.

339
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:14,199
And there are residents, you may not think so, there are residents in that close proximity that I would hate to have concerns down the line.

340
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:19,338
of people calling up saying they can hear, you know, people out at 2 in the morning, 3 in the morning.

341
00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:21,539
I just have a real concern with this.

342
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:28,764
And I'm not sure if that's the direction we should be going in that particular area.

343
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,806
We allowed the 3 o'clock extension.

344
00:30:32,826 --> 00:30:40,211
Maybe if we put a 6-month review on this, I would be amenable maybe to a 6-month review.

345
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:44,634
But somehow that furniture has to be removed, Mr. President.

346
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,503
Because I'm not sure what a gate would do, to be quite honest with you.

347
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:54,949
And I'm not sure if their employees are going to want to go out and start kicking people off the property.

348
00:30:55,449 --> 00:31:02,915
Unless they put like a no-loitering sign after store hours, and then maybe it'd have to be police if something came along.

349
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:10,102
I mean, the six-month review, that would be great if we could just take a look at it for six months and see how it works out.

350
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:11,503
Yeah, that takes us into September.

351
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:17,010
Well, our police have better things to do than kick people out of your property with all due respect.

352
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,350
Well, I think they would first come out there and tell when it was closed.

353
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,672
I mean, we could post signs there that it's only open during store hours or from daylight hours.

354
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:32,195
And then we could probably add a chain across it or something or do something so that prohibit people from sitting there during the day.

355
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:35,356
But I think that I'm pretty sure that the furniture is bolted down to the patio.

356
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,376
It's not movable.

357
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:40,238
And I think that's part of trying to get the ADA space requirements.

358
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:45,200
additional information here on the patio furniture if you want to look at it.

359
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,624
I don't know if that helps address your concerns, but.

360
00:31:50,824 --> 00:31:51,904
The furniture is not my concern.

361
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:58,209
My concern is the fact that there'll be people loitering out there after hours and that that's my concern.

362
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:09,377
You know, maybe if Wendy's wanted to open their restaurant and allow people that maybe one o'clock in the morning we're going to sit down inside your establishment and have something to eat.

363
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,946
Maybe that may be what could be done.

364
00:32:14,046 --> 00:32:20,368
I think this is more of a... Point of clarification, Councilor, Vice-President Lugokurin.

365
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:24,829
I'm sorry, I have to press your button too, I'm sorry.

366
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,671
Will all the furniture be, you know, sometimes a stackable chair is locked up, anything like that?

367
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:39,534
In the packets that we received, it shows a diagram of the furniture, and it's the Infinity Series patio series,

368
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,641
which is ADA compliant and meets all state, local, and federal regulations.

369
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:57,246
There's a little sketch that's going around that shows, and I think there's certain requirements with regards to, in particular with a wheelchair, the space that they're allowed to turn and clear.

370
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:00,347
So I think that's why they're proposing with the bolt down.

371
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:07,310
I mean, if there's anything, if they could chain up the furniture maybe so that they couldn't sit there after hours.

372
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:12,397
But I don't think physically moving the furniture every night would be something.

373
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:16,619
And the intent is that they're remodeling a bunch of their stores in New England.

374
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:20,300
They've done this in the South and they're coming up here and they're remodeling their stores.

375
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,761
I think it's more for like family's daylight hours.

376
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:26,042
It's not really something like after hours drive-thru.

377
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:27,242
But I do see your point.

378
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:34,245
You wouldn't want anybody hanging out there, orders in the drive-thru and then sitting down there.

379
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:40,738
Point of information, Councillor Penta.

380
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:42,558
Is this area going to be lit?

381
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:44,879
No.

382
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:45,939
It will not be lit?

383
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,200
We're not proposing any more lighting, no.

384
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,941
So this outside seating area will have no lights at all at any time during the day or night?

385
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:54,001
Well, there might be some lights above.

386
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:58,702
There's a walkway here that's going to be in front of the building, but the patio itself will not be lit.

387
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:02,923
So maybe, Councillor Mack, you can make a request that there be no lighting there after 11 o'clock at night?

388
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,989
No, he said there is some along the side.

389
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:11,992
Nothing near the patio at all.

390
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:17,056
I think Councilor Caviello was waiting to be recognized first.

391
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:24,502
I'm sorry, we're having a microphone problem tonight, as you can see.

392
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,302
Thank you, Mr. President.

393
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:35,370
I agree with Councilor Marks that maybe if you gated that area off, I mean, I see the space here, but if you put a gate out there and maybe took the umbrellas in with the sign saying, you know,

394
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:37,085
no seating after dark.

395
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:42,249
I know the only lights you'll be seeing are whatever comes off the store.

396
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,792
I would imagine they would take the umbrellas in.

397
00:34:45,812 --> 00:34:47,094
Yeah, but if you could gate that.

398
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:48,975
Certainly.

399
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:52,858
It looks like you haven't gated most of the way.

400
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,082
Gate it with a sign saying no seating after dark.

401
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:00,885
Yes, that would definitely be amenable to that.

402
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,328
Councilor Knight.

403
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:07,252
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

404
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:13,376
As I look through the packet, I see a letter dated January 6, 2015, from Diane McLeod to the city clerk.

405
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:21,401
And the letter reads, reviewing the outdoor seating specifications provided for Wendy's, I note that they do have three tables, one of which is accessible.

406
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:24,042
Other than that, they provide no information on accessible seating.

407
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:26,104
What is provided is not accessible.

408
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:30,566
No path of travel with distance or access aisles with height or knee depth, as well as no seating policy.

409
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:32,988
More detailed information is needed.

410
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:34,709
That letter was followed up

411
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:39,581
by a letter which looks like it's dated January 8th.

412
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:44,785
And it says, in response to the memo dated January 6th, 2015 from Ms.

413
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:50,871
Diane McLeod, ADA coordinator, Bowler Engineering is submitting the following supplemental information on behalf of Wendy's.

414
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:59,518
Patio table cut sheet by Recycle Design depicting compliance with ADA, patio accessibility sketch, and Wendy's restaurants accessible seating policy.

415
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:03,431
After that, Mr. Clerk, there's no correspondence from the Office of Disability to your office.

416
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,593
Have you had any discussions with Ms.

417
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:08,695
McLeod to determine whether or not, in fact, the seating policy is in compliance?

418
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:08,915
MR. MCLEOD.

419
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:18,042
Mr. Chairman, a lot of my staff have had problems today, these days.

420
00:36:19,984 --> 00:36:28,470
But after Mr. Donato forwarded the updated part

421
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:33,193
to Diane on these ADA requirements.

422
00:36:33,714 --> 00:36:39,477
And from there, she said she had no problem after that, as long as that's what it is, those plans that he submitted.

423
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:39,957
Yeah.

424
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:40,278
Okay.

425
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:41,338
Yeah.

426
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:41,619
Thank you.

427
00:36:41,939 --> 00:36:42,879
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

428
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,901
Anything further, Councilor Knight?

429
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:51,725
No, that's it.

430
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:53,946
I just wanted to be sure that... Thank you, Councilor Knight.

431
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:54,727
Councilor Camuso.

432
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,088
Thank you, Mr. President.

433
00:36:57,612 --> 00:37:04,717
I think that Wendy's has to make a determination, and if they want to proceed with this, I agree with Councillor Marks 100%.

434
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:10,641
If they want to proceed with this, I think we have to move reconsideration on the 3 a.m.

435
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:14,263
license, or at least put six-month review on the 3 a.m.

436
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:20,847
license, because we could eventually have a real albatross around our neck in the residential neighbourhood, as Councillor Marks stated.

437
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:25,267
They have their 3 o'clock license and they get this.

438
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:30,108
And we all know that Malden still has bar rooms that are open till 2 a.m.

439
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:35,629
And traditionally, people get out of there and they'd always head to Wendy's, Kelly's and Burger King.

440
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,430
So I definitely agree with Councilor Marks.

441
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,631
This is a major concern.

442
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:45,512
Could you speak on behalf of Wendy's and what's more important to the operation right now?

443
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:48,012
Is it the seating or is it the 3 a.m.

444
00:37:48,052 --> 00:37:48,793
drive-thru license?

445
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:49,933
Because I can't see

446
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:53,045
I can't see doing both of them at this point, to be quite honest with you.

447
00:37:53,366 --> 00:38:06,413
Because we all know that that may be fenced off or a chain or something, but you're still going to have people, I mean, we have other establishments that their furniture gets stolen at 2, 3 in the morning from in front of their restaurants in this community.

448
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:13,777
So I just don't feel comfortable, to be quite honest, doing both of these at the same time.

449
00:38:13,797 --> 00:38:16,458
I don't know how the rest of my council colleagues feel about it.

450
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:23,127
I think if we're gonna do this, we should put a six-month review on the license that we just gave a few minutes ago.

451
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,668
Would you, can you speak on behalf of?

452
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:33,009
Well, I think the six-month review would be certainly a good alternative, acceptable.

453
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:33,629
On both?

454
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:35,010
On both, sure.

455
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,930
I mean, we can certainly police that.

456
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,751
I mean, I think, does the Kellys have tables out there too?

457
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:40,431
Is there an issue?

458
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:41,331
No.

459
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:43,711
Yeah, they do, but they're on the Revere Beach Parkway side.

460
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:45,792
There's a couple metal tables.

461
00:38:46,712 --> 00:38:46,852
Yeah.

462
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:48,276
Yeah.

463
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:55,182
But, you know, certainly, I mean, we can certainly add the fence and blocking off and signage.

464
00:38:55,202 --> 00:39:00,387
And we can certainly, I mean, they're ready to do a building permit, get this building under construction.

465
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:02,128
They're going to be pulling the building permit.

466
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:03,149
We received approval.

467
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:08,073
So they would be open in the summer and it would be perfect time to evaluate it at the end of the summer.

468
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:15,860
And if it's not working for the city and if you guys want to call us back in here and if, you know, discuss the alternatives, either change the hours or

469
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:26,100
The other thing I would... I agree with Councillor Marks if there's an aesthetically pleasing way where you can do higher wrought iron with a gate that they can actually lock.

470
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:30,684
I mean, if you drive up Route 28, up near Kitty's and stuff, you have some of the smaller restaurants.

471
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:34,066
McDonald's, for instance, has a nice wrought iron fence.

472
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:40,211
It's black, but it prevents people from jumping over it and getting in there when they're not supposed to.

473
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:45,115
But the current setup, I just think... I think you're actually asking for problems.

474
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,969
Um, and I agree with Councillor Marks.

475
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:51,689
It's a very, uh, condensed residential neighbourhood right on the other side of BJ's.

476
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,130
And, uh, as you know, you get your air conditioner on on a, uh, nice summer night.

477
00:39:56,851 --> 00:40:00,271
I mean, uh, your window's open with the air conditioner off, you can hear things travel.

478
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:08,934
So, um, I'd like to, if Councillor Marks is okay with it, I would, uh, I would like to see the six-month review, as the Councillor said.

479
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:14,755
But also, right after this vote's taken, I'm gonna move reconsideration on the initial vote to put a six-month review on that as well.

480
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,971
There's a motion for approval as amended before us.

481
00:40:23,491 --> 00:40:24,252
Councilor Marks.

482
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:36,101
Mr. President, I don't mind the six-month review, but I don't see what the hardship is to take in, you said there's seating for 12, take in 12 chairs and three tables.

483
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:39,244
You know, outdoor.

484
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:45,048
If you saw the diagrams, Councilor, it would be akin to moving this whole bench that you're sitting at inside.

485
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:49,672
They may have to rearrange what they were going to order, Mr. President, based on our approval.

486
00:40:50,656 --> 00:41:04,121
I realize that's what they're calling for, but, um, you know, we have a program that allows businesses to put tables and chairs out in the sidewalk, Mr. President, and we don't allow them to leave the tables and chairs at the end of the night.

487
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:07,182
Those tables and chairs have to be taken in and so forth.

488
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:08,863
And I don't see any difference.

489
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:15,986
I, you know, I don't mind the six month review, but, um, I don't see why Wendy's can't take in this furniture every night.

490
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:18,947
If this is something you want to offer seasonal for three months,

491
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:23,745
This is something that you're going to have to take in the furniture, or you're not going to get my vote.

492
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:39,774
I don't know where anyone else stands, but I just, you know, speaking on behalf of the residents in that area, and there are many, I couldn't possibly support something that may attract people at three in the morning to sit out there and not only have a burger, but maybe a couple of beers, too.

493
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:40,815
Don't forget, so.

494
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:44,157
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

495
00:41:45,063 --> 00:41:50,066
Mr. President, that's an interesting position that Councillor Marks has taken, and I think it makes sense.

496
00:41:51,107 --> 00:42:03,515
You know, we have Wendy's here, and I don't see any harm in maybe Wendy's putting out some temporary seating and us approving maybe a 30-day or a 60-day or a 90-day license for them to use temporary seating and see how it goes.

497
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:08,278
Then they can come back to the council if, in fact, things have worked out and we can approve the design of the

498
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:11,388
the standard equipment that's going to go in.

499
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:19,876
But I think if we let them have an opportunity to give it a dry run or a trial run and see what the effect is, maybe that'll be a good compromise for all of us here.

500
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:26,022
I think that we have some concerns about the permanency of the seating that's going to be out there.

501
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:29,285
We also have some concerns about whether or not there are going to be transients there late at night.

502
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:33,790
It's on Wendy's, obviously, to monitor their property, and I certainly don't want to turn this into

503
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:44,838
you know, private detail for the police department to have to come down and keep monitoring Wendy's and what's going on, and I certainly don't want to see the quality of life of the residents in the area be hurt.

504
00:42:45,059 --> 00:43:03,912
However, I think that there's room for compromise here, Mr. President, and I think there's some room for some outside-of-the-box thinking, and if maybe we allow Wendy's to do a three-month trial period with seating that's not permanently fixed, and then they can come back to the council after that period of time, and we can take a look at the complaints that were registered by the police department, we can take a look at the

505
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:10,184
the calls that have been made to our first responders, maybe we'll have a better understanding as to what exactly is going on down there after hours.

506
00:43:11,986 --> 00:43:12,766
Thank you, Counselor.

507
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:14,448
Counselor Caraviello.

508
00:43:14,568 --> 00:43:15,228
Thank you, Mr. President.

509
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:20,233
If those aren't too heavy, I don't see why you couldn't stand them up at the end of the night.

510
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:24,637
Excuse me?

511
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:27,139
I think they're bolted into the attic.

512
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:27,819
Are they going to be bolted?

513
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,161
Why do they have to be bolted in?

514
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:30,181
Do they have to be bolted in?

515
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:45,771
Well, again, I think, yeah, I think for, like, that, that someone had said, and then, um, just, again, these, these are, like, designed to meet ADA requirements, so they have to be spaced a certain distance away, and I think, you know, one of the concerns is that if they stack... I mean, could they be covered in the evening?

516
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,273
Would you cover them with a cover?

517
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:48,834
I guess we could cover them.

518
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:50,015
Maybe that would be a compromise.

519
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:51,276
I mean, I know they, I know they have covers.

520
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,498
You, you know, they, you can get a cover that can cover the tables.

521
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:59,502
I think that'd be a great idea, Counselor, if we could cover them, and if they could lock them with a cover, and then...

522
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:04,584
A tarp with a cable and a lock?

523
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:05,004
Yeah.

524
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:06,946
That'd be great.

525
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:09,888
Well, Mr. President?

526
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:11,209
Councilor Camuso?

527
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:24,439
That leads up to something right along the lines, and I think it would be something that Councilor Mox, and I'm not speaking for him, but maybe that would be satisfying to him and myself, because obviously there's some neighborhood concerns.

528
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,682
What about one of those tops that you shut down the whole patio at night?

529
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:34,274
It just, you roll it out from the wall, and it comes with the vinyl, so you actually can't walk in there.

530
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:38,035
It goes around the four corners.

531
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:39,935
They have them, I mean.

532
00:44:40,115 --> 00:44:41,416
I've seen them, I'm not sure.

533
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:45,757
I would think that the manufacturer would have something that would just cover the whole table as it is.

534
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:50,278
Yeah, but the table being covered is still gonna not prevent people from going in the patio at three in the morning.

535
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:51,738
So you said cover the tarp?

536
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:54,378
You know what I'm talking about, right?

537
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:56,859
Like, pool yards and things like that would actually go,

538
00:44:57,732 --> 00:45:08,457
It's very aesthetically pleasing, and it comes out, and it just attaches to the four corners for lack of the scientific.

539
00:45:09,817 --> 00:45:18,261
Of the fence, yeah.

540
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:19,062
I would support that.

541
00:45:20,562 --> 00:45:24,184
So if the chair could have something in motion form.

542
00:45:24,584 --> 00:45:26,785
Make a motion to have it

543
00:45:27,513 --> 00:45:41,742
Covered up by virtue of connecting a vinyl something or something aesthetically pleasing to all four corners, so that at 11 o'clock at night, anything within the regular operating hours.

544
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:44,604
After it gets dark, according to... At dusk.

545
00:45:45,644 --> 00:45:47,125
Cover the furniture and chain it down.

546
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:50,327
No, not the furniture, cover the whole patio.

547
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:52,308
Either cover the furniture or cover the patio.

548
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:52,809
No, the patio.

549
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:25,283
so that the patio be covered, so this license is granted on the condition that the outdoor dining license is granted with a six-month review, if I understood the amendments, and that a vinyl or similar material tarp be employed to cover the entire seating area from post to post,

550
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:31,024
of the fence to prevent the entrance of individuals in there to be seated.

551
00:46:32,645 --> 00:46:40,167
After the sun goes down and or the termination of the agreed upon dining hours, which is sunset, am I correct?

552
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:41,627
That's what you stated.

553
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:43,347
Yeah, it's not, it's not lighting.

554
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:47,969
So I guess it would be dining hours, but there's not gonna be any additional lighting.

555
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:53,490
So, I mean, I guess we could just say the store while the store is open, but that's acceptable.

556
00:46:53,868 --> 00:46:54,789
Is that a little broad?

557
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:57,711
The store is open till 3, or is the store closed at 11?

558
00:46:57,911 --> 00:47:01,433
I mean, while the store is open, but not the drive-thru.

559
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:03,654
So the restaurant itself closes at 11?

560
00:47:03,694 --> 00:47:03,654
11.

561
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:10,179
So at 11 o'clock, this shop will be employed, or before then?

562
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,259
11 o'clock, it closed.

563
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,762
Unless someone else has better... I don't know.

564
00:47:15,802 --> 00:47:16,743
We're all on the same page.

565
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:17,343
I guess it's my question.

566
00:47:17,363 --> 00:47:18,544
To protect the integrity of the neighbourhood.

567
00:47:18,844 --> 00:47:19,385
Councillor Knight?

568
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:22,867
My question, Mr. President, is are we granting the license on these contingencies, or are we...

569
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:32,900
The chair's understanding is that we're agreeing to the license with these contingencies.

570
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:37,882
We're not asking for a redo of the design and a design alternative.

571
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:45,905
The design alternative has been approved by all the necessary persons, so we're just making amendments to it for the purpose of granting the license.

572
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,561
compliance with in-store hours, and that's something we do review in six months.

573
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:59,361
And if we have to, we pull it back till 8 p.m.

574
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:00,462
or whenever the sun goes down.

575
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:01,902
Very good.

576
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:09,523
And we should probably, if I may, through the Chair, get a report from the Chief of Police with regards to any calls that maybe are made at Kelly's.

577
00:48:09,963 --> 00:48:15,585
And I don't even think Kelly's has a permit for outdoor seating, although they do have a few tables up in the Hill area there.

578
00:48:15,905 --> 00:48:17,105
So maybe we could look into that.

579
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:22,546
So with all those amendments, Mr. Clerk, you have them all?

580
00:48:24,937 --> 00:48:34,683
Six-month review at the termination of restaurant hours in store dining hours.

581
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:35,383
Correct.

582
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:35,823
Is that right?

583
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:36,384
Yes.

584
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:38,365
Mr. President.

585
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:39,425
Councilor Marks.

586
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:47,590
You know, why would we want to invite residents at 10 o'clock to an area that's not going to be lit?

587
00:48:49,171 --> 00:48:52,814
And forget about Wendy's, because they're not looking out for residents of this community.

588
00:48:53,174 --> 00:48:53,254
No.

589
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:03,505
Why would we want, if the gentleman said it's not going to be lit, and we're going to allow people, our residents, to go and use this area that's not lit, to me would pose a great danger.

590
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:08,408
I'm not sure why we would allow that.

591
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:11,050
It doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President.

592
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:16,713
It may work for the store to have it open until 11, but if it's not lit, then why are we, you know,

593
00:49:17,915 --> 00:49:19,236
If you could clarify that for us, sir.

594
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,878
Would we call that ambient lighting?

595
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:43,408
It doesn't light up your area, you said.

596
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:45,348
It doesn't light up the area.

597
00:49:45,788 --> 00:49:46,869
It's gonna be close enough to it.

598
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:48,949
It's gonna be close enough to give enough light.

599
00:49:49,609 --> 00:49:55,631
So originally then you were allowing lights out there without any restrictions at all.

600
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:58,112
You just wanted to have a little potty area out there.

601
00:49:58,712 --> 00:49:59,132
I'm sorry.

602
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:04,854
You made it sound originally like once it turns dark, there's no one's gonna go by there because

603
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,801
Once the sun goes down, you're not going to go out there.

604
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:09,441
Now you're saying, well, there's enough lighting there.

605
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:12,743
You could stay until 10, 11 o'clock, if need be.

606
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:17,544
When the store closes, they shut the lights off on the exterior of the building, but they leave the drive-thru windows open.

607
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,825
Yeah, but that's not how it was presented to us originally.

608
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:21,426
I apologize.

609
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:24,967
You made it sound like there was no lighting out there.

610
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:29,689
And now all of a sudden there's lighting because you want it to be open until 11.

611
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,989
Mr. President, I can't support 11 o'clock.

612
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,590
I can't support 11 o'clock.

613
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:38,737
That's not the purpose of those lights out there to light up that particular area.

614
00:50:39,357 --> 00:50:49,826
And to me, you know, when you're trying to put a baby to bed at 8 o'clock is late to hear noise of someone that may be out there 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock at night.

615
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:54,790
You know, so I can't support that if we want to do it.

616
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:57,632
Dusk hours.

617
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:01,373
Or even 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, but not 11.

618
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:04,093
I think that's far too late, Mr. President.

619
00:51:06,474 --> 00:51:10,095
We have a motion of approval with those conditions stated.

620
00:51:10,675 --> 00:51:13,395
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Caruso.

621
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:14,656
What hour, 11 o'clock?

622
00:51:14,676 --> 00:51:18,416
Yeah, in-store dining hours, so that would be 11.

623
00:51:18,596 --> 00:51:20,097
I would ask that that be amended to

624
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:21,908
8 o'clock, Mr. President.

625
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:25,330
I withdraw the 11 and amendable to 8.

626
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:30,053
It's a six-month review, so we can revisit this in a six-month period.

627
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:34,236
So we've made that amendment to 8 o'clock, that that area has to be covered up.

628
00:51:35,556 --> 00:51:39,218
So on that motion, all those in favor with the six-month review.

629
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:40,959
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

630
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:43,561
Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Marks.

631
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:50,185
On the motion for approval, as amended with all those conditions, Mr. Clerk.

632
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:50,705
Quick question.

633
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:52,714
Quick question, Councilor Camuso.

634
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,495
I just have a quick question.

635
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,337
Does anyone know what time Brewers Patio closes?

636
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:01,180
Because that's directly across the street, and that's... In Malden.

637
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,421
Correct.

638
00:52:02,861 --> 00:52:04,002
That's a good point.

639
00:52:04,022 --> 00:52:04,262
2 o'clock.

640
00:52:04,282 --> 00:52:04,842
It's right on the line.

641
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:05,463
It is 2 o'clock.

642
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:06,183
The patio too?

643
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,745
I've been out there.

644
00:52:09,065 --> 00:52:13,768
The question is, we haven't had any complaints about that, but I think the 8 o'clock is definitely a good start.

645
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:20,093
Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out that nothing precludes

646
00:52:20,897 --> 00:52:26,041
Wendy's from coming back and petitioning the council to lift the restrictions at a later date, provided that there are no problems.

647
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:27,021
Correct.

648
00:52:28,602 --> 00:52:31,765
So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

649
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:33,006
Councilor Camuso.

650
00:52:33,306 --> 00:52:33,486
Yes.

651
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:35,047
Councilor Caviello.

652
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:35,427
Yes.

653
00:52:36,128 --> 00:52:36,668
Councilor Knight.

654
00:52:36,788 --> 00:52:36,988
Yes.

655
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:38,910
Vice-President Lana-Kern.

656
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:39,210
Yes.

657
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,631
Councilor Marks.

658
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:40,991
Yes.

659
00:52:41,752 --> 00:52:42,252
Councilor Penta.

660
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:42,372
Yes.

661
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:43,993
President Dela Russo.

662
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:45,374
Yes.

663
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:46,835
7 in the affirmative, none negative.

664
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:49,738
The motion passes for Wendy's on Middlesex Avenue.

665
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:50,138
Thank you.

666
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:51,362
Mr. President?

667
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:53,244
Mr. Counselor?

668
00:52:53,384 --> 00:52:56,686
While we're under suspension, I'd like to move reconsideration on 15-089.

669
00:52:58,868 --> 00:53:07,053
On the motion for reconsideration on 15-089, petition for 3 a.m.

670
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:08,795
drive-thru at Wendy's.

671
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:11,156
All those in favor?

672
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:13,058
All those opposed?

673
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:15,860
Motion for reconsideration is before us.

674
00:53:16,915 --> 00:53:20,736
I'd like to put a six-month review on this, at least present it to the council with a six-month review.

675
00:53:21,476 --> 00:53:25,678
We have to go through the public hearing again now that we're reconsidering.

676
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:39,202
So, the public hearing, having previously been... Mr. President, I move that the public hearing notice be waived based on the issue that you've already read at once and to the record.

677
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:40,202
Very good.

678
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:41,903
On that motion, all those in favour?

679
00:53:41,923 --> 00:53:42,563
All those opposed?

680
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:44,703
The reading is waived.

681
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:46,684
All those in favour of

682
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:48,910
Point of information, Counselor Penta.

683
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,891
I do not believe you can waive a public hearing, Mr. Clark.

684
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:52,931
Can you or can you not?

685
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:53,231
Do it quick.

686
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:54,531
It's for the public.

687
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:55,351
That's what it is.

688
00:53:55,371 --> 00:53:59,372
Just waive the reading, not the actual public hearing.

689
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:03,053
No, it's a public hearing because you're asking to waive one of the ingredients of the hearing.

690
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:07,953
Can't the Council... The Chair will... The Chair will... Wait a minute.

691
00:54:07,973 --> 00:54:14,775
If the Council votes for this right now and then for next week have a motion of reconsideration on the time sequence on that, can we do that?

692
00:54:15,195 --> 00:54:15,955
On the license.

693
00:54:15,975 --> 00:54:16,875
You would have to reconsider.

694
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:23,980
Tomorrow, but we wouldn't have to go to the whole public hearing process and advertising or anything like that, correct?

695
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:27,802
Can't we just do it right now?

696
00:54:27,822 --> 00:54:29,462
It'll take us two minutes to do it.

697
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:30,163
All those in favor?

698
00:54:30,203 --> 00:54:30,603
All those opposed?

699
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:32,004
The public hearing's already been held.

700
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:32,864
We voted on a paper.

701
00:54:32,884 --> 00:54:35,205
We're moving for reconsideration on the paper, not on the public hearing.

702
00:54:35,245 --> 00:54:36,366
The public hearing's already been held.

703
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:40,828
This legislative body's making a reconsideration on a piece of legislation that it had passed.

704
00:54:40,928 --> 00:54:41,188
It's not

705
00:54:42,663 --> 00:54:43,984
on how we voted on the public hearing.

706
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:45,684
Can you do this, Eddie, can you do this or not?

707
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:46,345
Just do it over.

708
00:54:46,485 --> 00:54:46,885
Just read it.

709
00:54:47,165 --> 00:54:47,525
Just read it.

710
00:54:47,605 --> 00:54:49,226
Let's just read it and I'll be happy.

711
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,866
Wait a minute, let the clerk answer, please.

712
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:53,588
You granted the special zoning.

713
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,448
Zoning is a public hearing.

714
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:57,009
Move for reconsideration.

715
00:54:57,029 --> 00:55:02,972
When you move reconsideration, it brings it back to its original state and you do all your stuff all over again.

716
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:06,233
And it's not a different day, so it doesn't have to be re-advertised.

717
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:11,035
It's past the notification time, which was 7 p.m., so we're all set just if we read it.

718
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:12,406
No, he just said no.

719
00:55:12,426 --> 00:55:13,126
You have to have the hand.

720
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,227
You have to go through the whole thing.

721
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:15,727
He has to read the paper.

722
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:18,008
It's advertised for the same night that we're doing the recall.

723
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:20,228
If I did it tomorrow, maybe it would be a different ball game.

724
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:22,609
So we're going to read the paper now.

725
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:24,809
15-089.

726
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:27,390
City of Medford, notice of a public hearing.

727
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:41,153
A public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council and the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George Piazza Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, on Tuesday evening, March 24, 2015, at 7 p.m., on a petition from Wendy's Restaurant for a special permit

728
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:52,857
to amend its hours of operation to operate its drive-thru at 330 Middlesex Avenue, Medford, on said site being located in an Industrial 1 zoning district as follows.

729
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:56,578
Monday to Sunday drive-thru, 11 p.m.

730
00:55:56,658 --> 00:55:57,818
to 3 a.m.

731
00:55:58,418 --> 00:56:03,879
In accordance with the provisions of Section 94-145B of Chapter 94 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Medford,

732
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:11,638
Petition and plan may be seen in the office of the City Clerk, Medford City Hall, Medford, Mass.

733
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:17,603
Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations, aids, and further information.

734
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:19,024
TDT 781-393-2516.

735
00:56:19,364 --> 00:56:25,069
The City of Medford is an EEO AA504 employer.

736
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:33,055
By order of the City Council, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, advertising Medford Mercury,

737
00:56:33,498 --> 00:56:36,240
March 6th and March 16th, 2015.

738
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:48,290
The chair declares this public hearing open and opens the floor to those all in favor to make themselves known before us.

739
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:54,515
All those in favor, please present yourself before the chair and state you're in favor.

740
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,998
Hi, Tony Donato, Boiler Engineer, in favor.

741
00:56:57,598 --> 00:56:58,038
Very good.

742
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,322
Anybody else in favor of this drive-through?

743
00:57:03,722 --> 00:57:05,864
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

744
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:08,346
Thank you, Mr. President.

745
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:09,827
I am in favor of this.

746
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:24,980
If I could please just add, at a time when Medford is seeing businesses fly out of here, with eight open storefronts down here in Medford Square, the amount of hoops I've seen this council put on this man and this business,

747
00:57:25,672 --> 00:57:33,376
is amazing to me, calling for them to add expenditures of an awning, and this, that, and the other thing.

748
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,477
I hope Wendy's doesn't just move across the street.

749
00:57:36,497 --> 00:57:37,558
Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

750
00:57:37,598 --> 00:57:38,478
Thank you, Mr. President.

751
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:38,978
Thank you.

752
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:40,399
Anybody else in favor?

753
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:44,060
Hearing and seeing none, the chair declares this portion of the meeting closed.

754
00:57:44,181 --> 00:57:45,201
Anybody opposed?

755
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:47,922
All those opposed, please present yourself.

756
00:57:48,503 --> 00:57:53,745
Hearing and seeing none, the chair declares this portion of the meeting closed.

757
00:57:54,285 --> 00:57:56,886
Opens up the floor to consideration.

758
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:57,887
Councilor Camuso.

759
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:03,450
I'd like to move approval with the approval of the Chairman of the Zoning Committee.

760
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,511
Zoning Committee Chairman Penta.

761
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:09,753
And I'd like to just put a six-month review.

762
00:58:10,294 --> 00:58:11,014
I apologize.

763
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:14,976
I wish we did this a little earlier, but I do think it's needed.

764
00:58:16,217 --> 00:58:22,360
This is still a residential neighborhood and well-intentioned and well-needed, I think.

765
00:58:22,649 --> 00:58:24,831
Motion for approval with the six-month review.

766
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:25,431
Mr. President.

767
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:26,472
Counselor Penta, please.

768
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:28,354
I forgot your name.

769
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:28,674
What is it?

770
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:29,535
Tony.

771
00:58:29,615 --> 00:58:29,775
Tony?

772
00:58:29,815 --> 00:58:29,975
Yes.

773
00:58:30,275 --> 00:58:30,536
Okay.

774
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:32,317
Why do you want three o'clock?

775
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:38,122
Have you done some kind of analysis that says you're going to make a lot of money up to three o'clock?

776
00:58:38,222 --> 00:58:44,047
Well, the store closes at one right now, and they do have customers that still pull in the driveway, and they just want to service the customers.

777
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:50,853
They don't have a breakfast like a McDonald's or Burger King, so their revenue is totally generated for lunch and dinner.

778
00:58:52,113 --> 00:58:58,357
So, I mean, if the business isn't there, they're not going to be open at 3 a.m.

779
00:58:58,377 --> 00:58:59,397
Let's put it that way.

780
00:58:59,437 --> 00:59:03,199
I mean, if they see the customers come in, they'll stay open.

781
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,181
But, you know, they'll definitely reevaluate it.

782
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:08,483
And if not, they're not going to stay at 3 a.m.

783
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:11,744
if there's no demand for it.

784
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:14,786
One of my concerns, I want to go back to Councilor Marks, and you talked about the neighborhood.

785
00:59:14,806 --> 00:59:17,828
And it's true, in a hot summer's night, air conditioning's in a whole bunch of nine yards.

786
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:22,312
Are you comfortable, John Edwards, are you comfortable with 3 o'clock as compared to 2?

787
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:29,358
I'm just having a hard time with 3 o'clock because... I think the... I mean, there's also other fast food restaurants.

788
00:59:29,378 --> 00:59:33,781
I think the Dunkin' Donuts is open 24 hours right across the street.

789
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:35,903
So, I mean, they're just trying to... Is that in Medford or Malden?

790
00:59:36,904 --> 00:59:37,204
Medford.

791
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:38,605
That's open 24 hours?

792
00:59:39,546 --> 00:59:42,008
The Dunkin' Donuts on the mall?

793
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,593
I just don't know the exact...

794
00:59:50,705 --> 00:59:53,587
I made this 13 of them, I came up with them.

795
00:59:54,427 --> 01:00:00,130
But Burger King, again, Burger King's, I think the one was 24 Hours Burger King, if I'm correct.

796
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:12,916
Wendy's is up to three, but they do have a 24-hour license based on the old Krispy Kreme, because they inherited that.

797
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:16,638
So they wanted to exercise that, they could.

798
01:00:18,996 --> 01:00:24,501
I think it's the fast food environment that changed.

799
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:25,782
We have a three-month review on it.

800
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:29,104
It may likely be just a weekend thing, too, in the end.

801
01:00:29,965 --> 01:00:31,246
The three o'clock is not going to be every night?

802
01:00:31,266 --> 01:00:36,610
Well, it's every night, but as a demand there, like I said, they're going to re-evaluate it, too, if the demand's not there.

803
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,932
But right now, they think the demand's there.

804
01:00:39,172 --> 01:00:45,097
So when we review this thing in six months, it's possible that you may not even be open until three, you may only be open until two or whatever it might be.

805
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:45,337
Correct.

806
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,701
Now, we have motion approval by Councilor Camuso.

807
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:52,903
And this goes with the business, not with the land.

808
01:00:52,923 --> 01:00:53,023
Right.

809
01:00:53,043 --> 01:00:55,724
And this goes with the business, not with the land.

810
01:00:56,385 --> 01:00:56,785
Amended.

811
01:00:58,566 --> 01:00:59,846
All those in favor?

812
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:01,487
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

813
01:01:01,587 --> 01:01:05,209
Roll call vote has been requested for the 3 a.m.

814
01:01:05,549 --> 01:01:13,152
drive-thru, which is tied solely to the Wendy's, and with a six-month review.

815
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:15,474
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

816
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:16,194
Councilor Camuso.

817
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:18,493
Councilor Caviello?

818
01:01:18,814 --> 01:01:18,994
Yes.

819
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:20,355
Councilor Knight?

820
01:01:20,455 --> 01:01:20,615
Yes.

821
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:22,016
Vice-President Lowell-Kern?

822
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:22,256
Yes.

823
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:23,376
Councilor Mox?

824
01:01:23,556 --> 01:01:23,837
Yes.

825
01:01:24,657 --> 01:01:25,317
Councilor Penta?

826
01:01:25,418 --> 01:01:25,618
Yes.

827
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:27,118
President DelaRusso?

828
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:27,459
Yes.

829
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:29,860
Seven in the affirmative, none negative.

830
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:30,921
Motion passes.

831
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:31,801
Congratulations.

832
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:32,301
Thank you.

833
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:33,602
Thank you for your patience.

834
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:38,965
Mr. President, do you mind if I ask in the six-month review, is it something that you internally, or you just contact Wendy's in general?

835
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:40,086
Is it a hearing?

836
01:01:40,106 --> 01:01:42,407
The clerk will contact you and put it on the pen.

837
01:01:44,408 --> 01:01:46,950
For the zoning and the hours, a decision goes out.

838
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,626
15-310 Petition for Outdoor Dining License by Bertucci's.

839
01:02:16,585 --> 01:02:19,427
4054, Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Mass.

840
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:21,348
We hope you've taken notes.

841
01:02:22,129 --> 01:02:31,814
On file, building commissioner's report, board of health, traffic impact report, ADA coordinator petition.

842
01:02:32,795 --> 01:02:34,316
This is before licensing committee.

843
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:41,380
We'll allow our friends from Bertucci's to address the council, and then turn the floor over to Councilor Caviello.

844
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:45,943
Mr. Bertucci, state your name and address for the record, please.

845
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,259
Good evening, my name is Gary Sadler.

846
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:57,707
I'm an architect with Upland Architects representing Pertucci's on their proposed outdoor patio at their location at 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway.

847
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:13,519
Just to give you a brief overview, the proposed project is a roughly 68 by 18 foot wood framed with a composite deck patio.

848
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:24,867
rails, handicap ramp to accommodate 32 seats on the patio.

849
01:03:25,787 --> 01:03:35,272
The patio will be located inside or over an existing landscape bed adjacent to the sidewalk.

850
01:03:36,533 --> 01:03:39,675
The project has been through the various committees.

851
01:03:40,175 --> 01:03:44,697
We did spend a little time with some back and forth with Ms.

852
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,177
McLeod.

853
01:03:46,537 --> 01:03:53,442
on the ADA accessibility items and made some revisions to the plan to accommodate those requirements and requests.

854
01:03:56,805 --> 01:04:04,370
There are plans to open up the existing side wall to accommodate wider door openings.

855
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:11,175
The patio will be staffed full time by a wait staff.

856
01:04:13,076 --> 01:04:13,777
Tonight I have

857
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:21,480
John Sullivan of Bertucci's, who can address any operational issues that, or questions that you might have.

858
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:24,841
Thank you.

859
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:25,601
Councilor Caravaglio.

860
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:27,362
Thank you, Mr. President.

861
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:29,663
I reviewed the papers and find them in order.

862
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:31,344
I just have one question.

863
01:04:31,384 --> 01:04:33,725
What are your hours of the outdoor dining going to be?

864
01:04:43,072 --> 01:04:48,076
My only concern would be if you'd stop the outdoor seating 30 minutes prior to closing.

865
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:54,081
That would be my only concern, so we wouldn't have people lingering out there all night.

866
01:04:54,201 --> 01:04:55,082
Sounds like we could do that.

867
01:05:01,727 --> 01:05:02,027
All set?

868
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:03,328
All set, Mr. President.

869
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:04,429
Quick question.

870
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:05,810
Chairman Penta, please.

871
01:05:06,851 --> 01:05:09,894
You have a note here from Diane as it relates to everything looking good,

872
01:05:10,692 --> 01:05:13,796
One of your entrances having two feet, three inches, has that been corrected?

873
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:20,744
Yes, yeah, if there was, yeah, we've right now, that has been corrected.

874
01:05:20,765 --> 01:05:21,686
It has to be three feet.

875
01:05:21,946 --> 01:05:22,346
Exactly.

876
01:05:22,366 --> 01:05:23,928
We're actually showing four feet.

877
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:24,849
Okay.

878
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:29,315
For, which is compliant with the access standards of Massachusetts.

879
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:38,375
In the two doors, the two new doors that will open up to the patio are actually 10 foot wide each, 10 foot plus.

880
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:41,817
They're a folding door system.

881
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:48,502
So anything that we may have originally presented, that got resolved in the back and forth with the ADA coordinator.

882
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,584
She makes something here, which I've never seen before.

883
01:05:51,624 --> 01:05:55,347
It says, do you have people who will seat them, or will they seat themselves?

884
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:57,508
And do you have an accessible seating policy?

885
01:05:57,568 --> 01:05:58,249
Is that something new?

886
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,431
I've never heard of it.

887
01:06:01,451 --> 01:06:03,492
That's new to me, a seating policy.

888
01:06:03,512 --> 01:06:09,414
I can tell you that Bertucci's has a hostess, a full-time hostess that does seat their guests.

889
01:06:09,434 --> 01:06:11,635
But will the person seat these people in this area?

890
01:06:11,655 --> 01:06:12,075
Oh, absolutely.

891
01:06:12,295 --> 01:06:12,895
Yes, yes.

892
01:06:13,276 --> 01:06:13,776
Yes, they will.

893
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:17,737
I've just never seen that before.

894
01:06:19,138 --> 01:06:23,660
I haven't heard of a seating policy, but

895
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:34,248
It may be in situations where it's a seat yourself type of establishment, where a patron in a wheelchair may not know where the accessible seating is.

896
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:35,329
That would be my guess.

897
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:36,950
Okay.

898
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,071
Move approval, Mr. President.

899
01:06:38,492 --> 01:06:43,776
On the motion for approval by Councilor Penta, Councilor, Vice President Lango-Curran.

900
01:06:44,397 --> 01:06:46,819
I think Councilor Knight has a good question.

901
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:51,103
I don't know if he got it answered, but I was under the impression that just the

902
01:06:53,769 --> 01:07:01,456
4, 8, 12, 16, 24 seats was what we were discussing, and the section to the right was an indoor section.

903
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:02,717
Can you explain?

904
01:07:02,737 --> 01:07:08,582
So is there a bar outside and high top tables?

905
01:07:11,885 --> 01:07:16,529
Sir, would you please state your name and address for the record and address the councillors from the podium, please?

906
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,951
John Sullivan, I'm the general manager of the location.

907
01:07:21,193 --> 01:07:23,195
So that, what you're looking at is the whole deck.

908
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:29,881
The L shape that you're looking at is pretty much like a couch with two seats there and a table.

909
01:07:30,702 --> 01:07:35,466
And then going towards your left would be the other seating.

910
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:42,453
The long stretch in front of the four diamonds that you see is a handicap ramp that'll go down.

911
01:07:42,513 --> 01:07:44,254
It's over 30 feet in length.

912
01:07:45,155 --> 01:07:46,817
And if you look at, what you're looking at,

913
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:54,540
Let's say in between the two diamonds to your right, you'll see a three, that's a host stand.

914
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,542
And to the left and right of that are two sliding glass doors that are five feet by five feet.

915
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:08,666
And if you're looking at Bertucci's from Mystic Valley Parkway, will this deck be on the right side?

916
01:08:08,746 --> 01:08:10,167
If you're looking at the front of the building?

917
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:10,747
Yep.

918
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:14,489
It's the left-hand side where the courthouse is, the parking lot.

919
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:16,110
Oh, where the parking lot is, where your parking lot is.

920
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,470
Right, exactly.

921
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:19,028
Correct.

922
01:08:20,368 --> 01:08:24,589
So there'll be two handicap entrances, one for the deck and also there's one going in the main building.

923
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:27,670
This is going to have 32 seats?

924
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:28,750
Yes.

925
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:33,031
30 minutes prior to closing.

926
01:08:33,091 --> 01:08:38,433
Can you explain the type of seating that would be, like with Wendy's we had stationary

927
01:08:48,163 --> 01:08:49,826
...that were going to be bolted down.

928
01:08:49,846 --> 01:08:53,473
What type of tables and chairs are going to be used?

929
01:08:55,373 --> 01:08:56,554
Nothing will be bolted down.

930
01:08:56,975 --> 01:08:58,796
It's movable furniture.

931
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:05,142
So the tables to the left of the plan are what they call flex seating.

932
01:09:05,602 --> 01:09:07,484
So those are movable.

933
01:09:07,704 --> 01:09:12,368
If Bertucci's needed to accommodate a party of eight, they could slide the tables together.

934
01:09:12,388 --> 01:09:15,271
So those are flexible in terms of their layout.

935
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:22,277
The diamonds that have the number two in it, those are what are considered high top that really adjust for

936
01:09:23,525 --> 01:09:29,046
guest to come in and stand at those tables, maybe if they're waiting for a seat inside for dining.

937
01:09:29,606 --> 01:09:45,049
The seating over on the right, as John mentioned, is more lounge-type seating, cushion-type seating, or outdoor couch with a little table to set your drink or food at.

938
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:49,510
And then at the end of the night, what will happen to all the seating?

939
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:52,355
Remain there, is it gonna be fenced in?

940
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,896
You said it's a wooden fence?

941
01:09:54,596 --> 01:09:56,836
It is surrounded with rail.

942
01:09:56,996 --> 01:10:01,297
It's not segregated, it's not closed off.

943
01:10:01,317 --> 01:10:04,858
In other words, there's no gate at the end of the ramp to segregate the rest of the area.

944
01:10:04,898 --> 01:10:12,220
But the intent is, maybe with the exception of umbrellas, if there are umbrellas, the seating stays on the deck.

945
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,680
Last question, any video cameras?

946
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,221
Are you gonna have any type of props?

947
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:21,959
Thank you.

948
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,182
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

949
01:10:26,442 --> 01:10:29,584
Councilor Marks is waiting next, then Councilor Camuso.

950
01:10:31,465 --> 01:10:36,328
The parking that currently exists, will that still exist in front of the building?

951
01:10:36,568 --> 01:10:36,748
Yes.

952
01:10:36,848 --> 01:10:41,871
So we're not replacing any handicapped spots or anything else that's in front of the building?

953
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:42,971
Correct.

954
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:46,393
No changes are proposed or required to the parking.

955
01:10:47,214 --> 01:10:50,196
So the width of this patio that you're talking,

956
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:56,179
It appears to be at least, what, 11, 12 feet?

957
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:57,999
It's about 18 feet.

958
01:10:58,019 --> 01:10:58,240
18 feet?

959
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:58,900
Wide, yes.

960
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,221
That's from the building to the edge of the ramp.

961
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:06,303
And that falls within the landscape bed that's there existing.

962
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:10,664
And just outside of that is the sidewalk, the public sidewalk.

963
01:11:11,705 --> 01:11:20,488
So there is, at the end of that ramp, we're proposing to connect or pour a concrete pad at the end of that ramp and connect it with the sidewalk.

964
01:11:22,052 --> 01:11:27,595
Okay, and are you going to focus people that don't want to use the outside area to a particular entrance?

965
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:41,763
The way operationally it would work is patrons come into the restaurant through the main entrance, set up with the hostess, and then the hostess would bring them to the outdoor dining.

966
01:11:41,824 --> 01:11:45,286
But currently you have two accesses now to get into your main entrance, right?

967
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:46,566
Right, that's true.

968
01:11:46,626 --> 01:11:49,448
So are we doing away with one of the accesses and you're only going to have

969
01:11:50,624 --> 01:11:52,446
So you are going to have multiple accesses then?

970
01:11:52,746 --> 01:11:56,290
You're going to have the main two entrances that you're talking about now with my foyer.

971
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,690
Right.

972
01:11:57,351 --> 01:11:59,193
So they're going to come in that way, meet the hostess.

973
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:02,316
We just opened up a new bar lounge in August.

974
01:12:03,096 --> 01:12:10,324
So to get out to the deck, they're going to have to go through the bar lounge to go through the two doors, sliding glass doors that we're doing there.

975
01:12:10,524 --> 01:12:13,987
So there's not going to be any access for them to walk up the ramp to get to the...

976
01:12:14,928 --> 01:12:15,469
Thank you.

977
01:12:15,549 --> 01:12:16,409
All set, councillor?

978
01:12:16,429 --> 01:12:16,550
Yes.

979
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:17,710
Councillor Camuso.

980
01:12:41,547 --> 01:12:41,907
Thank you.

981
01:12:42,668 --> 01:12:46,710
I certainly see this as a whole different animal than the previous petitioner that was up here.

982
01:12:47,171 --> 01:12:50,833
This is a restaurant that you actually have to wait in line, get a seat.

983
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:54,216
You have to show proper identification if you're going to have an alcoholic beverage.

984
01:12:54,696 --> 01:12:56,317
So I am totally in support of this.

985
01:12:56,377 --> 01:13:05,563
We already have establishments like Margarita's and many others throughout the community that have similar seating arrangements.

986
01:13:05,843 --> 01:13:09,306
Pizza Regina among Joe's American Bar and Grill.

987
01:13:10,294 --> 01:13:13,415
So not your average Joe's, not Joe's American Bar.

988
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:17,116
But with that being said, Mr. President, I do support this.

989
01:13:17,536 --> 01:13:31,479
I just want to make sure that you realize my understanding is you have to go get an extension of your liquor license now if you're going to serve alcoholic beverages on the outside extension.

990
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:36,760
Other restaurants in our community have had to do that when they set up patios and things like that.

991
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:43,482
So you want to make sure that everything's in order for insurance purposes, as well as liability with the city and everything else.

992
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:52,584
So I'm not 150% sure on that, but I know another restaurant had to do it, I'm being told by one of my council colleagues.

993
01:13:53,004 --> 01:13:55,745
So I think we have to be very cognizant of that.

994
01:13:56,405 --> 01:13:59,746
So I second the approval, if it hasn't been done yet.

995
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:01,967
And then one question to the clerk.

996
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:04,948
I know there's been some confusion

997
01:14:06,785 --> 01:14:15,930
based upon outdoor seating ordinance that this city council worked diligently upon that was put into effect maybe two or three fiscal years ago.

998
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:23,473
We really didn't delineate in that ordinance whether it was public property or private property.

999
01:14:24,114 --> 01:14:32,538
So in the past, restaurants like Petucci's wouldn't even necessarily have to come in front of the council for outdoor seating because it was their own property and they owned it.

1000
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:36,759
I have pizza Regina and some of the others that I just mentioned.

1001
01:14:37,420 --> 01:15:00,895
So I think we have to go back and revisit the ordinance because I was under the impression at the time it was strictly to protect the city's interests as far as slip and falls on sidewalks when people had the small little chairs out there in front of restaurants like Bocelli's restaurants like muffin shop and several others up on the hillside the Danish pastry house.

1002
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:07,211
I think the ordinance was more geared towards that, making sure there was a bond in place and that the city is protected.

1003
01:15:08,052 --> 01:15:09,233
But this is a whole different animal.

1004
01:15:09,613 --> 01:15:19,039
So I think we should send this maybe to a licensing subcommittee to look at with the city solicitor if we want to update the ordinance where it comes to private property.

1005
01:15:19,379 --> 01:15:27,525
Because like I said, quite honestly, these are the first two vendors we've seen, as long as I can remember, looking for outdoor seating on property that they currently own.

1006
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:31,207
And the other thing is too, we want to make sure we have a mechanism in place

1007
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,062
that we don't get challenged.

1008
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:43,004
They're here under their own will this evening saying, we're here to apply for this because the building commissioner turned around and said, you need it, or the code enforcement officer said you need it.

1009
01:15:43,584 --> 01:15:46,064
But that's his interpretation of the law.

1010
01:15:46,384 --> 01:15:50,645
There's really nothing in the law that states that they need to be here this evening.

1011
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:51,865
There's an ordinance.

1012
01:15:52,285 --> 01:16:01,587
The ordinance is for, this doesn't delineate, excuse me, it doesn't decipher whether it's public property or private property.

1013
01:16:02,936 --> 01:16:08,941
So this is where, this is the first time, like I said, that you look at the other restaurants that have this currently within our community.

1014
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:11,603
They never had to come before the city council for outdoor seating.

1015
01:16:13,084 --> 01:16:14,365
So there could be a challenge.

1016
01:16:14,405 --> 01:16:19,148
And like I said, they're just doing what the building department has told them to come forward because it was denied.

1017
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:31,678
But quite honestly, if you get a vendor that's right in the middle of a neighborhood, that knows they're not gonna get the support of the council because it's in the middle of a neighborhood, they may say, hey, we're gonna take it to Superior Court

1018
01:16:32,096 --> 01:16:32,897
And we're going to challenge it.

1019
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:36,119
There's nothing in writing that says private property, you can't have outdoor seating.

1020
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:46,926
So if we could at least send the question to the city solicitor on the alcohol and the extension of the license, as well as private property and outdoor seating.

1021
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:56,853
Because if you look at that ordinance, it was drafted for, there were certain little restaurants on Main Street, High Street, Riverside Ave that were looking for that.

1022
01:16:57,226 --> 01:16:58,026
Right.

1023
01:16:58,086 --> 01:17:04,688
If I remember, Dr. Rose had some concerns regarding public health in that ordinance too.

1024
01:17:05,368 --> 01:17:05,868
Exactly.

1025
01:17:06,508 --> 01:17:17,510
So if we could just get a thing, but I support this wholeheartedly, but I just don't want to be challenged at some point if a restaurant opens up, you know, directly abutting a neighborhood.

1026
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:26,352
Directly abutting a neighborhood and then next thing you know, we're in superior court with our city solicitor because there's really no legal mechanism to

1027
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,560
to fall back on.

1028
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:29,940
Thank you.

1029
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:37,062
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, seconded by Councilor Camuso, and amended, Councilor Knight.

1030
01:17:37,762 --> 01:17:44,763
I was wondering if the petitioners could tell me if they plan on having any music, televisions, entertainment, or anything like that out on the deck.

1031
01:17:47,143 --> 01:17:48,544
Not currently.

1032
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:49,044
Okay.

1033
01:17:50,604 --> 01:17:50,984
Okay, great.

1034
01:17:51,984 --> 01:17:52,304
Very good.

1035
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:53,305
Move for approval, Mr. President.

1036
01:17:53,745 --> 01:17:54,325
On the motion.

1037
01:17:54,805 --> 01:17:55,605
All those in favor?

1038
01:17:55,945 --> 01:17:57,526
Did that include the questions to the solicitor?

1039
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:00,006
That includes the amended questions.

1040
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:06,029
In general, not just to them, but the answer for all the businesses.

1041
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:09,470
We want to make sure there's consistency.

1042
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:13,831
Private and public application.

1043
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:15,872
Thank you for your guidance on this.

1044
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:17,493
All those in favor?

1045
01:18:17,513 --> 01:18:18,293
Aye.

1046
01:18:18,373 --> 01:18:19,113
All those opposed?

1047
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:21,314
Congratulations.

1048
01:18:21,394 --> 01:18:21,994
Motion carries.

1049
01:18:22,415 --> 01:18:22,635
Thank you.

1050
01:18:22,655 --> 01:18:23,175
Thank you very much.

1051
01:18:23,195 --> 01:18:23,475
Thank you.

1052
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,661
Good luck.

1053
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,141
Two little items to report out of committees.

1054
01:18:35,581 --> 01:18:43,143
14704, Subcommittee on Rules Meeting Report, March 18, 2015, Council Meeting DVD, etc.

1055
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:49,024
Maybe Councilor Knight will want to share with us the report out, Chairman of the Rules Committee.

1056
01:18:49,484 --> 01:18:50,844
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1057
01:18:51,424 --> 01:18:54,345
Wednesday the 18th we had a Rules Committee meeting at 4.30 p.m.

1058
01:18:54,365 --> 01:18:54,625
in Room 207.

1059
01:18:56,057 --> 01:18:57,818
to discuss papers in committee.

1060
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:05,741
One of the papers that was in committee was for the council to review the cost of a copy of a meeting of the Memphis City Council.

1061
01:19:06,401 --> 01:19:20,887
Presently, there was a policy put in place where the cost of a copy of a tape was $20, and that $20 was based upon the time when it took somebody however long the meeting was to sit there in front of a VCR and actually copy it on VHS, Mr. President.

1062
01:19:21,597 --> 01:19:36,979
Under the deliberations in the subcommittee meeting, we reported out favorably a recommendation that the council meetings from zero to six months be $5 for a copy, and council meetings for anything over six months be $10 for a copy.

1063
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:46,358
We've also discussed, Mr. President, the council's ongoing position of support in putting the council meetings on the city's website.

1064
01:19:46,718 --> 01:19:52,181
So those are the two items that were submitted, discussed in committee, that were reported out favorably, Mr. President.

1065
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:55,803
So on the motion of Councilor Knight to report this out favorably, Councilor Panta.

1066
01:19:56,063 --> 01:20:03,267
Real quick, I'd like to just insert one question, where you have five dollars, it should be for a citizen copy.

1067
01:20:04,948 --> 01:20:07,750
Okay, so that way you're there because governmental agencies

1068
01:20:08,194 --> 01:20:09,935
would be entitled to it anyway.

1069
01:20:10,215 --> 01:20:10,455
Right.

1070
01:20:10,475 --> 01:20:12,716
Yeah, we're not creating a new policy council.

1071
01:20:12,756 --> 01:20:15,417
What we're doing is just changing the fee schedule for the existing.

1072
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:17,857
And just put the word citizen in front of the word copy.

1073
01:20:18,037 --> 01:20:19,078
No, I got no problem with that.

1074
01:20:19,618 --> 01:20:22,399
So as amended by recommendation of Councilor Penta.

1075
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:23,940
So all those in favor?

1076
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,480
Aye.

1077
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,540
All those opposed?

1078
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,601
So carries the motion.

1079
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:33,383
Secondly, we have a report out

1080
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:42,285
15294, Committee of the Whole meeting report from March 18, 2015 on substance abuse.

1081
01:20:43,226 --> 01:20:49,431
We had a very fruitful and helpful Committee of the Whole meeting last Wednesday evening here in the chambers.

1082
01:20:50,372 --> 01:20:57,599
Attendees included all the members of the city council, as well as Karen Rose, Director of Public Health,

1083
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:22,169
Fire Chief Giliberti, Police Chief Sacco, leaders of Team Medford, Penny and Brooke, representatives of the health departments of Medford school systems, as well as many others, including Cheryl D'Alefano and Aaron DiBenedetto.

1084
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:33,804
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the problem of opiate addiction in the community and as well as an ordinance for a substance abuse coordinator.

1085
01:21:34,284 --> 01:21:41,828
So the recommendations that came out of the committee were the resolution originally proposed by Councillor Camuso was ratified.

1086
01:21:42,228 --> 01:21:51,173
So be it resolved that the city solicitor draft an ordinance for the City of Medford to hire a part-time substance abuse prevention coordinator working a minimum of 24 hours per week.

1087
01:21:52,279 --> 01:22:01,543
The substance abuse coordinator shall report to the Board of Health Director and be responsible for developing and administering a unified substance abuse prevention program in Medford.

1088
01:22:01,943 --> 01:22:10,347
The focus shall be on prevention, intervention services, health policy development, community outreach and other functions to meet the needs of the community.

1089
01:22:10,807 --> 01:22:18,291
The coordinator shall also work with the local health care providers to gather and disseminate information

1090
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:25,886
on available substance abuse treatment services and resources in the local area.

1091
01:22:26,446 --> 01:22:32,570
The coordinator shall have a master's degree and be a certified addiction counselor with three to five years' experience in counseling services.

1092
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:41,235
Two, the Medford City Council goes on record in support of the implementation of NARCAM within the Fire and Police Department.

1093
01:22:41,635 --> 01:22:49,720
Three, the city utilize the reverse 911 system to inform the citizens of the substance abuse problems

1094
01:22:50,180 --> 01:23:00,083
and the resources that are available to them, and four, that Team Medford investigate other communities on what they are doing to address the substance abuse problems.

1095
01:23:00,443 --> 01:23:04,844
Upon a motion of Councilor Knight, that the meeting report be referred out of committee.

1096
01:23:05,324 --> 01:23:06,824
It passed that evening.

1097
01:23:07,805 --> 01:23:08,885
Councilor Longo-Curran.

1098
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:10,606
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1099
01:23:10,626 --> 01:23:11,086
Madam Vice President.

1100
01:23:11,106 --> 01:23:19,628
If we could just also add to this, I know that I had asked the Health Department, Karen Rose, and Team Medford to draft

1101
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:27,901
correspondence to the City Council with regards to what they think is needed from a substance abuse coordinator.

1102
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:34,003
I know they have a number of grants coming in and out of the work they do, and I know they are working on a number of things.

1103
01:23:34,263 --> 01:23:40,264
So what in addition to what they're already working on do we need to expand on with regards to that position?

1104
01:23:40,284 --> 01:23:42,464
The role of that position, yes.

1105
01:23:43,005 --> 01:23:43,645
If we could add that.

1106
01:23:44,745 --> 01:23:45,725
Mr. Clerk has that.

1107
01:23:47,085 --> 01:23:47,806
Anything else, ma'am?

1108
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:49,106
That's it, thank you.

1109
01:23:49,346 --> 01:23:49,626
Thank you.

1110
01:23:51,825 --> 01:24:08,372
I know that this committee of the whole meeting was the first of many discussions that we are going to have relative to the issue of opiate abuse here in the city of Medford.

1111
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:11,734
I think we've made great strides and this is certainly a good start.

1112
01:24:15,385 --> 01:24:23,349
At the close of the Committee of the Whole meeting on the 18th, we also voted that we would meet again in a period not to exceed 30 days.

1113
01:24:23,769 --> 01:24:44,500
And I had wondered, Mr. President, if you could also indicate that the committee report ought to indicate that we will reconvene in Committee of the Whole to continue our discussion on this matter in a period of no more than 30 days from the conclusion of the last meeting.

1114
01:24:46,142 --> 01:24:46,642
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1115
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:47,042
Thank you.

1116
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:48,023
Councillor Camuso.

1117
01:24:48,403 --> 01:24:55,365
If the entire council will be amenable to, we started the process of drafting an ordinance for the part-time position.

1118
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:59,366
The mayor recently said he was going to actually make it a full-time department head.

1119
01:24:59,987 --> 01:25:15,372
If we could amend it from the floor this evening for the word part-time put full-time, and that's just because the mayor actually said that at a recent event, and asked the city solicitor to start drafting the ordinance that this city council put forward.

1120
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:19,809
Because right now, there's nothing, no mechanism in place to actually make that happen.

1121
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:44,115
So... So, to amend that to be a full-time position... Based on what the mayor said, a full-time position in the ordinance, and at this point, too, I mean, we can even strike out some of the language with the qualifications and all that, because that's going to be up to the personnel director, but at least get the ordinance going, because it was initiated here at the city council via a resolution recently.

1122
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:44,635
So...

1123
01:25:46,173 --> 01:25:53,795
And as we know, the city council, our job is the budget, it's to create ordinances, is our two biggest functions.

1124
01:25:54,175 --> 01:26:00,756
So if we could amend the word part-time to full-time, and that's based upon the mayor recently saying that he has the funds available somewhere to do this.

1125
01:26:01,477 --> 01:26:03,737
And to send this to the city solicitor.

1126
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:07,038
To send it to the city solicitor though, to start the ordinance drafted.

1127
01:26:07,098 --> 01:26:10,379
Because up until now, there's no mechanism in place to put this.

1128
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:15,620
So when the mayor comes up with the money, at least the city council got an ordinance in place to fall back on.

1129
01:26:17,186 --> 01:26:18,026
Very good, councillor.

1130
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:21,088
And can we get a roll call vote on sending that as well?

1131
01:26:21,628 --> 01:26:21,889
Yes.

1132
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:25,311
Because this city council has been very unanimous throughout this whole process.

1133
01:26:25,891 --> 01:26:34,035
And it's glad to see that there's some working relationship with the mayor's office on this very important position.

1134
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:40,379
Doesn't matter where it was initiated, as long as it's coming to fruition, because it's much needed in our community.

1135
01:26:40,519 --> 01:26:42,800
And you can tell that by the turnout the other evening.

1136
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:44,861
Thank you, councillor.

1137
01:26:45,402 --> 01:26:45,902
Councillor Knight.

1138
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,851
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1139
01:26:47,891 --> 01:26:56,274
And Councilor Camuso, I think that that's a great act and a great approach to take in terms of shaping this ordinance to something that's going to work here for the city of Medford.

1140
01:26:57,014 --> 01:27:06,377
In reviewing the language and looking at the language, it says, be it resolved that the city solicit a draft an ordinance for Medford to hire a part-time substance abuse prevention coordinator working a minimum of 24 hours a week.

1141
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:11,559
I think we don't even need to put in the part-time, full-time, or anything else.

1142
01:27:11,619 --> 01:27:14,960
I think what we really need to do is take a look at saying a substance abuse prevention coordinator

1143
01:27:15,374 --> 01:27:18,617
koordinator working no less than 40 hours a week.

1144
01:27:19,277 --> 01:27:25,183
If in fact we wanted to be a full-time position, someone that's going to actually be here and there, it's going to be outlined.

1145
01:27:25,263 --> 01:27:30,848
It's going to be framed right there in the ordinance that their hours of work or what's expected of them is that they put in 40 hours.

1146
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:38,034
Full-time, part-time, I think that those are items that would have to be defined early on in the ordinance as we start moving along.

1147
01:27:39,418 --> 01:27:52,806
I think we can all agree that, you know, people work a 40-hour work week, so if we wanted a full-time position, we could just put in there they work no less than 40 hours, and that might be, you know, some cleaner language in terms of what it is we want to accomplish.

1148
01:27:53,046 --> 01:27:57,709
And, Mr. President, if I may just... So it's amended by Councilor Knight to be a 40-hour work week?

1149
01:27:57,749 --> 01:27:59,270
Again, that's for discussion, Mr. President.

1150
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:00,591
I don't want to go amend the resolution.

1151
01:28:00,631 --> 01:28:07,435
Councilor Camuso has put a number of hours and time and effort into this, so, you know, I don't want to do anything contrary to what his efforts are.

1152
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,504
However, that would be a suggestion that I would make at this point in time.

1153
01:28:10,544 --> 01:28:25,896
Mr. President, the original intent of the ordinance was to have remedial action taken sooner than later, and we started with the part-time, and like I said, it was unanimously supported by this council.

1154
01:28:26,277 --> 01:28:30,440
The mayor came out at a later date saying he's willing to do full-time, but as of right now,

1155
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:40,634
Besides the press conference and besides this council going on record in support of it, there's no mechanism in place to put the person in a job with the proper personnel classification.

1156
01:28:41,194 --> 01:28:48,597
So as Councilor Knight stated, we're still going to have to assign a classification to it as we see CAF1, ME02, ME03.

1157
01:28:50,198 --> 01:28:55,421
So it's our job as city councilors to initiate and approve or deny ordinances.

1158
01:28:55,841 --> 01:28:59,503
So this city council has taken the ball, and we're running with it.

1159
01:29:00,064 --> 01:29:07,248
And I'm glad to see the mayor agrees with us that it is needed, and he went as far as to say a full-time position.

1160
01:29:07,288 --> 01:29:08,348
So for that, I am thankful.

1161
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:09,829
Thank you, Councilor.

1162
01:29:10,069 --> 01:29:10,990
Councilor Knight, you're all set?

1163
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:11,770
I am, thank you.

1164
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:12,491
Councilor Penta?

1165
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:13,891
No, I'm all set.

1166
01:29:13,951 --> 01:29:14,932
Councilor Penta is all set.

1167
01:29:15,423 --> 01:29:19,884
So, on the motion of approval, as amended, a roll call vote has been requested.

1168
01:29:20,484 --> 01:29:22,364
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1169
01:29:25,885 --> 01:29:26,125
Yes.

1170
01:29:27,485 --> 01:29:27,705
Yes.

1171
01:29:30,086 --> 01:29:30,406
Yes.

1172
01:29:35,307 --> 01:29:37,247
He has an old roll paper in there.

1173
01:29:40,268 --> 01:29:42,708
They still have President Emeritus Miyako on them.

1174
01:29:45,356 --> 01:29:46,897
The clerk will start anew.

1175
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:47,897
Yes.

1176
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:55,520
Yes.

1177
01:29:56,861 --> 01:29:57,101
Yes.

1178
01:30:00,643 --> 01:30:01,503
Councilor Knight.

1179
01:30:02,944 --> 01:30:03,664
Knight is yes.

1180
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:13,748
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none negative.

1181
01:30:14,508 --> 01:30:15,428
The motion passes.

1182
01:30:17,969 --> 01:30:22,169
On the motion of Vice President Langel-Kern to revert back to the regular order of business.

1183
01:30:22,229 --> 01:30:22,970
All those in favor?

1184
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,310
All those opposed?

1185
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:28,391
We are back.

1186
01:30:28,411 --> 01:30:32,171
14, 15-303 offered by Vice President Langel-Kern.

1187
01:30:32,532 --> 01:30:39,213
Be it resolved that the city of Medford take part in honoring those who have been affected by autism by taking part in

1188
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:42,163
light it up blue on April 2nd.

1189
01:30:42,843 --> 01:30:50,588
Autism Speaks is asking people to wear the color blue and asking homeowners, et cetera, to put up a blue light.

1190
01:30:51,169 --> 01:31:00,175
Be it further resolved that the city of Medford use a spotlight and shine it on City Hall the evening and night of April 2nd.

1191
01:31:01,096 --> 01:31:02,136
Madam Vice President.

1192
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:06,139
Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

1193
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,841
I'm sure we've all got

1194
01:31:09,177 --> 01:31:23,062
two to three emails, if not more, from people who are in favor of, you know, working hard for Autism Speaks, and they are lighting the city, the town, hopefully the nation up blue on April 2nd.

1195
01:31:23,482 --> 01:31:38,668
It's something that they're asking residents, communities, cities, towns across the nation to take part and light it up blue, whether you wear the color blue or put a, you know, your spotlight outside of your house, put a blue bulb in,

1196
01:31:39,531 --> 01:31:50,101
I was hoping that we, I'm sure that the city has a spotlight somewhere and that we could use that, purchase a blue bulb and shine it on City Hall on April 2nd.

1197
01:31:50,821 --> 01:31:57,888
That's something that we could do with a number of different organizations if we do have a spotlight available.

1198
01:31:58,929 --> 01:32:01,651
It's something maybe we could ask the vocational school to help us out with.

1199
01:32:02,011 --> 01:32:05,835
They light up City Hall like a Christmas tree during Christmas time.

1200
01:32:07,175 --> 01:32:11,338
I know childhood cancer has a day where they go gold.

1201
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:15,320
The Zaken Bridge is lit up in gold, so maybe we could take part in that.

1202
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,243
There's also, you know, Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Pancreatic Cancer Awareness.

1203
01:32:19,823 --> 01:32:25,166
So I would hope that maybe that is something we can do to show our support for different organizations on different days.

1204
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:34,832
And the first one being autism, which affects many young children, I guess those of all ages, and something that should be recognized.

1205
01:32:36,174 --> 01:32:37,314
One in twenty children today?

1206
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:46,636
I'm not sure of the statistics, but I know it's a great deal of children and this is something that would be great for the community.

1207
01:32:48,057 --> 01:32:48,397
Thank you.

1208
01:32:48,417 --> 01:32:53,898
So on the motion of Vice President Longo Kern for approval, all those in favor?

1209
01:32:54,178 --> 01:32:54,598
Roll call.

1210
01:32:55,038 --> 01:32:57,699
A roll call vote has been requested by the Vice President.

1211
01:32:59,139 --> 01:33:01,820
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1212
01:33:11,197 --> 01:33:11,437
Yes.

1213
01:33:15,819 --> 01:33:16,139
Yes.

1214
01:33:16,339 --> 01:33:17,999
Seven in the affirmative, none negative.

1215
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:22,381
The motion passes.

1216
01:33:22,401 --> 01:33:25,862
15-304 offered by Vice President Langel-Kern.

1217
01:33:26,462 --> 01:33:36,646
Be it resolved that the City Council thank Maria Daniels for her hard work with the Medford Arts Council and congratulate her for receiving the Leadership Circle Award

1218
01:33:37,087 --> 01:33:39,168
from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

1219
01:33:39,868 --> 01:33:44,210
Be it further resolved that an accommodation be drafted to present to Ms.

1220
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:49,513
Daniels on April 26 during the reception at the Royal House.

1221
01:33:50,433 --> 01:33:51,233
Madam Vice President.

1222
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:52,414
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1223
01:33:53,134 --> 01:33:53,314
Ms.

1224
01:33:53,334 --> 01:34:01,618
Maria Daniels is getting recognized with the Leadership Circle Award from the Massachusetts Cultural Council, which I think is a huge honor.

1225
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:23,674
and the council has been invited along with the rest of the community to the Royal House on April 26th, and I would ask the city clerk to draft an accommodation from the council to hand deliver to Maria Daniels on that day in recognition of how thankful we are for all the work she does with the arts in this community.

1226
01:34:24,094 --> 01:34:26,575
You've seen her before the council answering questions,

1227
01:34:28,784 --> 01:34:33,547
You also see her at almost every event that has to do with cachet and the arts.

1228
01:34:33,627 --> 01:34:37,630
So she does a lot of work for this community, and I want to thank her for that.

1229
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:39,711
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1230
01:34:39,731 --> 01:34:43,333
So on the motion of approval by Vice President Lugo-Kern, all those in favor?

1231
01:34:43,353 --> 01:34:43,753
Aye.

1232
01:34:44,134 --> 01:34:44,914
All those opposed?

1233
01:34:45,314 --> 01:34:46,135
The motion passes.

1234
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:54,091
15-306 offered by Councillor Penta.

1235
01:34:54,712 --> 01:35:09,638
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record advising the Mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to sign a new 10-year agreement with Comcast to be effective as of April 20th, since in fact,

1236
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:22,470
It serves no betterment for Comcast subscribers who are now being offered new competitive technologies by new methods at competitive rates by other state-of-the-art vendors.

1237
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:23,731
Counselor Penta.

1238
01:35:24,091 --> 01:35:39,281
Mr. President, after I put this resolution on board, if anybody saw it, Apple, the Apple industry, Apple Computer Company, came out with their newest and latest of technologies for which they even allege it will be a challenge to Comcast customers.

1239
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:52,695
as it relates to not only their streaming, but also as it relates to the technology of being able to get that for which Comcast is offering its subscribers, as well as other internet providers.

1240
01:35:53,275 --> 01:36:04,100
Also, Mr. President, unfortunately or fortunately, however you want to look at it, we got this letter dated December 18th that was delivered by UPS to this building over here.

1241
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:08,842
Unfortunately, it wasn't timestamped, so whoever had it and sat on it,

1242
01:36:09,637 --> 01:36:21,962
and didn't relay it to the council as they should have, or to the city clerk's office as they should have, it just really presents a big issue because the 10 years is just about expiring, which is right around the corner.

1243
01:36:22,782 --> 01:36:33,426
There's been no talk of having a public hearing, for which the mayor apparently is refusing to have because you're less than a month away, a little bit more than a month away to do this advertising.

1244
01:36:34,367 --> 01:36:37,448
Also, there's an obligation, I believe under the contract,

1245
01:36:38,617 --> 01:36:57,787
Even according to the folks from Xfinity, which is Mr. Kelly, and he writes in his letter of December 18th, that we didn't get until just last week, that the city has an obligation under the formal renewal process to either accept or deny Comcast's proposal within four months, or no later than April 18th.

1246
01:36:58,267 --> 01:37:03,310
And this was hand-delivered by UPS on December 18th, and we received it last week.

1247
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:07,352
Taking that into consideration, and now seeing what's out there,

1248
01:37:08,314 --> 01:37:11,315
We know what's happened with 10-year contracts here in the city.

1249
01:37:11,736 --> 01:37:13,796
The first one is the rubbish contract for 10 years.

1250
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:23,881
The latest one is the outrageous kiosks that are operating here in the city of Meffitt, causing all kinds of problems, not only to our residents, but also to the small business people in this community.

1251
01:37:24,421 --> 01:37:33,865
And now the mayor wants to saddle us again with another 10-year contract, and this time giving absolutely no public access for the purposes of information.

1252
01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:36,966
The unfortunate part about all of this, Mr. President,

1253
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:59,074
The technologies are so far advanced out there that if you traverse yourself out to the states of California and in that particular territory, those folks that had even public access on the peg stations are now moving to get rid of them because they are basically alleging that they're serving no purpose other than making a huge cost and a dent in the cost of cable subscription.

1254
01:37:59,714 --> 01:38:05,735
I believe Comcast and Verizon, as it relates to both of their service people, have merged in many of those cities and towns.

1255
01:38:06,409 --> 01:38:07,610
as far as the service goes.

1256
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:11,973
And there is some movement that maybe Xfinity and Verizon might even merge in the future.

1257
01:38:12,374 --> 01:38:14,375
But that's just another issue right now.

1258
01:38:14,435 --> 01:38:18,959
Right now we're dealing with the 10-year issue that the city should not go forward and sign this contract.

1259
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:25,884
And anyone who has Comcast out there right now, send a letter, call the mayor's office, and just tell them not to sign this contract.

1260
01:38:26,585 --> 01:38:27,606
What's Comcast going to do?

1261
01:38:27,666 --> 01:38:28,987
Just pick up and walk out of the city?

1262
01:38:29,047 --> 01:38:29,647
I don't think so.

1263
01:38:30,127 --> 01:38:33,190
But the fact of the matter is the technology is so far advanced right now.

1264
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:33,710
It's out there.

1265
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,012
It's happening right in front of our faces, and Apple,

1266
01:38:36,527 --> 01:38:40,010
Couldn't have proved it anymore, as they did last Thursday when they came out online.

1267
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:54,280
They did a seven and a half minute demo of showing how advanced, not only are they over cable television, but the new technologies that are out there, plus their merging and interaction with other subsidiaries that are into this particular type of a situation.

1268
01:38:55,381 --> 01:39:06,029
We've seen also what's happened with the PEG access stations, when communities around us got themselves in trouble by misappropriating the funds, who went to jail for eight years,

1269
01:39:06,693 --> 01:39:09,154
Who's being subject to an attorney general investigation?

1270
01:39:09,174 --> 01:39:11,734
And it's just not fair.

1271
01:39:12,214 --> 01:39:15,355
We have here in our own city of Medford an investigation that's going on.

1272
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:21,177
We were led to believe at some point in time that the public access channel was going to file dissolution.

1273
01:39:22,137 --> 01:39:24,017
And they said they were, and they haven't.

1274
01:39:24,438 --> 01:39:33,920
We have papers here tonight that come from the attorney general's office, especially the charitable affairs division, which are basically saying it is still under investigation.

1275
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:39,692
I don't know how much more investigation it can be when there's hundreds of thousands of dollars missing and unaccounted for.

1276
01:39:40,052 --> 01:39:57,958
But when they're missing and unaccounted for, and the mayor of this community sits by and does absolutely nothing about it, and then he wants to even entertain possibly thinking of signing a new 10-year contract with a company that does nothing more than raise the rates each and every time they have a chance.

1277
01:39:58,598 --> 01:40:02,339
And it's the same mayor in this community who happens to have a pretty good deal

1278
01:40:02,908 --> 01:40:20,282
Concast, who recently gave him $5,000 for whatever he wanted to use within the community, and I believe there's a $30,000 or thereabout in account that he has used to do whatever he's wanted, unbeknownst to this council as it relates to whatever he feels a charitable event needs to take place here in this community.

1279
01:40:20,302 --> 01:40:26,447
You know, Mr. Kelly, who's the Director of Governmental Affairs and Regulations, has never offered that to the City Council.

1280
01:40:26,807 --> 01:40:29,129
He's never made that away to the taxpayers of this community.

1281
01:40:29,738 --> 01:40:36,345
I'm not so sure the mayor would want to sign this because he has a particular perk that he gets out of this for himself to use whatever he wants to use.

1282
01:40:37,065 --> 01:40:53,481
I'm not so sure, Mr. President, that public access here in the city of Medford, for which the city has in its coffers in excess of $300,000, if not more, that have been taken from subscribers to Comcast, who have had no public access for well over a year and a half or thereabouts,

1283
01:40:54,237 --> 01:40:55,878
is the right way to go now in the future.

1284
01:40:56,398 --> 01:40:59,480
The mayor wants to put this new public access channel up at the high school.

1285
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:12,307
It is not readily available, it's not easily accessible, it's not on a bus route that way you get off, it's an easily walking distance, and especially at nighttime, it presents itself with a handicap and a public safety issue.

1286
01:41:13,008 --> 01:41:22,413
So with that being said, and recognizing that there was a three-member commission that the mayor empowered earlier this year, whether he agreed or disagreed with the folks that were on there,

1287
01:41:22,678 --> 01:41:29,160
They did make recommendations that basically talked about keeping this thing centrally located, easily accessible, and something that could work.

1288
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:32,140
And to this day, the mayor still doesn't have it.

1289
01:41:33,181 --> 01:41:42,543
He's quoted a saying back in 2014, excuse me, before the election, that public access would be made available and it would be in the city of Medford and it would be operational.

1290
01:41:43,023 --> 01:41:43,663
Well, where is it?

1291
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:45,023
It doesn't exist.

1292
01:41:45,864 --> 01:41:51,685
The mayor has taken personal advantage on the public access of Channel 15, the educational channel for his own,

1293
01:41:52,095 --> 01:42:06,159
personal use for which he uses personnel from the high school for his own personal public affairs to have him televised anytime he wants on their dime while they should be teaching in school, not doing, they shouldn't be taking care of him.

1294
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:13,922
You know, we just heard tonight from the subcommittee of the council that was on relative to having our council meetings put on the government access.

1295
01:42:14,022 --> 01:42:14,202
I mean,

1296
01:42:14,505 --> 01:42:16,805
to be put on the city's website.

1297
01:42:17,045 --> 01:42:18,166
That would be a great way to go.

1298
01:42:18,626 --> 01:42:24,627
But I doubt it, if the mayor would allow that, because if there's anything that's controversial that doesn't speak well of the mayor, it's not gonna go.

1299
01:42:24,867 --> 01:42:25,587
It's not gonna show.

1300
01:42:26,467 --> 01:42:30,788
You know, Comcast, they may have been good at one point in time.

1301
01:42:30,828 --> 01:42:38,729
I know Councilor Camuso, you had made comment, I think it was last week or two weeks ago, that maybe we should go back and just rescind the order that the council voted on, whatever it might be.

1302
01:42:38,769 --> 01:42:40,750
We never got an answer back from the city clerk on that.

1303
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,150
So, pardon me?

1304
01:42:44,016 --> 01:42:46,257
Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1305
01:42:46,277 --> 01:42:51,680
Just for the Councils, that was a homeroom petition, and the only way to get rid of it would be through another homeroom petition.

1306
01:42:51,800 --> 01:43:04,708
Okay, so with that being said, be it a homeroom petition or what have you, I don't think it's fair, especially to the ratepayers, who keep paying each and every month, each and every month, each and every month, and getting nothing forward, you know, and that's the problem with society today.

1307
01:43:05,108 --> 01:43:12,432
People become so inundated with all these nuances, they just let it go by, and while they let it go by, the city keeps generating money,

1308
01:43:13,311 --> 01:43:24,037
In an account that serves no purpose for the rate payers, and at the same time, the mayor has an extreme advantage of taking those monies to be used that he has going with Comcast.

1309
01:43:24,518 --> 01:43:26,679
And one final comment, Mr. President, you know.

1310
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:29,441
Point of information, Counselor Kimuso.

1311
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:35,324
Were you referring to the franchise fee question, or the whole, when I just answered Home Rule petition, I wasn't sure if you were talking about.

1312
01:43:35,344 --> 01:43:35,624
Franchise fee.

1313
01:43:35,644 --> 01:43:36,645
All right, that, all right.

1314
01:43:36,865 --> 01:43:38,206
So we're talking apples to apples, okay.

1315
01:43:38,326 --> 01:43:38,606
Okay.

1316
01:43:38,626 --> 01:43:39,767
I didn't know if you were talking about the,

1317
01:43:40,408 --> 01:43:45,533
Signing of the 10-year contract again, which we're still waiting for the administration to respond if it's a renewal.

1318
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:47,556
The question we asked, but I just wanted to make sure.

1319
01:43:47,576 --> 01:43:49,958
The issue of the 5% is the franchise fee.

1320
01:43:49,978 --> 01:43:52,100
That was a home rule which is broken down to 3, 1, and 1.

1321
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:52,301
Okay.

1322
01:43:53,021 --> 01:43:56,084
With that being said, Mr. President, I just don't think it's fair.

1323
01:43:56,425 --> 01:43:58,247
I don't think the city should go forward.

1324
01:43:58,467 --> 01:44:03,272
I think the mayor should be getting, the council should direct them not to sign this contract.

1325
01:44:03,554 --> 01:44:05,715
especially not having a public hearing.

1326
01:44:06,036 --> 01:44:07,997
And more importantly, what are we getting?

1327
01:44:08,017 --> 01:44:12,299
If we lock ourselves into another 10-year deal, God knows what's going to happen.

1328
01:44:12,339 --> 01:44:15,021
The rates, Councilor Caviello, you just said it, what are we getting?

1329
01:44:15,061 --> 01:44:18,763
All we're getting is the rates just keep going up and up and up, and you're getting nothing forward in return.

1330
01:44:19,444 --> 01:44:20,784
And it's just not fair.

1331
01:44:21,545 --> 01:44:25,647
And with that being said, I'll open it up to anybody, other questions, Mr. President.

1332
01:44:27,148 --> 01:44:27,989
Councilor Camuso.

1333
01:44:28,649 --> 01:44:32,331
Thank you, and thank you, Councilor Pinto, for bringing this up this evening again.

1334
01:44:33,743 --> 01:44:37,605
So after last week's meeting, we asked several questions that were waiting for answers.

1335
01:44:38,886 --> 01:44:40,747
One of them in particular was the franchise fee.

1336
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:45,070
And I think at this point, we're talking about all new technology.

1337
01:44:45,630 --> 01:45:01,920
If no one bids on the public access station, and there's not the interest out there from non-profits to do it, I'd like to ask the city solicitor if he can do some research through the FEC or whoever it is, if we could use the franchise fee for other cable related

1338
01:45:02,743 --> 01:45:05,404
rather than the public access station, like citywide Wi-Fi.

1339
01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:07,785
A lot of communities now have citywide Wi-Fi.

1340
01:45:08,286 --> 01:45:26,734
And since this discussion took place last week, there are some people that approached me, I'm sure, talked to other members of this council, that they feel that public access is good, but there is maybe a better need for the money in today's day and age, where everyone has devices that can hook up to Wi-Fi.

1341
01:45:27,134 --> 01:45:29,875
So if we could at least just ask the question, because as of right now,

1342
01:45:31,028 --> 01:45:42,016
The deadline for the bid has been extended and based upon what you hear out there, there's really not that much interest other than maybe Winchester.

1343
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,052
some other communities.

1344
01:45:46,252 --> 01:46:03,526
But other than that, if legally it can be used for citywide Wi-Fi or updating technology into the new schools even more than we already have, somewhere where it will have a better impact on our community and maybe the youth, the seniors, or whatever.

1345
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:12,373
If we could just ask the question, I'd like to, I support your paper, but I'd like to make a B paper that we ask the solicitor to do research on where else it can be spent.

1346
01:46:12,942 --> 01:46:14,062
Can we do that as an amendment?

1347
01:46:14,303 --> 01:46:15,263
Amendment or be paid for?

1348
01:46:15,283 --> 01:46:17,124
Well, a point of, just a point of further clarification.

1349
01:46:17,304 --> 01:46:18,764
Point of further clarification, Council Penta.

1350
01:46:18,784 --> 01:46:20,705
The peg access is very specific by law.

1351
01:46:20,965 --> 01:46:23,466
It has to be used for public access, educational, government channel.

1352
01:46:23,786 --> 01:46:27,727
And the other thing that nobody has talked about, why does it have to be for a non-profit?

1353
01:46:27,767 --> 01:46:29,808
Why can't it not be for a for-profit?

1354
01:46:30,088 --> 01:46:42,593
And if it was a for-profit, you might have a different attitude of people coming in here and saying, hey, not only can we do it and raise money for the community, you don't have to worry about public access because the for-profit will take care of the whole situation.

1355
01:46:43,450 --> 01:46:46,333
And you know, and that's something that the mayor is not even entertained.

1356
01:46:47,074 --> 01:46:50,037
He doesn't even, he doesn't have the ability to figure this thing out.

1357
01:46:50,457 --> 01:46:54,521
We were paying a guy named Peter Epstein, something like $325 an hour.

1358
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:58,185
And that was the gentleman who did the last hearing 10 years ago.

1359
01:46:58,385 --> 01:46:58,705
Okay.

1360
01:46:59,046 --> 01:47:04,071
And he has yet to be contacted the last time I spoke to him, which is probably within the past three weeks to a month.

1361
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:07,594
And so if the mayor has no intention of having this public hearing,

1362
01:47:07,964 --> 01:47:11,146
and he intends to have a 10-year contract signed, Mr. President.

1363
01:47:11,326 --> 01:47:20,512
That's absolutely unfair to every single ratepayer, subscriber in this community, to know what's going on, and at the same time, it doesn't serve the taxpayer any benefit at all.

1364
01:47:20,752 --> 01:47:25,575
They're getting nothing out of this 10-year contract, except the mayor is the one that becomes the beneficiary.

1365
01:47:27,937 --> 01:47:30,558
Councillor Camuso will finish his comments now, as amended.

1366
01:47:30,578 --> 01:47:36,582
And I definitely hear what you're saying, but I think we need to know what exactly, and you said it eloquently, Councillor Penta,

1367
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:41,425
I can be used for public access educational as well as governmental.

1368
01:47:41,805 --> 01:47:44,167
So this could be used potentially.

1369
01:47:44,207 --> 01:47:45,949
And this is the question I want to ask this evening.

1370
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:57,541
If we could use this, if there's not not the drive to get the public access done, but to improve the infrastructure for the children of our community, maybe the senior citizen centers throughout the community.

1371
01:47:57,894 --> 01:48:24,690
We can bring technology maybe into their buildings legally, and we might not be able to, but if we could at least ask the city solicitor to look at all these avenues, because when this topic came up last week, I've had several people, and I'm sure other people have heard similar, if not the same thing, but public access is great, but we talked about last week where technology's going, and that's why we're all gonna support, hopefully support this this evening, the 10 years, but with today's technology,

1372
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:34,537
There's probably places we could spend that money, if legally we can, that will have a better impact on the citizens of this community, be it the youth, the senior citizens.

1373
01:48:35,817 --> 01:48:43,021
So if we could just ask the question, we're not saying we want to do this, but if we could just ask the question so we have a better understanding on where it can be spent.

1374
01:48:43,061 --> 01:48:45,182
So can I do that as an amendment or a B paper?

1375
01:48:46,463 --> 01:48:48,924
As a B paper with a roll call vote on both, please.

1376
01:48:49,004 --> 01:48:51,706
So as a B paper with a roll call vote.

1377
01:48:51,726 --> 01:48:54,287
So on that motion, Councilor Caravaglio.

1378
01:48:54,847 --> 01:48:55,527
Thank you, Mr. President.

1379
01:48:55,547 --> 01:49:02,529
You know, I was here Sunday with several of my other colleagues, and there had to be 300 people hanging out of the doors here.

1380
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:14,093
And something that the TV station should have been here, if not the high school station, many of those kids who died were high school students.

1381
01:49:15,013 --> 01:49:16,314
And no one ever saw anything.

1382
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:20,755
That's one of the, I've never seen this room as packed as it was.

1383
01:49:21,135 --> 01:49:22,495
They were hanging in the hallways, and nobody,

1384
01:49:24,395 --> 01:49:26,577
other than the people in this room.

1385
01:49:26,877 --> 01:49:31,381
That was something that should have been on TV for the high school students to see.

1386
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:44,812
It was people that spoke in the beginning about the drugs and the knocking and many other things, and the speeches of kids that are recovering from drug abuse.

1387
01:49:44,872 --> 01:49:49,977
We have press conferences, we have other ridiculous things, but that was the biggest event that I've seen in years.

1388
01:49:51,078 --> 01:49:57,442
and we had nothing for anyone to see about that to show one of the biggest problems that we have.

1389
01:50:01,905 --> 01:50:06,928
Mr. President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank Councillor Penta for bringing this resolution forward.

1390
01:50:07,569 --> 01:50:09,250
I certainly support the resolution in theory.

1391
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:11,771
I have some concerns about the language, Mr. President.

1392
01:50:13,052 --> 01:50:19,036
In looking at the language of the resolution, I mean, I think that everybody here is in agreement that we don't want to see a 10-year contract with Comcast.

1393
01:50:19,852 --> 01:50:23,374
and the mayor has the authority as our chief negotiator to enter into a contract.

1394
01:50:24,015 --> 01:50:35,622
By law, we've all been advised, informed, you know, told by the city solicitor that the longest term of a contract should be three years unless special approval is given.

1395
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:46,789
In looking at the resolution, you know, I think that it might make sense for us to go on record advising the mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to sign any agreement in excess of three years.

1396
01:50:47,922 --> 01:51:03,288
And the reason I say that, Mr. President, is because, you know, even if Comcast was providing new methods and new technologies and competitive rates, I still don't think that we'd support a 10-year contract for the provision of Comcast cable services.

1397
01:51:04,248 --> 01:51:07,509
You know, when looking at this resolution, again, I support it in theory.

1398
01:51:07,529 --> 01:51:09,270
I think it's a good resolution.

1399
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:17,333
I just hopefully think that some suggestions to accomplish what we're trying to get to are necessary, Mr. President.

1400
01:51:18,214 --> 01:51:27,980
And looking at it, be it resolved the Memphis City Council will go on record advising the mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any agreement in excess of a three-year term.

1401
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,562
Would be enough for us to get our point across his desk.

1402
01:51:31,942 --> 01:51:37,505
And I'm open to obviously discussing amending the paper with the sponsor.

1403
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:40,787
Again, like I said, in essence, I'm in support of it.

1404
01:51:40,847 --> 01:51:44,669
However, I think that some language changes might make it a little bit more strong.

1405
01:51:49,143 --> 01:51:49,743
Thank you, Mr. President.

1406
01:51:49,903 --> 01:51:54,905
You know, why sign any contract until we have someone that wants to run the station?

1407
01:51:56,185 --> 01:51:59,746
I mean, three years, one year, six months?

1408
01:52:00,527 --> 01:52:04,088
Sign no contract until we have someone that's going to run the station, Mr. President.

1409
01:52:06,969 --> 01:52:08,629
So is that an amendment to the motion?

1410
01:52:08,829 --> 01:52:08,989
Yes.

1411
01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:16,132
So on the motion of Councillor Panta as amended,

1412
01:52:16,807 --> 01:52:21,148
by Councillor Caraviello with a B paper called for by Councillor Camuso.

1413
01:52:21,588 --> 01:52:22,469
Councillor Camuso.

1414
01:52:22,829 --> 01:52:30,571
If we could also ask the city solicitor the question, what happens, because I don't have a copy of the contract in front of me as I don't know any of us that do.

1415
01:52:30,891 --> 01:52:31,211
I don't.

1416
01:52:31,732 --> 01:52:34,852
What happens at the expiration date?

1417
01:52:35,113 --> 01:52:43,095
We want to, I mean, we just want to make sure that they don't just turn the switch and now that everyone that subscribed to Comcast has a blackout and now

1418
01:52:43,669 --> 01:52:48,710
You're waiting for Verizon to come into every house in the community that has Comcast that's going to take two years to get up and running.

1419
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:51,971
So, just want to find out what happens if it doesn't get signed.

1420
01:52:52,711 --> 01:52:54,832
And is that a amendment to the main paper?

1421
01:52:54,952 --> 01:52:56,432
If Councilor Penta doesn't mind.

1422
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:01,593
As amended to the main paper by Councilor Camuso.

1423
01:53:02,094 --> 01:53:02,914
Is that okay, Councilor?

1424
01:53:04,474 --> 01:53:05,694
Yeah.

1425
01:53:05,774 --> 01:53:11,736
Councilor Caviello's amendment was that it not be signed, not even for three years.

1426
01:53:18,131 --> 01:53:20,432
Councillor Penter would like to summation.

1427
01:53:23,592 --> 01:53:24,272
Mr. Citizen.

1428
01:53:25,513 --> 01:53:28,153
Mr. Council President, my name is Joe Villione.

1429
01:53:28,973 --> 01:53:31,674
I live at 59 Garfield Avenue, Metro Mass.

1430
01:53:32,794 --> 01:53:39,596
And I want to respectfully disagree with Councillors Penter and Camuso about peg access.

1431
01:53:40,716 --> 01:53:44,417
Um, there are two stations very interested in running the, uh,

1432
01:53:45,225 --> 01:53:45,745
access station.

1433
01:53:45,765 --> 01:53:46,726
It's not Winchester either.

1434
01:53:46,766 --> 01:53:47,767
Winchester is obsolete.

1435
01:53:47,807 --> 01:53:52,571
And according to the RFP, they want someone that's interested in Medford.

1436
01:53:53,351 --> 01:54:00,196
Now, in case this doesn't happen because the mayor hasn't advertised this properly, I have put in for community media Medford.

1437
01:54:00,236 --> 01:54:04,099
So we will have a Medford Corporation runs it for Medford.

1438
01:54:04,139 --> 01:54:06,381
And I've already reached out to people to be part of that.

1439
01:54:06,401 --> 01:54:07,322
No, I didn't want to do that.

1440
01:54:07,362 --> 01:54:10,584
I'd rather do access TV, but I'm going to do this for the city of Medford.

1441
01:54:11,025 --> 01:54:11,465
I put in

1442
01:54:11,912 --> 01:54:14,074
What, 12, 13 years fighting for this.

1443
01:54:14,714 --> 01:54:23,442
We shouldn't be punished because the mayor made so many mistakes with AXS TV and didn't discipline the station after the Judge Jackson Thompson report.

1444
01:54:23,762 --> 01:54:25,343
So why should you punish us?

1445
01:54:25,384 --> 01:54:30,228
Now, as Councilor Caraviello had a great point, the vigil Sunday should have been taped.

1446
01:54:30,248 --> 01:54:39,896
Now, if someone had called me, I would have brought my camera and I bought my own camera as well as my tablet and my cell phone because I don't want to be dependent on the six stations where I have memberships.

1447
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:43,353
because I have to borrow a camera and then run back and bring them back.

1448
01:54:44,633 --> 01:54:49,254
And I'm a member of Mass Access now as well, so I am plugged in, but I have my own camera.

1449
01:54:49,894 --> 01:54:54,515
I got it, and I could have come here and videotaped that, and we could have put it on Made in Medford.

1450
01:54:55,015 --> 01:54:57,455
All you have to do, and I've said it before, just call me and I'm there.

1451
01:54:58,476 --> 01:55:00,636
Access is very important to this community.

1452
01:55:00,696 --> 01:55:06,977
It's very important to me, and I ask the council president some great latitude in this, because I have a prepared paper.

1453
01:55:07,137 --> 01:55:10,178
I respect the opinions, but we should come to the middle on this.

1454
01:55:11,615 --> 01:55:14,036
The mayor, as issuing authority, has not been efficient.

1455
01:55:14,076 --> 01:55:15,957
Now, he's a good mayor in certain regards.

1456
01:55:16,358 --> 01:55:18,279
Mayor McGlynn does some things that I really like.

1457
01:55:18,959 --> 01:55:23,162
Okay, there might be a 10-year thing with waste management, but those green barrels are effective.

1458
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:26,944
So, you know, there are some things the mayor does.

1459
01:55:27,024 --> 01:55:28,685
I just wish he would ask our input.

1460
01:55:29,285 --> 01:55:30,185
So he's not all bad.

1461
01:55:30,225 --> 01:55:32,327
He's a good guy outside of the council, and I've said that.

1462
01:55:32,427 --> 01:55:34,208
I like Mayor McGlynn as a person.

1463
01:55:35,132 --> 01:55:38,394
I really am appalled at some of the things he does as mayor.

1464
01:55:38,775 --> 01:55:42,457
So don't separate, you know, you have to separate the two.

1465
01:55:43,218 --> 01:55:46,760
He's not a bad guy outside of City Hall, but he's been in a long time.

1466
01:55:48,101 --> 01:55:51,604
Now, a for-profit would be beneficial.

1467
01:55:51,864 --> 01:55:55,826
So we jumpstart a for-profit, and I see it as a media center.

1468
01:55:56,147 --> 01:56:00,310
We're cachet, and all these organizations in America come together, as they do in Somerville.

1469
01:56:01,137 --> 01:56:03,119
Something they do in Malden, as they do in Newton.

1470
01:56:03,179 --> 01:56:04,480
Newton, you can't get a show on there.

1471
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:09,244
Boston, there are access centers that are flourishing.

1472
01:56:09,364 --> 01:56:10,946
Why deny Medford this?

1473
01:56:11,006 --> 01:56:11,987
Because we don't have it.

1474
01:56:12,988 --> 01:56:15,310
Now, we've lived without 5% of the franchise fee.

1475
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:16,010
Continue that 1%.

1476
01:56:16,531 --> 01:56:18,312
Continue it.

1477
01:56:18,713 --> 01:56:23,237
I beg the city council to think about this, this idea, this solution.

1478
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:27,232
The mayor has not been an efficient issuing authority.

1479
01:56:27,332 --> 01:56:28,733
All due respect, Mayor McGlynn.

1480
01:56:29,073 --> 01:56:30,314
You have, and I can prove it.

1481
01:56:30,955 --> 01:56:34,077
Anywhere, anytime, meet me and I'll show you where you're deficient.

1482
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:43,804
There's nothing in the contract that says the mayor has to be the issuing authority, so why don't we have seven people, or six, because one doesn't want to hear what I have to say.

1483
01:56:44,565 --> 01:56:50,089
Why don't we have seven people putting their heads together and being the issuing authority?

1484
01:56:51,120 --> 01:57:01,588
In Winchester, the selectman of the issuing authority, not the town manager, met with Mr. Howard for a half hour at his request, and we discussed cable issues.

1485
01:57:01,608 --> 01:57:05,872
He didn't even know Wincambe had been sued by employees and lost, settled out of court.

1486
01:57:07,772 --> 01:57:14,657
Richard Howard didn't even know this until my public records request, so here I am enlightening every community to the deficiencies and the pluses.

1487
01:57:14,677 --> 01:57:18,380
And there are a lot of good access stations out there, though there are more problems now.

1488
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:21,242
I'm going to get the lawsuit that was filed in Saugus.

1489
01:57:21,322 --> 01:57:22,583
The town hall is going to give it to me.

1490
01:57:23,343 --> 01:57:27,285
I have to pay 25 cents a page, but I will have that information for the city council.

1491
01:57:27,905 --> 01:57:34,988
We need to move forward with public access TV just because the last crowd was so bad and did so many bad things.

1492
01:57:35,528 --> 01:57:41,830
And, you know, there's a counselor here that enjoyed being on a board member show, and now that counselor wants to shut down access.

1493
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:42,471
Well, I don't get it.

1494
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:43,911
You got to use it, and I didn't.

1495
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:45,112
That's not fair.

1496
01:57:45,612 --> 01:57:48,473
And, you know, believe me, I was an angel taping the mayor's

1497
01:57:49,073 --> 01:57:50,293
Raising of the Christmas Tree.

1498
01:57:50,794 --> 01:57:54,435
I did so many things for Medford Community Cablevision, and I got kicked in the teeth.

1499
01:57:54,495 --> 01:57:57,856
They took speakers that one of my friends had a company.

1500
01:57:58,716 --> 01:58:03,658
Everything I could do for MCC, picking up supplies at a discount, because my family had a discount at Hunt.

1501
01:58:04,638 --> 01:58:06,879
I did for Medford Community Cablevision.

1502
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:07,659
I did a lot of stuff.

1503
01:58:07,699 --> 01:58:08,599
It was all about them.

1504
01:58:08,959 --> 01:58:12,020
It was an insider's club, as is Winchester, as is a couple of others.

1505
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:13,761
Now, Winchester was great three years ago.

1506
01:58:14,081 --> 01:58:14,941
We had a great board.

1507
01:58:15,321 --> 01:58:16,722
We had a good executive director.

1508
01:58:18,469 --> 01:58:19,310
But it's changed.

1509
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:20,691
The good people left.

1510
01:58:21,131 --> 01:58:26,175
The good board, the board people that were great, the school committee person, they're gone.

1511
01:58:26,476 --> 01:58:29,398
And now you've got the entrenched cronies just as we had here in Medford.

1512
01:58:29,418 --> 01:58:31,239
So Winchester coming in here, that ain't gonna happen.

1513
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,502
I'll put an injunction there before I let that happen, believe me.

1514
01:58:34,782 --> 01:58:37,164
No, there's two good stations that want to come into Medford.

1515
01:58:37,484 --> 01:58:39,886
The mayor has not advertised this properly.

1516
01:58:40,207 --> 01:58:40,987
The deadline's the 26th.

1517
01:58:42,748 --> 01:58:44,371
I'm out there talking to contractors.

1518
01:58:44,551 --> 01:58:46,494
I'm out there talking to different TV stations.

1519
01:58:46,554 --> 01:58:47,576
They didn't hear about this.

1520
01:58:48,117 --> 01:58:49,258
They didn't get the message.

1521
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:50,520
Why?

1522
01:58:50,941 --> 01:58:51,762
I'm not the mayor.

1523
01:58:52,143 --> 01:58:53,565
Why am I doing this work?

1524
01:58:53,605 --> 01:58:56,129
Because the mayor doesn't want it to happen.

1525
01:58:57,992 --> 01:59:02,614
purposely not getting it out there because he wants to say, oh, Comcast, do you want Channel 3?

1526
01:59:03,154 --> 01:59:09,576
I'll give you Channel 3 in exchange for whatever they're gonna barter, and we'll give you like, you know, Channel 700 for public access.

1527
01:59:10,376 --> 01:59:11,657
That is in the wind.

1528
01:59:11,797 --> 01:59:16,779
Look at the language in the portions of the contract I gave you last week.

1529
01:59:17,519 --> 01:59:24,741
The language is there, they wanted to remove Channel 3 years ago, and the old crowd, you know, the old crowd did not want to let go of Channel 3 for good reason.

1530
01:59:25,101 --> 01:59:26,522
Four, five, seven, three.

1531
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:30,132
We need a for-profit station.

1532
01:59:30,192 --> 01:59:35,617
We need to move forward with the technology, not go back into the dark ages and shut off access.

1533
01:59:35,717 --> 01:59:36,958
All due respect, councillors.

1534
01:59:37,818 --> 01:59:41,201
You both have good points, and I appreciate what Councillor Knight has.

1535
01:59:41,301 --> 01:59:43,843
I really appreciate what Councillor Knight brought to the table.

1536
01:59:44,659 --> 01:59:47,641
I do your, you know, and Councilor Caraviello, excellent points.

1537
01:59:47,981 --> 01:59:50,242
All seven, well, six of you people.

1538
01:59:51,222 --> 01:59:56,885
And I'm hoping, I'm hoping Council President, you get with the program because you, you know, you're a good guy outside of the council as well.

1539
01:59:57,386 --> 02:00:00,247
And it's time for you to cut ties with the mayor because he's afraid of you.

1540
02:00:01,157 --> 02:00:02,298
You gotta get that through your head.

1541
02:00:02,598 --> 02:00:03,639
You have the power over him.

1542
02:00:03,659 --> 02:00:04,639
You got more money than God.

1543
02:00:04,659 --> 02:00:07,721
We're gonna focus on the issue at hand, which is the Comcast contract.

1544
02:00:07,741 --> 02:00:07,821
I am.

1545
02:00:07,861 --> 02:00:08,922
I want you to be issuing it already.

1546
02:00:09,523 --> 02:00:10,803
I'm saying nice things about you.

1547
02:00:11,304 --> 02:00:12,725
I'm praising you for once.

1548
02:00:12,885 --> 02:00:13,765
I mean, Freddie, take it.

1549
02:00:16,507 --> 02:00:16,907
I'm here.

1550
02:00:17,608 --> 02:00:18,609
I know public access.

1551
02:00:18,649 --> 02:00:19,649
I started in 1979.

1552
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:22,771
I got more memberships than most people in the country.

1553
02:00:22,791 --> 02:00:25,633
And I know this issue and I'm passionate about it.

1554
02:00:25,693 --> 02:00:27,594
Do not take this away from the people who want it.

1555
02:00:27,855 --> 02:00:29,916
Chris Donovan wanted to come here tonight and talk about

1556
02:00:30,492 --> 02:00:33,454
Somerville Cable TV having 24 programs a day.

1557
02:00:34,735 --> 02:00:38,998
And I know that because I'll have a radio show on Somerville TV starting in about three weeks.

1558
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:43,802
A radio show, they have a radio station along with their public access station.

1559
02:00:43,842 --> 02:00:49,726
In conclusion, I said it before, I talked to Stephanie Burke, she said there's Homeland Security money for a station.

1560
02:00:50,126 --> 02:00:50,767
Now I ran

1561
02:00:52,052 --> 02:00:53,952
Two radio stations, AM 1670.

1562
02:00:54,252 --> 02:00:56,353
There's an expanded band on AM.

1563
02:00:56,513 --> 02:01:01,954
We could put transmitters around the city in conjunction with the internet streaming and the public access.

1564
02:01:02,014 --> 02:01:02,814
I have this knowledge.

1565
02:01:03,494 --> 02:01:04,414
I am committed to this.

1566
02:01:05,155 --> 02:01:14,276
We can have an emergency channel where Captain Barry Clemente could be on all sorts of media platforms, including Connect CTY, Reverse 911.

1567
02:01:14,757 --> 02:01:15,177
I'm here.

1568
02:01:15,557 --> 02:01:16,477
Medford needs this.

1569
02:01:16,637 --> 02:01:17,697
We're not going to let it go.

1570
02:01:18,117 --> 02:01:21,778
I will not let public access be taken away from us any longer.

1571
02:01:22,292 --> 02:01:22,752
Your Honor.

1572
02:01:24,693 --> 02:01:25,834
Thank you, Mr. Viglione.

1573
02:01:27,175 --> 02:01:30,857
Sir, if you would like to address the council, please state your name and address for the record.

1574
02:01:31,037 --> 02:01:32,117
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1575
02:01:32,277 --> 02:01:34,118
I'm from 811 18 Pembroke Street.

1576
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:35,939
I agree with the council.

1577
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:40,102
I think it's dangerous to sign another contract, 10-year contract with Comcast.

1578
02:01:40,122 --> 02:01:49,246
I'm not sure if the council is aware, but the fastest internet speed in the country is in Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee, and they run their own network.

1579
02:01:50,487 --> 02:01:53,348
a possibility that this city could actually get involved in.

1580
02:01:53,848 --> 02:02:04,410
Chattanooga is a local tech hub as a result, offering internet speeds of a gigabyte per second for $85 a month to its average citizen.

1581
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:17,512
There are lots of options available to this town, and signing another deal with Compass for 10 years will not only hamstring future negotiations, but will also limit Medford becoming a technology hub.

1582
02:02:17,672 --> 02:02:17,872
Thanks.

1583
02:02:20,975 --> 02:02:22,856
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

1584
02:02:23,236 --> 02:02:25,417
Robert Cappucci, 71 Evans Street.

1585
02:02:25,957 --> 02:02:30,039
Through the Chair, if I could ask, Councillor Penta threw out a figure.

1586
02:02:30,559 --> 02:02:41,764
Comcast, or whoever the issuing authority is, or maybe it's a combination between several services, has given the city how much money that's not being used?

1587
02:02:43,244 --> 02:02:44,685
Through the Chair to Councillor Penta?

1588
02:02:45,185 --> 02:02:49,467
I believe through the years it's been approximately $30,000 that the Mayor's been able to use.

1589
02:02:50,140 --> 02:02:51,841
For whatever he feels he wants to use it for.

1590
02:02:52,182 --> 02:02:56,245
And how long have we not had access to television?

1591
02:02:57,967 --> 02:02:58,867
Well, since December of 2013.

1592
02:02:59,248 --> 02:03:08,356
So we're two and a half years almost, two years and a quarter, with that much money.

1593
02:03:08,936 --> 02:03:10,157
What?

1594
02:03:10,177 --> 02:03:10,918
A year and a half.

1595
02:03:10,938 --> 02:03:11,498
A year and a half?

1596
02:03:11,979 --> 02:03:13,000
Well, we're...

1597
02:03:18,523 --> 02:03:21,844
This governing body acts as kind of like the Congress of Medford.

1598
02:03:21,864 --> 02:03:23,044
You're the voice of the people.

1599
02:03:23,164 --> 02:03:26,605
The mayor is the chief executive officer.

1600
02:03:27,145 --> 02:03:40,689
You really need to ask about these monies, why we don't have an access television for the community for a myriad of reasons, and what the mayor is afraid of and why he's not advertising.

1601
02:03:40,729 --> 02:03:47,011
I mean, Joe Viglione, who came up before me, gave an excellent dissertation, and it's

1602
02:03:48,583 --> 02:03:52,164
It's really incumbent upon this body to get answers.

1603
02:03:52,464 --> 02:03:57,306
I know under our city charter, all you can do is make requests of the mayor.

1604
02:03:57,366 --> 02:04:08,329
But if it takes changing the city charter to finally get some things moving forward in the city, these are the options before you.

1605
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:17,112
And this is why we elect you good folks to be our voices when obviously there's just too much power.

1606
02:04:17,528 --> 02:04:19,730
in one office in Medford City government.

1607
02:04:21,351 --> 02:04:23,232
We need to know where this money has gone.

1608
02:04:24,533 --> 02:04:30,477
I hope this investigation will find that out, and we need access to television in Medford.

1609
02:04:30,617 --> 02:04:31,597
Thank you very much.

1610
02:04:32,258 --> 02:04:32,698
Thank you.

1611
02:04:32,778 --> 02:04:37,061
So we're speaking on not signing a 10-year contract.

1612
02:04:37,861 --> 02:04:41,064
Councillor Pinto was waiting for the floor.

1613
02:04:41,284 --> 02:04:43,625
I'd be willing to amend it that reads the following.

1614
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:45,987
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record

1615
02:04:46,550 --> 02:05:00,557
advising the mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place with Comcast to be effective as of August 20th since, in fact, and I think that's what you were leading to.

1616
02:05:00,637 --> 02:05:01,917
Why sign a contract at all?

1617
02:05:02,157 --> 02:05:03,158
We haven't even had our public hearing.

1618
02:05:03,178 --> 02:05:10,021
Well, I wanted to amend mine that we not sign a contract until we find a vendor for the public access station.

1619
02:05:11,299 --> 02:05:16,680
Well, that's a separate issue, because right now the contract is—the public vendor's going to have nothing to do with the contract.

1620
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,961
Because the contract is— The contract's the contract.

1621
02:05:20,481 --> 02:05:22,901
The contract is having a 10-year deal with Comcast.

1622
02:05:22,941 --> 02:05:23,721
That's where he's going.

1623
02:05:24,101 --> 02:05:27,842
Inclusive of the contract is going to be having public access in whatever it might be.

1624
02:05:28,462 --> 02:05:38,584
The key here is, if you don't want him to sign a 10-year contract, and you want the public hearing to get input from the community, you do that, or you just tell him not to sign a 10-year contract.

1625
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:42,101
Okay, Mr. President, I'm willing to take my motion off the table.

1626
02:05:43,001 --> 02:05:44,641
That your amendment is off the table.

1627
02:05:45,521 --> 02:05:47,561
Councilor Caraville withdraws his amendment.

1628
02:05:48,722 --> 02:05:53,182
And Councilor Pinto offers a revised motion.

1629
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:55,843
And if the Councilor could share that.

1630
02:05:56,163 --> 02:05:56,823
I'll read it again.

1631
02:05:57,043 --> 02:05:58,903
Read it again so that the Clerk has it.

1632
02:05:59,464 --> 02:06:07,905
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council go on record advising the Mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any contract agreement

1633
02:06:08,409 --> 02:06:09,569
Hold it.

1634
02:06:09,669 --> 02:06:10,970
Slow, slow, slow.

1635
02:06:11,410 --> 02:06:25,493
All he has to do after the word to, where it says not to, just insert the words enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place with Comcast to be effective as of April 20th and then continue on.

1636
02:06:25,673 --> 02:06:26,013
You get it?

1637
02:06:28,233 --> 02:06:29,353
He has to go slowly.

1638
02:06:31,494 --> 02:06:36,875
After the word to, enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place.

1639
02:06:37,635 --> 02:06:39,396
because that is so important.

1640
02:06:39,416 --> 02:06:47,381
People don't realize that that public hearing talks about exactly what's going on in this city and what Comcast is offering other than work.

1641
02:06:47,401 --> 02:06:51,344
Would you be the rates just keep going up and up and up and nobody's got a chance to talk about this.

1642
02:06:51,684 --> 02:06:52,064
Thank you.

1643
02:06:52,884 --> 02:06:55,326
Uh, council, uh, we all set.

1644
02:06:56,046 --> 02:07:00,049
You have that Eddie clerk has that a counselor night is waiting next.

1645
02:07:00,649 --> 02:07:01,750
Um, Mr. President,

1646
02:07:02,483 --> 02:07:04,824
I'd like to thank the council for coming up with some new language.

1647
02:07:04,864 --> 02:07:06,464
That's language that I can certainly support.

1648
02:07:06,604 --> 02:07:10,045
I appreciate his efforts and it's a pleasure to work alongside him on this.

1649
02:07:10,345 --> 02:07:10,905
Mr. President.

1650
02:07:10,925 --> 02:07:11,205
Thank you.

1651
02:07:11,325 --> 02:07:12,265
And Councilor Camuso.

1652
02:07:13,426 --> 02:07:23,268
I'd like to get the answer because I did look into this because I was getting several people that were interested in putting in a bid if it was for profit.

1653
02:07:25,337 --> 02:07:28,299
I'm not so sure you can have a public access channel that is for profit.

1654
02:07:28,339 --> 02:07:28,839
Absolutely.

1655
02:07:29,099 --> 02:07:30,520
I would call that channel 457.

1656
02:07:31,161 --> 02:07:37,305
You have to give people equal time and things like that, but you do have their out there on the country.

1657
02:07:37,345 --> 02:07:39,346
They have profit public.

1658
02:07:39,366 --> 02:07:52,294
We got to check the FCC regulations and see if, uh, if you can, because like I said, I know people that are interested in doing it, um, quite honestly for profit, but nonprofit is actually, which makes it a vibrant part of the community.

1659
02:07:52,914 --> 02:07:55,997
And it's not for business, it's not to make money and everything else.

1660
02:07:56,697 --> 02:07:58,179
So if we could ask that question as well.

1661
02:07:58,579 --> 02:08:00,381
Ask that question as part of your B paper.

1662
02:08:03,744 --> 02:08:10,890
And then the B paper is looking into where else the money can be spent in lieu of the public access, if the city needs it.

1663
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:14,833
Senior housing, internet accessibility citywide, Wi-Fi.

1664
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:28,687
That the B-Paper can include overall spending money spent on Wi-Fi and senior citizen housing.

1665
02:08:28,987 --> 02:08:31,249
And our technology upgrades to the school system.

1666
02:08:31,769 --> 02:08:42,438
And if it can be for-profit according to FCC regulations and all that.

1667
02:08:42,458 --> 02:08:47,542
Because I'm not a lawyer, but I would think it has to be non-profit.

1668
02:08:47,982 --> 02:08:48,383
I would think.

1669
02:08:53,778 --> 02:08:54,778
– Briefly on that question.

1670
02:08:54,798 --> 02:09:00,580
– You can have for-profit that does not have to go through Comcast, because they're not going to come under those regulations.

1671
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:06,202
You will have a legitimate for-profit company come in here and run a cable company.

1672
02:09:06,362 --> 02:09:11,103
Well, it'll be a public access, but they won't follow the same guidelines as if you're going to have it under Comcast.

1673
02:09:11,363 --> 02:09:12,003
That's the difference.

1674
02:09:13,504 --> 02:09:16,905
They have guidelines that they're going to have to follow, but it won't come under the Comcast contract.

1675
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:21,652
In summation, sir, you wish to speak at the podium.

1676
02:09:22,493 --> 02:09:28,482
Comcast's website actually says on it that it has to be non-profit according to FCC regulations.

1677
02:09:28,702 --> 02:09:28,963
For them.

1678
02:09:31,377 --> 02:09:34,038
Comcast, I'm sure it's similar with Verizon, ICN.

1679
02:09:34,358 --> 02:09:38,300
We're going to get a clarification on that as requested as part of the resolution.

1680
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:40,421
Sir, can you name and address for the record again?

1681
02:09:40,761 --> 02:09:42,682
Michael Leggero, I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1682
02:09:43,042 --> 02:09:44,483
I have a question for the council.

1683
02:09:45,123 --> 02:09:53,127
Is it possible that the council could summon a representative of Comcast here to talk about this contract and negotiation?

1684
02:09:53,727 --> 02:09:56,788
Or is it possible to at least invite someone from Comcast here?

1685
02:09:56,868 --> 02:10:00,350
The council can invite anybody to report to it as they deem fit.

1686
02:10:01,541 --> 02:10:04,362
May I recommend that the council invite someone from Comcast to speak?

1687
02:10:05,123 --> 02:10:05,343
Thank you.

1688
02:10:05,603 --> 02:10:06,003
Thank you.

1689
02:10:08,764 --> 02:10:09,405
Councillor Knight.

1690
02:10:09,625 --> 02:10:19,609
I believe inviting someone to Comcast to appear before the council to discuss the ongoing contract negotiations would be a little bit outside the scope of actual good faith contract negotiations.

1691
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:27,353
The mayor has his position, Comcast has their position, and they're in negotiations trying to hammer out an agreement for them to come to the council

1692
02:10:27,867 --> 02:10:30,287
I think would probably set back negotiations.

1693
02:10:30,688 --> 02:10:43,030
Having negotiated a number of contracts in the past, during my time with the union, most of the negotiating committees keep everything confidential until the parties enter into an agreement, then they report that information out, and that information gets reported out.

1694
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:50,771
It would be akin to the city council trying to influence the negotiation of nuclear arms in Iran.

1695
02:10:52,512 --> 02:10:53,752
Yes, Councilor Penta.

1696
02:10:54,956 --> 02:10:57,017
I'll somewhat disagree with that, only for one reason.

1697
02:10:57,057 --> 02:11:04,562
The idea of having the public hearing is to get information from the ratepayers that are going to tell you what they like, what they don't like, or what they would like to see.

1698
02:11:05,022 --> 02:11:07,283
Then they take that information and go back and negotiate.

1699
02:11:07,364 --> 02:11:11,826
If you don't have any public hearing and you don't have any public information, what are you negotiating?

1700
02:11:12,186 --> 02:11:13,027
I'm certainly not.

1701
02:11:13,965 --> 02:11:19,930
opposed to a public hearing on the issue to discuss the concerns that residents have about their Comcast cable subscription.

1702
02:11:20,410 --> 02:11:28,856
However, even if you look at the open meeting law, the open meeting law says a perfect scenario for executive session would be when, in fact, it would be detrimental to contract negotiations.

1703
02:11:29,617 --> 02:11:31,658
So I think that, you know, based on past practice.

1704
02:11:31,678 --> 02:11:31,839
Right.

1705
02:11:31,959 --> 02:11:37,243
But we're going to now conclude our discussions and take a vote.

1706
02:11:38,464 --> 02:11:40,245
Sir, you want to briefly address the council?

1707
02:11:40,525 --> 02:11:42,747
Just two quick points on these things.

1708
02:11:43,689 --> 02:11:50,131
On a public hearing, yes, it's important that the public ascertain about the telephone, internet, cable TV, public access.

1709
02:11:51,211 --> 02:11:53,792
And I agree with Councilor Knight and Councilor Penter on this.

1710
02:11:54,872 --> 02:11:57,052
It should be the public hearing that the mayor has.

1711
02:11:57,573 --> 02:12:01,554
And I believe he's required by rule, not by law, but by rule as in a requirement.

1712
02:12:01,994 --> 02:12:10,736
And if our city clerk, our wonderful city clerk could just alert me when he gets that piece of paper, I'll try coming by the office every day to make sure that I see it on the wall because

1713
02:12:11,264 --> 02:12:11,924
That's very important.

1714
02:12:11,964 --> 02:12:15,386
Now, on one last topic, for-profit television.

1715
02:12:16,147 --> 02:12:24,211
In Medford, when I was at TV3, I had Robert Hilliard on, a professor from Emerson who had a wonderful book called Low Power Television, LPTV.

1716
02:12:25,292 --> 02:12:30,635
And a lot of ethnic groups are using low power television, and then if you connect to the cable, you have a larger power television.

1717
02:12:31,993 --> 02:12:40,259
medier using what three fifths of the monies for the general fund and then the other one percent for the high school salaries.

1718
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:50,747
He certainly as issuing authority could say to Comcast look we're going to take these monies and we're going to use them to launch a for profit station and then you won't be obligated other than to carry it.

1719
02:12:51,068 --> 02:12:52,309
There are ways he can work it.

1720
02:12:52,689 --> 02:12:53,770
He's the issuing authority.

1721
02:12:54,370 --> 02:12:56,071
That's what a negotiation is all about.

1722
02:12:56,592 --> 02:12:57,272
Thank you very much.

1723
02:12:57,713 --> 02:12:58,013
Thank you.

1724
02:12:59,019 --> 02:13:02,160
Sir, you've already spoken twice on this item.

1725
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:08,122
If you want to.

1726
02:13:08,302 --> 02:13:12,243
The point I have would like to make, obviously, a public hearing would absolutely be best.

1727
02:13:12,643 --> 02:13:23,227
But if a public hearing is not able to be arranged, it seems that you could invite, if it's possible, the council to invite Comcast here just to speak on, to hear some of the public concerns.

1728
02:13:23,827 --> 02:13:26,708
I don't see how that would necessarily detrimentally affect the contract.

1729
02:13:26,888 --> 02:13:27,108
Thank you.

1730
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:27,804
Thank you.

1731
02:13:28,585 --> 02:13:35,390
On the motion of Councilor Penta for approval, we're going to take the B paper first by Councilor Camuso.

1732
02:13:36,130 --> 02:13:41,394
So on the B paper offered by Councilor Camuso for approval.

1733
02:13:41,594 --> 02:13:42,455
All those in favor?

1734
02:13:43,356 --> 02:13:45,998
Roll call vote has been requested on that paper.

1735
02:13:47,139 --> 02:13:47,919
The B paper.

1736
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:49,901
Mr. Clerk, if you're able to.

1737
02:13:49,941 --> 02:13:50,221
Yes.

1738
02:13:53,975 --> 02:13:54,516
Councilor Knight.

1739
02:13:54,616 --> 02:13:54,756
Yes.

1740
02:13:54,776 --> 02:13:55,817
Vice Mayor Donald Kern.

1741
02:13:55,837 --> 02:13:55,897
Yes.

1742
02:13:55,957 --> 02:13:56,257
Councilor Marks.

1743
02:13:56,317 --> 02:13:56,878
Yes.

1744
02:13:56,918 --> 02:13:57,418
Councilor Penta.

1745
02:13:57,438 --> 02:13:57,538
Yes.

1746
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:00,521
President De La Ruza.

1747
02:14:00,721 --> 02:14:01,042
Yes.

1748
02:14:01,122 --> 02:14:02,643
Seven in the affirmative, none negative.

1749
02:14:02,663 --> 02:14:03,504
The motion passes.

1750
02:14:04,265 --> 02:14:09,790
On the main motion offered by Councilor Penta for approval, roll call vote has been requested.

1751
02:14:10,190 --> 02:14:11,511
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1752
02:14:15,315 --> 02:14:16,055
Councilor Camuso.

1753
02:14:16,336 --> 02:14:16,476
Yes.

1754
02:14:17,056 --> 02:14:17,857
Councilor Cavillo.

1755
02:14:17,917 --> 02:14:18,097
Yes.

1756
02:14:18,638 --> 02:14:19,178
Councilor Knight.

1757
02:14:19,218 --> 02:14:19,439
Yes.

1758
02:14:27,607 --> 02:14:35,233
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, none negative, the paper passes.

1759
02:14:35,253 --> 02:14:36,214
15-307.

1760
02:14:39,036 --> 02:14:44,200
Offered by Councillor Penta, be it resolved that the intentional failure

1761
02:14:45,045 --> 02:15:04,218
of the Mayor's Revenue Enhancement Parking Program, not monitoring why the reprogramming of the parking kiosks and their continued collection of revenues not entitled to revenue collection totals after operating hours be discussed.

1762
02:15:06,019 --> 02:15:06,760
Councilor Penta.

1763
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:12,804
Mr. President, once again, this week is another one of these weeks relative to the whole parking thing.

1764
02:15:12,844 --> 02:15:14,525
Having discussions with the Chief of Police

1765
02:15:15,056 --> 02:15:20,659
and small business people, people who are getting tickets, machines that just aren't working, I don't know.

1766
02:15:20,719 --> 02:15:22,580
So let me start off with the first one right here.

1767
02:15:23,481 --> 02:15:31,165
Here is a picture of a poll that says 30-minute parking Monday through Saturday, 7 a.m.

1768
02:15:31,225 --> 02:15:32,045
to 7 p.m.

1769
02:15:33,606 --> 02:15:37,868
On March 10th of this year, that law was changed to 8 to 6.

1770
02:15:39,009 --> 02:15:44,532
These signs are still up and people are still getting tickets for which now the chief is getting phone calls

1771
02:15:45,018 --> 02:15:45,958
as it relates to this.

1772
02:15:46,959 --> 02:16:01,142
I have here a ticket that's issued on the 18th of March, where somebody put the money in the meter, and the meter stopped collecting it and collecting it, for which they shouldn't have collected the money.

1773
02:16:01,943 --> 02:16:10,745
Now, Councilor Caviello, you made a resolution back on December 23rd as it relates to having the city come forward

1774
02:16:11,334 --> 02:16:16,618
and present to the council a 60-day evaluation take place by the mayor and Republican.

1775
02:16:16,638 --> 02:16:18,040
The 60 days has come and gone.

1776
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:29,189
Then on January 2nd of this past year, you also had a resolution as it related to the kiosks on the face of the kiosk being legible so you could read it, and you still can't read it.

1777
02:16:30,069 --> 02:16:40,518
Again this past week, we have the truck, once again, in downtown Medford, in other parts of the city, again in violation of the contract

1778
02:16:41,134 --> 02:16:45,057
Nothing to be seen on the back saying that this truck makes frequent stops.

1779
02:16:45,738 --> 02:16:55,146
The mayor has just intentionally allowed, allowed this company from Republic from Tennessee to go forward and continuously keep breaking and breaking the laws.

1780
02:16:56,487 --> 02:17:03,894
Now, the other part of the contract basically says the following that, you know, we are supposed to be getting some kind of information forthcoming.

1781
02:17:04,854 --> 02:17:07,897
I believe today, again, speaking to the chief outside,

1782
02:17:08,439 --> 02:17:15,604
He had to go down and speak to some folks next to, I believe, Mystic Valley Pediatrics.

1783
02:17:16,184 --> 02:17:17,925
Next to there, there's a beauty shop over there.

1784
02:17:18,406 --> 02:17:22,248
The women over there are up in arms and they're all afraid because they think they're going to get tickets.

1785
02:17:22,689 --> 02:17:23,970
Who's parked in the parking lot?

1786
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:25,831
The two kiosks are against the wall.

1787
02:17:26,912 --> 02:17:36,238
The records reflect, as we just get, that in January of this past year before the city council, Republic was supposed to go over and meet with the senior citizens

1788
02:17:36,786 --> 02:17:38,607
to explain to them the whole kiosk.

1789
02:17:39,247 --> 02:17:49,352
And here we have here a letter dated March 19th, addressed to you, Council President De La Russo, that on April 3rd, they're going to go over there and discuss how to use a kiosk.

1790
02:17:49,792 --> 02:17:52,674
From January to April 3rd, okay?

1791
02:17:54,055 --> 02:17:54,455
Huge.

1792
02:17:54,695 --> 02:17:56,416
I mean, they're right on the ball with all of this.

1793
02:17:57,196 --> 02:18:02,078
The fact of the matter is that the machines are still taking the money, and where does that extra money go to?

1794
02:18:02,619 --> 02:18:03,819
Is it coming to the city of Medford?

1795
02:18:04,079 --> 02:18:05,120
Is it going into Republic?

1796
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:11,384
We talk about the people getting tickets, full-scale observation.

1797
02:18:12,365 --> 02:18:23,313
West Method, on Playstead Road, where Playstead Road and Winthrop Street meets, there were 15 to 17 cars on any one given day that used to be parked there, and they never got a ticket.

1798
02:18:23,713 --> 02:18:27,136
Now you're lucky if you see one, if not two, cars at the very most.

1799
02:18:27,566 --> 02:18:29,107
And you know where those cars are parking?

1800
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:35,571
Those cars are parking all on the side streets, and they're going into the neighborhoods, and the complaints are starting to come in.

1801
02:18:36,572 --> 02:18:37,993
Go to the parking lots.

1802
02:18:38,693 --> 02:18:40,214
Supposed to be three-hour parking.

1803
02:18:41,054 --> 02:18:42,816
The sign's still up there for two hours.

1804
02:18:43,857 --> 02:18:45,818
So how do you turn around and give somebody a ticket?

1805
02:18:46,578 --> 02:18:55,642
Today, someone who was a business merchant in West Medford and a business merchant in Medford Square who paid their $100 for the pass got themselves tickets.

1806
02:18:56,082 --> 02:19:01,505
They got themselves tickets today with the permit because they were parked in the municipal parking lot.

1807
02:19:02,585 --> 02:19:08,388
On Boston Avenue, in front of this sign over here, where a legitimate delivery was being made,

1808
02:19:09,402 --> 02:19:16,448
and the trunk was open and the merchandise was coming out, the guy in the truck goes up there and gives them a ticket.

1809
02:19:16,949 --> 02:19:19,511
How do you give someone a ticket when you're in a legitimate spot?

1810
02:19:19,571 --> 02:19:19,891
Tell me.

1811
02:19:20,532 --> 02:19:30,320
Councilor Marks, you made a comment a little while ago when this thing was going on, that once this thing started to get going, you gotta be careful because they're gonna be taking aggressive action.

1812
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:32,042
They're doing more than taking aggressive action.

1813
02:19:32,822 --> 02:19:34,083
Look at the tickets that they're giving out.

1814
02:19:34,564 --> 02:19:37,106
You'd think they would at least put the courtesy, like every other city in town,

1815
02:19:37,388 --> 02:19:40,030
from the back of the ticket that at least gives you the telephone number.

1816
02:19:40,711 --> 02:19:43,012
You have to figure out where 557 Main Street is.

1817
02:19:43,293 --> 02:19:44,453
A lot of people don't know that.

1818
02:19:45,174 --> 02:19:56,343
A senior citizen, a senior citizen in Medford Square trying to figure out how to put money in the machine when they didn't have any change and they didn't have a credit card and trying to figure it out.

1819
02:19:57,083 --> 02:19:57,844
It just doesn't work.

1820
02:19:58,164 --> 02:19:59,645
Medford is not that type of a community.

1821
02:20:00,586 --> 02:20:03,188
Why the mayor is doing this, I have absolutely no idea.

1822
02:20:03,928 --> 02:20:05,950
But again, he's in complete violation

1823
02:20:06,905 --> 02:20:12,611
The contract has been in complete violation, you know, since this thing operated.

1824
02:20:12,751 --> 02:20:13,812
It's beginning.

1825
02:20:14,232 --> 02:20:15,914
What about the credit cards that you're putting in?

1826
02:20:16,875 --> 02:20:19,357
And they're reading the wrong numbers for the license plate.

1827
02:20:20,078 --> 02:20:21,559
Last week we got a complete description.

1828
02:20:21,599 --> 02:20:31,829
I have a complete description here from a nurse, a doctor, and the patients that just couldn't negotiate what's going on in Riverside Avenue in that big, huge parking lot.

1829
02:20:32,852 --> 02:20:41,239
Imagine, we came here, had a big discussion with the people from Republic who stood at that podium that night and said, we are going to go over because the seniors were having a problem.

1830
02:20:41,259 --> 02:20:43,101
We'll probably give them 25 pocket spaces.

1831
02:20:43,341 --> 02:20:44,221
That was in January.

1832
02:20:44,602 --> 02:20:53,289
And now they're going to go there on April 3rd, which isn't even here yet, April 3rd, to show and discuss with them how to put the money in the machine, which is almost 400 feet away from

1833
02:20:54,550 --> 02:20:56,051
from where they park their cars.

1834
02:20:56,111 --> 02:20:57,331
It makes absolutely no sense at all.

1835
02:20:57,552 --> 02:20:59,432
Go outside and sit in front of City Hall over here.

1836
02:20:59,693 --> 02:21:07,717
They have a stupid little meter on the corner of the road over there, so if you park all the way in the parking lot over here, you're gonna figure out I gotta walk all the way over here.

1837
02:21:08,117 --> 02:21:09,057
It doesn't make any sense.

1838
02:21:10,178 --> 02:21:13,540
Mr. President, page four of the contract.

1839
02:21:16,461 --> 02:21:24,285
I am going to suggest tonight that the city exercises its right, as it states here, to fully terminate this contract

1840
02:21:24,666 --> 02:21:26,667
with Republic before it gets any worse.

1841
02:21:27,528 --> 02:21:35,553
We haven't even seen, we haven't even seen, as we've been told, the next phase of where these kiosks are going to go in.

1842
02:21:35,913 --> 02:21:40,236
There are business districts and streets and locations that don't even have them yet.

1843
02:21:40,896 --> 02:21:45,079
Once they have them, this is just going to accelerate and multiply.

1844
02:21:45,099 --> 02:21:47,721
I'm going to make an offer here for the mayor tonight.

1845
02:21:48,241 --> 02:21:52,904
He can go out of this thing being a hero, rather than having the council come after him.

1846
02:21:52,964 --> 02:21:54,485
Mr. Mayor, this is what I'm saying to you.

1847
02:21:55,311 --> 02:22:01,113
You came to the council a few years ago, and you asked us to take a million point two out of our water and sewer surplus account.

1848
02:22:02,133 --> 02:22:05,694
Councilman Marks was the only one that voted against it, and looking back, he did the right thing.

1849
02:22:06,195 --> 02:22:09,596
Probably the worst mistake I ever made, but I gave it to you at that point in time.

1850
02:22:09,636 --> 02:22:13,457
Never a thank you in return, because that's what we needed to balance the budget.

1851
02:22:14,197 --> 02:22:16,158
I'm asking you to take whatever it is

1852
02:22:17,245 --> 02:22:45,029
You take the cost of what the contract says, of what it cost them to put this thing together, you amortize that over the minus the deductions of what we're being paid, and we'll pay the difference, seven, eight, nine hundred thousand dollars, let these people leave this community, let the people go back to their normal way of owning and operating their small little business, not being afraid of getting tagged and towed and ticketed wrongly, not being afraid to know that I'm going to lose a customer,

1853
02:22:45,416 --> 02:22:54,540
because they didn't put the money in the meter, not to be afraid of a lady falling down and the snow that's going to be taken by an ambulance to the hospital because she was trying to put her money into the kiosk.

1854
02:22:55,240 --> 02:23:03,483
Go out a hero and admit that we made a mistake and we're going to go back to the original idea of having traffic enforcement.

1855
02:23:03,924 --> 02:23:05,204
We will do this in-house.

1856
02:23:05,484 --> 02:23:08,846
We will get local people and we'll move ourselves forward.

1857
02:23:09,386 --> 02:23:14,408
And I think everybody at that point in time would say thank you, Mr. Mayor, for understanding

1858
02:23:14,775 --> 02:23:16,336
the impact that this is going to have.

1859
02:23:16,717 --> 02:23:20,380
You know, Councilor Camuslo, you said something in one of the very first meetings a long time ago.

1860
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:23,903
You turned around and said that you were in favor of putting parking meters.

1861
02:23:24,484 --> 02:23:30,649
And if parking meters were going to be the issue then, like it would be now, I don't think anybody would have, I think they would have understood it.

1862
02:23:31,069 --> 02:23:34,332
But this has turned out to be a major, major disaster.

1863
02:23:34,953 --> 02:23:40,598
With that being said, Mr. President, I get pictures, I get more and more stories, I get more and more people.

1864
02:23:40,999 --> 02:23:42,599
giving me the authority to use their names.

1865
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:43,940
I think it's obvious.

1866
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:45,820
And you know the thing that's really funny about all this?

1867
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:51,201
Can you imagine the mayor having the audacity, and that's the word I would use, the audacity to say, he hasn't received one complaint.

1868
02:23:51,801 --> 02:23:55,602
He hasn't received one complaint on this traffic program.

1869
02:23:56,443 --> 02:23:59,303
Go walk the streets, Mr. Mayor.

1870
02:23:59,543 --> 02:24:00,844
Go walk the streets.

1871
02:24:00,964 --> 02:24:01,744
Look at these people.

1872
02:24:01,844 --> 02:24:02,764
Ask them what they say.

1873
02:24:04,444 --> 02:24:05,205
Unbelievable.

1874
02:24:06,065 --> 02:24:07,325
That being said, Mr. President,

1875
02:24:07,853 --> 02:24:08,894
I know it could be a tough vote.

1876
02:24:08,994 --> 02:24:10,236
Maybe people will want to vote for it.

1877
02:24:10,276 --> 02:24:10,836
Maybe they won't.

1878
02:24:10,896 --> 02:24:12,298
But the message goes back to the mayor.

1879
02:24:13,058 --> 02:24:14,260
You can do it one of two ways.

1880
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:21,367
You can voluntarily get out of it or the council is going to make a suggestion that you go out of it and terminate this contract with Republic.

1881
02:24:22,228 --> 02:24:30,096
And I don't think there's anybody in this room and any businesses in this community that would turn around and say, OK, we can do that, you know, and if we have a problem,

1882
02:24:30,541 --> 02:24:36,024
If we have a problem with enforcement, we will address it, but we will address it in-house, and we will start very slow.

1883
02:24:36,504 --> 02:24:45,470
We don't have to have an out-of-town company called Republic from Tennessee, who takes almost 68% of the net profit before the city of Memphis sees a dime.

1884
02:24:46,590 --> 02:24:53,434
And now we're going to be dealing with this type of aggressive taxation on the people of this community.

1885
02:24:53,894 --> 02:24:55,295
Plus, it's a 10-year contract.

1886
02:24:55,515 --> 02:24:59,998
How many of these 10-year contracts does this mayor think the people in this community

1887
02:25:00,879 --> 02:25:01,420
should stomach.

1888
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:02,000
It's wrong.

1889
02:25:02,401 --> 02:25:03,281
There's no need for this.

1890
02:25:03,762 --> 02:25:25,620
So, with that being said, Mr. President, I move that the city of Medford remove itself, terminate its contract with the Republic of Tennessee—I think that's the name—Republic Parking of Tennessee in the best interests of the taxpayers, the small business people, and the city of Medford as a whole.

1891
02:25:26,881 --> 02:25:27,982
Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

1892
02:25:28,062 --> 02:25:28,783
Councilor Caviello.

1893
02:25:29,424 --> 02:25:30,144
Thank you, Mr. President.

1894
02:25:30,164 --> 02:25:40,868
You know, I, my opinions on this is as in-depth as Councillor Pentland's are, but, you know, this company's been in town for four to five months now, and they haven't managed to get their act together.

1895
02:25:42,068 --> 02:25:50,471
I mean, listen, I appreciate they've made changes here and there, but, you know, we're to the point now where you should have had the majority of the bugs worked out.

1896
02:25:51,751 --> 02:25:57,933
I mean, you know, the point of them still taking money on Sundays and after hours is

1897
02:25:58,695 --> 02:25:59,715
Not acceptable at all.

1898
02:26:00,736 --> 02:26:07,658
I mean, what happened to a certain percentage of the employees were going to be Method Residents?

1899
02:26:07,678 --> 02:26:08,379
I only know one.

1900
02:26:10,659 --> 02:26:14,821
I only know one Method Resident that was hired to work on this parking program.

1901
02:26:15,161 --> 02:26:20,563
I haven't seen one person that's all day giving out tickets that's a Method Resident.

1902
02:26:20,583 --> 02:26:23,984
Maybe I might be wrong, maybe I don't know them, but I don't see that.

1903
02:26:24,264 --> 02:26:25,625
I mean, and the other thing is, you know,

1904
02:26:26,883 --> 02:26:30,785
These people that are out there ticketing are arrogant.

1905
02:26:32,165 --> 02:26:33,506
They're just out and out arrogant.

1906
02:26:34,126 --> 02:26:35,827
People are saying, hey, look, I was just doing this.

1907
02:26:36,127 --> 02:26:36,587
I don't care.

1908
02:26:37,147 --> 02:26:37,807
Appeal the ticket.

1909
02:26:38,608 --> 02:26:39,668
It's not the attitude to have.

1910
02:26:40,569 --> 02:26:42,069
That wasn't what I signed up for here.

1911
02:26:42,629 --> 02:26:44,990
I was in favor of the parking.

1912
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:51,193
But I wasn't in favor of a plan that's just gone wrong from day one.

1913
02:26:52,013 --> 02:26:56,135
I mean, listen, we had a bad winter, and that accounts for part of it.

1914
02:26:56,628 --> 02:26:59,530
It's because they're not getting the revenues that were anticipated.

1915
02:26:59,910 --> 02:27:01,871
You can't go take it out on the backs of the people.

1916
02:27:04,152 --> 02:27:06,033
And I say, I've heard it, I've seen it.

1917
02:27:06,934 --> 02:27:16,218
And I say, I don't know if I would vote to rescind the whole, write a check for $800,000, $900,000 without some discussion.

1918
02:27:17,539 --> 02:27:24,423
But I think this company has to come in before us.

1919
02:27:25,038 --> 02:27:54,368
either either council the whole or are in front of this this this body but again you know they're they're just running run just run shadow over everybody in town so I'd like to say that we have them come into a council the whole meeting where we can discuss this for a reasonable time and I want to know the amount of method people that were hired to work here again I've only seen one I want to know we're supposed to be like 50 or 60 percent of the people that were hired

1920
02:27:56,319 --> 02:27:56,779
Where are they?

1921
02:27:56,799 --> 02:27:57,860
I want some names.

1922
02:27:58,760 --> 02:28:01,362
Councillor, if I could just from the Chair clarify one thing.

1923
02:28:02,243 --> 02:28:06,945
In the beginning of this, you had asked for a, I think, a three-month review of this.

1924
02:28:06,965 --> 02:28:07,926
Two-month review?

1925
02:28:08,967 --> 02:28:10,327
Where are we with that?

1926
02:28:10,367 --> 02:28:13,950
We're well past that date, Mr. President.

1927
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:15,811
We're well past that date.

1928
02:28:16,171 --> 02:28:20,994
Resolution is 14795, December 3rd, 60-day review.

1929
02:28:21,014 --> 02:28:24,236
60-day review, and that was requested when, Councillor?

1930
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:26,481
December 23rd.

1931
02:28:26,801 --> 02:28:36,069
But again, these people need to have... Counselor, repeat that, please.

1932
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:37,610
I'm sorry.

1933
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:50,381
Mr. Counselor, I'll repeat what you just... I said it's time that this group come in here and put these employees on notice that these are people in this community.

1934
02:28:50,981 --> 02:28:53,163
They're not here to be treated like animals.

1935
02:28:54,527 --> 02:29:00,390
And also, you know, put up a sign so the people can see where the meter is.

1936
02:29:01,230 --> 02:29:02,391
The meters are at car level.

1937
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:07,754
City of Boston, City of Cambridge, there's a big tall sign, pay meter here.

1938
02:29:09,094 --> 02:29:09,334
Yes.

1939
02:29:09,474 --> 02:29:10,815
And that's part of the problem.

1940
02:29:10,835 --> 02:29:12,996
People can't see where these meters are.

1941
02:29:13,096 --> 02:29:15,838
And if you want to contain it, there's not enough of them.

1942
02:29:16,758 --> 02:29:18,079
There's not enough of them in certain areas.

1943
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:22,341
You know, in front of the Citizens Bank,

1944
02:29:23,783 --> 02:29:28,065
There's those four spots and all those, and on the side there, there's only one kiosk.

1945
02:29:28,085 --> 02:29:29,906
I mean, people are walking all over the place.

1946
02:29:30,646 --> 02:29:40,990
Mr. President, I'd like to make a motion that we either have Republic either come before this council or a meeting or a committee of the whole within the next 14 days.

1947
02:29:41,550 --> 02:29:42,311
Very good, Councillor.

1948
02:29:44,011 --> 02:29:44,512
So moved.

1949
02:29:45,572 --> 02:29:46,092
Councillor Knight.

1950
02:29:46,953 --> 02:29:52,595
Mr. President, I believe last week we did vote by way of resolution to invite the Traffic Commission here as well.

1951
02:29:53,387 --> 02:30:00,431
The traffic commission is the body that's responsible for the oversight, the implementation of the parking program, but more importantly, they're the policy makers.

1952
02:30:00,751 --> 02:30:04,273
They're the ones that set the policy, set the ordinance and the tone.

1953
02:30:05,293 --> 02:30:09,135
Republic's tasked with the job of enforcing our ordinance, and they're doing that.

1954
02:30:09,556 --> 02:30:19,881
I think that it's incumbent upon us and the administration to sit down and point out where the failings are, and then take corrective action.

1955
02:30:20,571 --> 02:30:21,952
Councilor Pinto is absolutely correct.

1956
02:30:22,013 --> 02:30:23,754
The contract is not being adhered to.

1957
02:30:23,794 --> 02:30:25,075
There are violations in the contract.

1958
02:30:26,036 --> 02:30:31,440
I think that, you know, Councilor Caviello's idea is a good one to bring them here in the next 14 days or the next 30 days.

1959
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:41,169
I'd suggest that we say 30 days, Mr. President, for the simple fact that maybe we can meet as a council and come up with our laundry list or our punch list of things that are driving us crazy about this program.

1960
02:30:41,229 --> 02:30:41,949
It's not working.

1961
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:45,272
The violations of the contract are not being adhered to.

1962
02:30:45,685 --> 02:30:49,986
So on and so forth, get this list together and give them an opportunity to remediate the problems that they have.

1963
02:30:50,086 --> 02:30:54,467
I mean, I don't think 30 days, we've already given them two months for a review.

1964
02:30:54,487 --> 02:31:00,608
I think that the review that's coming back from this council and members of the general public are not glaring.

1965
02:31:00,988 --> 02:31:02,609
Point of information, Councilor Caviello.

1966
02:31:02,749 --> 02:31:06,170
No disrespect, Councilor, but we've asked for 60 days.

1967
02:31:06,390 --> 02:31:07,670
We're going into 90 now.

1968
02:31:08,679 --> 02:31:10,160
If you give them 30, it's gonna be 60.

1969
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:15,463
I'm sure that if this whole group, if you give us a week, we'll all have a list.

1970
02:31:16,183 --> 02:31:17,024
And that's all well and good.

1971
02:31:17,064 --> 02:31:18,204
I'm saying let's get the list together.

1972
02:31:18,224 --> 02:31:18,745
Let's give it to them.

1973
02:31:18,765 --> 02:31:19,825
Let's give them 30 days to fix it.

1974
02:31:19,845 --> 02:31:21,927
If you give these guys 30, it's gonna go into 60.

1975
02:31:22,047 --> 02:31:23,968
If they don't fix it within 30, they don't fix it within 30.

1976
02:31:24,008 --> 02:31:26,469
Then we can take our vote on whether or not we want the contract eliminated.

1977
02:31:26,549 --> 02:31:28,670
But I think that we've made a lot of progress.

1978
02:31:29,051 --> 02:31:30,612
We've made a lot of progress and a lot of discussion.

1979
02:31:31,272 --> 02:31:34,394
This city went the whole winter without a parking permit program.

1980
02:31:35,534 --> 02:31:37,255
And they still haven't figured it out.

1981
02:31:39,723 --> 02:31:40,123
It's a shame.

1982
02:31:40,563 --> 02:31:51,225
And I don't disagree with you, Councillor, and quite frankly, I find it kind of asinine to be giving people parking tickets when there are no signs that are out there that say where you can park and where you can't park, and that the signs are inaccurate, so on and so forth.

1983
02:31:51,606 --> 02:31:55,306
And I think that these are real-life issues, you know what I mean?

1984
02:31:55,386 --> 02:31:59,767
So I think that, you know, at the end of the day, is the contract going to be eliminated by the administration?

1985
02:31:59,967 --> 02:32:00,347
I don't know.

1986
02:32:00,847 --> 02:32:01,128
I don't know.

1987
02:32:01,168 --> 02:32:03,288
But if it isn't, if it isn't,

1988
02:32:04,434 --> 02:32:04,734
Then what?

1989
02:32:05,015 --> 02:32:10,439
We're still left with the same project and the same program, and we still need to have these changes take place in order for it to work appropriately.

1990
02:32:15,984 --> 02:32:26,934
Mr. President, you know, a lot of the times when the Republic was here for a couple of meetings and the chief was here, we gave a whole bunch of concerns that we had, and, you know, we got some of our responses back.

1991
02:32:26,974 --> 02:32:30,817
I think the main one was changing the hours from 7 to 7 to 8 to 6.

1992
02:32:32,513 --> 02:32:32,933
I'm sorry.

1993
02:32:32,953 --> 02:32:33,273
I'm sorry.

1994
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:47,071
Also with single head meters.

1995
02:32:47,291 --> 02:32:54,294
Now how do you justify putting up the signs and telling you, you have 30 minute parking, but tagging people?

1996
02:32:54,814 --> 02:32:59,296
And then having the audacity, as Councilor Caviello says, being arrogant, well if you don't like it, appeal it.

1997
02:32:59,796 --> 02:33:06,419
Why should somebody have to appeal something if they're parked in a spot that's legitimately for 30 minutes, and take some time off from work,

1998
02:33:07,159 --> 02:33:08,839
And we don't even have our hearing officer.

1999
02:33:09,160 --> 02:33:11,980
Our hearing officer, unfortunately, she's not in right now.

2000
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:17,942
And now there's some concern that maybe, that Republic is doing some of these hearings.

2001
02:33:17,982 --> 02:33:19,262
I don't know if that's true or false.

2002
02:33:19,302 --> 02:33:20,842
Maybe we should make that as another paper.

2003
02:33:21,182 --> 02:33:24,203
Because if they're doing that, that's, again, outside the scope of this.

2004
02:33:24,903 --> 02:33:30,184
You know, you have parking meters taking money after 7 o'clock at night.

2005
02:33:30,264 --> 02:33:32,845
Councilor Caviello, it was your resolution that said

2006
02:33:34,606 --> 02:33:37,307
No charge for the parking period after the fact.

2007
02:33:38,187 --> 02:33:40,048
You can delay this thing all you want.

2008
02:33:40,108 --> 02:33:42,649
The fact of the matter is they've had more than enough time.

2009
02:33:43,029 --> 02:33:47,671
You can't be driving around since January not having the proper signage on the truck.

2010
02:33:48,011 --> 02:33:51,973
It took these to get the signage on the side of the truck and they were still doing it.

2011
02:33:52,698 --> 02:33:57,462
I spoke to the chief tonight, and the chief turned around and said, I told Dan Nash, you know, this is unacceptable.

2012
02:33:57,822 --> 02:33:59,483
Well, that's not the point of being unacceptable.

2013
02:33:59,543 --> 02:34:00,224
It's a contract.

2014
02:34:00,524 --> 02:34:02,826
If you're in violation of the contract, then so be it.

2015
02:34:03,366 --> 02:34:12,633
We put that guy tonight through the torches of hell, the poor guy at Wendy's over an outside thing, and here a multi-million dollar company comes in, and they can walk around and do anything they want.

2016
02:34:13,093 --> 02:34:14,974
Take the money after six o'clock at night.

2017
02:34:15,654 --> 02:34:17,876
Tag people improperly.

2018
02:34:17,956 --> 02:34:19,797
I won't say illegally, improperly.

2019
02:34:19,817 --> 02:34:21,978
Another guy was in the loading zone.

2020
02:34:22,218 --> 02:34:24,439
Tag a guy who's legitimate in a loading zone.

2021
02:34:25,119 --> 02:34:25,640
It's wrong.

2022
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:27,000
It's wrong, Mr. President.

2023
02:34:28,521 --> 02:34:32,463
It's just plain wrong.

2024
02:34:33,244 --> 02:34:41,648
You guys can do whatever you want, ladies, but all I know is, I'm moving on the question, strongly suggesting to the mayor to terminate the contract ASAP,

2025
02:34:42,202 --> 02:34:48,187
and behalf of the taxpayers of this community, because of their failure to abide by the contract as amended, and that's it.

2026
02:34:48,547 --> 02:34:57,554
You know, another thing, you know, and I think it was you, Adam, who came up with, and rightfully so, the suggestion about the signs, okay?

2027
02:34:58,015 --> 02:35:00,157
It was a violation of the contract and the signs and this and that.

2028
02:35:00,397 --> 02:35:03,279
And now because of that, you don't see any of these signs up.

2029
02:35:03,459 --> 02:35:06,261
If you go and you talk to them and they say, well, it's the city's fault.

2030
02:35:06,702 --> 02:35:07,923
The city's fault for what?

2031
02:35:08,523 --> 02:35:11,846
That you've got the wrong signs up and you're not, and you've not been putting

2032
02:35:12,086 --> 02:35:17,707
the proper signs up, and you haven't changed the two hours to three hours in certain parts of the city.

2033
02:35:18,147 --> 02:35:23,049
And you have certain parts of residential neighborhoods that have kiosks in front of them that don't belong there.

2034
02:35:23,069 --> 02:35:24,549
And don't buy it.

2035
02:35:24,669 --> 02:35:27,390
With all due respect, Mr. President, I'm going to move the question.

2036
02:35:27,410 --> 02:35:27,790
MR. PICARDY.

2037
02:35:27,810 --> 02:35:33,031
Councilor Penton moves the question for termination of the contract with a roll call vote.

2038
02:35:34,131 --> 02:35:41,313
Councilor Caviello had several motions that he offered asking for review, and they were nuanced by Councilor Knight.

2039
02:35:42,758 --> 02:35:45,320
Those seem to be contravening on the same motion.

2040
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:51,124
So the chair awaits a motion to make Councilor Caraviello's amendments a B paper.

2041
02:35:51,485 --> 02:35:52,325
Councilor Caraviello.

2042
02:35:53,006 --> 02:36:00,672
Can I ask Councilor Penta, is his motion that the city of Memphis write a check for $900,000 to Republic to get out of this?

2043
02:36:00,772 --> 02:36:01,893
Whatever the cost is, yes.

2044
02:36:04,515 --> 02:36:11,361
In all due respect, I think before we make a vote to write a $900,000 check, I think we need to have some discussion on that.

2045
02:36:12,067 --> 02:36:19,790
I mean, I'm not happy with the contract there, but I don't know if we should be writing a check for 900,000.

2046
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:24,271
Well, there are violations in the contract that have to have offsets to it.

2047
02:36:24,371 --> 02:36:30,193
Before we make a decision to write a check there, we sit down with the city solicitor and figure out what violations are.

2048
02:36:30,789 --> 02:36:40,771
I'd rather give him the direction rather than sitting down, but again, I've had enough direction, but before this group, as I say to you, I get I get these calls all day long.

2049
02:36:40,791 --> 02:36:43,272
I go down there and meet these people and talk to them with you.

2050
02:36:43,572 --> 02:36:43,992
I just don't.

2051
02:36:44,292 --> 02:36:44,572
I don't.

2052
02:36:44,932 --> 02:36:48,313
I'm not comfortable voting to write a check for $900,000 and until we

2053
02:36:51,819 --> 02:36:57,003
until we know what violations... Well, I don't know if it's 900, that's just... Well, I mean, whatever it happens to be.

2054
02:36:58,784 --> 02:37:01,747
Again, and say, where did these funds come from?

2055
02:37:02,467 --> 02:37:04,168
So, Councillor, you had... I mean, where did these funds come from?

2056
02:37:04,549 --> 02:37:05,209
Well, free cash.

2057
02:37:07,751 --> 02:37:11,574
Point... First of all, the Chair needs a clarification from Councillor Caviello.

2058
02:37:12,214 --> 02:37:18,379
Does he wish his motions to be made as a B paper so that the two motions are not contravening one another?

2059
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:18,599
Yes.

2060
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:19,500
Yes.

2061
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:32,984
If the clerk would, and then we'll have a point of clarification from the Madam Vice President.

2062
02:37:33,924 --> 02:37:43,310
I would like a motion from Councilor Penta, the amendment by Councilor Penta on the termination of the contract.

2063
02:37:45,732 --> 02:37:51,555
And I have Councilor Calviello's request for 14 days for review.

2064
02:37:53,556 --> 02:37:55,218
I don't have the other one.

2065
02:37:55,238 --> 02:37:55,798
The other one is

2066
02:37:56,787 --> 02:38:18,323
...restated, restated on the... ...those are two separate things then, because we're asking on Consul Penta's main motion, which was a motion of discussion, which is a discussion, it had actually no motion,

2067
02:38:19,347 --> 02:38:26,771
that was revised to make a motion that the city immediately back out of this, terminate the contract.

2068
02:38:26,871 --> 02:38:29,913
For the contract, I think it's a 90-day clause, and then they have to work it out.

2069
02:38:30,513 --> 02:38:31,693
So to void the contract.

2070
02:38:32,294 --> 02:38:46,961
And then Councilor Caviello will now have as a B paper a request for the representatives of the Traffic Commission and... No, from Traffic Commission and.

2071
02:38:46,981 --> 02:38:47,041
And.

2072
02:38:47,381 --> 02:38:47,962
And Republic.

2073
02:38:49,032 --> 02:38:57,521
to present themselves before the City Council within the next two weeks to answer the grievances herewith.

2074
02:38:59,023 --> 02:39:00,545
Point of clarification, Councillor Knight.

2075
02:39:20,050 --> 02:39:21,451
Right here, this should be your answer.

2076
02:39:23,552 --> 02:39:24,013
That's it.

2077
02:39:25,173 --> 02:39:26,334
It's on your desk, that's your answer.

2078
02:39:27,114 --> 02:39:34,839
It says, uh, 15, yeah, that's your answer, nothing.

2079
02:39:37,121 --> 02:39:37,601
No answer.

2080
02:39:37,941 --> 02:39:40,183
Uh, point of clarification, Councilor Leong Gokern.

2081
02:39:42,424 --> 02:39:44,525
I'm sorry, uh, Madam Vice President.

2082
02:39:45,246 --> 02:39:47,007
It was back when we were discussing the 900,000.

2083
02:39:48,185 --> 02:40:03,895
I think the point of clarification was not only is it 900,000 to a million dollars to actually buy out of the contract, but we also have hundreds of thousand dollars within our budget this term that we'd have to make up for because the revenues are accounted within our current budget.

2084
02:40:04,476 --> 02:40:07,458
So that's my point of clarification.

2085
02:40:07,498 --> 02:40:09,079
If I could speak on this.

2086
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:17,204
When the chief was involved and he was here three or four weeks in a row, things with OneRepublic

2087
02:40:18,226 --> 02:40:19,447
One with Republic.

2088
02:40:19,887 --> 02:40:21,027
Things were getting resolved.

2089
02:40:21,448 --> 02:40:25,850
There's also things changing within the Traffic Commission on a weekly basis.

2090
02:40:25,890 --> 02:40:38,276
Their last meeting was on March 10th, and if you look, I believe we were all given the minutes, about six pages long, and there's a couple pages with regards to concerns just with regards to the parking management program.

2091
02:40:38,756 --> 02:40:41,798
They did vote to reduce the hours from 7 a.m.

2092
02:40:41,858 --> 02:40:44,499
to 7 p.m., down to 8 a.m.

2093
02:40:44,599 --> 02:40:47,701
to 6 p.m., knocking two hours a day off the

2094
02:40:48,932 --> 02:40:52,794
time when residents and customers do have to pay.

2095
02:40:53,555 --> 02:40:58,617
So I offered, before this contract was signed, a free 15-minute parking.

2096
02:40:58,978 --> 02:41:02,380
Councilor Marks upped it to free 30-minute parking.

2097
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:17,568
If some significant changes are made and Republic adheres to the terms of the contract with regards to placement, signage on vehicles and ticketing the proper way and allowing what Dan from Republic had mentioned, which is the

2098
02:41:19,399 --> 02:41:37,323
a leeway with regards to five to ten minutes before one is ticketed, if they adhere to the fact that they had told us that if somebody is in the process of getting a ticket and the person says that's my car, the person given the ticket would walk away, no questions asked.

2099
02:41:37,883 --> 02:41:46,645
Obviously we're not seeing that, we're not, Republic isn't adhering to what they said at the council floor, so we need to get a grip on that, I think we need to have a meeting

2100
02:41:48,062 --> 02:41:53,924
in the next 14 to 21 days with Republic, with the chief of police, and hammer these out.

2101
02:41:54,344 --> 02:41:55,884
And if things aren't changed, I agree.

2102
02:41:56,764 --> 02:42:00,686
Things aren't going right, and I agree that we will have to do what we have to do.

2103
02:42:00,906 --> 02:42:04,347
But I don't agree with terminating the contract tonight.

2104
02:42:04,367 --> 02:42:09,028
There's too many unanswered questions with regard to our current budget, how we're going to pay the million dollars.

2105
02:42:09,608 --> 02:42:16,030
And, you know, we've had blizzards, a few blizzards, which have hampered everything in this city.

2106
02:42:16,527 --> 02:42:28,391
And I think we need to really sit down and discuss everything that's gone on and everything that needs to take place to better this process and hopefully resolve the issues that are presented.

2107
02:42:32,393 --> 02:42:33,913
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

2108
02:42:33,973 --> 02:42:36,894
Councilor Miles has waited patiently.

2109
02:42:36,974 --> 02:42:37,994
Thank you, Mr. President.

2110
02:42:38,155 --> 02:42:45,297
I share many of the comments by my colleagues that were mentioned behind the reel tonight.

2111
02:42:46,131 --> 02:43:03,676
And, you know, from day one, when the mayor made his proposal, members of this council spoke up and said, Mr. Mayor, when you outsource the enforcement, you're taking all local control out of the hands of the city.

2112
02:43:04,496 --> 02:43:05,657
And we're seeing that now.

2113
02:43:06,277 --> 02:43:09,298
How can you tell a company that has a 10-year contract

2114
02:43:10,052 --> 02:43:17,957
that their revenue is based on whatever ticketing they go out and do, to say, hey, you know what, be a little lax, be a little understanding.

2115
02:43:18,578 --> 02:43:20,459
It's never gonna happen.

2116
02:43:21,139 --> 02:43:22,720
That is their revenue stream.

2117
02:43:23,141 --> 02:43:36,790
You're not gonna get that company to say, you know what, we will be sensitive, we will, you know, if someone's in church, or someone just got out of mass, or someone ran into the store for a second, or someone's in a loading zone,

2118
02:43:37,710 --> 02:43:39,631
and they're just delivering something into their store.

2119
02:43:39,971 --> 02:43:49,354
You're not going to get that type of sensitive nature from this enforcement company.

2120
02:43:49,474 --> 02:43:52,534
That's what they are, they're an enforcement company.

2121
02:43:52,554 --> 02:44:00,437
And my suggestion, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater at this point, because a lot of time and effort went into this,

2122
02:44:02,121 --> 02:44:08,884
My suggestion would be, any parking enforcement program consists of three major components.

2123
02:44:09,324 --> 02:44:12,245
It's maintenance, collections, and enforcement.

2124
02:44:13,266 --> 02:44:17,728
I believe, as I believed from the start, that we can do the enforcement in-house.

2125
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:21,843
We can control how aggressive we want in-house.

2126
02:44:22,244 --> 02:44:24,586
We can hire the employees in-house.

2127
02:44:25,167 --> 02:44:38,560
And if we were to take that component out, leave the other components, the collection, the maintenance to Republic right now, take that one component of just enforcement away from the picture,

2128
02:44:39,537 --> 02:44:45,001
Will that still cost the city $900,000 to opt out a portion of the contract?

2129
02:44:45,441 --> 02:44:46,542
I doubt it very much.

2130
02:44:47,062 --> 02:44:49,063
And maybe that's what we should be exploring.

2131
02:44:49,524 --> 02:45:00,691
Because as I stated from the start, I as one member of the council, and I think many members feel the same behind this reeling, is that once you lose the local control of enforcement, all bets are off.

2132
02:45:01,592 --> 02:45:02,852
And that's what we're seeing right now.

2133
02:45:02,872 --> 02:45:05,194
We're seeing very aggressive enforcement.

2134
02:45:05,770 --> 02:45:12,753
Så my suggestion would be that we asked if council Penta would be amendable to this.

2135
02:45:13,234 --> 02:45:21,338
We asked the mayor to find out what it would take for us to take on the enforcement of this particular project.

2136
02:45:22,498 --> 02:45:28,121
What is the dollar amount so we can opt out of the enforcement and we'll leave everything else in place right now.

2137
02:45:28,541 --> 02:45:32,143
So the city would be responsible for hearings and enforcement.

2138
02:45:32,853 --> 02:45:35,975
If you want to outsource the hearings, that's something you can look at.

2139
02:45:36,455 --> 02:45:39,616
But those would be the two items that the city is responsible for.

2140
02:45:40,017 --> 02:45:48,000
And as Councillor Knight mentioned, other than the Traffic Commission, they're the ones that really set the policy around this.

2141
02:45:48,521 --> 02:45:51,462
So I think if we take that back in-house, the enforcement,

2142
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:56,902
I think we'll go a long way to make sure that we're the city that we wanted to be in the start.

2143
02:45:57,402 --> 02:46:00,244
We don't want to be an aggressive ticketing city.

2144
02:46:00,664 --> 02:46:02,465
That's not what the city of methods all about.

2145
02:46:03,105 --> 02:46:05,226
We want to make sure cars are moved along.

2146
02:46:05,626 --> 02:46:08,967
And that's been the, uh, the emphasis on this from day one.

2147
02:46:09,047 --> 02:46:16,931
So, um, I, I would offer, uh, ask my colleague respectfully, and I think council Penta brings up a lot of valid concerns.

2148
02:46:17,547 --> 02:46:31,051
But I think that may be a good option to put forward, something that I believe will strike at a lot of the concerns that I'm hearing from residents about the aggressive enforcement.

2149
02:46:33,212 --> 02:46:41,895
If I knew there was a way around it, there's no way you're gonna tell a for-profit company, you know what, go a little lax on the ticketing.

2150
02:46:43,095 --> 02:46:43,995
That's their revenue.

2151
02:46:44,556 --> 02:46:47,457
What business is going to say, you know what, Meffin, you're right, we'll go a little lax.

2152
02:46:48,838 --> 02:46:53,300
You know, we won't hit those, we won't hit the residents or the out-of-towners as much.

2153
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:55,361
We'll go easy on the ticketing.

2154
02:46:55,661 --> 02:46:56,961
It's just never going to happen.

2155
02:46:57,902 --> 02:47:06,125
So I would ask my council colleague, Councilor Penter, if he would be amenable to sending that to the mayor to see if we could take that in-house at this point.

2156
02:47:06,486 --> 02:47:09,507
I also noticed in the correspondence we received back from

2157
02:47:11,603 --> 02:47:20,249
regarding paper 15-081 and 15-022 dated March 19th.

2158
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:34,920
We mentioned to the mayor and the parking traffic commission that without permit parking stickers, residents are no longer able to call and say there's someone parked on our street that doesn't belong here.

2159
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:39,023
And we got a response to the paper from the mayor

2160
02:47:39,552 --> 02:47:45,583
saying we are investigating a permit sticker to be placed on all residential permit parking vehicles.

2161
02:47:46,584 --> 02:47:47,686
Wow, that sounds familiar.

2162
02:47:47,706 --> 02:47:50,451
That's what we've done for the last 10 years in the city.

2163
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:58,804
You know, it was this new parking program that said, you know what, we're going to do away with the stickers without any input from anyone.

2164
02:47:59,184 --> 02:48:01,685
And they're finding out, you know what, that doesn't work.

2165
02:48:02,426 --> 02:48:14,852
That doesn't work because a lot of what's the resident permit issues are called on by residents that call calling up and you're tying the residents hand by not having stickers on vehicles.

2166
02:48:15,533 --> 02:48:16,153
So, you know,

2167
02:48:18,220 --> 02:48:33,628
I think, you know, we're at a point where we are at right now, from no enforcement at all, nothing happened in the community, to at least a program, it has a lot of faults, but I think we could stick with a portion of the program and not can the whole program.

2168
02:48:34,209 --> 02:48:38,171
And in my opinion, the enforcement is the big issue right now.

2169
02:48:38,531 --> 02:48:46,315
Let's take that in-house, let's hire our own traffic crossing guards, our own retired police, let's put them on the payroll for 20 hours a week,

2170
02:48:47,177 --> 02:48:52,559
Let's get some enforcement out there that we can control and say, you know what, we don't want it to happen like this.

2171
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:55,341
That would be my recommendation.

2172
02:48:55,361 --> 02:49:01,964
I want to ask my council colleague, Councilor Penta, if he'd be willing to go that direction before we throw the whole program out.

2173
02:49:04,785 --> 02:49:06,126
Councilor Camuso is next.

2174
02:49:10,628 --> 02:49:14,730
One thing we have to be cognizant of the fact is if we

2175
02:49:16,172 --> 02:49:18,113
pay the money to get out of this contract.

2176
02:49:19,513 --> 02:49:22,054
We are still, as a community, going to own the vehicles.

2177
02:49:22,414 --> 02:49:23,715
We're going to own the kiosks.

2178
02:49:24,675 --> 02:49:37,860
And then at that point, we could bring in someone maybe from another community that has done this, like Cambridge or Boston, and then do it in-house.

2179
02:49:38,841 --> 02:49:44,183
But I think we... I'm just not there quite yet, Mr. President.

2180
02:49:45,115 --> 02:49:46,235
I'm not there quite yet.

2181
02:49:48,376 --> 02:50:03,338
But in the right hands, with the city being in control of the whole program, with the state-of-the-art equipment, that's what they call it, not what I've seen firsthand.

2182
02:50:05,558 --> 02:50:14,660
But if we did make the investment, like Councillor Marks said, whether it was on a portion of it or the whole thing, it's not like we're going to scrap the contract

2183
02:50:15,408 --> 02:50:18,249
and just waste $800,000 of taxpayers' money.

2184
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:25,932
We're still gonna have some equity and we're gonna have some assets that come along with all the equipment.

2185
02:50:26,673 --> 02:50:43,900
And I do believe that if the right person, if we had a department head here running this program, that that was their job, not the chief of police who's taxed upon too frequently to deal with this when we have real situations going on in the community that need to be dealt with.

2186
02:50:45,075 --> 02:50:47,637
But to be honest, I'm just not there yet.

2187
02:50:47,877 --> 02:50:49,578
I agree with what Councilor Langel-Kern said.

2188
02:50:51,319 --> 02:50:57,583
This has been a winter that we haven't experienced in ever, ever.

2189
02:50:58,544 --> 02:51:00,065
State of emergency over three days.

2190
02:51:00,125 --> 02:51:06,069
We're trying to get money from Washington because of the amount of snow that we've got from back to back to back storms.

2191
02:51:07,589 --> 02:51:12,653
The city hasn't been able to focus as much time on this as they should have.

2192
02:51:13,568 --> 02:51:20,630
The mayor should have never started this program in January, whether it was snowing out, no snow, I don't care.

2193
02:51:21,071 --> 02:51:29,374
Unless we were south of North Carolina, this program should not have started in the midst of a New England winter.

2194
02:51:31,394 --> 02:51:41,638
This should have started when people were out in a short-sleeved shirt with a pair of Bermuda shorts on, and they could take their time at the kiosk, learn it,

2195
02:51:42,633 --> 02:51:46,634
Not going over snow banks.

2196
02:51:49,075 --> 02:51:52,475
You throw the snow into this mix, and it's been hectic.

2197
02:51:54,196 --> 02:51:57,397
There's a car on Barner Ave that hasn't moved since the snowstorm.

2198
02:51:58,037 --> 02:51:58,597
Hasn't moved.

2199
02:51:58,637 --> 02:52:01,538
It's right around number 18, 14, right around there.

2200
02:52:04,618 --> 02:52:06,959
You're still dealing with snow banks on all the side streets.

2201
02:52:07,519 --> 02:52:11,400
The streets are not back to an acceptable width at no fault of the DPW.

2202
02:52:12,863 --> 02:52:20,505
But with that being said, I'd like to give it a little bit further to see what they can change.

2203
02:52:22,065 --> 02:52:23,866
But Councillor Marks is 100% right.

2204
02:52:24,706 --> 02:52:31,728
He's 100% right when he says there's not any for-profit company that is not out to make the dollar.

2205
02:52:32,288 --> 02:52:35,949
It's all about dollars and cents and bringing in the dollars.

2206
02:52:36,529 --> 02:52:37,609
Let's not anyone fool you.

2207
02:52:38,209 --> 02:52:41,190
And that's going to be the same thing if we go for a for-profit TV channel.

2208
02:52:42,823 --> 02:52:43,664
for public access.

2209
02:52:43,704 --> 02:52:44,584
It's gonna be the same thing.

2210
02:52:45,004 --> 02:52:48,326
It's gonna be the biggest person that pays the most money to get their advertisement on.

2211
02:52:49,527 --> 02:52:55,831
So, when you're dealing with for-profit companies, like Councilor Mark said, everything's out.

2212
02:52:56,952 --> 02:53:08,599
Decisions are made in the boardroom when they're looking at graphs and data and pie charts, and what they wanna do is make those pie charts bigger and bigger and bigger under one of the categories, and that's income.

2213
02:53:10,255 --> 02:53:13,076
They want to make the income go up and the expenses go down.

2214
02:53:13,997 --> 02:53:19,499
That's any for-profit company in the United States, as far as I'm concerned.

2215
02:53:20,139 --> 02:53:27,241
The only time that they want to start slowing down on the revenues is when their tax guy tells them, hey, you're at a point now, why don't you slow down on the revenues?

2216
02:53:27,261 --> 02:53:31,483
And they're not doing it because they want to give the Medford person a break.

2217
02:53:31,523 --> 02:53:39,306
It's because they're being advised by their business people to start slowing down for tax ramification reasons.

2218
02:53:40,434 --> 02:53:54,443
But like I said, at this point, coming off this winter, starting a program that should not have been started in the midst of a winter, I think the mayor was 150% wrong on that decision.

2219
02:53:55,964 --> 02:53:57,745
I don't know how he came to that decision.

2220
02:53:57,765 --> 02:54:04,670
I think a lot of it was this council, as well as the business community and people looking for the enforcement.

2221
02:54:05,471 --> 02:54:08,773
And quite honestly,

2222
02:54:09,864 --> 02:54:10,705
Let's call it like it is.

2223
02:54:11,345 --> 02:54:19,390
This isn't a program you wanted to start three months before the people are getting out to make a determination on who the leaders of this community should be.

2224
02:54:19,810 --> 02:54:23,552
And I'm not saying that that had any bearing on this decision whatsoever.

2225
02:54:24,953 --> 02:54:29,076
But the fact of the matter is, it started during a time that it should not have been started.

2226
02:54:31,017 --> 02:54:36,080
I think we have to give it at least, at least, another month to see where we go now.

2227
02:54:37,041 --> 02:54:38,362
I don't even want to say we're out of the

2228
02:54:40,051 --> 02:54:42,672
We're out of the realm of snow because we are in New England.

2229
02:54:43,592 --> 02:54:53,514
But now that the snow is thawing, I think we're going to have a better understanding on exactly where the program can be improved, where it cannot be improved.

2230
02:54:54,075 --> 02:54:55,655
We've dealt with a lot of these same issues.

2231
02:54:55,995 --> 02:54:59,976
You look back to some of the bigger issues throughout the community since I've been on the council.

2232
02:55:00,476 --> 02:55:05,017
And we had the water meter situation where people weren't letting us in their houses to change the meters.

2233
02:55:06,137 --> 02:55:07,958
And you had to take baby steps.

2234
02:55:08,772 --> 02:55:13,195
And ultimately they figured out how to work together and have the person gain access to the house.

2235
02:55:13,815 --> 02:55:15,796
Then it was the recycling bins.

2236
02:55:16,457 --> 02:55:18,838
People were up in arms over the recycling bins.

2237
02:55:19,118 --> 02:55:23,701
It was as if we were telling people, you can't throw any trash away and we're going to start charging you for trash.

2238
02:55:24,401 --> 02:55:30,805
That was ultimately the way we perceived it, and that's how the people felt at first.

2239
02:55:31,906 --> 02:55:34,508
But as you drive around this community on any given trash day now,

2240
02:55:35,460 --> 02:55:37,321
Everyone said we're not going to have enough room for trash.

2241
02:55:37,361 --> 02:55:40,423
We're definitely not going to have enough room, and I need seven barrels for my house.

2242
02:55:41,123 --> 02:55:48,287
If you don't have a two-family, you see very few and far between people that have out two trash bins that they're paying an extra fee to have that extra barrel.

2243
02:55:48,707 --> 02:55:49,728
Few and far between.

2244
02:55:49,768 --> 02:55:53,370
I mean, I challenge anyone to say differently.

2245
02:55:53,790 --> 02:55:55,751
I mean, that's a fact as you drive around our community.

2246
02:55:56,723 --> 02:56:03,207
The other things, other major things over this community that I've been here for the past 16 years, the building of the new schools.

2247
02:56:03,768 --> 02:56:13,574
There was a lot of animosity, a lot of pushback on it, but over time, over time, people got to like them, and now people are just thrilled.

2248
02:56:13,594 --> 02:56:22,800
We were talking earlier tonight about possibly using money to put more technology in the schools if the city thinks that there's a better use of that money rather than the public access channel.

2249
02:56:23,908 --> 02:56:37,455
So, but I'm just, I'm referring to some of the major, major stumbling blocks that were, you would have thought that the world was coming to an end during some of those issues here in our community because of the complaints and everything else we heard.

2250
02:56:38,675 --> 02:56:51,201
But as a community, everyone worked together and got to the point where they may not have loved the trash program, the new schools, this or that, but at least it was acceptable and tolerated for lack of a better word.

2251
02:56:53,413 --> 02:56:59,495
I think we have to be cognizant of the fact that we have to be open and fair to the community.

2252
02:57:00,456 --> 02:57:09,179
And at the appropriate time, I have no problem whatsoever taking a vote when I feel the end all be all and they're just totally out of the contract.

2253
02:57:09,299 --> 02:57:17,522
And let's be honest right now too, if we tried to go after them legally and say we want to suspend the contract and Mark Rumley has to go to Middlesex Superior Court.

2254
02:57:17,787 --> 02:57:21,368
and say it's because they don't have magnets on the back of their truck that say stay back.

2255
02:57:21,808 --> 02:57:27,410
Don't even spend the $250 filing fee, because we're going to get laughed right out of that courtroom, Mr. President.

2256
02:57:28,090 --> 02:57:33,932
And when we hear, when the business owners and stuff, the judges are going to want to hear that, our jury or anything.

2257
02:57:34,172 --> 02:57:42,915
They're going to want to know where the city was financially damaged by it and by the things, the citizens are financially damaged because of the enforcement.

2258
02:57:43,495 --> 02:57:44,095
But as of right now,

2259
02:57:44,818 --> 02:57:48,100
I just don't think that they're in breach of contract enough where it would stand up.

2260
02:57:48,281 --> 02:57:49,061
I'm not an attorney.

2261
02:57:49,101 --> 02:57:53,625
We have one of the finest city solicitors in the Commonwealth, if not the United States, that works within our building.

2262
02:57:54,065 --> 02:58:03,152
That if and when it comes to that time, him and his assistant city solicitor would be going to bat for this community.

2263
02:58:03,612 --> 02:58:05,734
But I just don't think we're there at this point.

2264
02:58:05,854 --> 02:58:07,195
I'm starting to repeat myself.

2265
02:58:07,755 --> 02:58:11,558
So I'm going to cease my comments.

2266
02:58:11,978 --> 02:58:14,060
But I cannot support it this evening.

2267
02:58:14,633 --> 02:58:24,044
But I am getting closer to be able to take a vote in good faith that the program may not be in the best interest.

2268
02:58:24,644 --> 02:58:29,690
But I think people have to realize that it's not as Councillor Caviello said, we're going to just shell away 800,000, 900,000.

2269
02:58:32,169 --> 02:58:38,694
It would be more that we're acquiring equipment, we're acquiring assets, and then it would be something like Councilor Marks stated.

2270
02:58:39,014 --> 02:58:44,138
You bring in someone for $75,000, $80,000 a year that knows parking management.

2271
02:58:44,238 --> 02:58:52,525
I mean, Councilor Marks traversed this whole area with Ronnie DeFranco and the Chief and Gwendolyn Blackburn when they were going to surrounding communities.

2272
02:58:52,765 --> 02:58:54,947
There's people that specialize in just this.

2273
02:58:55,967 --> 02:58:57,248
Just this.

2274
02:58:57,328 --> 02:58:59,190
Somerville can do it, Cambridge can do it,

2275
02:59:01,309 --> 02:59:03,489
You know what the difference is?

2276
02:59:04,270 --> 02:59:10,291
And I think... I can say this now because I'm not on the ballot in November.

2277
02:59:11,111 --> 02:59:17,172
The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, you go to Cambridge, you're paying the park to go to work.

2278
02:59:17,432 --> 02:59:20,733
Or you're paying the park to go into jury duty at the courthouse.

2279
02:59:20,773 --> 02:59:25,694
You're paying the park to actually go to something that you have to attend.

2280
02:59:27,108 --> 02:59:31,590
The problem right now we're having is people are paying to park.

2281
02:59:31,831 --> 02:59:38,434
We have to do more as a community to bring in more quality businesses to help sustain these other smaller businesses that are having a hard time.

2282
02:59:38,474 --> 02:59:43,777
It's not a result of the parking that bestsellers went out of business or Ward's Gift is closing their doors.

2283
02:59:43,817 --> 02:59:44,518
This just started.

2284
02:59:44,538 --> 02:59:48,560
It may be a convenient excuse for people to say that that's why the business is a

2285
02:59:49,015 --> 02:59:53,758
We have to do more as a community to bring people in that are going to want to pay the quarter to park.

2286
02:59:54,278 --> 02:59:54,979
We're starting that.

2287
02:59:55,039 --> 02:59:57,680
We've got Carol's Diner in Medford Square.

2288
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:59,821
He's booming on the weekend.

2289
03:00:01,722 --> 03:00:09,247
We have to do more as a community to bring people to these centers and towns and squares.

2290
03:00:11,023 --> 03:00:20,766
All too often, there's too many storefronts that are vacant, and I haven't really heard much from the mayor on giving tax credits to bring in quality businesses and things like that.

2291
03:00:21,366 --> 03:00:26,747
Malden, the one business that I think we've did that for was Hof's Bakery.

2292
03:00:27,367 --> 03:00:34,169
Hof's Bakery got a break on their tax obligations because they were hiring X amount of people, they were staying here, and what did they just do?

2293
03:00:34,689 --> 03:00:36,610
They're moving to Malden because

2294
03:00:37,685 --> 03:00:39,806
Maldon's got an incentive for them to go there, I'm sure.

2295
03:00:39,826 --> 03:00:44,789
Whether it's the landlord, whether it's the city, whatever it may be, they're moving.

2296
03:00:45,170 --> 03:00:46,891
This is the stuff that we have to do.

2297
03:00:47,191 --> 03:00:54,315
Medford Square, we've been talking about the Medford Square revitalization for as long as... I was at the Gleason School when they were talking about it.

2298
03:00:54,476 --> 03:00:55,536
That was probably the first study.

2299
03:00:56,057 --> 03:00:57,077
When I was at the Gleason School in 1989, 1990.

2300
03:00:57,137 --> 03:00:58,198
This is where we have to get aggressive.

2301
03:01:01,847 --> 03:01:04,090
We have to get aggressive and make people want to come here.

2302
03:01:04,150 --> 03:01:09,158
And this is not being insultive to the businesses that we have.

2303
03:01:10,219 --> 03:01:10,620
It's not.

2304
03:01:12,122 --> 03:01:12,964
But I said it before.

2305
03:01:13,945 --> 03:01:15,587
We have to do something with the liquor licenses.

2306
03:01:16,812 --> 03:01:23,253
The liquor license, the 99s and the Texas Roadhouses and the rest of them, those are middle of the road places.

2307
03:01:23,273 --> 03:01:24,333
They don't even look at Medford.

2308
03:01:24,493 --> 03:01:30,395
They don't even look at Medford because you have to have a burger in order to have a beverage.

2309
03:01:30,955 --> 03:01:33,755
And these are the things that we have to do as a community.

2310
03:01:34,375 --> 03:01:39,636
And this council has been working towards that.

2311
03:01:40,156 --> 03:01:42,697
This evening, we granted a few licenses that hopefully

2312
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:44,390
Help out the businesses.

2313
03:01:45,030 --> 03:01:50,091
But this city has to be more forward thinking when it comes to bringing in quality businesses.

2314
03:01:50,451 --> 03:01:52,712
You can only talk about station landing for so long.

2315
03:01:53,332 --> 03:01:54,172
It's like the new schools.

2316
03:01:54,952 --> 03:01:57,232
Stations landing was a great improvement to that area.

2317
03:01:57,812 --> 03:01:58,933
But how many years ago was it?

2318
03:02:01,073 --> 03:02:01,733
10, 12 years ago.

2319
03:02:03,113 --> 03:02:05,974
We have to start looking to do more things like that.

2320
03:02:06,494 --> 03:02:10,075
You got Shaw's Supermarket down here, which is an eyesore.

2321
03:02:10,515 --> 03:02:11,695
It was a snow pile for

2322
03:02:12,624 --> 03:02:15,737
For the whole winter, you gotta dodge snowbanks to go to Eastern Bank.

2323
03:02:17,063 --> 03:02:17,786
In the parking lot.

2324
03:02:19,199 --> 03:02:21,621
But I'm sorry I'm getting off topic a little bit here.

2325
03:02:22,081 --> 03:02:24,563
But that's where we got to go.

2326
03:02:24,703 --> 03:02:26,064
We got to do more as a community on that.

2327
03:02:26,084 --> 03:02:27,025
And that starts at the top.

2328
03:02:27,405 --> 03:02:30,368
That starts with the city administration working with his OCD director.

2329
03:02:30,768 --> 03:02:31,849
And let's not kid ourselves.

2330
03:02:31,929 --> 03:02:34,071
I often feel bad for our OCD director.

2331
03:02:34,531 --> 03:02:35,492
And I'm going to finish on this.

2332
03:02:35,812 --> 03:02:43,618
I often feel bad on our OCD director when sometimes this council or members of this council or the council in general or people in the community

2333
03:02:44,756 --> 03:02:47,097
may say they don't do a thing or this or that.

2334
03:02:47,338 --> 03:02:47,938
That's not true.

2335
03:02:48,458 --> 03:02:52,880
They're doing what the person in the corner office is giving them the green light to do.

2336
03:02:54,141 --> 03:02:55,301
Whether it's fair or unfair.

2337
03:02:55,361 --> 03:02:57,843
Our OCD director in this community is Michael McGlynn.

2338
03:02:59,063 --> 03:03:03,585
He's our OCD director slash mayor slash traffic enforcement guy slash treasurer collector.

2339
03:03:04,106 --> 03:03:07,527
So anyone that thinks any different, you're sadly mistaken.

2340
03:03:08,708 --> 03:03:10,409
But that's enough on that.

2341
03:03:10,889 --> 03:03:13,150
But as far as this, I cannot support it this evening.

2342
03:03:13,641 --> 03:03:22,347
But I think in due time, if it continues this way, Mr. President, I'm sorry for being long-winded, but I think it's a bigger picture we have to focus on than rather just this parking.

2343
03:03:22,507 --> 03:03:22,807
Thank you.

2344
03:03:22,827 --> 03:03:26,650
We're going to take our votes as soon as Councilor Knight and the citizens speak.

2345
03:03:26,690 --> 03:03:27,430
May I rest my case?

2346
03:03:28,111 --> 03:03:28,991
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2347
03:03:29,051 --> 03:03:30,252
Sir, you wish to address the Council?

2348
03:03:30,813 --> 03:03:31,713
Yes, Mr. President.

2349
03:03:31,753 --> 03:03:32,634
My name is Michael Leggero.

2350
03:03:32,674 --> 03:03:34,075
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

2351
03:03:35,656 --> 03:03:40,659
I'm worried that there's perhaps a false dichotomy forming.

2352
03:03:42,158 --> 03:03:48,482
republic has violated the contract, then there's going to be no charge to the city of Medford.

2353
03:03:49,082 --> 03:03:51,963
Um, I bring the council's attention to number 23.

2354
03:03:52,664 --> 03:04:01,168
If there is a non of the contract page 15, if there is a non-monetary violation of the contract, they have 30 days to fix it.

2355
03:04:01,189 --> 03:04:02,489
And if they don't, that's it.

2356
03:04:02,629 --> 03:04:03,810
End of contract, no fee.

2357
03:04:04,710 --> 03:04:09,273
Um, and on, as you mentioned, uh, counselor Penta on, uh,

2358
03:04:10,095 --> 03:04:17,297
Attachment RF0100, which is also mentioned in the contract, they have to identify license plates with a 98% accuracy.

2359
03:04:17,837 --> 03:04:27,360
If they're tagging people at a 30-minute stop and they haven't been there for 15 minutes, that's also in violation of the contract.

2360
03:04:27,420 --> 03:04:28,721
They would have to address that.

2361
03:04:29,761 --> 03:04:35,803
Also, another issue, just a clarification, if we break the contract and we are found to be in fault,

2362
03:04:36,177 --> 03:04:37,518
We don't own any of the equipment.

2363
03:04:37,558 --> 03:04:38,158
It's all theirs.

2364
03:04:39,499 --> 03:04:41,841
At least the kiosks and a majority of the equipment.

2365
03:04:41,941 --> 03:04:47,985
So if we do break the contract and we are found to be in fault, the equipment goes back to Republic.

2366
03:04:48,306 --> 03:04:48,526
Thank you.

2367
03:04:49,346 --> 03:04:49,767
Thank you.

2368
03:04:50,727 --> 03:05:01,535
So on the motion of Councilor Penta, and I will read it, offered by Councilor Penta be it resolved that the city terminate its parking contract with Republic from Tennessee

2369
03:05:02,012 --> 03:05:14,238
pursuant to contract section 5, paragraph B11, or II, in the interest of the taxpayers of the city, small businesses, and the city as a whole.

2370
03:05:16,159 --> 03:05:23,223
And I think we separated the two with a B paper offered by Councilor Caravaglio, so we take the B paper first.

2371
03:05:23,908 --> 03:05:32,715
So on that B paper offered by Councilor Caviello, which we clarified earlier this evening, all those in favor?

2372
03:05:33,476 --> 03:05:34,376
Councilor Camuso?

2373
03:05:37,659 --> 03:05:43,544
Well, Councilor Caviello's motion is calling to send this to the Committee of the Whole within 14 days.

2374
03:05:45,325 --> 03:05:47,087
As a council, I think we're all on the same page.

2375
03:05:48,187 --> 03:05:51,250
Rather than take the vote this evening, would you respectfully

2376
03:05:51,678 --> 03:05:53,939
Put it aside for 14 days, it's totally your prerogative.

2377
03:05:54,819 --> 03:05:55,079
Okay.

2378
03:05:57,640 --> 03:05:59,661
Councillor Pinto is going to share with us the reason why.

2379
03:06:01,542 --> 03:06:02,242
I heard what you said.

2380
03:06:02,462 --> 03:06:03,322
I heard what everybody said.

2381
03:06:04,563 --> 03:06:08,064
That this is what I get every single day between phone calls and dealing with people.

2382
03:06:08,564 --> 03:06:12,366
And the fact of the matter is that that guy over there says nobody's complained.

2383
03:06:12,846 --> 03:06:17,488
Well, if nobody's complained to him and we've all heard the complaints, either by phone calls, letters,

2384
03:06:18,530 --> 03:06:21,094
people getting tagged signs going up.

2385
03:06:21,615 --> 03:06:22,316
There was nothing.

2386
03:06:22,356 --> 03:06:26,082
There's no honoring that for which the contract says they were supposed to be doing.

2387
03:06:27,598 --> 03:06:28,999
I'm not going to continue to go on.

2388
03:06:29,179 --> 03:06:30,701
There are more important things to do out here.

2389
03:06:30,761 --> 03:06:33,423
We have a resolution coming up talking about potholes in the city.

2390
03:06:34,403 --> 03:06:35,364
That's going to be huge.

2391
03:06:35,464 --> 03:06:36,705
It's going to be so huge.

2392
03:06:37,666 --> 03:06:39,147
That's just one of many things.

2393
03:06:40,028 --> 03:06:43,290
And the mayor's worried about having his community day, having this and having that.

2394
03:06:43,610 --> 03:06:49,054
I'm more concerned about how this city should run according to every single day.

2395
03:06:49,275 --> 03:06:51,476
You know, you can talk about the snowstorm all you want.

2396
03:06:52,177 --> 03:06:54,599
What's a snowstorm have to do with somebody doing their job?

2397
03:06:55,570 --> 03:07:00,173
So if there's an embargo on there because of a snowstorm, okay, nobody got your tickets?

2398
03:07:00,413 --> 03:07:03,575
Point of information, I was referring to the snow emergency that was in effect.

2399
03:07:03,735 --> 03:07:07,137
I'm saying, no tickets on the snow emergency, we understand, they gave tickets, whatever it is.

2400
03:07:07,157 --> 03:07:09,258
It was a three-week emergency, unheard of, that's the leadership.

2401
03:07:09,619 --> 03:07:15,482
But putting that aside, that should not stop life from going on, from them to do their job, like they're supposed to.

2402
03:07:16,022 --> 03:07:21,706
I shouldn't have to speak to the chief every time, and he tells me, I spoke to Dan Nash, they're supposed to be doing this, they're supposed to be doing that,

2403
03:07:22,648 --> 03:07:44,525
When people get a ticket, and this is what did it for me today, yesterday, when people get a ticket, and they're parked legitimately, and they have to go and appeal the ticket, and take time off from work, knowing that they were in the proper spot, and then the guy has, you talk about being arrogant, that's the bottom line, being arrogant, not even I'm sorry, when it's supposed to be eight to six.

2404
03:07:45,298 --> 03:07:48,959
And they're still collecting money out of the machines after seven o'clock at night.

2405
03:07:49,659 --> 03:07:55,660
When you, Councilor Caviello, on January 2nd talked about having the fascia of the machine in good shape, and it's still.

2406
03:07:56,641 --> 03:08:00,341
We asked to put a light on top of the kiosk so people could see something at nighttime.

2407
03:08:00,701 --> 03:08:03,922
And what about somebody coming into the square late at night or in the afternoon?

2408
03:08:03,962 --> 03:08:10,244
How are they supposed to figure out that that box way down the street, I've got to go get a ticket and walk it back to my car?

2409
03:08:10,484 --> 03:08:12,064
And who the hell didn't remember their number plate?

2410
03:08:12,304 --> 03:08:15,106
and put the quarter in, and not put the quarter in, and the credit card.

2411
03:08:15,146 --> 03:08:15,706
No, I'm sorry.

2412
03:08:16,046 --> 03:08:17,867
I hear what all you said, but you know something?

2413
03:08:18,728 --> 03:08:20,328
I say it, I do it every single day.

2414
03:08:21,609 --> 03:08:24,331
As far as I'm concerned, the mayor can do it, doesn't have to do it.

2415
03:08:24,371 --> 03:08:26,092
You guys can vote on it, don't vote on it.

2416
03:08:26,112 --> 03:08:28,253
This is how I feel, and this is the direction I want to go.

2417
03:08:28,273 --> 03:08:30,294
But you may have the votes for it at a later date.

2418
03:08:30,654 --> 03:08:32,315
Well, maybe at a later date, we'll see.

2419
03:08:32,655 --> 03:08:33,135
Councilor Knight?

2420
03:08:34,436 --> 03:08:35,517
Yes, Mr. President.

2421
03:08:35,897 --> 03:08:39,879
I too feel as though it's premature to take a vote to opt out of the contract.

2422
03:08:40,732 --> 03:08:53,901
I think that, you know, we have a very divided council right now, but it's a council that's willing to take a look at the direction that our traffic commission is going in and try to work towards putting some resolutions and resolves in place.

2423
03:08:55,162 --> 03:08:58,364
With that being said, you know, last week we did pass a resolution.

2424
03:08:58,484 --> 03:09:01,226
We asked the traffic commission to come and appear before us with Republic.

2425
03:09:02,146 --> 03:09:06,289
My council colleague, Councillor Caviello, referred to a response that we received in our packet.

2426
03:09:06,409 --> 03:09:09,211
However, that response wasn't to the paper that we just passed last week.

2427
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:19,196
So I think that, you know, we're going down one course and one train, and we're saying, come on down, let's talk about this, let's figure out what's going on, and let's come up with some sort of plan that can work for us.

2428
03:09:19,777 --> 03:09:23,459
And now, a week later, we're saying, forget about it, let's eliminate the plan in its entirety.

2429
03:09:24,239 --> 03:09:26,621
I think we're sending mixed signals and mixed messages.

2430
03:09:27,681 --> 03:09:30,363
I certainly like the solution that Councillor Marks had.

2431
03:09:30,383 --> 03:09:34,926
I thought that was an out-of-the-box way of looking at the situation, and I think that that's where the problem lies.

2432
03:09:34,946 --> 03:09:37,507
I think the problem really does lie with over-aggressive enforcement.

2433
03:09:37,911 --> 03:09:44,493
and then, you know, a very reasonable traffic commission that's willing to address some of those issues that come up.

2434
03:09:44,973 --> 03:09:47,614
So we have aggressive enforcement with a reasonable traffic commission.

2435
03:09:48,034 --> 03:09:50,995
Maybe the enforcement arm is the problem.

2436
03:09:51,335 --> 03:10:00,038
So, you know, I think that this item needs a little bit more time to be hashed out, a little bit more time to be vetted properly, Mr. President, before I'm ready to take a vote to say that the program should be eliminated.

2437
03:10:01,858 --> 03:10:03,619
As being said, Mr. President, I'd move on the question.

2438
03:10:07,470 --> 03:10:13,492
I would ask you, is this in proper form to be voted on at this point, where it's not our jurisdiction?

2439
03:10:14,673 --> 03:10:16,273
The mayor is the signatory authority.

2440
03:10:19,215 --> 03:10:20,135
I just asked the question.

2441
03:10:22,276 --> 03:10:29,098
Another paper of this nature was ruled out of order a few weeks ago, and then it was withdrawn by the petitioner.

2442
03:10:29,899 --> 03:10:31,800
So I'm just asking for the consistency.

2443
03:10:39,566 --> 03:10:43,169
I think the clerk is saying that it's construed as a recommendation.

2444
03:10:45,270 --> 03:10:45,891
I don't know.

2445
03:10:47,112 --> 03:10:50,894
I think everybody's shared their thoughts on this tonight.

2446
03:10:51,755 --> 03:10:56,178
Motion a table then, until we have that meeting, which is undebatable.

2447
03:10:56,759 --> 03:11:00,181
Motion to table that motion, which was undebatable.

2448
03:11:00,201 --> 03:11:03,704
What does that do to the D paper that we have for Councilor Caviello?

2449
03:11:03,744 --> 03:11:07,687
You can call a meeting at any time and hopefully you respect his wishes within 14 days.

2450
03:11:15,470 --> 03:11:16,891
The President knows what we want to do.

2451
03:11:17,932 --> 03:11:19,413
Fourteen days, have a meeting.

2452
03:11:20,354 --> 03:11:21,395
Call the roll for the motion.

2453
03:11:22,295 --> 03:11:23,136
Motion to table.

2454
03:11:23,156 --> 03:11:23,897
Call the roll.

2455
03:11:23,917 --> 03:11:32,904
On the motion of Councillor Camuso to table, which is undebatable, it is undebatable, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2456
03:11:38,148 --> 03:11:38,708
Councillor Camuso?

2457
03:11:38,988 --> 03:11:39,248
Yes.

2458
03:11:39,268 --> 03:11:42,471
Councillor Caprio?

2459
03:11:42,511 --> 03:11:42,751
Yes.

2460
03:11:43,872 --> 03:11:44,372
Councillor Matlow?

2461
03:11:44,392 --> 03:11:44,452
Yes.

2462
03:11:51,325 --> 03:11:51,565
Yes.

2463
03:11:52,746 --> 03:11:55,307
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

2464
03:11:55,868 --> 03:11:56,788
The motion is tabled.

2465
03:12:18,987 --> 03:12:22,708
15-305 offered by Council Marks.

2466
03:12:23,328 --> 03:12:39,751
Be it resolved that a portion of the $143,000 in state aid to fill potholes and repair streets as part of the Governor's Winter Recovery Assistance Program be used to stripe the raised crosswalk on Withrop Street in the interest of public safety.

2467
03:12:39,791 --> 03:12:40,491
Council Marks.

2468
03:12:42,411 --> 03:12:43,432
Thank you, Mr. President.

2469
03:12:43,872 --> 03:12:45,452
I'll be brief because of the late hour.

2470
03:12:46,908 --> 03:13:02,356
As we all read in the local paper and received a correspondence from the mayor, the city of Method is in line to receive $143,000 of state aid to help with the filling of potholes and repair of streets throughout our community.

2471
03:13:03,037 --> 03:13:13,583
I would only ask that the raised crosswalk on Winthrop Street, which if you come up or down Winthrop Street, you'll realize that other than the

2472
03:13:14,077 --> 03:13:16,559
yellow neon signs on both sides of the street.

2473
03:13:16,980 --> 03:13:26,149
The raised crosswalk itself blends into the road and is very difficult to see when you're coming up on it, especially if you're at some speed.

2474
03:13:26,809 --> 03:13:37,219
And I would ask that the white markings, which were originally on the raised crosswalk, be replaced back in the interest of public safety with just a portion of the $143,000

2475
03:13:39,318 --> 03:13:42,381
towards the repair of streets and potholes.

2476
03:13:42,621 --> 03:13:44,983
On the motion of Council Marks for approval, all those in favor?

2477
03:13:45,684 --> 03:13:46,444
All those opposed?

2478
03:13:46,504 --> 03:13:48,526
Motion passes.

2479
03:13:48,546 --> 03:13:50,868
14-308, offered by Councilor Penta.

2480
03:13:51,428 --> 03:14:00,997
Be it resolved that the City hastily participate in the Governor's proportionate share allocation for this past winter's pothole street damages to cities and towns.

2481
03:14:01,457 --> 03:14:02,798
Medford's allocation is set at $143,334.

2482
03:14:07,125 --> 03:14:11,851
The program will be implemented this month, with all qualifying work needing to be completed by June 30, 2015.

2483
03:14:13,293 --> 03:14:20,803
The State Department of Transportation will issue one-time contracts with municipalities, allowing them to draw down their share of the $30 million.

2484
03:14:21,283 --> 03:14:22,104
Medford's share is $143,334.

2485
03:14:26,143 --> 03:14:43,555
for the specific purpose of road and facility repairs that include patching of potholes, cracking, and other surface defects, including paving projects and repair and or replacement of signage, guardrail storm drains, storm grates, or road striping or painting.

2486
03:14:44,575 --> 03:14:53,621
These contracts will include a use it or lose it clause to ensure that funds are spent and projects are completed by June 30th.

2487
03:14:53,741 --> 03:15:04,028
All work invoices must be provided to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation by July 31st, 2015, and MassDOT will reimburse cities and towns as invoices are received.

2488
03:15:04,609 --> 03:15:10,192
Along with this amount from the state and with the city having in excess of some $6.5 million in free cash,

2489
03:15:11,821 --> 03:15:23,769
for which this council voted to expend some one million from free cash for our street recovery restoration, our city taxpayers should expect nothing less than having their street attended to.

2490
03:15:24,089 --> 03:15:24,809
Councilor Penta.

2491
03:15:25,410 --> 03:15:31,894
Mr. President, it's quite obvious the Baker administration has done something a little bit different than the prior administration.

2492
03:15:31,934 --> 03:15:37,958
They're holding cities and towns accountable, they're giving them deadlines, and they're indicating it's a use it or lose it program.

2493
03:15:38,118 --> 03:15:41,180
And at the same time, with our council making the request

2494
03:15:41,915 --> 03:15:44,837
the administration take a million dollars out of free cash.

2495
03:15:45,497 --> 03:16:05,068
This, I think, works hand-in-glove with the street restoration program that I offered here some weeks back, that every single taxpayer in this community should identify their particular street, either by phone, by taking a picture, sending it in, and hopefully getting something that's time-stamped and dated, either from the clerk's office or from the Department of Public Works.

2496
03:16:05,528 --> 03:16:09,190
That way, they are showing some authenticity as to what they're doing.

2497
03:16:09,787 --> 03:16:21,872
Again, anyone who might be watching, news media that's out there, anyone that has a problem on their street, a crack, a road depression, a sidewalk or a curbing or whatever it might be.

2498
03:16:22,853 --> 03:16:28,415
If some damage took place during this past winter, take the picture, make a request, put it in.

2499
03:16:29,015 --> 03:16:37,119
And I think that needs to be something that the city council should get a handle on as to how many requests came in and how is the city going to make its determination.

2500
03:16:38,433 --> 03:16:45,816
The $143,000 is a limited amount, as we can tell, but I think it would be something that gets the ball rolling, knowing that we have that to start off with.

2501
03:16:46,156 --> 03:16:51,218
And I know we have another million dollars, hopefully, that the mayor will go forward and expend for the purpose of the streets.

2502
03:16:51,758 --> 03:16:57,660
There isn't one street you can't go down that there is not a depression, a pothole, a sinkhole, or whatever it might be.

2503
03:16:57,740 --> 03:17:05,183
Front ends, cars, tires, and everything under the sun has been attacked this winter, unfortunately because of the storm.

2504
03:17:05,703 --> 03:17:10,046
It is what it is, and that being the case, Mr. President, I move forward on this.

2505
03:17:10,306 --> 03:17:29,499
And I like—we haven't gotten a report back, and I think we deserve a report back on the request that the Council made and to have an idea just what this administration intends to do over and beyond the $143,000, since, in fact, we asked for a million dollars to be taken out of free cash to be used for something that's desperately needed on a daily basis.

2506
03:17:30,260 --> 03:17:33,102
And this is like a subject matter that I was talking about, you know.

2507
03:17:34,056 --> 03:17:37,478
The parking enforcement, you know, you could talk about that.

2508
03:17:37,878 --> 03:17:38,958
The problems are still going to be there.

2509
03:17:39,238 --> 03:17:41,279
But this is something that's happening every single day.

2510
03:17:41,339 --> 03:17:43,961
It's in the face of the single taxpayer in this community.

2511
03:17:44,501 --> 03:17:52,304
And they don't deserve to have their streets turned into a battleground territory, unfortunately, because of what happened during the winter.

2512
03:17:52,784 --> 03:17:54,705
We have a responsibility to these ratepayers.

2513
03:17:54,945 --> 03:17:56,406
They pay taxes in this community.

2514
03:17:56,626 --> 03:17:58,527
They pay the salaries of everybody in this building.

2515
03:17:58,887 --> 03:18:00,488
And they deserve their streets to be repaired.

2516
03:18:01,508 --> 03:18:04,209
On the motion of approval by Councilor Penter, all those in favor.

2517
03:18:05,649 --> 03:18:08,370
Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Camuso.

2518
03:18:08,690 --> 03:18:09,651
Councilor Caravaglio.

2519
03:18:10,311 --> 03:18:11,831
Oh, I'm sorry, a couple of people want to speak.

2520
03:18:12,251 --> 03:18:12,531
Thank you.

2521
03:18:12,952 --> 03:18:14,092
Thank you, Mr. President.

2522
03:18:14,112 --> 03:18:22,154
You know, I appreciate Councilor Penter putting this out, but, you know, every manhole cover in the city, in the main streets are all sinking.

2523
03:18:23,315 --> 03:18:26,336
Why can't some of that money be taken out of the water and sewer accounts?

2524
03:18:26,836 --> 03:18:27,296
Precisely.

2525
03:18:27,696 --> 03:18:28,876
You know, rather than the free gas.

2526
03:18:29,597 --> 03:18:30,697
I think, you know,

2527
03:18:31,692 --> 03:18:36,476
I saw last week in the newspaper that there's an RFP out for potholes.

2528
03:18:36,516 --> 03:18:58,753
I don't know how many potholes they're looking to fill, but that RFP should be made to look at every pothole in the city and every manhole cover that's sinking and get an actual cost, see how many manhole covers are sinking, take that part of the money out of the water and sewer account that that's building versus just asking for a million dollars to do a bunch of streets.

2529
03:18:59,723 --> 03:19:00,864
$143,000 goes nowhere.

2530
03:19:00,904 --> 03:19:03,205
I did half my driveway for $4,500.

2531
03:19:03,245 --> 03:19:07,328
So I'd say $143,000 isn't going anywhere.

2532
03:19:08,729 --> 03:19:10,530
As amended by Councilor Caviello.

2533
03:19:11,491 --> 03:19:12,091
Councilor Knight.

2534
03:19:12,651 --> 03:19:13,972
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2535
03:19:14,773 --> 03:19:18,815
This morning I had the opportunity to speak with our highway superintendent relative to this very issue.

2536
03:19:19,455 --> 03:19:21,857
And I asked exactly how far $143,000 would get him.

2537
03:19:24,224 --> 03:19:31,551
And a highway superintendent said that this $143,000 will be very, very helpful to the city of Medford to restore our roadways.

2538
03:19:32,632 --> 03:19:40,919
In the conversation, you know, we continued to talk about the program and what direction the city was going to go in, whether or not they were going to participate and so on.

2539
03:19:41,400 --> 03:19:45,223
And one of the things that came up in discussion was the fact that if we're going to get $143,000 in money,

2540
03:19:48,242 --> 03:19:51,986
And it's for the purposes of repairing our roadways, what's the best way to use it?

2541
03:19:52,086 --> 03:19:56,930
Would it be the best use to take that and put cold patch down so that we can get through the rest of the winter, Mr. President?

2542
03:19:57,351 --> 03:20:04,758
Or would it be the best use of that money to wait until the winter's over to grind streets down, right back down to the bone and build them back up the way that they should be built?

2543
03:20:06,903 --> 03:20:12,585
Much to my happiness, Mr. President, they're going to be doing a bit of both, from what I understand.

2544
03:20:12,605 --> 03:20:18,527
There'll be some sections of High Street that are going to get ground down all the way in the near future, and there's also going to be some patchwork that's being done.

2545
03:20:19,207 --> 03:20:28,630
So I certainly commend the work of our DPW to take this twofold approach, Mr. President, to grinding the streets down, but also repairing some of the patchwork that needs to be done.

2546
03:20:29,250 --> 03:20:29,990
With that being said,

2547
03:20:30,781 --> 03:20:36,302
You know, I think this is a great initiative, a great project, and I commend the highway superintendent for being in front of the issue as opposed to behind it.

2548
03:20:37,142 --> 03:20:37,983
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2549
03:20:38,883 --> 03:20:39,663
Councilor Camuso.

2550
03:20:39,983 --> 03:20:48,065
Thank you, and as we know, $143,000, really, with this stuff, like the Council has stated, isn't going to get us far.

2551
03:20:48,085 --> 03:20:51,905
It's going to be very helpful for potholes and things of that nature, but look at Central Ave.

2552
03:20:52,165 --> 03:20:58,827
When they actually ground it down and actually did the job, it's very limited what this is going to get us.

2553
03:20:58,927 --> 03:20:59,967
I'm glad that this council

2554
03:21:00,442 --> 03:21:12,796
I took a vote last week under the leadership of Councillor Penta, or two weeks ago, to appropriate, or at least ask the Mayor to appropriate a million dollars of the taxpayers' money that's in an account right now, unencumbered.

2555
03:21:13,357 --> 03:21:14,498
Very, very important word.

2556
03:21:14,959 --> 03:21:15,680
Not encumbered.

2557
03:21:16,732 --> 03:21:20,476
It could be used for any purpose with a vote of this council.

2558
03:21:20,896 --> 03:21:22,518
So the $143,000 is great.

2559
03:21:22,938 --> 03:21:29,865
But if the mayor puts $1.143 million on the table to do this community, you're going to see that get us some places.

2560
03:21:30,305 --> 03:21:35,730
So once again, this council is bringing forward good ideas as far as I'm concerned.

2561
03:21:36,751 --> 03:21:38,913
On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

2562
03:21:39,674 --> 03:21:40,375
All those opposed?

2563
03:21:45,787 --> 03:21:47,089
We have two papers on the can.

2564
03:21:49,011 --> 03:21:50,353
Offered by councillor, oh no.

2565
03:21:51,515 --> 03:21:55,100
Communications from city officials, boards and commissions and employees.

2566
03:21:55,120 --> 03:21:55,140
15-313.

2567
03:22:00,773 --> 03:22:06,016
This is on the motion of Councilor Langel-Kern to waive a portion of the reading.

2568
03:22:06,536 --> 03:22:25,125
This is notice from the City Clerk and Chief Election Official, Edward P. Finn, notifying the citizens and municipal elected officials of the election calendar to begin Tuesday, June 9th, with nomination papers being available.

2569
03:22:27,286 --> 03:22:35,490
Without going through the whole thing, Thursday, July 28th, last day to submit our papers for nomination.

2570
03:22:40,152 --> 03:22:43,333
Preliminary election, Tuesday, September 22nd.

2571
03:22:44,474 --> 03:22:47,035
General election, Tuesday, November 3rd.

2572
03:22:48,036 --> 03:22:51,217
Yours truly, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, etc.

2573
03:22:51,537 --> 03:22:52,698
Papers in the hand of the clerk.

2574
03:22:53,685 --> 03:23:03,332
offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the, on the motion of approval from Vice President Logan Kern, all those in favor?

2575
03:23:03,752 --> 03:23:04,492
All those opposed?

2576
03:23:04,752 --> 03:23:05,473
Motion approved.

2577
03:23:06,374 --> 03:23:18,322
Offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend Team Medford on their vigil this past Sunday that drew a tremendous crowd to the City Council Chambers.

2578
03:23:18,982 --> 03:23:19,582
Mr. Councilor.

2579
03:23:19,823 --> 03:23:20,503
Thank you, Mr. President.

2580
03:23:20,543 --> 03:23:22,484
You know, for those of us who were here Sunday,

2581
03:23:23,795 --> 03:23:26,996
This room, the hallway, was overflowing with people.

2582
03:23:27,616 --> 03:23:29,076
I mean, we were turning away people.

2583
03:23:30,337 --> 03:23:37,679
It just goes to show what the response and the need for this type of service in this community.

2584
03:23:37,959 --> 03:23:53,283
In fact, tonight, during the Council of the Whole meeting, the attorney of Peter Miranda said he sold the building on Judge Hester Drive to a drug counseling firm.

2585
03:23:54,105 --> 03:23:57,166
which will be coming in the next year or so.

2586
03:23:57,646 --> 03:24:03,727
But the thing is, we had this huge outpouring of people in the support, and everybody got behind it.

2587
03:24:04,167 --> 03:24:14,349
This morning, I pick up and read the paper that our state senator is the sponsor of the bill to legalize marijuana in the state.

2588
03:24:15,189 --> 03:24:20,270
So this whole room, this whole council supporting stopping drugs, and our senator,

2589
03:24:21,675 --> 03:24:22,696
is supporting groups.

2590
03:24:22,856 --> 03:24:24,617
I mean, talk about a message being sent.

2591
03:24:26,038 --> 03:24:27,539
But again, I want to thank Penny and her group.

2592
03:24:27,919 --> 03:24:30,000
Did an excellent job, brought everybody out here Sunday.

2593
03:24:30,020 --> 03:24:32,522
And let's just say, I hope to continue.

2594
03:24:32,862 --> 03:24:35,744
We move forward and hopefully help some of these people in this community.

2595
03:24:35,764 --> 03:24:37,325
Thank you.

2596
03:24:37,345 --> 03:24:38,485
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

2597
03:24:39,166 --> 03:24:40,987
All those in favor, Councilor Penta.

2598
03:24:43,668 --> 03:24:44,849
This one was jam-packed.

2599
03:24:45,309 --> 03:24:49,552
In all the years that I've served, I've never seen so many people attend

2600
03:24:51,502 --> 03:24:55,683
That was really a heart-throbbing particular day.

2601
03:24:56,703 --> 03:25:01,705
But I couldn't help but think when I looked up into that ceiling and I was hoping that that ceiling did not fall down.

2602
03:25:01,745 --> 03:25:02,645
That's a disgrace.

2603
03:25:03,425 --> 03:25:05,586
That's been like that for almost two years now.

2604
03:25:06,706 --> 03:25:07,386
It's patched.

2605
03:25:09,767 --> 03:25:11,968
You're right, Councilor Del Rosso, the whole building is a disgrace.

2606
03:25:12,428 --> 03:25:14,548
The unfortunate part about it, this place was marred.

2607
03:25:15,589 --> 03:25:17,709
Mr. President, will you get an answer on this?

2608
03:25:18,609 --> 03:25:20,710
Find out, are they going to repair this or not?

2609
03:25:21,716 --> 03:25:28,542
You know, this is the city, this is the people's chambers, and this has been two years.

2610
03:25:28,562 --> 03:25:29,583
The top of the roof, right?

2611
03:25:30,884 --> 03:25:32,305
God, I don't know what he's thinking on a daily basis.

2612
03:25:32,325 --> 03:25:35,668
Maybe he just doesn't care what's going on, but there were people here that do care.

2613
03:25:35,688 --> 03:25:37,049
Madam Vice President.

2614
03:25:48,217 --> 03:25:49,478
Thank you, President de la Russo.

2615
03:25:49,498 --> 03:25:51,178
Back to the vigil on Sunday.

2616
03:25:51,278 --> 03:25:53,119
I just want to concur with my colleagues.

2617
03:25:53,559 --> 03:25:57,981
I want to also thank Janelle Rocco, I believe, who is the organizer.

2618
03:25:59,722 --> 03:26:00,982
The two hours were perfect.

2619
03:26:01,442 --> 03:26:06,004
I mean, from the speakers to the reading of the names to the crowd.

2620
03:26:06,084 --> 03:26:09,386
So I just want to thank Janelle and Penny and Brooke.

2621
03:26:09,646 --> 03:26:13,167
And it was moving.

2622
03:26:13,467 --> 03:26:17,349
And I think it did what it set out to do was to break the stigma.

2623
03:26:18,232 --> 03:26:18,552
Thank you.

2624
03:26:19,553 --> 03:26:20,793
Sir, you wish to address the council?

2625
03:26:21,273 --> 03:26:24,215
Yes, Joe Villion, 59 Garfield Ave, Manfred Mass.

2626
03:26:24,795 --> 03:26:27,656
I too was taken aback when I walked into the council chambers.

2627
03:26:27,676 --> 03:26:31,338
We have this beautiful hall out there and all these beautiful paintings on the wall.

2628
03:26:31,878 --> 03:26:37,080
And there has been the Christmas thing out there.

2629
03:26:37,160 --> 03:26:40,282
It's like 15 cartons and three empty bottles.

2630
03:26:40,602 --> 03:26:44,824
So all the people that came in here for a vigil saw boxes of trash.

2631
03:26:45,677 --> 03:26:50,043
Two or three months ago, there was a steak knife there and there was a box cutter there.

2632
03:26:50,664 --> 03:26:54,970
And when I go to New York and I go to record companies, I have to go through the metal detector.

2633
03:26:55,270 --> 03:26:57,694
We have a steak knife on top of boxes of stuff.

2634
03:26:58,435 --> 03:26:59,997
It looks like someone's basement.

2635
03:27:04,080 --> 03:27:07,681
But right out here, when you walk in, there's just piles of stuff.

2636
03:27:07,781 --> 03:27:15,604
And if someone's coming from New York and they're coming to the vigil because they're visiting a Medford resident, which probably happened, or someone from out of state, what are they thinking about us?

2637
03:27:16,024 --> 03:27:17,984
The ceiling, boxes out there.

2638
03:27:18,184 --> 03:27:21,045
This mayor has got to get it together because this is Medford pride.

2639
03:27:21,706 --> 03:27:26,147
And the vigil, God bless that this room was packed, but Medford pride.

2640
03:27:28,162 --> 03:27:28,462
Thank you.

2641
03:27:28,482 --> 03:27:30,484
On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

2642
03:27:31,164 --> 03:27:31,845
All those opposed?

2643
03:27:32,425 --> 03:27:33,086
Motion passes.

2644
03:27:34,306 --> 03:27:37,709
Christmas candles come down, and Santa's sled.

2645
03:27:41,191 --> 03:27:53,000
Offered by Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the DPW remove the mattress, box, spring, and TV illegally dumped at the corner of Elm Street and Fulton Street.

2646
03:27:54,421 --> 03:27:54,941
Move approval.

2647
03:27:56,214 --> 03:28:00,456
They were going to do it themselves, but it's nasty, so they don't want to touch it.

2648
03:28:00,476 --> 03:28:02,357
On the motion to approve by Councilor Camuso.

2649
03:28:02,377 --> 03:28:03,058
All those in favor?

2650
03:28:03,078 --> 03:28:03,598
All those opposed?

2651
03:28:04,078 --> 03:28:04,719
Motion passes.

2652
03:28:05,779 --> 03:28:06,139
Councilor?

2653
03:28:06,480 --> 03:28:07,020
One more thing.

2654
03:28:08,141 --> 03:28:10,522
City Hall really is, if I may, falling apart.

2655
03:28:11,923 --> 03:28:15,365
We had this beautiful event here Sunday with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people.

2656
03:28:16,405 --> 03:28:19,747
And when the gentlemen that were here walked into the second floor men's room,

2657
03:28:21,594 --> 03:28:26,816
That bathroom has been covered with caution tape, the urinal, for about two and a half months.

2658
03:28:28,237 --> 03:28:28,617
You know what?

2659
03:28:29,017 --> 03:28:36,001
If it's beyond repair, if it's beyond repair, take it out, cap off the hole.

2660
03:28:37,061 --> 03:28:39,142
This is a basic plumbing job.

2661
03:28:39,542 --> 03:28:39,922
Basic.

2662
03:28:40,202 --> 03:28:40,783
Very basic.

2663
03:28:40,803 --> 03:28:43,464
We can get someone at Minuteman, Volk could come up here and do that.

2664
03:28:43,484 --> 03:28:45,305
An apprentice would be sent to do it.

2665
03:28:48,253 --> 03:28:48,893
I'm speechless.

2666
03:28:49,094 --> 03:28:49,994
I'm speechless for once.

2667
03:28:51,235 --> 03:28:55,338
You would think that you'd want to get the building ready for those type of events.

2668
03:28:56,039 --> 03:29:06,947
I mean, I understand not every office in this city hall has their own private bathroom in it, like the mayor's office, but for us little people that have to use the public restroom, it's disgusting.

2669
03:29:09,229 --> 03:29:10,790
If we can get that fixed.

2670
03:29:11,763 --> 03:29:13,045
We'll do some research on that.

2671
03:29:14,386 --> 03:29:23,417
The tabled records of February 24th are still in the possession of Counselor Knight.

2672
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:30,146
Mr. Clerk, have you received those changes dispatched to you from the Counselor?

2673
03:29:38,440 --> 03:29:41,261
The changes initiated by Councilor Caviello have been handled.

2674
03:29:41,281 --> 03:29:44,642
Well, what happened was, Mr. President, I got a set of minutes and the set of minutes was incorrect.

2675
03:29:45,182 --> 03:29:47,483
Then there were going to be some corrections that were made.

2676
03:29:47,743 --> 03:29:50,184
I got another set of minutes that came out that had corrections in them.

2677
03:29:50,724 --> 03:29:56,226
So before I could bring the corrections up at the Council meeting on the initial minutes, we got a new set of minutes.

2678
03:29:56,606 --> 03:29:57,687
I got those new set of minutes.

2679
03:29:57,707 --> 03:29:58,847
I looked at those new set of minutes.

2680
03:29:58,907 --> 03:30:00,287
I've gone through those new set of minutes.

2681
03:30:00,628 --> 03:30:04,969
I've made one change, Mr. President, and it comes under the first item on the GIC.

2682
03:30:05,129 --> 03:30:07,490
And Councilor Penter and I having a little bit of a

2683
03:30:08,612 --> 03:30:09,953
disagreement as to what it should read.

2684
03:30:10,453 --> 03:30:17,997
What the president read into the record was, Councilor Penta asks that the record reflect he also spoke as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

2685
03:30:18,977 --> 03:30:26,181
Councilor Penta would like the language to read that Councilor Penta did not speak as a city councilor, but as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal.

2686
03:30:27,421 --> 03:30:30,143
Councilor Penta.

2687
03:30:30,243 --> 03:30:35,645
Councilor Penta wishes the records to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass.

2688
03:30:35,665 --> 03:30:36,646
Municipal Association.

2689
03:30:37,218 --> 03:30:39,083
Board of Directors and not as a city councilor.

2690
03:30:39,525 --> 03:30:40,869
If you go to 17.22 on the tape, that's exactly what I said.

2691
03:30:44,917 --> 03:30:47,820
What was written to the record by the President is what I'm going to go with, Mr. President.

2692
03:30:47,860 --> 03:30:49,862
I've gone over this thing three or four or five times, so.

2693
03:30:49,902 --> 03:30:51,824
Well, I want to be as exact as can be.

2694
03:30:52,004 --> 03:30:54,146
As do I, because, you know, my name's on it, Mr. President.

2695
03:30:54,166 --> 03:30:55,267
That's why I gave it such scrutiny.

2696
03:30:55,327 --> 03:30:58,930
I wasn't going to move for approval if I feel as though it wasn't an accurate reflection of what happened at the meeting.

2697
03:31:00,171 --> 03:31:03,455
You know, so I'd move for approval as amended, Mr. President.

2698
03:31:03,775 --> 03:31:08,539
So what will the, Mr. Clerk, what will the record actually say then?

2699
03:31:11,536 --> 03:31:15,138
According to Councillor Knight, it's basically almost the same.

2700
03:31:15,918 --> 03:31:25,664
We just said that, you know, I was under the impression that if someone was going to be behind the rail and they were going to speak, but not as a city council, but as an average citizen or a member of an organization, they would get up and they would address the council from the podium.

2701
03:31:25,964 --> 03:31:30,546
That didn't happen, which started leading me to have all these concerns saying, what's going on?

2702
03:31:30,586 --> 03:31:31,367
Why is it happening here?

2703
03:31:31,407 --> 03:31:37,090
And then I watched the tape and it says he was also a member of the MMA as opposed to exclusively speaking as a member of the MMA.

2704
03:31:37,963 --> 03:31:42,345
So, I went with what the president said because of the fact that, you know, parliamentary procedure would do that.

2705
03:31:42,485 --> 03:31:43,205
Which president?

2706
03:31:43,845 --> 03:31:43,985
You.

2707
03:31:44,886 --> 03:31:45,546
What did I say?

2708
03:31:46,986 --> 03:31:52,248
Councilor Penta asked that the record also reflect that he spoke as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

2709
03:31:52,988 --> 03:31:55,249
And I may have said something to the effect of so noted.

2710
03:31:55,269 --> 03:31:57,050
You might have said that too.

2711
03:31:57,470 --> 03:31:57,790
Thank you.

2712
03:31:58,610 --> 03:32:05,753
And all I added on is was as a member of the Massachusetts Board of Directors and not as a city councilor, because that's exactly what I said.

2713
03:32:06,811 --> 03:32:13,574
17.22 into the minutes.

2714
03:32:21,117 --> 03:32:22,038
There was action on the paper.

2715
03:32:22,138 --> 03:32:24,159
There was action on the paper.

2716
03:32:24,219 --> 03:32:26,940
It was a letter sent, I believe, to the administration and to the legislature.

2717
03:32:28,401 --> 03:32:29,741
No, no, no, no, no.

2718
03:32:30,041 --> 03:32:34,063
No, the action on the paper was actually to be to be advised

2719
03:32:34,788 --> 03:32:39,731
And to report back from the administration any plans to increase the charge of the plan for the employees.

2720
03:32:39,891 --> 03:32:40,671
So there was action?

2721
03:32:41,351 --> 03:32:42,972
It was a request, yeah, to get information.

2722
03:32:43,433 --> 03:32:46,234
But my question is, I think it's fairly simple.

2723
03:32:47,515 --> 03:32:49,936
I think I got a good understanding of what happened.

2724
03:32:51,757 --> 03:32:52,617
Was there a roll call vote?

2725
03:32:52,637 --> 03:32:54,638
If there wasn't a roll call vote, you could have... There was a roll call vote.

2726
03:32:54,658 --> 03:32:55,479
There was a roll call vote.

2727
03:32:57,900 --> 03:32:58,800
I know exactly what I said.

2728
03:32:58,820 --> 03:32:59,521
You know what I'm saying.

2729
03:33:04,924 --> 03:33:12,669
I understand that, but my speaking, I wanted to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass Municipal Board of Directors and not as a city councilor.

2730
03:33:12,889 --> 03:33:16,211
My vote might have been a city councilor, but my speaking was not.

2731
03:33:17,612 --> 03:33:17,952
Whatever.

2732
03:33:19,713 --> 03:33:24,036
I think what the councilor was trying to say is, if you were speaking as a member of the MMA,

2733
03:33:24,848 --> 03:33:26,990
You should have spoken from the other side of the podium.

2734
03:33:27,011 --> 03:33:30,635
Right, and that is what we discussed actually, the official position of the MMA.

2735
03:33:30,975 --> 03:33:36,642
If I want to speak for the Chamber of Commerce, then I should go behind the rail and speak from the podium.

2736
03:33:36,862 --> 03:33:42,008
Does the MMA, on the particular issue you guys are talking about, whatever it is, does the MMA have an official position on it?

2737
03:33:43,717 --> 03:33:44,958
– They support G.I.C., yeah.

2738
03:33:45,359 --> 03:33:52,846
This goes back to 2009, when this council voted on it, they talked about it, and they discussed it.

2739
03:33:53,046 --> 03:34:00,333
– Well, perhaps what the most pertinent facts are is what should the records indicate?

2740
03:34:00,353 --> 03:34:04,777
– What should the record reflect, and should it reflect whether or not what the president read into the record, or what was

2741
03:34:05,570 --> 03:34:09,116
Mentioned during a speech when the gentleman wasn't speaking as a city councilor, apparently.

2742
03:34:09,476 --> 03:34:10,137
I mean, I don't know.

2743
03:34:10,818 --> 03:34:14,884
I'm deferring to the language that the president referred to when he read it into the record.

2744
03:34:15,264 --> 03:34:15,945
That's the language.

2745
03:34:17,654 --> 03:34:18,375
Why is this hooky?

2746
03:34:18,735 --> 03:34:19,415
It's not a big deal.

2747
03:34:19,515 --> 03:34:21,616
I didn't make a big deal that he did.

2748
03:34:22,156 --> 03:34:24,637
Well, like I said, Mr. President, my name's on it and I move for approval.

2749
03:34:24,677 --> 03:34:26,478
I want it to be an accurate reflection just because.

2750
03:34:26,778 --> 03:34:28,698
Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

2751
03:34:28,858 --> 03:34:31,599
If it's an accurate reflection, then you get to watch the minutes of the meeting.

2752
03:34:32,020 --> 03:34:32,200
I have.

2753
03:34:32,220 --> 03:34:33,260
That's what I've come up with.

2754
03:34:33,580 --> 03:34:35,281
There's a motion for approval on the record.

2755
03:34:35,361 --> 03:34:37,261
Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

2756
03:34:37,322 --> 03:34:38,382
All those in favor.

2757
03:34:38,402 --> 03:34:39,022
Wait, wait, wait.

2758
03:34:39,102 --> 03:34:39,522
What are they?

2759
03:34:39,542 --> 03:34:40,123
What are the words?

2760
03:34:40,463 --> 03:34:40,763
Read it.

2761
03:34:41,503 --> 03:34:45,026
The way he presented it to us.

2762
03:34:45,086 --> 03:34:46,166
Read it.

2763
03:34:46,226 --> 03:34:46,707
I don't have it.

2764
03:34:46,767 --> 03:34:47,047
Read it.

2765
03:34:47,487 --> 03:34:47,808
What is it?

2766
03:34:47,828 --> 03:34:48,328
You have it.

2767
03:34:48,568 --> 03:34:49,188
What did he give you?

2768
03:34:49,208 --> 03:34:50,249
It's the same thing.

2769
03:34:50,409 --> 03:34:51,010
What is it, Eddie?

2770
03:34:51,030 --> 03:34:51,870
Just read it, please.

2771
03:34:52,331 --> 03:34:54,152
I don't have the records in front of me.

2772
03:34:55,073 --> 03:34:55,593
Where's the book?

2773
03:34:56,293 --> 03:34:57,374
The e-mail that I sent to the city.

2774
03:34:57,554 --> 03:35:03,639
I know, but it's just—Councilor Penta asks that the record reflects that he also spoke as a member of the MMA.

2775
03:35:03,879 --> 03:35:04,799
Yeah, and that's what I have.

2776
03:35:07,552 --> 03:35:09,453
As recommended by Councillor Knight.

2777
03:35:09,753 --> 03:35:10,733
All those in favour?

2778
03:35:10,813 --> 03:35:11,834
No, no, no.

2779
03:35:12,014 --> 03:35:16,816
You said you accepted before wishes to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass.

2780
03:35:17,056 --> 03:35:20,177
So then we go back to the original one.

2781
03:35:20,617 --> 03:35:23,318
Councillor Penter wishes to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass.

2782
03:35:23,698 --> 03:35:27,279
Municipal Association.

2783
03:35:38,206 --> 03:35:39,367
Not asked to be recorded.

2784
03:35:40,267 --> 03:35:41,227
Wishes to be recorded.

2785
03:35:43,348 --> 03:35:46,410
There's a difference.

2786
03:35:46,870 --> 03:35:47,771
How do you present the records?

2787
03:35:47,791 --> 03:35:48,791
That's my question.

2788
03:35:49,091 --> 03:35:56,475
I read the references saying that Counselor Pender wanted to also be recorded as being a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

2789
03:35:58,956 --> 03:35:59,476
And I said that.

2790
03:35:59,516 --> 03:36:00,957
That's exactly what I said that day.

2791
03:36:01,317 --> 03:36:03,278
On the motion of Counselor Knight for approval.

2792
03:36:03,998 --> 03:36:04,799
All those in favor.

2793
03:36:06,017 --> 03:36:06,858
All those opposed?

2794
03:36:06,898 --> 03:36:08,479
The ayes have it.

2795
03:36:08,779 --> 03:36:09,219
Counselor?

2796
03:36:10,640 --> 03:36:11,460
You have to read it.

2797
03:36:12,261 --> 03:36:12,601
Read it.

2798
03:36:12,661 --> 03:36:13,722
Nobody's reading the words.

2799
03:36:14,122 --> 03:36:15,223
You have it, Mr. Clark.

2800
03:36:15,303 --> 03:36:15,983
What are the words?

2801
03:36:16,003 --> 03:36:17,564
I don't have them.

2802
03:36:17,644 --> 03:36:18,345
So you don't have it.

2803
03:36:18,405 --> 03:36:20,466
He said he sent it to you.

2804
03:36:20,746 --> 03:36:23,168
But I don't have them with me right here.

2805
03:36:23,648 --> 03:36:27,671
But you just said you wanted wish instead of recorded.

2806
03:36:28,971 --> 03:36:30,813
I'm going by what you had last time.

2807
03:36:30,873 --> 03:36:32,894
It says Counselor Pinto wishes to be recorded.

2808
03:36:33,387 --> 03:36:35,929
speaking as a member of the Mass Municipal Association.

2809
03:36:36,049 --> 03:36:46,558
The email I have in front of me reads, under paper number 15053, the vote was taken and the president noted, Counselor Penta would like the record to reflect that he also spoke as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

2810
03:36:47,038 --> 03:36:48,800
The minutes should reflect that, hyphen.

2811
03:36:49,200 --> 03:36:52,763
Counselor Penta spoke also as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

2812
03:36:53,003 --> 03:36:53,583
That's what I sent.

2813
03:36:53,603 --> 03:36:54,164
That's right.

2814
03:36:54,204 --> 03:36:55,445
That's what it says.

2815
03:36:56,566 --> 03:36:57,727
So on that motion.

2816
03:36:58,467 --> 03:36:59,028
That's the motion.

2817
03:36:59,608 --> 03:37:00,469
All those in favor.

2818
03:37:02,177 --> 03:37:03,077
All those opposed?

2819
03:37:03,518 --> 03:37:05,119
Motion carries.

2820
03:37:05,639 --> 03:37:12,282
Records, March 17, 2015, were passed to Vice President Lundgren, Madam Vice President.

2821
03:37:15,664 --> 03:37:18,745
The correction will be shared with the clerk on that motion of approval.

2822
03:37:18,785 --> 03:37:19,426
All those in favor?

2823
03:37:19,446 --> 03:37:20,126
All those opposed?

2824
03:37:20,866 --> 03:37:21,447
So moved.

2825
03:37:21,987 --> 03:37:23,908
On the motion of Council Marks for adjournment.

2826
03:37:24,408 --> 03:37:25,228
All those in favor?

2827
03:37:25,248 --> 03:37:26,009
All those opposed?

2828
03:37:27,350 --> 03:37:28,010
Meeting adjourned.
