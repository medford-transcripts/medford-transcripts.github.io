    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=6.73s">Vice</a>  President Bears president counts of Caraviello Councilor Collins, President Council night President Councilor Kelly, Councilor Tseng, President, President Morell, President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=36.116s">motions,</a>  orders and resolutions to two dash three zero zero offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=41.12s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the city solicitor provide the Medford City Council with a draft ordinance require a monthly presentation by finance, the finance director to review the warrant articles and projected versus forecasted revenues tonight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=53.831s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=54.972s">This</a>  was a resolution that had been passed by this previous councils on multiple occasions, this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=59.832s">has</a>  been very difficult to get and has not been coming forth with. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=62.933s">So</a>  I think that at this point in time, it would make sense that we move forward and codify this request so that it would be part of our local law and therefore a requirement that we be provided with this information so that we can properly prepare for the financial responsibilities that we have as council.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=79.18s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=80.78s">Any</a>  discussion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=81.781s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=83.521s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=86.822s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=93.41s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=94.311s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=95.872s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=96.052s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=96.132s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=96.332s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=96.793s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=97.453s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=97.653s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=97.754s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=98.234s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=98.754s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=122.023s">permit</a>  parking restrictions while conducting official post office business. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=125.626s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=126.607s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=127.989s">At</a>  the risk of being told I'm not in any position to discuss this matter, I'd like to bring it forward anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=134.775s">It's</a>  been brought to my attention that Park Medford has been ticketing the letter carriers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=142.421s">So</a>  the individuals that deliver us medications, bills, mail documents and the like, employees of the United States government, not the state government, not the local government, who are exercising their duties for the post office, not being held harmless in the execution of those duties, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=162.049s">Past</a>  practice has always been that our letter carriers would be held harmless when they were using their personal vehicles to conduct post office business. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=168.735s">And</a>  this policy has apparently changed with the implementation of the in-house parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=173.817s">So</a>  I'd ask that the traffic commission take up the issue and create a letter carriers pass so that our letter carriers that are using their personal vehicles for post office business can park on city streets to deliver the mail and medication and the other materials that they so deliver to the residents of the community free of interference from parking.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=197.816s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=199.576s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=200.856s">I</a>  support this measure wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=202.477s">I'd</a>  like to propose a B paper just to request that the administration report to us on what communications methods they used to reach out to residents regarding the new parking program and whether or not they plan to include any information about this program in mailings to city residents or property owners.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=233.038s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=234.08s">If</a>  constantly wouldn't wouldn't mind amending this so if we can provision it if the visiting nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=240.39s">that</a>  come to many people's homes also. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=243.931s">That's</a>  another common call I get is, you know, the nurse comes to visit my mother or comes in to do treatments, and they don't have anywhere to park it, and they get tickets on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=255.194s">So</a>  if we could maybe look at something for medical personnel who host visits, it would be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=270.712s">Do</a>  you want to speak on the parking passes? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=272.393s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=273.874s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=276.316s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=278.618s">Parking</a>  there is horrendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=287.544s">And</a>  I've, I've been to the mayor's office downstairs and I requested parking permits on that street and it's gone without any notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=295.532s">When</a>  I went to other streets within Medfed, I see parking places all over the place up in East Med, was it North Medfed, West Medfed? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=302.596s">They</a>  have parking permit, but on that particular street, on 22 Bradley Road, on Bradley Road, we cannot have parking for residents on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=313.601s">There's</a>  not enough spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=315.242s">And</a>  what happens is everybody, I've lived there for 22 years, so I know what goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=321.225s">People</a>  come in from out of town, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=323.477s">People</a>  that work into the center of the town, and I understand they pay taxes but I inadvertently pay taxes to rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=330.039s">You're</a>  allowed to park during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=332.16s">They</a>  come from writing, they work all over Medford Square, they're allowed to park all day during that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=336.841s">I</a>  am like a hostage to my apartment.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=341.85s">So,</a>  the traffic commission petition for turning streets and department parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=347.296s">Have</a>  you, have you worked with the traffic commission to the mayor give any indication you should give me any indications because I've got numerous tickets there, and now they take it on a Saturday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=356.685s">I</a>  come up one Saturday and I had a parking ticket, and I was like appalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=360.749s">I</a>  paid the ticket because I didn't want to deal with the parking office up on Main Street.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=365.783s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=366.163s">So</a>  it was horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=367.424s">And</a>  then I want to say, because I have to get it off my chest. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=370.425s">The</a>  year of 2010 was the worst winter in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=375.547s">And</a>  I remember distinctly because I got out of graduate school and I was working and I couldn't get a job because of the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=383.071s">And</a>  every week I was getting parking tickets and they were putting parking meters on the street and giving out parking tickets to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=391.735s">During</a>  one of the worst blizzards <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=396.428s">I</a>  think that's unconscionable.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=400.131s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=400.591s">I</a>  think those decisions predate this most of us on the council I could, I know I have your email I can reach out to the mayor it is petitioning to turn the street department parking goes to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=411.679s">So</a>  I can, I can follow up on that make sure you're the right person.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=416.102s">Yes,</a>  well no it's kind of a new situation now because of what we're here for but I believe we have to wait until the end.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=423.127s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=423.968s">But</a>  I can follow up with you by email.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=425.129s">That</a>  would be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=425.65s">Well,</a>  we'll see what happens now because I'm going to be forced to move.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=428.593s">Understood.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=429.894s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=431.696s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=432.197s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=432.377s">Just</a>  name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=433.438s">Hello,</a>  my name is Donia Goss. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=434.76s">I</a>  live at 26 Bradley Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=437.623s">I</a>  have a disabled placard. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=440.126s">Anyway,</a>  whenever the Chevalier Theater has a show, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=444.856s">to</a>  having a show Friday night, Joan Jett. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=447.678s">Great</a>  theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=448.999s">Whenever</a>  there's a show, you cannot find a parking space within a quarter of a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=457.065s">And</a>  our building has 30 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=460.269s">and</a>  there's maybe five or six spaces on the street, because there's no parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=466.172s">So</a>  it's very, for me, sometimes I go grocery shopping, I come home, I go around and around and around, I can't find a place to park, and then I have to carry all, parking is unbearable. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=479.658s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=480.498s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=481.198s">Madam</a>  President, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=482.759s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=483.039s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=485.14s">Quick</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=486.02s">I</a>  apologize, did you say you were handicapped? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=489.986s">Did</a>  you?</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=490.266s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=490.986s">Do</a>  you have a placard?</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=492.027s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=492.747s">And</a>  did they put a handicapped spot on that street for you?</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=495.528s">There</a>  is one handicapped spot in front of the senior citizen building, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=500.81s">But</a>  there are other senior citizens that are handicapped in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=505.692s">Occasionally</a>  I will park there but sometimes I don't find a space there.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=511.254s">I</a>  hope we get to find a resolution for what <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=514.18s">Our</a>  neighbors are going through on Bradley Road, but this is something that as we move forward, I think it's something that we should talk with the traffic commission, maybe hold a meeting with the residents of Bradley Road, because this is something that's been going on for years and no one has listened.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=527.811s">There's</a>  just not enough physical spaces.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=530.213s">Well,</a>  maybe there's other solutions that we could talk to the traffic commission when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=534.857s">So</a>  let's hope we can find the resolution for the biggest issue and then revert back and circle back to the traffic commission, because that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=542.825s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=543.445s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=544.806s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=547.527s">Anyone</a>  else would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=553.109s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Vice President Bears, and there's also the B paper from Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=562.992s">I'm</a>  going to take the B paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=565.513s">The</a>  B paper is to get an update from the administration on the communication methods used to reach out to residents regarding parking.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=658.617s">Madam</a>  President, yes, as the resolution reads, the traffic commission I directed signage to one ramp said to keep this road that has displaced vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=667.185s">These</a>  roads, but measure blitz victory park, the backside of victory park, and there's access to walking trails back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=672.97s">But</a>  what's happening is the street is very narrow street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=675.992s">It's</a>  getting overrun by vehicles, residents in the street can't back out of the driveways, can't find parking in the front rows. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=681.837s">So</a>  it's creating a situation where the <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=684.578s">Signage</a>  that the traffic commission put up has really displaced a number of vehicles to another neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=691.08s">It's</a>  now feeling a negative impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=692.561s">So</a>  in the interest of parity, the traffic commission will take simple steps to treat this neighborhood as they treat others and ensure that the signage is erected so that neighbors don't have to go through the weekends of recreational events going on in the community, very similar to what's going on now.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=712.367s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=713.268s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=715.23s">for</a>  expressing those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=718.691s">I</a>  echo all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=719.691s">I</a>  think it's important that as we as we hear so often, even this evening, that a lot of the issues we're having with parking has nothing to do with method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=730.793s">It</a>  has people that come outside of method that want to use our recreational spaces or our restaurants or our theaters and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=740.295s">and</a>  it really displaces the quality of life of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=744.218s">So</a>  if we can, like Councilor Knight said, you know, in the case that we've had in other locations and it's worked, I think we need to follow up on this stretch of road as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=759.73s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1014.778s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1017.599s">Resolution</a>  speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1019.019s">I</a>  know that we're coming up on, you know, we're a bit more than a year out from when our city's waste management contracts will be up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1026.301s">So</a>  I think it's, you know, about time that we start, you know, making sure that the administration is looking at how things are going with our <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1034.03s">current</a>  contractor with an eye towards how we can improve our overall waste reduction and efficacy of recycling in the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1043.753s">That</a>  doesn't necessarily mean a new contractor, but I think it's a good time to start re-evaluating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1049.555s">We're</a>  always overdue for evaluating how we can be further accelerating towards a zero waste future, evaluating how good we are at recycling all the things that we think that we're recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1061.059s">I</a>  also want to make sure that that <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1062.524s">also</a>  takes into account any private waste haulers that are operating on properties in Medford to ensure that across the board, we're doing what we can to dispose of waste, recycle as efficiently as we can in line with our climate and pollution goals.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1080.858s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1081.979s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1085.481s">I</a>  think this is really an essential effort considering when this contract goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1091.07s">the</a>  new contract will be pricier than the current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1093.672s">And</a>  as I think we've seen, there's a lot of increases in the cost of waste removal and waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1098.935s">Since</a>  we last signed the contract on this, one of the ways that we can mitigate the impact of the growing cost of waste removal, crowding out other essential priorities in the city budget, is to reduce the amount of overall waste that we are producing as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1111.524s">So</a>  I think this is a great resolution and I second it and will support it.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1124.895s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Collins for introducing such a thoughtful resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1129.959s">Measures</a>  like this represent the action that we can take at the local level to address the growing climate catastrophe that we're facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1139.186s">I</a>  know that many feel a sense of dread and hopelessness, but I think Councilor Collins shows us today that we can be hopeful, but we just have to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1148.053s">And</a>  resolutions like this show that our city is acting, and that our city council in particular is trying to get the answers that we need to create the policies that we need to address climate emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1163.307s">At</a>  the, at the local level, both overall and at the local level, reducing waste is one of the key, one of the key ways that we can that we can pursue one of the key paths we can pursue towards meeting, you know, meeting a better future that's more sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1182.396s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1183.837s">I</a>  am I full wholeheartedly support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1188.343s">And</a>  I think I would like our city to do in the city administration to do more research into what else we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1196.333s">What</a>  what other measures we can take towards the zero waste goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1199.397s">Um,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1201.94s">There</a>  are a lot of cities that are innovating right now, they've developed textile recycling programs, they've done on different programs with technical, technical parts, and I would like to see our city explore those options and also to make what options do exist more accessible to all Medfordians.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1224.257s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1229.148s">spent</a>  a lot of time in this area and it's been my day job, so I really thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1233.05s">And</a>  a lot of, if not most of the callers contracted these days do have the ability to provide data. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1239.393s">So</a>  I think this is a really important resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1241.134s">It's</a>  something that we should be looking for in the city because when we know better, we can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1244.756s">So</a>  I also really appreciate you bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1247.337s">So</a>  on the motion, Councilor Collins, second by Vice President Bears.</p>

And as a city employee, it's really upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1605.908s">It's</a>  ridiculous to let a company come in and upset people's lives, especially after what's been going on the last two years.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1622.818s">I</a>  know some of you may have received some information from the city or some avenues, maybe for some funding or some help. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1653.281s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not worried about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1657.063s">She'll</a>  be out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1659.204s">She</a>  does not want you guys to believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1669.928s">Do</a>  you see her on here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1672.029s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1676.851s">Thank</a>  you, and so sorry about this microphone buzzing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1679.792s">We're</a>  not sure why that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1685.388s">To</a>  the question of, you know, can we do anything, and I'm really grateful to everybody who's been in contact with the city council and other city officials about this, and we're really glad not to know about it, but glad to be kept updated about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1699.395s">And</a>  I think, you know, I don't want to speak for my colleagues, but I think we all empathize with you and we all accept that this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1705.838s">But</a>  to the question of what can we do about it, I think, speaking only for myself, you know, taking care not to speak for anybody else, we want to make sure that you're advocating to the people who have the power to help <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1715.384s">you</a>  in this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1717.705s">Unfortunately,</a>  we need to make sure that you're advocating to the right people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1725.95s">We</a>  need to make sure that you're talking to the people who have the power to either alleviate the expense and the inconvenience and the stress and the work and the anxiety of finding new housing.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1825.989s">Thank</a>  you, President Marillyn. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1827.09s">Thank</a>  you to our AV wizard back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1832.574s">What</a>  I was saying is that, you know, we appreciate the tenants keeping us informed of your situation and, you know, speaking only for myself and probably for <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1841.288s">Many</a>  other, if not all of my colleagues, we stand in solidarity with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1845.612s">We're</a>  sorry for what you're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1847.013s">I</a>  think that we need to make sure that you're advocating to the right people, the people with the power to adjust your situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1854.559s">As</a>  it's been stated, since this is proceeding legally, there's nothing that we can do in these chambers <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1864.282s">know,</a>  to wave a magic wand and give you what you deserve, you know, what you need, what you're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1871.864s">And</a>  I think that, you know, I'm certainly speaking for myself, I want to be in contact with, you know, this tenant group to make sure that you're connected with the right people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1879.665s">I</a>  know they've already received some very helpful, you know, what I seem to be like helpful pertinent information from our Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1886.527s">I</a>  hope that to the extent that's helpful, you can remain in contact with our housing staff, other resources around the city, you know, and I hope that, you know, on an individual Councilor basis, we can stay in contact to make sure that you're accessing the resources that are available to see what can happen here, you know, to appeal to perhaps this property owners that are angels. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1911.877s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1912.598s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1913.458s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1914.278s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1917.0s">you</a>  know, I think you're all experiencing very directly the housing crisis that we're in in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1923.462s">Something</a>  that we as a council have talked a lot about is housing stability and what city resources we can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1928.443s">But,</a>  you know, I think Councilor Collins was very direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1932.385s">You</a>  know, we are constrained by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1934.725s">We</a>  can't go in and say you can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1936.626s">It's</a>  not within the power of the city of Medford to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1939.247s">What</a>  is within our power is to do what Councilor Collins said and what I think if <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1944.358s">President</a>  Morell may read the update if it hasn't gone to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1949.367s">provide</a>  as many resources and as much information as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1952.188s">We</a>  do have access to pro bono legal aid for housing situations for residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1956.789s">We</a>  have a program that helps people move within the city with financial support. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1961.95s">And</a>  to be direct, there's a lot of state laws that need to change around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1966.691s">I</a>  think we've been advocating, at least I've been advocating for some of those changes at this point, even if they were to go through, it's not gonna stop the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1974.532s">And</a>  I'm sorry for that, but they do need to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1978.353s">The</a>  other piece of this is I think fully, if you are able and if it, with the advice of legal counsel, I'm not a lawyer and I'm not certainly not your lawyer, but if you're able to get that legal advice, you do have a significant number of protections on the table here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1994.437s">They've</a>  provided a notice to quit that's now gonna be active after 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1998.278s">That's</a>  the initiation of a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2000.859s">It's</a>  not the end of a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2003.68s">That</a>  process would then, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2005.32s">essentially</a>  begin an eviction proceeding, which would then take you before a judge, that can last months. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2010.646s">It</a>  may not end the way that you want it to, but it may give you enough time to find something in this market. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2017.233s">So</a>  I would suggest that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2020.008s">or</a>  with the advice of council, if it's possible for you, if it's not going to impact you negatively in some other way, just fully see out your legal rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2027.411s">And</a>  that may extend the process with enough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2030.112s">But,</a>  you know, we as a city also need to take, you know, going forward, this is an example of why we need more resources for housing stability, more than just a couple people, more than just a couple affordable units, because it takes months and months and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2045.858s">to</a>  find housing in this market and with the very limited supply of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2050.685s">So</a>  I again I'm also very sorry that this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2055.878s">you</a>  know, big corporate change has just suddenly uprooted your lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2059.14s">And</a>  I wish that we had more power to help, but certainly we can advocate, continue to reach out to this person, ask them to be compassionate, as Councilor Caraviello said, ask them to extend the time period. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2073.011s">And</a>  if they won't do anything more there, I certainly would suggest that you avail yourselves of all of the options that come before you in the legal process to extend this and give yourself as much time as you can to find <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2085.492s">new</a>  housing.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2087.333s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2088.233s">And</a>  then actually, if I could just read the update from Planning, Development, and Sustainability, that might just be helpful to any questions that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2094.395s">But</a>  of course, everyone is still welcome to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2097.256s">So</a>  this is from Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2102.198s">And</a>  some of this is coming verbatim from the person who purchased the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2105.719s">So</a>  if this is incorrect, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2107.84s">This</a>  is just the story that they are getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2110.341s">So</a>  it's a 34-unit building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2112.885s">So</a>  the director of planning development sustainability and the housing planner spoke with the owner and some of his representatives this past Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2119.851s">So</a>  it's a 34 unit building and the owner let them know that 18 units for tenants at will, 14 have leases until the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2127.59s">The</a>  new owner purchased the building one year ago in March 2021, and he said that all units that are tenants at will were in that status when he purchased the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2136.96s">It's</a>  clear that his plan is to renovate kitchens, bathrooms, and redo floors, and that the tenants must vacate the apartments for this to occur as they are one-bathroom units. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2144.808s">It</a>  was clear that rent would go up after the renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2147.691s">He</a>  agreed to extend the notice for the tenants at will an additional 30 days for those who needed an extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2153.217s">His</a>  representative, Jay Walsh, contacted the department on Friday night to let them know that everyone who had received a notice to quit had been notified that they could have an additional 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2164.225s">The</a>  director with the city requested that the owner give the tenants with leases as much notice as possible as it's necessary to look for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2172.248s">New</a>  rental units in September, given this market, look sorry, look now for rental units in September, given the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2179.736s">The</a>  owner indicated that he understood and would take into advisement and give more notice that he had been planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2186.102s">The</a>  city director requested that he give the tenants the opportunity to stay in the building, potentially by giving them the option to return to the renovated apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2194.249s">This</a>  seems to be a new idea to him, but he seemed to think it was very reasonable and suggested that once some apartments were renovated, those with longer leases could be offered the option to lease one of the renovated apartments rather than being required to move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2207.459s">we</a>  emphasize, the city emphasized that we very much would like to retain Medford residents in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2212.222s">And</a>  I will make sure you guys get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2213.483s">There's</a>  just like two more paragraphs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2216.045s">The</a>  city also presented him with information from the Medford Housing Authority on their opportunity for landlords to receive $1,000 for leasing a unit to a section eight voucher holder that hadn't previously leased to someone with section eight and let them know that the maximum section eight rents are what the maximum section eight rents are in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2234.094s">It's</a>  the city director's hope that he would consider Section 8 voucher holders for the renovated units. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2239.017s">The</a>  current Section 8 tenants are through the Arlington Housing Authority, and the landlord has been in touch with them to verify that everything that they did was legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2246.982s">The</a>  city director did not ask him about current or future rent rates, as they were focused on keeping Medford residents housed at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2254.127s">And</a>  they just went out to note that they did flyer every door in the building with the flyers with regard to ABCD and the move in, move out program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2262.557s">Um,</a>  if anyone didn't get that information, we can make sure that that gets to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2266.219s">Um,</a>  so any further questions we can relate to them and as fellow council just said, we, as a, we, as a body don't have any statutory power, but we can absolutely advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2276.222s">We</a>  can reach out to, you know, the city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2278.863s">I</a>  put in a call to Senator Jalen to see if there's anything that, you know, we may not be thinking of that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2284.105s">So</a>  I think even though we don't have direct power in this situation, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2288.607s">As</a>  fellow Councilors said, you know, my heart breaks for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2290.888s">This</a>  is obviously also this is the tip of the iceberg, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2293.228s">Like,</a>  this is stuff that we've been trying to stave off for the past two years and the housing market being what it is, we're unfortunately going to keep, you know, this is going to keep happening to our residents and it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2306.462s">we'll</a>  do what we can to stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2308.283s">But</a>  unfortunately, we don't have a lot of power in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2310.645s">But</a>  thank you for bearing with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2313.566s">Please</a>  just name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2316.068s">I</a>  mean, we know the address, but name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2321.764s">many</a>  people here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2324.165s">And</a>  ultimately, everyone kind of said what we're all thinking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2328.007s">Like</a>  we all wish that there could be a better resolution, we wish that someone would step in and help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2332.469s">I</a>  think at the end of the day, the biggest issue that we have is that these companies are not going anywhere, they're going to buy more buildings in this town, they're going to buy more units, they're going to kick more people out and leave them without an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2346.436s">And</a>  they're going to do it in a way that <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2348.677s">is</a>  unethical, is immoral, and I just don't think that this is a direction that the town of Medford, the city of Medford should want to trend in because, listen, I've lived here since 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2360.16s">I</a>  didn't always live in this building, but I've lived in Medford because I love living in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2365.801s">As</a>  of May 1st, I'm living in Brighton, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2369.002s">I</a>  didn't want to, but luckily I found a place because I didn't know my options, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2374.363s">And</a>  ultimately, you know, I'm lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2377.024s">other</a>  people in our building are not going to be as lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2379.885s">And</a>  these are citizens of our town. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2382.825s">These</a>  are residents of our town that love being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2385.766s">They</a>  want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2387.566s">And</a>  for someone who has never been in the building to take that away from them and not give them a real option, it's just morally bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2395.368s">It's</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2396.488s">And</a>  I understand that there's limited power here for all of us, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2401.009s">Us</a>  as residents, you guys as <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2404.17s">as</a>  president, as, as, as Councilors, we understand that, but, you know, we're an example of what's going to happen to more and more buildings in this town. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2411.412s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2411.792s">And,</a>  and ultimately you don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2414.232s">I</a>  feel I wouldn't want that because I love Medford for everything Medford has. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2418.573s">And</a>  if Medford ceases to be Medford, why are we going to be here and why are we going to spend money here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2423.495s">Why</a>  are we gonna spend time here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2424.655s">So</a>  I just wanted to make it known that this company, there's a lot like them, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2429.816s">And</a>  they're not going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2431.116s">And</a>  I just think that there needs to be more sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2434.537s">you</a>  know, it's a free market, but what are they doing for the people who live here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2438.06s">And</a>  how is it trending? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2439.04s">Because</a>  at the end of the day, kicking us all out, putting a fake marble kitchen in and charging double the price, who are you bringing in really? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2446.845s">You're</a>  going to bring in people that don't care about this town and don't want to be here and don't want to settle down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2451.489s">So</a>  that's all I got to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2453.75s">And</a>  thank you for giving me the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2455.871s">Sorry,</a>  I'm not good at this kind of, everyone's in a suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2458.513s">I</a>  feel really uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2459.714s">So</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2460.815s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2464.675s">Would</a>  anyone else like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2467.517s">See</a>  if there's anyone on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2474.64s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2478.402s">I</a>  will make sure, is there, I'm trying to think as far as if just to get, I'll work with the Planning Development and Sustainability Office just to make sure the contents of that email that I just read out gets to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2493.737s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'll work with the director of the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability to make sure the contents of the email that I just read gets to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2505.602s">I</a>  know you've probably been given that information in a few different forms, but I'll make sure it's packaged and it gets to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2516.706s">I</a>  understand, I know, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2520.977s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2521.918s">If</a>  you do want to come up to the microphone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2539.28s">I</a>  mean, this whole process here is a little bit mute, mute, you mean it's, we have no rights, because these corporations come in, and they just take over and they in this has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2549.808s">I've</a>  been in the Boston area, 40 years and as councilmen as statesmen, the people, you're supposed to know what's saying that you're not, but people should represent the people and they're not representing the people they're representing the corporations who's got the deep pockets, who can do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2566.14s">And</a>  it isn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2567.22s">And</a>  I'm not mad at you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2568.561s">I</a>  think this is the wrong forum.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2570.882s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2571.402s">So</a>  I think, yeah, exactly as the inappropriate for you're in the wrong.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2574.263s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2574.964s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2575.544s">So</a>  I'm coming to that conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2579.225s">So</a>  I mean, what is the next phone, we take it, we have to take it to the next state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2583.107s">Is</a>  that where it goes? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2583.967s">I</a>  mean, but at that point, it'll be new. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2585.988s">I</a>  mean, it'll be I'll be gone by then because</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2589.043s">No</a>  one can throw you out of that apartment but a judge, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2591.225s">It's</a>  not like after 60 days, they're gonna lock the doors, take away the key and take all your stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2595.367s">I</a>  mean, they can't do that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2596.468s">It</a>  has to go through a process.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2597.669s">I</a>  just wanna let you know how traumatizing it was to get a message Monday afternoon at 1258 saying to me, you need to vacate the property and all your belongings in 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2609.391s">I</a>  called the property management, they would not pick up the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2612.993s">I</a>  spoke with them, I said, you know, I have an ankle injury and I'm in physical therapy because I fell in the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2618.495s">And</a>  they still said, no, you have to go.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2619.936s">I</a>  understand that everybody has a personal circumstance, there's 32 units in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2623.777s">But</a>  you know, ultimately, right, it's, you have to vacate, or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2626.879s">Well,</a>  we're gonna take you to court, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2628.779s">But</a>  I don't wanna be, I don't want on my record to be evicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2631.06s">I</a>  mean, I don't need that on my, I don't need that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2633.161s">But</a>  it's a no fault eviction because it's not for non-payment of rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2636.203s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2636.463s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2637.083s">So</a>  it's not for non-payment of rent, it's not for, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2639.985s">selling</a>  drugs out of the apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2641.106s">No,</a>  no, no cause right it's it's a contract issue right it's a contract issue between the property owner and the tenants that are in the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2648.531s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2648.891s">So,</a>  ultimately, the forum where it's going to be resolved would be in some type of mediation, whether in the court system, you know what I mean as this goes through the process but the notice to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2660.027s">It's</a>  just like, listen, in 30 days, we're filing an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2664.049s">That's</a>  really what it is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2665.15s">So</a>  it's, they're giving you a 30 days notice to say they're going to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2668.131s">Right</a>  now, through the discussions that have happened here at this body and through the administration, they've said, look, it's not going to be 30 days now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2675.094s">It's</a>  going to be 60 days.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2676.255s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2676.795s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2677.115s">And</a>  if anybody is a tenant at Willow's leases up, we're not going to move on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2681.398s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2681.738s">We're</a>  going to wait 60 days.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2683.419s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2683.919s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2684.319s">So</a>  that's going to initiate the process, but think, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2689.122s">Between</a>  the, what was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2690.724s">18</a>  units that have leases and 14 that don't?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2693.827s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2694.287s">Or</a>  vice versa.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2695.708s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2699.792s">Yeah,</a>  18 without leases.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2702.335s">18</a>  with leases, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2703.076s">All</a>  probably expiring at different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2705.298s">All</a>  the 60 day notice to stick with. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2706.839s">By</a>  the time this building gets empty, how long, how much time is this going to pass?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2710.348s">Right,</a>  it's gonna be at least six months because I don't know my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2714.49s">My</a>  neighbor my neighbor just signed a lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2716.552s">She</a>  just moved in and she's the leases over in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2719.813s">I</a>  honestly don't know sir.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2720.854s">Right,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2722.035s">It's</a>  just the manner in which they did this was inhumane. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2726.237s">Well,</a>  and I mean I understand they have a right to buy a building I understand they have a right to do whatever they want with the property, but it's the manner in which they went about doing it to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2736.265s">was</a>  totally wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2737.686s">And</a>  they wouldn't knew when they bought the building, how long those tenants were in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2741.408s">So</a>  they knew they should be dealing with this in an appropriate manner with people who have been residents there for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2749.973s">People</a>  recognize business is business, but there's also a humanity part of this too, which is more, it's principle.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2755.297s">I</a>  mean, yeah, you're talking about public service.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2758.719s">You</a>  know, it's the principle and I'm not mad at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2760.76s">It's</a>  just the principle matter of this and the manner in which they did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2764.602s">I'm</a>  totally traumatized.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2766.299s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2767.96s">And</a>  it's, that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2769.521s">I</a>  mean, there's the answer that Councilor and I just gave you, which is about the specific circumstance in the court of law and your legal rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2777.025s">I</a>  mean, then there's the other question that you're bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2778.925s">You've</a>  been here for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2780.206s">That</a>  means that you remember 30 years ago when it, you know, voters in Wellesley voted away, went control for people in Boston, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2788.022s">do</a>  you think owns the corporations that are buying up the apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2791.625s">And</a>  that's where it is, you know, we are extremely limited by state law, there's a couple things that we can try to do, we can try to provide more resources and notice about your legal rights, which is what we're able to do in this case, that's something we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2804.155s">I</a>  mean, I'm an advocate of asking the state to implement a lot of laws to kind of create <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2808.439s">create</a>  a better set of conditions for people.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2810.26s">I</a>  think it needs to go to the state legislature, honestly, because, you know, if it's not me next, you next. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2816.522s">You</a>  know, if people don't speak up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2818.883s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2819.583s">And</a>  there's a, you know, there's a lot of groups.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2821.904s">It'll</a>  be like California, you won't be able to live here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2823.764s">There's</a>  a lot of groups and tenants, advocates and people who are saying, you know, begging the state government, you know, they'll do anything, you know, unanimously they'll pass a law that says, you know, we'll free up this zoning and you can build something bigger, but <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2837.481s">They</a>  won't attach to it just cause eviction or rent stabilization so you can have a 30% rent increase in a single year, or, you know, the tenant opportunity to purchase or all these other things that would give tenants more of a balance in this fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2850.93s">And</a>  so, you know, that's something that we can advocate for but <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2855.073s">we</a>  legally can't implement any of that unless the state lets us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2858.514s">And</a>  I'm just saying, it's worth going to the next level and saying, this happened in your state rep district or your state Senate district, and we need you to take, we need you to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2868.375s">And,</a>  you know, it's, yeah, I think you've made a very strong point about the conditions of who's making the law in Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2875.997s">And</a>  I do appreciate your time and the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2880.057s">However,</a>  I mean, I did call some of the numbers and I feel as though that, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2883.478s">I</a>  called this number and then I could go to this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2886.541s">Oh,</a>  now we're gonna go to this person, then it's like this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2889.485s">This</a>  is why I never became a public servant because I like to produce and I like results.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2893.79s">Yeah,</a>  I hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2895.291s">I</a>  don't like passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2896.272s">And</a>  I'm not saying you are passing the buck, but people will take the pass the buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2901.017s">And</a>  when is the buck stop.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2903.196s">Maybe,</a>  you know, and I'm just saying, and I'm not saying you know maybe we can maybe we can maybe we can ask, I'm assigned to, I know they're thin but with this being such a dire situation having a assigned member for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2917.992s">They're</a>  working directly with the families and the homeowners of Bradley will be an advocate even for the state because you know this is really this is this is getting out of control, but I think with this is such a dire situation I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2929.819s">And</a>  one of the biggest things is having someone on the other line I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2934.002s">I</a>  think the least we can do is recommend that, uh, Miss Hunts puts a identified representative from their office that's going to work directly with the people of Bradley Road because of because of this die situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2948.653s">I</a>  don't think they'll block at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2949.894s">I</a>  think that they'll they'll really work hard to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2952.936s">But</a>  I think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2954.857s">That,</a>  you know, where we were handcuffed, at least you should have an avenue within our city hall that are going to at least point you in the right direction and make sure that someone's going to be on the other line because I can't, I can't even imagine what you're going through right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2970.295s">And</a>  the stress level, at least we can do is ask the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2973.328s">to</a>  take that stress level out, so they can help you move forward those chores so no thank you if I could recommend that that'd be something that no I appreciate that because you know I did make a call this week and the woman says where you can go live in a shelter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2985.784s">Well</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2986.444s">That's</a>  what they told me disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2988.247s">My</a>  sister lives in a shelter and I used to go to that shelter.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2992.025s">Well,</a>  I think if we can do that, because there are avenues and I know that it's easy for us to sit on this side. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3000.47s">And</a>  it's easy because we have, you know, we have homes right now but the idea of what you're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3006.154s">We</a>  don't, we can't say we understand because we don't, but we can also understand that if we can do this and we could follow from what I've, I've talked to a few different attorneys I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3016.224s">By</a>  law, I can't tell you I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3017.885s">I</a>  get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3018.466s">I</a>  know that like Councilmate says, this isn't an easy process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3022.228s">No,</a>  and you have to go to even as you as residents there if you take advantage of what we have in the city to finance legal representation that that building can stay the same for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3036.719s">And</a>  you just what you're doing is banded together that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3040.507s">have</a>  someone direct you from the city to the right avenues and make sure that someone's on the other line and follow through with the resources we can offer you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3048.937s">And</a>  I think that at least gives us some time to find out other ways that we can get to the state and have the state representatives <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3056.272s">look</a>  at different options, whether it's finding ways to, uh, you know, work directly with housing within different state housing, um, processes or whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3066.417s">So</a>  there's got to be something out there that, like you said, this is the worst case scenario, and I know what's happening today, and like Councilor Behr says, this is probably the beginning of something more drastic moving forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3080.653s">I</a>  mean, if you look at the rents out there, the rents out there, and I've already saw four apartments and I just cried. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3086.516s">I</a>  just cried. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3087.396s">I</a>  was just like, and what they're charging for $1,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3091.238s">I</a>  mean, it's pretty, I mean, you walk in these carpets are dirty, you go out, you know what I mean, two feet and you get a big plate of salt and use your shovels, you can shovel your own walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3100.703s">That's</a>  really what, you can live in this basement apartment, but we're not gonna clean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3104.145s">But</a>  you can request it to be cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3105.945s">I</a>  said, excuse me, it's not clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3107.366s">No,</a>  you're not gonna clean it after I move in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3109.63s">or</a>  before I move it after I said Alicia, I. So at the recommendation of Councilor- Yeah, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3115.032s">I</a>  apologize that I'm so upset.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3116.092s">No,</a>  no, you have every right to. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3118.894s">That's</a>  the reason why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3119.894s">We</a>  wish we could do more, but we're here to listen and help in any way we can.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3124.816s">No,</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3125.616s">If</a>  this is little that we can do, and at least let you know that you have seven people that understand, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3134.903s">can</a>  be there for you just to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3136.764s">That's</a>  the best we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3138.225s">I</a>  hope that can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3139.025s">But</a>  listen, I wish I could do more.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3141.227s">You've</a>  been wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3142.167s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3142.567s">I</a>  appreciate you taking the time.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3143.608s">I</a>  wish we could do more.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3144.428s">It's</a>  good that it's voiced here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3146.57s">And</a>  I think it needs to be representative of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3150.672s">I've</a>  just seen so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3153.494s">It's</a>  incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3154.214s">It's</a>  just incredible what happens.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3156.195s">I'll</a>  call up the director to get you guys a dedicated contact person just to at least try to mitigate the call here, call there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3165.535s">I</a>  can be an advocate because it has to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3168.716s">It</a>  really has to stop somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3170.436s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3171.116s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3173.397s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3203.523s">Yes,</a>  I mean, the firm is doing the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3204.764s">The</a>  motion passes reverting to regular order of business reports of committees to 2-012 March 29 2022 subcommittee on ordinances and rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3214.327s">Uh,</a>  vice President Bears, if you could provide us a brief overview of that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3217.469s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3218.809s">Um,</a>  last week we met again in subcommittee on rules and ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3223.571s">Uh,</a>  I think our third meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3226.793s">At</a>  our March 9th meeting, we reported out a number of suggested changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3231.076s">We</a>  reported out a number of additional suggested changes at our March 29th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3237.52s">And</a>  those will be, I believe, included in packets this week, both a track change document and a clean document. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3244.525s">The</a>  other item we reported out was an item for further discussion, which was around our meetings, days, times, Tuesday to Wednesday, biweekly, a number of other matters that the subcommittee felt required the full discussion of the council and not a recommendation from just three councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3261.036s">So</a>  that will be kind of the agenda is going over the suggested changes, as well as a discussion of the meeting times for the council.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3272.468s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Harris. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3274.629s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to approve the committee records, seconded by Vice President Harris. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3281.794s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>
