1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:17,134
Vice President bears president counts of Carabiello counselor Collins, President Council night President Councilor Kelly, Councilor saying, President, President Morrell, President.

2
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:40,520
motions, orders and resolutions to two dash three zero zero offered by counselor night.

3
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:53,371
Be it so resolved that the city solicitor provide the Medford City Council with a draft ordinance require a monthly presentation by finance, the finance director to review the warrant articles and projected versus forecasted revenues tonight.

4
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:54,932
Madam President, thank you very much.

5
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:59,236
This was a resolution that had been passed by this previous councils on multiple occasions, this information.

6
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,893
has been very difficult to get and has not been coming forth with.

7
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:17,819
So I think that at this point in time, it would make sense that we move forward and codify this request so that it would be part of our local law and therefore a requirement that we be provided with this information so that we can properly prepare for the financial responsibilities that we have as council.

8
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,820
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,560
Any discussion?

10
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,341
Second.

11
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,682
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

12
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,043
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

13
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,131
Vice President bears.

14
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:34,571
Yes.

15
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:36,032
Yes.

16
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:36,112
Yes.

17
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:36,272
Yes.

18
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:36,533
Yes.

19
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:36,993
Yes.

20
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:37,633
Yes.

21
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:37,734
Yes.

22
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:38,074
Yes.

23
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:38,454
Yes.

24
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:38,955
Yes.

25
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:05,346
permit parking restrictions while conducting official post office business.

26
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,147
Councilor Knight.

27
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,849
Madam President, thank you very much.

28
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:12,893
At the risk of being told I'm not in any position to discuss this matter, I'd like to bring it forward anyway.

29
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:21,682
It's been brought to my attention that Park Medfit has been ticketing the letter carriers in our community.

30
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:41,169
So the individuals that deliver us medications, bills, mail documents and the like, employees of the United States government, not the state government, not the local government, who are exercising their duties for the post office, not being held harmless in the execution of those duties, Madam President.

31
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:48,132
Past practice has always been that our letter carriers would be held harmless when they were using their personal vehicles to conduct post office business.

32
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:53,777
And this policy has apparently changed with the implementation of the in-house parking program.

33
00:02:53,817 --> 00:03:14,567
So I'd ask that the traffic commission take up the issue and create a letter carriers pass so that our letter carriers that are using their personal vehicles for post office business can park on city streets to deliver the mail and medication and the other materials that they so deliver to the residents of the community free of interference from parking.

34
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,716
Thank you, Madam President.

35
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,176
Excuse me.

36
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,457
I support this measure wholeheartedly.

37
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:44,083
I'd like to propose a B paper just to request that the administration report to us on what communications methods they used to reach out to residents regarding the new parking program and whether or not they plan to include any information about this program in mailings to city residents or property owners.

38
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:53,319
Thank you.

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,348
If constantly wouldn't wouldn't mind amending this so if we can provision it if the visiting nurses.

40
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,990
that come to many people's homes also.

41
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:15,034
That's another common call I get is, you know, the nurse comes to visit my mother or comes in to do treatments, and they don't have anywhere to park it, and they get tickets on the street.

42
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:22,535
So if we could maybe look at something for medical personnel who host visits, it would be appreciated.

43
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,373
Do you want to speak on the parking passes?

44
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:32,534
Okay.

45
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,015
Any further discussion from the council?

46
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,437
Name and address for the record, please.

47
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:46,323
Parking there is horrendous.

48
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:54,149
And I've, I've been to the mayor's office downstairs and I requested parking permits on that street and it's gone without any notice.

49
00:04:55,532 --> 00:05:01,875
When I went to other streets within Medfed, I see parking places all over the place up in East Med, was it North Medfed, West Medfed?

50
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:09,679
They have parking permit, but on that particular street, on 22 Bradley Road, on Bradley Road, we cannot have parking for residents on that street.

51
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,722
There's not enough spaces.

52
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:19,785
And what happens is everybody, I've lived there for 22 years, so I know what goes on.

53
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:22,346
People come in from out of town,

54
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:28,579
People that work into the center of the town, and I understand they pay taxes but I inadvertently pay taxes to rent.

55
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,419
You're allowed to park during the day.

56
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,821
They come from writing, they work all over Medford Square, they're allowed to park all day during that.

57
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,542
I am like a hostage to my apartment.

58
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,875
So, the traffic commission petition for turning streets and department parking.

59
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:55,884
Have you, have you worked with the traffic commission to the mayor give any indication you should give me any indications because I've got numerous tickets there, and now they take it on a Saturday.

60
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:59,908
I come up one Saturday and I had a parking ticket, and I was like appalled.

61
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:04,213
I paid the ticket because I didn't want to deal with the parking office up on Main Street.

62
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,143
Absolutely.

63
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:07,024
So it was horrible.

64
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:09,845
And then I want to say, because I have to get it off my chest.

65
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:14,247
The year of 2010 was the worst winter in this city.

66
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:21,050
And I remember distinctly because I got out of graduate school and I was working and I couldn't get a job because of the economy.

67
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:30,014
And every week I was getting parking tickets and they were putting parking meters on the street and giving out parking tickets to the residents.

68
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:33,796
During one of the worst blizzards

69
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,549
I think that's unconscionable.

70
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,571
I understand.

71
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:51,019
I think those decisions predate this most of us on the council I could, I know I have your email I can reach out to the mayor it is petitioning to turn the street department parking goes to the traffic commission.

72
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,961
So I can, I can follow up on that make sure you're the right person.

73
00:06:56,102 --> 00:07:01,486
Yes, well no it's kind of a new situation now because of what we're here for but I believe we have to wait until the end.

74
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:03,527
Understood.

75
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,089
But I can follow up with you by email.

76
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:05,630
That would be true.

77
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,373
Well, we'll see what happens now because I'm going to be forced to move.

78
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:08,993
Understood.

79
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:10,255
Thank you.

80
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:11,857
Yep.

81
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:12,337
Yep.

82
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:13,398
Just name and address for the record.

83
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:14,700
Hello, my name is Donia Goss.

84
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,882
I live at 26 Bradley Road.

85
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,445
I have a disabled placard.

86
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:23,549
Anyway, whenever the Chevalier Theater has a show,

87
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:27,058
to having a show Friday night, Joan Jett.

88
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:28,379
Great theater.

89
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:35,824
Whenever there's a show, you cannot find a parking space within a quarter of a mile.

90
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:38,206
And our building has 30 units.

91
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:45,471
and there's maybe five or six spaces on the street, because there's no parking lot.

92
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:58,737
So it's very, for me, sometimes I go grocery shopping, I come home, I go around and around and around, I can't find a place to park, and then I have to carry all, parking is unbearable.

93
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:00,078
That's all.

94
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:00,918
Thank you.

95
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,699
Madam President, if I can.

96
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:02,959
Please.

97
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,939
Excuse me.

98
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,600
Quick question.

99
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,322
I apologize, did you say you were handicapped?

100
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:10,246
Did you?

101
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:10,566
Yes.

102
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:11,747
Do you have a placard?

103
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:12,267
Yes.

104
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:15,508
And did they put a handicapped spot on that street for you?

105
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:20,570
There is one handicapped spot in front of the senior citizen building, right?

106
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,172
But there are other senior citizens that are handicapped in that building.

107
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:30,954
Occasionally I will park there but sometimes I don't find a space there.

108
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,415
I hope we get to find a resolution for what

109
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:47,671
Our neighbors are going through on Bradley Road, but this is something that as we move forward, I think it's something that we should talk with the traffic commission, maybe hold a meeting with the residents of Bradley Road, because this is something that's been going on for years and no one has listened.

110
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,033
There's just not enough physical spaces.

111
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:54,837
Well, maybe there's other solutions that we could talk to the traffic commission when the time comes.

112
00:08:54,857 --> 00:09:02,343
So let's hope we can find the resolution for the biggest issue and then revert back and circle back to the traffic commission, because that's important.

113
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:03,405
So thank you.

114
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:04,586
Thank you so much.

115
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:07,507
Any further discussion?

116
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:08,987
Anyone else would like to speak?

117
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:22,972
So on the motion of Councillor Knight, as amended by Councillor Carviello, seconded by Vice President Behrs, and there's also the B paper from Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

118
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:24,472
I'm going to take the B paper first.

119
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:31,955
The B paper is to get an update from the administration on the communication methods used to reach out to residents regarding parking.

120
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:38,005
changes, and whether or not they send any communications through mail.

121
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:38,185
Yes.

122
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:42,867
Yes.

123
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:45,847
Vice President bears.

124
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:46,027
Yes.

125
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:46,328
Yes.

126
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:49,768
Yes.

127
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:49,909
Yes.

128
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:01,132
President Morrell.

129
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:01,613
Yes.

130
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:08,136
The main motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

131
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:09,717
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

132
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:20,802
Vice President Behrs.

133
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:21,143
Yes.

134
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:22,223
Councilor Kerrio.

135
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:22,743
Yes.

136
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:24,844
Councilor Collins.

137
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:25,185
Yes.

138
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:26,765
Councilor Knight.

139
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:27,166
Yes.

140
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:28,466
Councilor Scarpelli.

141
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:28,746
Yes.

142
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,390
Yes.

143
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:32,652
President Morrell.

144
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,615
Yes, seven in front of zero then I get the motion passes.

145
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,438
22-0302 offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli.

146
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:55,271
Whereas the sign posted along Rams Head and Heath Roads restricting parking along the wooded side of the street has displaced vehicles to a similar area of Judgment Road, be it so resolved that the Metro City Council request the Traffic Commission approve similar signage along the impacted stretch of Judgment Road.

147
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,832
Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpelli.

148
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:07,105
Madam President, yes, as the resolution reads, the traffic commission I directed signage to one ramp said to keep this road that has displaced vehicles.

149
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:12,930
These roads, but measure blitz victory park, the backside of victory park, and there's access to walking trails back there.

150
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,552
But what's happening is the street is very narrow street.

151
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:20,996
It's getting overrun by vehicles, residents in the street can't back out of the driveways, can't find parking in the front rows.

152
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,839
So it's creating a situation where the

153
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:31,060
Signage that the traffic commission put up has really displaced a number of vehicles to another neighborhood.

154
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,461
It's now feeling a negative impact.

155
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:52,327
So in the interest of parity, the traffic commission will take simple steps to treat this neighborhood as they treat others and ensure that the signage is erected so that neighbors don't have to go through the weekends of recreational events going on in the community, very similar to what's going on now.

156
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:52,747
Thank you.

157
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:54,028
Thank you, Councilman.

158
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,351
for expressing those concerns.

159
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,671
I echo all of them.

160
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:10,673
I think it's important that as we as we hear so often, even this evening, that a lot of the issues we're having with parking has nothing to do with method residents.

161
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:19,315
It has people that come outside of method that want to use our recreational spaces or our restaurants or our theaters and, um,

162
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:24,198
and it really displaces the quality of life of our residents.

163
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:39,710
So if we can, like Councilor Knight said, you know, in the case that we've had in other locations and it's worked, I think we need to follow up on this stretch of road as well.

164
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,951
So thank you, Madam President.

165
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:59,513
on the motion of counselors second by vice president bears.

166
00:12:59,613 --> 00:12:59,873
Yes.

167
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,294
Councilor Carribelle.

168
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:01,614
Yes.

169
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:02,894
Councilor Collins.

170
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:03,254
Yes.

171
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:04,375
Councilor night.

172
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:04,855
Yes.

173
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:05,856
Councilor Scarpa.

174
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,156
Yes.

175
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:07,016
Councilor Singh.

176
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:07,817
Yes.

177
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:09,698
President Morrell.

178
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:10,138
Yes.

179
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,309
22-303 offered by Councillor Carviello.

180
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:24,614
It is resolved that the administration report back to the council with the status of the veteran's office and how the veterans of Medford will be receiving services going forward.

181
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:25,834
Councillor Carviello.

182
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:26,575
Thank you, Madam President.

183
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:28,836
We did receive an email.

184
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:01,992
you know.

185
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:19,052
we're interviewing anybody, and that office needs to be staffed immediately, and not by telephone.

186
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:24,215
One life is too many lives, I have to say, for veterans that commit suicide on a daily basis.

187
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:33,521
So, Madam President, I would hope that the mayor would come back with us within the next week or two, saying that they're interviewing candidates for this job.

188
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:35,222
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

189
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:36,863
Any further discussion?

190
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:39,085
If you just want to read the last part,

191
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,131
the update from the Chief of Staff, just to read out the contact information so people have it.

192
00:14:44,191 --> 00:15:02,574
So currently, if any veteran needs support, they can call the Medford Department of Veteran Services at 781-393-2505, or email seniorclerkdarlingwhite at dwhite at medford-ma.gov, or Wilmington's Veterans Department at 97694-2040, or email Mr. Lewis Maglia directly at lcimaglia,

193
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,384
at WilmingtonMA.gov.

194
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:13,966
So that is the current information.

195
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:16,268
I hope that's also updated all over the website as well.

196
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,690
Councilor Knight.

197
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,916
If we could just get a copy of the contract between the town of Wilmington and the city of Memphis for these services from the administration.

198
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:25,557
I appreciate it.

199
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:27,959
Do you want that as a just amendment?

200
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:28,379
Please.

201
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:32,643
For the discussion.

202
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,865
So we are the motion.

203
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:45,586
Second by second.

204
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:46,206
Mr. President bears.

205
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:46,506
Yes.

206
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:46,706
Yes.

207
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:46,886
Yes.

208
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:46,986
Yes.

209
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:47,126
Yes.

210
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:12,606
President Morrell.

211
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:13,068
Yes.

212
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:13,529
7-4-0-0.

213
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:13,749
Negative.

214
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:14,090
Motion passes.

215
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:43,640
22-304, be it resolved that the Metro City Council requests an update from the city administration on the solid waste task force, including the scope and goals of the task force, opportunities for short and long-term waste reduction, inefficacy evaluation of our current recycling services, opportunities to further reduce waste and more efficiently recycle in our next waste management contract, and how our city's progress towards a zero waste future can be publicly tracked and made available to the public.

216
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:52,277
be it for the resolve of the administration, provide an update on what, if any regulations and requirements currently governs private waste and recycling collars operating in Medford.

217
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:53,638
Councilor Collins.

218
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,099
Thank you, President Morrell.

219
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,959
Resolution speaks for itself.

220
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:06,261
I know that we're coming up on, you know, we're a bit more than a year out from when our city's waste management contracts will be up.

221
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:13,423
So I think it's, you know, about time that we start, you know, making sure that the administration is looking at how things are going with our

222
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:23,733
current contractor with an eye towards how we can improve our overall waste reduction and efficacy of recycling in the next one.

223
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:28,615
That doesn't necessarily mean a new contractor, but I think it's a good time to start re-evaluating.

224
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:41,039
We're always overdue for evaluating how we can be further accelerating towards a zero waste future, evaluating how good we are at recycling all the things that we think that we're recycling.

225
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:41,999
I also want to make sure that that

226
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:57,275
also takes into account any private waste haulers that are operating on properties in Medford to ensure that across the board, we're doing what we can to dispose of waste, recycle as efficiently as we can in line with our climate and pollution goals.

227
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,317
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

228
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,277
Vice President Behrs.

229
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,939
Thank you, Madam President.

230
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,560
Thank you, Councilor Collins for putting this on the agenda.

231
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:10,585
I think this is really an essential effort considering when this contract goes up.

232
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,612
the new contract will be pricier than the current contract.

233
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:18,035
And as I think we've seen, there's a lot of increases in the cost of waste removal and waste management.

234
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:31,464
Since we last signed the contract on this, one of the ways that we can mitigate the impact of the growing cost of waste removal, crowding out other essential priorities in the city budget, is to reduce the amount of overall waste that we are producing as a city.

235
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:35,246
So I think this is a great resolution and I second it and will support it.

236
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:48,398
I wanted to thank Councillor Collins for introducing such a thoughtful resolution.

237
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:58,045
Measures like this represent the action that we can take at the local level to address the growing climate catastrophe that we're facing.

238
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:07,433
I know that many feel a sense of dread and hopelessness, but I think Councillor Collins shows us today that we can be hopeful, but we just have to act.

239
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:21,606
And resolutions like this show that our city is acting, and that our city council in particular is trying to get the answers that we need to create the policies that we need to address climate emergency.

240
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:42,196
At the, at the local level, both overall and at the local level, reducing waste is one of the key, one of the key ways that we can that we can pursue one of the key paths we can pursue towards meeting, you know, meeting a better future that's more sustainable.

241
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:42,797
And so,

242
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:47,982
I am I full wholeheartedly support this resolution.

243
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:55,332
And I think I would like our city to do in the city administration to do more research into what else we can.

244
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,377
What what other measures we can take towards the zero waste goal.

245
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,819
Um, you know,

246
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:20,954
There are a lot of cities that are innovating right now, they've developed textile recycling programs, they've done on different programs with technical, technical parts, and I would like to see our city explore those options and also to make what options do exist more accessible to all Medfordians.

247
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:24,617
Thank you.

248
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:32,910
spent a lot of time in this area and it's been my day job, so I really thank you for bringing this forward.

249
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:39,073
And a lot of, if not most of the callers contracted these days do have the ability to provide data.

250
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:41,094
So I think this is a really important resolution.

251
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:44,596
It's something that we should be looking for in the city because when we know better, we can do better.

252
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,157
So I also really appreciate you bringing this forward.

253
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:52,140
So on the motion, Councilor Collins, second by Vice President Behrs.

254
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:56,548
Vice President Behrs.

255
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:56,948

Councilor Kerrio.

257

Councilor Knight.

261
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:02,772
Yes.

President Morrell.

267
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:09,056

268
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,517
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

271
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,166
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

272
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:40,669

Yes, Councilor Carvio.

274
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,570
Yes, Councilor Collins.

275
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,030

276
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,350
Councilor night.

277
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:47,491
Councilor Scott Kelly.

278
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:49,752
Councilor saying yes.

279
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:51,472
President Morrell.

280
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:56,193
Yes, I never as you're in the negative, the rules are suspended to take public participation on a quarter.

281
00:21:56,653 --> 00:22:01,035
At this time, anyone would like to speak, please feel free to come to the podium.

282
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:08,817
If anyone would like to speak on zoom, you can raise your hand but I rotate hand on zoom so folks would like to speak in the chambers.

283
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:11,787
one at a time when you're ready.

284
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,630
Yes, you can, yeah, whoever wants to speak, you can come up.

285
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,194
Yep, yeah, everyone can speak.

286
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:22,655
Everyone who wants to speak can speak.

287
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:24,697
There's a lot of us here tonight.

288
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,438
Can I just, sorry, just name and address real quick.

289
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:31,042
Sure, I'm sorry, Elizabeth Maloney, Liza Maloney, 26 Bradley Road.

290
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:35,385
So thank you for giving us just a moment tonight.

291
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:37,207
There's many of us here from 26 Bradley.

292
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:43,624
So you're aware of kind of what's been going on.

293
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:46,806
And I know last week I did speak with you to via Zoom.

294
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,108
So we're hoping to work more closely with you.

295
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:57,012
We've been given another 30 day extension, I guess, with our kind of eviction, if you will.

296
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,073
It's just not enough time.

297
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:04,617
There's families in the building with children in the Medford school system.

298
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:09,300
It's just, it's sickening to be quite honest with you.

299
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:14,035
So we just hope to work with you more closely and keep coming to these meetings.

300
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:16,537
You know, meet the mayor next Thursday.

301
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:25,022
We saw that she starts her kind of open house, if you will, again, and just stay together as we get through this process.

302
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:29,905
But it's very upsetting that this kind of could happen in Bedford to anyone.

303
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:33,787
So if anyone else wants to.

304
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:41,786
do have an update from our planning department is all I can read, but I want to make sure everyone gets a chance to speak.

305
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:44,308
Thank you, Madam President, council members.

306
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:46,449
My name is Sean Temple.

307
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:55,393
I live at 26 Bradley Road, and I may be the senior member of the residents there.

308
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:58,414
I've been there maybe 25 years.

309
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:06,298
We just received a notice, a certified letter on Friday stating that we have to vacate.

310
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,581
the premises.

311
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:12,864
I've been there 25 years and nothing like this.

312
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:33,459
The Donados owned the building at one time and then it was sold to another management company, Sinead, and then in turn sold it to another management company who is now, I guess, I know, you know, residency is a high commodity these days.

313
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:41,480
You know, we have a lot of senior people here who live in the building as well as myself.

314
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:50,342
And, you know, I just feel, you know, just being kind of railroaded out of the building, you know, without any cause.

315
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:55,844
I mean, they don't really notify us about anything since I took over the building.

316
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:59,824
You know, it doesn't seem right.

317
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:01,745
You know, and whatever.

318
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:30,660
what I've found out so far is that they've only given us like 30 days and I think it's supposed to give us more time, you know, and I'm not even sure, you know, I'm not exactly sure how much time that is, but I mean, you know, it just doesn't seem practical, you know, and we're here today just to try to state our case about what's going on over there, you know, so that's what we're doing here.

319
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,501
Thank you for your time.

320
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:40,475

321
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,478
Well, is there anything that you guys can do?

322
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:45,799
Are we wasting our time?

323
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:51,023
Not not being sarcastic or anything, but is there anything that can be done legally?

324
00:25:51,223 --> 00:25:54,545
Or are you guys just listening?

325
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:58,669
Or is there something you can do with this company or to?

326
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,950
I think Councilor Morocco has a better

327
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:10,094
From what I've been told, I spoke to a couple of people that, from what I understand, they've given another 30 days.

328
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:11,655
So B1 has 60 days.

329
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:19,616
They are going to honor the leases that people have also until they expire also.

330
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:27,758
But I know there's some people in there with vouchers that they're in a little bit of a tough spot because if they get evicted, it can affect their voucher.

331
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:28,378
Right.

332
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,219
And that's the weird part.

333
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:34,084
apartments up to like two or three weeks ago.

334
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:35,905
It didn't make sense.

335
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,486
But for me, I'm going to find something.

336
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:45,367
But for a lot of people that live there, it's really... And as a city employee, it's really upsetting.

337
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:54,410
It's ridiculous to let a company come in and upset people's lives, especially after what's been going on the last two years.

338
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,651
You would think that people would have more compassion, but I guess this is a...

339
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:17,125
I know some of you may have received some information from the city or some avenues, maybe for some funding or some help.

340
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:37,043
Yeah, I'm not worried about that.

341
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:38,863
She'll be out of it.

342
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:43,045
She does not want you guys to believe it.

343
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:51,669
Do you see her on here?

344
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,831
Okay, thank you.

345
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:59,592
Thank you, and so sorry about this microphone buzzing.

346
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:00,813
We're not sure why that's happening.

347
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:18,674
To the question of, you know, can we do anything, and I'm really grateful to everybody who's been in contact with the city council and other city officials about this, and we're really glad not to know about it, but glad to be kept updated about what's going on.

348
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:25,778
And I think, you know, I don't want to speak for my colleagues, but I think we all empathize with you and we all accept that this is happening.

349
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:34,882
But to the question of what can we do about it, I think, speaking only for myself, you know, taking care not to speak for anybody else, we want to make sure that you're advocating to the people who have the power to help

350
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:36,405
you in this position.

351
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:45,930
Unfortunately, we need to make sure that you're advocating to the right people.

352
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:58,276
We need to make sure that you're talking to the people who have the power to either alleviate the expense and the inconvenience and the stress and the work and the anxiety of finding new housing.

353
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:16,233
When I talk, no, it's everybody's.

354
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:22,156
Yeah.

355
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:24,417
Motion for a five-minute recess.

356
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:25,677
Motion approved.

357
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:27,758
Questions and comments?

358
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:29,219
Any results that you'd like to propose?

359
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:30,520
Subject to approval?

360
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:33,581
Yes.

361
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:40,705
Yes.

362
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,867
Yes, if it's my turn.

363
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,941
Recess has ended, the meeting is back to order.

364
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:16,462
I just want to go back to Councilor Collins.

365
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:20,986
I believe you were in the middle and then we have Vice Mayor Behrs and then we'll come back to the residents.

366
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:23,407
Whatever you want to do.

367
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:25,749
Councilor Collins.

368
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:27,050
Thank you, President Marillyn.

369
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,552
Thank you to our AV wizard back there.

370
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:40,119
What I was saying is that, you know, we appreciate the tenants keeping us informed of your situation and, you know, speaking only for myself and probably for

371
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:43,990
Many other, if not all of my colleagues, we stand in solidarity with you.

372
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:46,993
We're sorry for what you're going through.

373
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:54,539
I think that we need to make sure that you're advocating to the right people, the people with the power to adjust your situation.

374
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:02,987
As it's been stated, since this is proceeding legally, there's nothing that we can do in these chambers

375
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:11,124
know, to wave a magic wand and give you what you deserve, you know, what you need, what you're asking for.

376
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:19,645
And I think that, you know, I'm certainly speaking for myself, I want to be in contact with, you know, this tenant group to make sure that you're connected with the right people.

377
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:25,887
I know they've already received some very helpful, you know, what I seem to be like helpful pertinent information from our Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability.

378
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:50,857
I hope that to the extent that's helpful, you can remain in contact with our housing staff, other resources around the city, you know, and I hope that, you know, on an individual counselor basis, we can stay in contact to make sure that you're accessing the resources that are available to see what can happen here, you know, to appeal to perhaps this property owners that are angels.

379
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,138
Thank you.

380
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:53,418
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

381
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,158
Vice President Behrs.

382
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:55,279
Thank you, Madam President.

383
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,881
you know, I think you're all experiencing very directly the housing crisis that we're in in this area.

384
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:08,283
Something that we as a council have talked a lot about is housing stability and what city resources we can provide.

385
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:11,964
But, you know, I think Councilor Collins was very direct.

386
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:14,405
You know, we are constrained by state law.

387
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,486
We can't go in and say you can't do this.

388
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:18,866
It's not within the power of the city of Medford to do that.

389
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:23,888
What is within our power is to do what Councilor Collins said and what I think if

390
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:27,354
President Morrell may read the update if it hasn't gone to all of you.

391
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,128
provide as many resources and as much information as possible.

392
00:32:32,188 --> 00:32:36,729
We do have access to pro bono legal aid for housing situations for residents of the city.

393
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,829
We have a program that helps people move within the city with financial support.

394
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,770
And to be direct, there's a lot of state laws that need to change around this.

395
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:54,272
I think we've been advocating, at least I've been advocating for some of those changes at this point, even if they were to go through, it's not gonna stop the situation.

396
00:32:54,532 --> 00:32:57,453
And I'm sorry for that, but they do need to change.

397
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:13,957
The other piece of this is I think fully, if you are able and if it, with the advice of legal counsel, I'm not a lawyer and I'm not certainly not your lawyer, but if you're able to get that legal advice, you do have a significant number of protections on the table here.

398
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:17,898
They've provided a notice to quit that's now gonna be active after 60 days.

399
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:20,799
That's the initiation of a process.

400
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:22,239
It's not the end of a process.

401
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,560
That process would then,

402
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,825
essentially begin an eviction proceeding, which would then take you before a judge, that can last months.

403
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:36,592
It may not end the way that you want it to, but it may give you enough time to find something in this market.

404
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:39,035
So I would suggest that.

405
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:47,371
or with the advice of council, if it's possible for you, if it's not going to impact you negatively in some other way, just fully see out your legal rights.

406
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:49,611
And that may extend the process with enough time.

407
00:33:50,112 --> 00:34:04,877
But, you know, we as a city also need to take, you know, going forward, this is an example of why we need more resources for housing stability, more than just a couple people, more than just a couple affordable units, because it takes months and months and months.

408
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:09,723
to find housing in this market and with the very limited supply of housing.

409
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:14,490
So I again I'm also very sorry that this is happening.

410
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:18,720
you know, big corporate change has just suddenly uprooted your lives.

411
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:31,630
And I wish that we had more power to help, but certainly we can advocate, continue to reach out to this person, ask them to be compassionate, as Councilor Caravaglio said, ask them to extend the time period.

412
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:44,700
And if they won't do anything more there, I certainly would suggest that you avail yourselves of all of the options that come before you in the legal process to extend this and give yourself as much time as you can to find

413
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:46,112
new housing.

414
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,193
Thank you, Vice President Barris.

415
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:54,255
And then actually, if I could just read the update from Planning, Development, and Sustainability, that might just be helpful to any questions that come up.

416
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:56,456
But of course, everyone is still welcome to speak.

417
00:34:57,256 --> 00:35:01,038
So this is from Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

418
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:05,679
And some of this is coming verbatim from the person who purchased the property.

419
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,820
So if this is incorrect, I apologize.

420
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,481
This is just the story that they are getting.

421
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,862
So it's a 34-unit building.

422
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:19,350
So the director of planning development sustainability and the housing planner spoke with the owner and some of his representatives this past Friday.

423
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:26,877
So it's a 34 unit building and the owner let them know that 18 units for tenants at will, 14 have leases until the fall.

424
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:36,219
The new owner purchased the building one year ago in March 2021, and he said that all units that are tenants at will were in that status when he purchased the building.

425
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,308
It's clear that his plan is to renovate kitchens, bathrooms, and redo floors, and that the tenants must vacate the apartments for this to occur as they are one-bathroom units.

426
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:46,990
It was clear that rent would go up after the renovations.

427
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:52,676
He agreed to extend the notice for the tenants at will an additional 30 days for those who needed an extension.

428
00:35:53,217 --> 00:36:02,507
His representative, Jay Walsh, contacted the department on Friday night to let them know that everyone who had received a notice to quit had been notified that they could have an additional 30 days.

429
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:11,728
The director with the city requested that the owner give the tenants with leases as much notice as possible as it's necessary to look for now.

430
00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:18,430
New rental units in September, given this market, look sorry, look now for rental units in September, given the market.

431
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:26,042
The owner indicated that he understood and would take into advisement and give more notice that he had been planning.

432
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:33,789
The city director requested that he give the tenants the opportunity to stay in the building, potentially by giving them the option to return to the renovated apartment.

433
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:46,680
This seems to be a new idea to him, but he seemed to think it was very reasonable and suggested that once some apartments were renovated, those with longer leases could be offered the option to lease one of the renovated apartments rather than being required to move out.

434
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:51,862
we emphasize, the city emphasized that we very much would like to retain Medford residents in Medford.

435
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:53,443
And I will make sure you guys get this.

436
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,064
There's just like two more paragraphs.

437
00:36:56,045 --> 00:37:13,277
The city also presented him with information from the Medford Housing Authority on their opportunity for landlords to receive $1,000 for leasing a unit to a section eight voucher holder that hadn't previously leased to someone with section eight and let them know that the maximum section eight rents are what the maximum section eight rents are in Medford.

438
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:18,477
It's the city director's hope that he would consider Section 8 voucher holders for the renovated units.

439
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:26,222
The current Section 8 tenants are through the Arlington Housing Authority, and the landlord has been in touch with them to verify that everything that they did was legal.

440
00:37:26,982 --> 00:37:33,507
The city director did not ask him about current or future rent rates, as they were focused on keeping Medford residents housed at this time.

441
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:41,692
And they just went out to note that they did flyer every door in the building with the flyers with regard to ABCD and the move in, move out program.

442
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:46,198
Um, if anyone didn't get that information, we can make sure that that gets to you.

443
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:56,182
Um, so any further questions we can relate to them and as fellow council just said, we, as a, we, as a body don't have any statutory power, but we can absolutely advocate.

444
00:37:56,222 --> 00:37:58,823
We can reach out to, you know, the city departments.

445
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:03,985
I put in a call to Senator Jalen to see if there's anything that, you know, we may not be thinking of that can be done.

446
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:07,647
So I think even though we don't have direct power in this situation,

447
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:10,848
As fellow counselors said, you know, my heart breaks for you guys.

448
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,208
This is obviously also this is the tip of the iceberg, right?

449
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:25,412
Like, this is stuff that we've been trying to stave off for the past two years and the housing market being what it is, we're unfortunately going to keep, you know, this is going to keep happening to our residents and it's not right.

450
00:38:26,462 --> 00:38:28,223
we'll do what we can to stop it.

451
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:30,404
But unfortunately, we don't have a lot of power in this situation.

452
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:32,706
But thank you for bearing with me.

453
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:35,988
Please just name and address.

454
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:38,269
I mean, we know the address, but name and address for the record, please.

455
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,585
many people here today.

456
00:38:44,165 --> 00:38:47,967
And ultimately, everyone kind of said what we're all thinking, right?

457
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:51,889
Like we all wish that there could be a better resolution, we wish that someone would step in and help us.

458
00:38:52,469 --> 00:39:06,276
I think at the end of the day, the biggest issue that we have is that these companies are not going anywhere, they're going to buy more buildings in this town, they're going to buy more units, they're going to kick more people out and leave them without an option.

459
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:07,777
And they're going to do it in a way that

460
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:20,060
is unethical, is immoral, and I just don't think that this is a direction that the town of Medford, the city of Medford should want to trend in because, listen, I've lived here since 2015.

461
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,941
I didn't always live in this building, but I've lived in Medford because I love living in Medford.

462
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:28,322
As of May 1st, I'm living in Brighton, Massachusetts.

463
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:34,263
I didn't want to, but luckily I found a place because I didn't know my options, right?

464
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:36,444
And ultimately, you know, I'm lucky.

465
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:39,225
other people in our building are not going to be as lucky.

466
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:42,805
And these are citizens of our town.

467
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:45,646
These are residents of our town that love being here.

468
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:46,666
They want to be here.

469
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:55,128
And for someone who has never been in the building to take that away from them and not give them a real option, it's just morally bankrupt.

470
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:55,968
It's wrong.

471
00:39:56,488 --> 00:40:00,889
And I understand that there's limited power here for all of us, right?

472
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:02,950
Us as residents, you guys as

473
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:11,032
as president, as, as, as counselors, we understand that, but, you know, we're an example of what's going to happen to more and more buildings in this town.

474
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:11,612
Right.

475
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,772
And, and ultimately you don't want that.

476
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:18,233
I feel I wouldn't want that because I love Medford for everything Medford has.

477
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:23,475
And if Medford ceases to be Medford, why are we going to be here and why are we going to spend money here?

478
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:24,535
Why are we gonna spend time here?

479
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:29,736
So I just wanted to make it known that this company, there's a lot like them, right.

480
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:30,856
And they're not going anywhere.

481
00:40:31,116 --> 00:40:33,197
And I just think that there needs to be more sort of

482
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:37,880
you know, it's a free market, but what are they doing for the people who live here?

483
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,960
And how is it trending?

484
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,785
Because at the end of the day, kicking us all out, putting a fake marble kitchen in and charging double the price, who are you bringing in really?

485
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:51,368
You're going to bring in people that don't care about this town and don't want to be here and don't want to settle down.

486
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,590
So that's all I got to say about it.

487
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,751
And thank you for giving me the time.

488
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,473
Sorry, I'm not good at this kind of, everyone's in a suit.

489
00:40:58,513 --> 00:40:59,654
I feel really uncomfortable.

490
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:00,775
So I'm sorry.

491
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:01,275
Thank you.

492
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:05,836
Would anyone else like to speak?

493
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:09,037
See if there's anyone on Zoom.

494
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,041
Any further discussion from the council?

495
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:32,590
I will make sure, is there, I'm trying to think as far as if just to get, I'll work with the Planning Development and Sustainability Office just to make sure the contents of that email that I just read out gets to you all.

496
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:43,301
I'm sorry, I'll work with the director of the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability to make sure the contents of the email that I just read gets to everyone.

497
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:51,924
I know you've probably been given that information in a few different forms, but I'll make sure it's packaged and it gets to everyone.

498
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:58,867
I understand, I know, I apologize.

499
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:01,758
Any further discussion?

500
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:05,183
If you do want to come up to the microphone.

501
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:29,068
I mean, this whole process here is a little bit mute, mute, you mean it's, we have no rights, because these corporations come in, and they just take over and they in this has been going on.

502
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:44,981
I've been in the Boston area, 40 years and as councilmen as statesmen, the people, you're supposed to know what's saying that you're not, but people should represent the people and they're not representing the people they're representing the corporations who's got the deep pockets, who can do whatever they want.

503
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,120
And it isn't right.

504
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,361
And I'm not mad at you.

505
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:50,462
I think this is the wrong forum.

506
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:51,322
Yeah.

507
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,223
So I think, yeah, exactly as the inappropriate for you're in the wrong.

508
00:42:54,263 --> 00:42:54,924
I agree with you.

509
00:42:54,964 --> 00:42:55,524
I agree with you.

510
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:57,505
So I'm coming to that conclusion.

511
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:03,047
So I mean, what is the next phone, we take it, we have to take it to the next state level.

512
00:43:03,107 --> 00:43:03,907
Is that where it goes?

513
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,808
I mean, but at that point, it'll be new.

514
00:43:05,988 --> 00:43:07,949
I mean, it'll be I'll be gone by then because

515
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:11,205
No one can throw you out of that apartment but a judge, right?

516
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:15,307
It's not like after 60 days, they're gonna lock the doors, take away the key and take all your stuff.

517
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:16,388
I mean, they can't do that, right?

518
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,609
It has to go through a process.

519
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:28,317
I just wanna let you know how traumatizing it was to get a message Monday afternoon at 1258 saying to me, you need to vacate the property and all your belongings in 30 days.

520
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:32,172
I called the property management, they would not pick up the phone.

521
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:38,435
I spoke with them, I said, you know, I have an ankle injury and I'm in physical therapy because I fell in the pool.

522
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:39,916
And they still said, no, you have to go.

523
00:43:39,936 --> 00:43:43,637
I understand that everybody has a personal circumstance, there's 32 units in the building.

524
00:43:43,777 --> 00:43:46,639
But you know, ultimately, right, it's, you have to vacate, or what?

525
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:48,679
Well, we're gonna take you to court, right?

526
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:51,040
But I don't wanna be, I don't want on my record to be evicted.

527
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,121
I mean, I don't need that on my, I don't need that.

528
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:55,262
But it's a no fault eviction because it's not for non-payment of rent.

529
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:56,403
Right.

530
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:57,043
You know what I mean?

531
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,184
So it's not for non-payment of rent, it's not for, you know,

532
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:01,086
selling drugs out of the apartment.

533
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:08,070
No, no, no cause right it's it's a contract issue right it's a contract issue between the property owner and the tenants that are in the property.

534
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:08,831
Right.

535
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:19,418
So, ultimately, the forum where it's going to be resolved would be in some type of mediation, whether in the court system, you know what I mean as this goes through the process but the notice to quit.

536
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:23,849
It's just like, listen, in 30 days, we're filing an application.

537
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:25,110
That's really what it is, right?

538
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,611
So it's, they're giving you a 30 days notice to say they're going to take action.

539
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:34,654
Right now, through the discussions that have happened here at this body and through the administration, they've said, look, it's not going to be 30 days now.

540
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:36,095
It's going to be 60 days.

541
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:36,595
Correct.

542
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:37,055
Right.

543
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,817
And if anybody is a tenant at Willow's leases up, we're not going to move on them.

544
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:41,658
Right.

545
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:42,898
We're going to wait 60 days.

546
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:43,779
Correct.

547
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:44,159
Right.

548
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,281
So that's going to initiate the process, but think,

549
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:50,704
Between the, what was it?

550
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,246
18 units that have leases and 14 that don't?

551
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:54,047
Yes.

552
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:54,828
Or vice versa.

553
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:56,409
It is.

554
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,315
Yeah, 18 without leases.

555
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,055
18 with leases, right?

556
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,817
All probably expiring at different times.

557
00:45:05,298 --> 00:45:06,659
All the 60 day notice to stick with.

558
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,622
By the time this building gets empty, how long, how much time is this going to pass?

559
00:45:10,348 --> 00:45:14,450
Right, it's gonna be at least six months because I don't know my name.

560
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,071
My neighbor my neighbor just signed a lease.

561
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:19,433
She just moved in and she's the leases over in August.

562
00:45:19,813 --> 00:45:20,834
I honestly don't know sir.

563
00:45:20,854 --> 00:45:21,935
Right, right.

564
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:25,517
It's just the manner in which they did this was inhumane.

565
00:45:26,237 --> 00:45:34,762
Well, and I mean I understand they have a right to buy a building I understand they have a right to do whatever they want with the property, but it's the manner in which they went about doing it to people.

566
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:37,025
was totally wrong.

567
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:40,768
And they wouldn't knew when they bought the building, how long those tenants were in that building.

568
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:49,173
So they knew they should be dealing with this in an appropriate manner with people who have been residents there for a long time.

569
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:55,277
People recognize business is business, but there's also a humanity part of this too, which is more, it's principle.

570
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:58,679
I mean, yeah, you're talking about public service.

571
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,640
You know, it's the principle and I'm not mad at it.

572
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,062
It's just the principle matter of this and the manner in which they did it.

573
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:05,643
I'm totally traumatized.

574
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:06,439
Yeah.

575
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,301
And it's, that's fair.

576
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:16,344
I mean, there's the answer that counselor and I just gave you, which is about the specific circumstance in the court of law and your legal rights.

577
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,825
I mean, then there's the other question that you're bringing up.

578
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:19,966
You've been here for 40 years.

579
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:27,110
That means that you remember 30 years ago when it, you know, voters in Wellesley voted away, went control for people in Boston, you know,

580
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:30,945
do you think owns the corporations that are buying up the apartment.

581
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:43,635
And that's where it is, you know, we are extremely limited by state law, there's a couple things that we can try to do, we can try to provide more resources and notice about your legal rights, which is what we're able to do in this case, that's something we can do.

582
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:48,399
I mean, I'm an advocate of asking the state to implement a lot of laws to kind of create

583
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,240
create a better set of conditions for people.

584
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:56,202
I think it needs to go to the state legislature, honestly, because, you know, if it's not me next, you next.

585
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,222
You know, if people don't speak up.

586
00:46:58,883 --> 00:46:59,123
Right.

587
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,824
And there's a, you know, there's a lot of groups.

588
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:03,664
It'll be like California, you won't be able to live here.

589
00:47:03,764 --> 00:47:16,109
There's a lot of groups and tenants, advocates and people who are saying, you know, begging the state government, you know, they'll do anything, you know, unanimously they'll pass a law that says, you know, we'll free up this zoning and you can build something bigger, but

590
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:30,350
They won't attach to it just cause eviction or rent stabilization so you can have a 30% rent increase in a single year, or, you know, the tenant opportunity to purchase or all these other things that would give tenants more of a balance in this fight.

591
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,012
And so, you know, that's something that we can advocate for but

592
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:37,834
we legally can't implement any of that unless the state lets us.

593
00:47:38,514 --> 00:47:48,355
And I'm just saying, it's worth going to the next level and saying, this happened in your state rep district or your state Senate district, and we need you to take, we need you to do something.

594
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:55,937
And, you know, it's, yeah, I think you've made a very strong point about the conditions of who's making the law in Massachusetts.

595
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:59,417
And I do appreciate your time and the resources.

596
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:03,018
However, I mean, I did call some of the numbers and I feel as though that,

597
00:48:03,478 --> 00:48:06,061
I called this number and then I could go to this person.

598
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:09,144
Oh, now we're gonna go to this person, then it's like this person.

599
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:13,089
This is why I never became a public servant because I like to produce and I like results.

600
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,191
Yeah, I hear you.

601
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,092
I don't like passing.

602
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:20,417
And I'm not saying you are passing the buck, but people will take the pass the buck.

603
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:22,139
And when is the buck stop.

604
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:37,474
Maybe, you know, and I'm just saying, and I'm not saying you know maybe we can maybe we can maybe we can ask, I'm assigned to, I know they're thin but with this being such a dire situation having a assigned member for office.

605
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:49,239
They're working directly with the families and the homeowners of Bradley will be an advocate even for the state because you know this is really this is this is getting out of control, but I think with this is such a dire situation I think that.

606
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:53,442
And one of the biggest things is having someone on the other line I think that's important.

607
00:48:54,002 --> 00:49:08,613
I think the least we can do is recommend that, uh, Miss Hunts puts a identified representative from their office that's going to work directly with the people of Bradley Road because of because of this die situation.

608
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:09,834
I don't think they'll block at that.

609
00:49:09,894 --> 00:49:12,896
I think that they'll they'll really work hard to do that.

610
00:49:12,936 --> 00:49:14,337
But I think that's very important.

611
00:49:14,857 --> 00:49:29,754
That, you know, where we were handcuffed, at least you should have an avenue within our city hall that are going to at least point you in the right direction and make sure that someone's going to be on the other line because I can't, I can't even imagine what you're going through right now.

612
00:49:30,295 --> 00:49:32,958
And the stress level, at least we can do is ask the city.

613
00:49:33,328 --> 00:49:44,342
to take that stress level out, so they can help you move forward those chores so no thank you if I could recommend that that'd be something that no I appreciate that because you know I did make a call this week and the woman says where you can go live in a shelter.

614
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:46,364
Well that's great.

615
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:47,786
That's what they told me disgusting.

616
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:50,509
My sister lives in a shelter and I used to go to that shelter.

617
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:59,730
Well, I think if we can do that, because there are avenues and I know that it's easy for us to sit on this side.

618
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:05,754
And it's easy because we have, you know, we have homes right now but the idea of what you're going through.

619
00:50:06,154 --> 00:50:15,160
We don't, we can't say we understand because we don't, but we can also understand that if we can do this and we could follow from what I've, I've talked to a few different attorneys I can't.

620
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:17,805
By law, I can't tell you I get it.

621
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:18,245
I get it.

622
00:50:18,466 --> 00:50:21,908
I know that like Councilmate says, this isn't an easy process.

623
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:36,058
No, and you have to go to even as you as residents there if you take advantage of what we have in the city to finance legal representation that that building can stay the same for a long time.

624
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,601
And you just what you're doing is banded together that's very important.

625
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:48,476
have someone direct you from the city to the right avenues and make sure that someone's on the other line and follow through with the resources we can offer you.

626
00:50:48,937 --> 00:50:55,845
And I think that at least gives us some time to find out other ways that we can get to the state and have the state representatives

627
00:50:56,272 --> 00:51:06,337
look at different options, whether it's finding ways to, uh, you know, work directly with housing within different state housing, um, processes or whatnot.

628
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:20,024
So there's got to be something out there that, like you said, this is the worst case scenario, and I know what's happening today, and like Councilor Behr says, this is probably the beginning of something more drastic moving forward.

629
00:51:20,653 --> 00:51:25,355
I mean, if you look at the rents out there, the rents out there, and I've already saw four apartments and I just cried.

630
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:27,356
I just cried.

631
00:51:27,396 --> 00:51:30,078
I was just like, and what they're charging for $1,700.

632
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:40,063
I mean, it's pretty, I mean, you walk in these carpets are dirty, you go out, you know what I mean, two feet and you get a big plate of salt and use your shovels, you can shovel your own walk.

633
00:51:40,703 --> 00:51:43,924
That's really what, you can live in this basement apartment, but we're not gonna clean it.

634
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:45,665
But you can request it to be cleaned.

635
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:47,326
I said, excuse me, it's not clean.

636
00:51:47,366 --> 00:51:48,907
No, you're not gonna clean it after I move in.

637
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,992
or before I move it after I said Alicia, I. So at the recommendation of Councilor- Yeah, I appreciate that.

638
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:56,072
I apologize that I'm so upset.

639
00:51:56,092 --> 00:51:57,433
No, no, you have every right to.

640
00:51:58,894 --> 00:51:59,854
That's the reason why we're here.

641
00:51:59,894 --> 00:52:04,756
We wish we could do more, but we're here to listen and help in any way we can.

642
00:52:04,816 --> 00:52:05,576
No, I appreciate that.

643
00:52:05,616 --> 00:52:13,279
If this is little that we can do, and at least let you know that you have seven people that understand, excuse me,

644
00:52:14,903 --> 00:52:16,544
can be there for you just to listen.

645
00:52:16,764 --> 00:52:18,205
That's the best we can do.

646
00:52:18,225 --> 00:52:18,985
I hope that can help.

647
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:21,207
But listen, I wish I could do more.

648
00:52:21,227 --> 00:52:22,127
You've been wonderful.

649
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:22,487
Thank you.

650
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,588
I appreciate you taking the time.

651
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:24,288
I wish we could do more.

652
00:52:24,428 --> 00:52:26,410
It's good that it's voiced here.

653
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,592
And I think it needs to be representative of the state.

654
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,073
I've just seen so much.

655
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:34,194
It's incredible.

656
00:52:34,214 --> 00:52:36,115
It's just incredible what happens.

657
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:44,000
I'll call up the director to get you guys a dedicated contact person just to at least try to mitigate the call here, call there.

658
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:48,636
I can be an advocate because it has to stop.

659
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,156
It really has to stop somewhere.

660
00:52:50,436 --> 00:52:50,916
Absolutely.

661
00:52:51,116 --> 00:52:53,357
Yeah.

662
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:53,757
Thank you.

663
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:54,237
Thank you.

664
00:53:16,304 --> 00:53:16,504
Yes.

665
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:18,226
Yes.

666
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:19,528
Yes.

667
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:24,744
Yes, I mean, the firm is doing the negative.

668
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:33,387
The motion passes reverting to regular order of business reports of committees to 2-012 March 29 2022 subcommittee on ordinances and rules.

669
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:37,268
Uh, vice president Ferris, if you could provide us a brief overview of that meeting.

670
00:53:37,469 --> 00:53:38,369
Thank you, Madam President.

671
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:43,551
Um, last week we met again in subcommittee on rules and ordinances.

672
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:45,652
Uh, I think our third meeting

673
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:50,515
At our March 9th meeting, we reported out a number of suggested changes.

674
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:56,019
We reported out a number of additional suggested changes at our March 29th meeting.

675
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,745
And those will be, I believe, included in packets this week, both a track change document and a clean document.

676
00:54:04,525 --> 00:54:20,936
The other item we reported out was an item for further discussion, which was around our meetings, days, times, Tuesday to Wednesday, biweekly, a number of other matters that the subcommittee felt required the full discussion of the council and not a recommendation from just three councilors.

677
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:30,503
So that will be kind of the agenda is going over the suggested changes, as well as a discussion of the meeting times for the council.

678
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:34,069
Thank you, Vice President Harris.

679
00:54:34,629 --> 00:54:41,734

687
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,770
This was a meeting on the proposed polystyrene ban.

688
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,332
We reviewed the draft that was edited by KP Law.

689
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,653
There was no debate over the minor edits that were made.

690
00:55:11,693 --> 00:55:18,676
The only change that was suggested and voted on was to adjust the effective date to July, 2023.

691
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:22,578
And that will be coming before the full council next week.
