1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:17,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President bears president counts of Carabiello counselor Collins, President Council night President Councilor Kelly, Councilor saying, President, President Morrell, President.

2
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:40,520
[SPEAKER_06]: motions, orders and resolutions to two dash three zero zero offered by counselor night.

3
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:53,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it so resolved that the city solicitor provide the Medford City Council with a draft ordinance require a monthly presentation by finance, the finance director to review the warrant articles and projected versus forecasted revenues tonight.

4
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:54,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam President, thank you very much.

5
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:59,236
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a resolution that had been passed by this previous councils on multiple occasions, this information.

6
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,893
[SPEAKER_14]: has been very difficult to get and has not been coming forth with.

7
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:17,819
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that at this point in time, it would make sense that we move forward and codify this request so that it would be part of our local law and therefore a requirement that we be provided with this information so that we can properly prepare for the financial responsibilities that we have as council.

8
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Any discussion?

10
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

11
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,682
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

12
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

13
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President bears.

14
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:34,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

15
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:36,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

16
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:36,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

17
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:36,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

18
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:36,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

19
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:36,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

20
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:37,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

21
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:37,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

22
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:38,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

23
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:38,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

24
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:38,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

25
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:05,346
[SPEAKER_06]: permit parking restrictions while conducting official post office business.

26
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

27
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam President, thank you very much.

28
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:12,893
[SPEAKER_14]: At the risk of being told I'm not in any position to discuss this matter, I'd like to bring it forward anyway.

29
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:21,682
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been brought to my attention that Park Medfit has been ticketing the letter carriers in our community.

30
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:41,169
[SPEAKER_14]: So the individuals that deliver us medications, bills, mail documents and the like, employees of the United States government, not the state government, not the local government, who are exercising their duties for the post office, not being held harmless in the execution of those duties, Madam President.

31
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:48,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Past practice has always been that our letter carriers would be held harmless when they were using their personal vehicles to conduct post office business.

32
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:53,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And this policy has apparently changed with the implementation of the in-house parking program.

33
00:02:53,817 --> 00:03:14,567
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd ask that the traffic commission take up the issue and create a letter carriers pass so that our letter carriers that are using their personal vehicles for post office business can park on city streets to deliver the mail and medication and the other materials that they so deliver to the residents of the community free of interference from parking.

34
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

35
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.

36
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I support this measure wholeheartedly.

37
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:44,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to propose a B paper just to request that the administration report to us on what communications methods they used to reach out to residents regarding the new parking program and whether or not they plan to include any information about this program in mailings to city residents or property owners.

38
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:53,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,348
[SPEAKER_12]: If constantly wouldn't wouldn't mind amending this so if we can provision it if the visiting nurses.

40
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,990
[SPEAKER_12]: that come to many people's homes also.

41
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:15,034
[SPEAKER_12]: That's another common call I get is, you know, the nurse comes to visit my mother or comes in to do treatments, and they don't have anywhere to park it, and they get tickets on the street.

42
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:22,535
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we could maybe look at something for medical personnel who host visits, it would be appreciated.

43
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to speak on the parking passes?

44
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:32,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

45
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion from the council?

46
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

47
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:46,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Parking there is horrendous.

48
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:54,149
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've, I've been to the mayor's office downstairs and I requested parking permits on that street and it's gone without any notice.

49
00:04:55,532 --> 00:05:01,875
[SPEAKER_13]: When I went to other streets within Medfed, I see parking places all over the place up in East Med, was it North Medfed, West Medfed?

50
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:09,679
[SPEAKER_13]: They have parking permit, but on that particular street, on 22 Bradley Road, on Bradley Road, we cannot have parking for residents on that street.

51
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,722
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not enough spaces.

52
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:19,785
[SPEAKER_13]: And what happens is everybody, I've lived there for 22 years, so I know what goes on.

53
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:22,346
[SPEAKER_13]: People come in from out of town,

54
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:28,579
[SPEAKER_13]: People that work into the center of the town, and I understand they pay taxes but I inadvertently pay taxes to rent.

55
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,419
[SPEAKER_13]: You're allowed to park during the day.

56
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,821
[SPEAKER_13]: They come from writing, they work all over Medford Square, they're allowed to park all day during that.

57
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I am like a hostage to my apartment.

58
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the traffic commission petition for turning streets and department parking.

59
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:55,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you, have you worked with the traffic commission to the mayor give any indication you should give me any indications because I've got numerous tickets there, and now they take it on a Saturday.

60
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:59,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I come up one Saturday and I had a parking ticket, and I was like appalled.

61
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:04,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I paid the ticket because I didn't want to deal with the parking office up on Main Street.

62
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

63
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:07,024
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was horrible.

64
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:09,845
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I want to say, because I have to get it off my chest.

65
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:14,247
[SPEAKER_13]: The year of 2010 was the worst winter in this city.

66
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:21,050
[SPEAKER_13]: And I remember distinctly because I got out of graduate school and I was working and I couldn't get a job because of the economy.

67
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:30,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And every week I was getting parking tickets and they were putting parking meters on the street and giving out parking tickets to the residents.

68
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:33,796
[SPEAKER_13]: During one of the worst blizzards

69
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's unconscionable.

70
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

71
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:51,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those decisions predate this most of us on the council I could, I know I have your email I can reach out to the mayor it is petitioning to turn the street department parking goes to the traffic commission.

72
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can, I can follow up on that make sure you're the right person.

73
00:06:56,102 --> 00:07:01,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, well no it's kind of a new situation now because of what we're here for but I believe we have to wait until the end.

74
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:03,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

75
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can follow up with you by email.

76
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:05,630
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be true.

77
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we'll see what happens now because I'm going to be forced to move.

78
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:08,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

79
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:10,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

80
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:11,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

81
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:12,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

82
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:13,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Just name and address for the record.

83
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:14,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my name is Donia Goss.

84
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 26 Bradley Road.

85
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a disabled placard.

86
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:23,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, whenever the Chevalier Theater has a show,

87
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:27,058
[SPEAKER_04]: to having a show Friday night, Joan Jett.

88
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:28,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Great theater.

89
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:35,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever there's a show, you cannot find a parking space within a quarter of a mile.

90
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:38,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And our building has 30 units.

91
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:45,471
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's maybe five or six spaces on the street, because there's no parking lot.

92
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:58,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very, for me, sometimes I go grocery shopping, I come home, I go around and around and around, I can't find a place to park, and then I have to carry all, parking is unbearable.

93
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:00,078
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

94
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:00,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

95
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, if I can.

96
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:02,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

97
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

98
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick question.

99
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, did you say you were handicapped?

100
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:10,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you?

101
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:10,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

102
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:11,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a placard?

103
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:12,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

104
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:15,508
[SPEAKER_07]: And did they put a handicapped spot on that street for you?

105
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:20,570
[SPEAKER_04]: There is one handicapped spot in front of the senior citizen building, right?

106
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,172
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are other senior citizens that are handicapped in that building.

107
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:30,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Occasionally I will park there but sometimes I don't find a space there.

108
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope we get to find a resolution for what

109
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:47,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Our neighbors are going through on Bradley Road, but this is something that as we move forward, I think it's something that we should talk with the traffic commission, maybe hold a meeting with the residents of Bradley Road, because this is something that's been going on for years and no one has listened.

110
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,033
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just not enough physical spaces.

111
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:54,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe there's other solutions that we could talk to the traffic commission when the time comes.

112
00:08:54,857 --> 00:09:02,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's hope we can find the resolution for the biggest issue and then revert back and circle back to the traffic commission, because that's important.

113
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:03,405
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

114
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:04,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

115
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:07,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

116
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:08,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else would like to speak?

117
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:22,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councillor Knight, as amended by Councillor Carviello, seconded by Vice President Behrs, and there's also the B paper from Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

118
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:24,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take the B paper first.

119
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:31,955
[SPEAKER_06]: The B paper is to get an update from the administration on the communication methods used to reach out to residents regarding parking.

120
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:38,005
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, and whether or not they send any communications through mail.

148
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:07,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam President, yes, as the resolution reads, the traffic commission I directed signage to one ramp said to keep this road that has displaced vehicles.

149
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:12,930
[SPEAKER_14]: These roads, but measure blitz victory park, the backside of victory park, and there's access to walking trails back there.

150
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,552
[SPEAKER_14]: But what's happening is the street is very narrow street.

151
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:20,996
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting overrun by vehicles, residents in the street can't back out of the driveways, can't find parking in the front rows.

152
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,839
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's creating a situation where the

153
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:31,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Signage that the traffic commission put up has really displaced a number of vehicles to another neighborhood.

154
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,461
[SPEAKER_14]: It's now feeling a negative impact.

155
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:52,327
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the interest of parity, the traffic commission will take simple steps to treat this neighborhood as they treat others and ensure that the signage is erected so that neighbors don't have to go through the weekends of recreational events going on in the community, very similar to what's going on now.

156
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:52,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

157
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:54,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilman.

158
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,351
[SPEAKER_07]: for expressing those concerns.

159
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I echo all of them.

160
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:10,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that as we as we hear so often, even this evening, that a lot of the issues we're having with parking has nothing to do with method residents.

161
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:19,315
[SPEAKER_07]: It has people that come outside of method that want to use our recreational spaces or our restaurants or our theaters and, um,

162
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:24,198
[SPEAKER_07]: and it really displaces the quality of life of our residents.

163
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:39,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can, like Councilor Knight said, you know, in the case that we've had in other locations and it's worked, I think we need to follow up on this stretch of road as well.

164
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,951
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Madam President.

165
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:59,513
[SPEAKER_06]: on the motion of counselors second by vice president bears.

166
00:12:59,613 --> 00:12:59,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

167
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Carribelle.

168
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:01,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

169
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:02,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

170
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:03,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

171
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:04,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor night.

172
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:04,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

173
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:05,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpa.

174
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

175
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:07,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Singh.

176
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:07,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

177
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:09,698
[SPEAKER_08]: President Morrell.

178
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:10,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

179
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,309
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-303 offered by Councillor Carviello.

180
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:24,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It is resolved that the administration report back to the council with the status of the veteran's office and how the veterans of Medford will be receiving services going forward.

181
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:25,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Carviello.

182
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:26,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

183
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:28,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We did receive an email.

184
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:01,992
you know.

185
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:19,052
[SPEAKER_12]: we're interviewing anybody, and that office needs to be staffed immediately, and not by telephone.

186
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:24,215
[SPEAKER_12]: One life is too many lives, I have to say, for veterans that commit suicide on a daily basis.

187
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:33,521
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Madam President, I would hope that the mayor would come back with us within the next week or two, saying that they're interviewing candidates for this job.

188
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:35,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

189
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:36,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

190
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:39,085
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just want to read the last part,

191
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,131
[SPEAKER_06]: the update from the Chief of Staff, just to read out the contact information so people have it.

192
00:14:44,191 --> 00:15:02,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So currently, if any veteran needs support, they can call the Medford Department of Veteran Services at 781-393-2505, or email seniorclerkdarlingwhite at dwhite at medford-ma.gov, or Wilmington's Veterans Department at 97694-2040, or email Mr. Lewis Maglia directly at lcimaglia,

193
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,384
[SPEAKER_06]: at WilmingtonMA.gov.

194
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:13,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the current information.

195
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:16,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that's also updated all over the website as well.

196
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

197
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,916
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could just get a copy of the contract between the town of Wilmington and the city of Memphis for these services from the administration.

198
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:25,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

199
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:27,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want that as a just amendment?

200
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:28,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

201
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:32,643
[SPEAKER_06]: For the discussion.

202
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are the motion.

203
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:45,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Second by second.

204
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:46,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President bears.

205

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

206
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:46,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

207
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:46,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

208
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:46,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

209
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:47,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

210
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:12,606
[SPEAKER_08]: President Morrell.

211
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:13,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

212
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:13,529
[SPEAKER_06]: 7-4-0-0.

213
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:13,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Negative.

214
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:14,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

215
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:43,640
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-304, be it resolved that the Metro City Council requests an update from the city administration on the solid waste task force, including the scope and goals of the task force, opportunities for short and long-term waste reduction, inefficacy evaluation of our current recycling services, opportunities to further reduce waste and more efficiently recycle in our next waste management contract, and how our city's progress towards a zero waste future can be publicly tracked and made available to the public.

216
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:52,277
[SPEAKER_06]: be it for the resolve of the administration, provide an update on what, if any regulations and requirements currently governs private waste and recycling collars operating in Medford.

217
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:53,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

218
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Morrell.

219
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Resolution speaks for itself.

220
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:06,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we're coming up on, you know, we're a bit more than a year out from when our city's waste management contracts will be up.

221
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:13,423
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's, you know, about time that we start, you know, making sure that the administration is looking at how things are going with our

222
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:23,733
[SPEAKER_15]: current contractor with an eye towards how we can improve our overall waste reduction and efficacy of recycling in the next one.

223
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:28,615
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't necessarily mean a new contractor, but I think it's a good time to start re-evaluating.

224
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:41,039
[SPEAKER_15]: We're always overdue for evaluating how we can be further accelerating towards a zero waste future, evaluating how good we are at recycling all the things that we think that we're recycling.

225
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:41,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to make sure that that

226
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:57,275
[SPEAKER_15]: also takes into account any private waste haulers that are operating on properties in Medford to ensure that across the board, we're doing what we can to dispose of waste, recycle as efficiently as we can in line with our climate and pollution goals.

227
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

228
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Behrs.

229
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

230
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Collins for putting this on the agenda.

231
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:10,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is really an essential effort considering when this contract goes up.

232
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,612
[SPEAKER_00]: the new contract will be pricier than the current contract.

233
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:18,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I think we've seen, there's a lot of increases in the cost of waste removal and waste management.

234
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:31,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we last signed the contract on this, one of the ways that we can mitigate the impact of the growing cost of waste removal, crowding out other essential priorities in the city budget, is to reduce the amount of overall waste that we are producing as a city.

235
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:35,246
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a great resolution and I second it and will support it.

236
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:48,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to thank Councillor Collins for introducing such a thoughtful resolution.

237
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:58,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Measures like this represent the action that we can take at the local level to address the growing climate catastrophe that we're facing.

238
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:07,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that many feel a sense of dread and hopelessness, but I think Councillor Collins shows us today that we can be hopeful, but we just have to act.

239
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:21,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And resolutions like this show that our city is acting, and that our city council in particular is trying to get the answers that we need to create the policies that we need to address climate emergency.

240
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:42,196
[SPEAKER_11]: At the, at the local level, both overall and at the local level, reducing waste is one of the key, one of the key ways that we can that we can pursue one of the key paths we can pursue towards meeting, you know, meeting a better future that's more sustainable.

241
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:42,797
[SPEAKER_11]: And so,

242
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:47,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I am I full wholeheartedly support this resolution.

243
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:55,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think I would like our city to do in the city administration to do more research into what else we can.

244
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,377
[SPEAKER_11]: What what other measures we can take towards the zero waste goal.

245
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know,

246
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:20,954
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of cities that are innovating right now, they've developed textile recycling programs, they've done on different programs with technical, technical parts, and I would like to see our city explore those options and also to make what options do exist more accessible to all Medfordians.

247
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:24,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

248
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:32,910
[SPEAKER_06]: spent a lot of time in this area and it's been my day job, so I really thank you for bringing this forward.

249
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:39,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of, if not most of the callers contracted these days do have the ability to provide data.

250
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:41,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is a really important resolution.

251
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:44,596
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that we should be looking for in the city because when we know better, we can do better.

252
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So I also really appreciate you bringing this forward.

253
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:52,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion, Councilor Collins, second by Vice President Behrs.

[SPEAKER_05]: There's many of us here from 26 Bradley.

292
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:43,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're aware of kind of what's been going on.

293
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:46,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know last week I did speak with you to via Zoom.

294
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're hoping to work more closely with you.

295
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:57,012
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been given another 30 day extension, I guess, with our kind of eviction, if you will.

296
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not enough time.

297
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:04,617
[SPEAKER_05]: There's families in the building with children in the Medford school system.

298
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:09,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's sickening to be quite honest with you.

299
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:14,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just hope to work with you more closely and keep coming to these meetings.

300
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:16,537
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, meet the mayor next Thursday.

301
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:25,022
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that she starts her kind of open house, if you will, again, and just stay together as we get through this process.

302
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:29,905
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's very upsetting that this kind of could happen in Bedford to anyone.

303
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:33,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anyone else wants to.

304
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:41,786
[SPEAKER_06]: do have an update from our planning department is all I can read, but I want to make sure everyone gets a chance to speak.

305
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:44,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President, council members.

306
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:46,449
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Sean Temple.

307
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:55,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 26 Bradley Road, and I may be the senior member of the residents there.

308
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:58,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been there maybe 25 years.

309
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:06,298
[SPEAKER_09]: We just received a notice, a certified letter on Friday stating that we have to vacate.

310
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,581
[SPEAKER_09]: the premises.

311
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:12,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been there 25 years and nothing like this.

312
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:33,459
[SPEAKER_09]: The Donados owned the building at one time and then it was sold to another management company, Sinead, and then in turn sold it to another management company who is now, I guess, I know, you know, residency is a high commodity these days.

313
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:41,480
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we have a lot of senior people here who live in the building as well as myself.

314
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:50,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I just feel, you know, just being kind of railroaded out of the building, you know, without any cause.

315
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:55,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they don't really notify us about anything since I took over the building.

316
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:59,824
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it doesn't seem right.

317
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:01,745
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and whatever.

318
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:30,660
[SPEAKER_09]: what I've found out so far is that they've only given us like 30 days and I think it's supposed to give us more time, you know, and I'm not even sure, you know, I'm not exactly sure how much time that is, but I mean, you know, it just doesn't seem practical, you know, and we're here today just to try to state our case about what's going on over there, you know, so that's what we're doing here.

319
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your time.

320
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:40,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Susan Bradley wrote.

321
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is there anything that you guys can do?

322
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:45,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we wasting our time?

323
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:51,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Not not being sarcastic or anything, but is there anything that can be done legally?

324
00:25:51,223 --> 00:25:54,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you guys just listening?

325
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:58,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there something you can do with this company or to?

326
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Councilor Morocco has a better

327
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:10,094
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I've been told, I spoke to a couple of people that, from what I understand, they've given another 30 days.

328
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:11,655
[SPEAKER_12]: So B1 has 60 days.

329
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:19,616
[SPEAKER_12]: They are going to honor the leases that people have also until they expire also.

330
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:27,758
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know there's some people in there with vouchers that they're in a little bit of a tough spot because if they get evicted, it can affect their voucher.

331
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:28,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

332
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,219
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the weird part.

333
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:34,084
[SPEAKER_01]: apartments up to like two or three weeks ago.

334
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:35,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't make sense.

335
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,486
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I'm going to find something.

336
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:45,367
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a lot of people that live there, it's really... And as a city employee, it's really upsetting.

337
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:54,410
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous to let a company come in and upset people's lives, especially after what's been going on the last two years.

338
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,651
[SPEAKER_12]: You would think that people would have more compassion, but I guess this is a...

339
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:17,125
[SPEAKER_19]: I know some of you may have received some information from the city or some avenues, maybe for some funding or some help.

340
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:37,043
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm not worried about that.

341
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:38,863
[SPEAKER_19]: She'll be out of it.

342
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:43,045
[SPEAKER_19]: She does not want you guys to believe it.

343
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:51,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you see her on here?

344
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

345
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:59,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, and so sorry about this microphone buzzing.

346
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:00,813
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not sure why that's happening.

347
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:18,674
[SPEAKER_18]: To the question of, you know, can we do anything, and I'm really grateful to everybody who's been in contact with the city council and other city officials about this, and we're really glad not to know about it, but glad to be kept updated about what's going on.

348
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:25,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, you know, I don't want to speak for my colleagues, but I think we all empathize with you and we all accept that this is happening.

349
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:34,882
[SPEAKER_18]: But to the question of what can we do about it, I think, speaking only for myself, you know, taking care not to speak for anybody else, we want to make sure that you're advocating to the people who have the power to help

350
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:36,405
[SPEAKER_18]: you in this position.

351
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:45,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, we need to make sure that you're advocating to the right people.

352
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:58,276
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to make sure that you're talking to the people who have the power to either alleviate the expense and the inconvenience and the stress and the work and the anxiety of finding new housing.

353
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:16,233
[SPEAKER_19]: When I talk, no, it's everybody's.

354
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:22,156
Yeah.

355
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:24,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion for a five-minute recess.

356
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:25,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion approved.

357
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:27,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Questions and comments?

358
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:29,219
[SPEAKER_19]: Any results that you'd like to propose?

359
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:30,520
Subject to approval?

360
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:33,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

361
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:40,705
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

362
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, if it's my turn.

363
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Recess has ended, the meeting is back to order.

364
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:16,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to go back to Councilor Collins.

365
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:20,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you were in the middle and then we have Vice Mayor Behrs and then we'll come back to the residents.

366
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:23,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you want to do.

367
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:25,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

368
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:27,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Marillyn.

369
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you to our AV wizard back there.

370
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:40,119
[SPEAKER_15]: What I was saying is that, you know, we appreciate the tenants keeping us informed of your situation and, you know, speaking only for myself and probably for

371
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:43,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Many other, if not all of my colleagues, we stand in solidarity with you.

372
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:46,993
[SPEAKER_15]: We're sorry for what you're going through.

373
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:54,539
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that we need to make sure that you're advocating to the right people, the people with the power to adjust your situation.

374
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:02,987
[SPEAKER_15]: As it's been stated, since this is proceeding legally, there's nothing that we can do in these chambers

375
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:11,124
[SPEAKER_15]: know, to wave a magic wand and give you what you deserve, you know, what you need, what you're asking for.

376
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:19,645
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that, you know, I'm certainly speaking for myself, I want to be in contact with, you know, this tenant group to make sure that you're connected with the right people.

377
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:25,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I know they've already received some very helpful, you know, what I seem to be like helpful pertinent information from our Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability.

378
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:50,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that to the extent that's helpful, you can remain in contact with our housing staff, other resources around the city, you know, and I hope that, you know, on an individual counselor basis, we can stay in contact to make sure that you're accessing the resources that are available to see what can happen here, you know, to appeal to perhaps this property owners that are angels.

379
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

380
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

381
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Behrs.

382
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:55,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

383
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,881
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think you're all experiencing very directly the housing crisis that we're in in this area.

384
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:08,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we as a council have talked a lot about is housing stability and what city resources we can provide.

385
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:11,964
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think Councilor Collins was very direct.

386
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:14,405
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are constrained by state law.

387
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,486
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go in and say you can't do this.

388
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:18,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not within the power of the city of Medford to do that.

389
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:23,888
[SPEAKER_00]: What is within our power is to do what Councilor Collins said and what I think if

390
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:27,354
[SPEAKER_00]: President Morrell may read the update if it hasn't gone to all of you.

391
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,128
[SPEAKER_00]: provide as many resources and as much information as possible.

392
00:32:32,188 --> 00:32:36,729
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have access to pro bono legal aid for housing situations for residents of the city.

393
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,829
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program that helps people move within the city with financial support.

394
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,770
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be direct, there's a lot of state laws that need to change around this.

395
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:54,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've been advocating, at least I've been advocating for some of those changes at this point, even if they were to go through, it's not gonna stop the situation.

396
00:32:54,532 --> 00:32:57,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry for that, but they do need to change.

397
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:13,957
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece of this is I think fully, if you are able and if it, with the advice of legal counsel, I'm not a lawyer and I'm not certainly not your lawyer, but if you're able to get that legal advice, you do have a significant number of protections on the table here.

398
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:17,898
[SPEAKER_00]: They've provided a notice to quit that's now gonna be active after 60 days.

399
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:20,799
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the initiation of a process.

400
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:22,239
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the end of a process.

401
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,560
[SPEAKER_00]: That process would then,

402
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,825
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially begin an eviction proceeding, which would then take you before a judge, that can last months.

403
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:36,592
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not end the way that you want it to, but it may give you enough time to find something in this market.

404
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:39,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest that.

405
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:47,371
[SPEAKER_00]: or with the advice of council, if it's possible for you, if it's not going to impact you negatively in some other way, just fully see out your legal rights.

406
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:49,611
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may extend the process with enough time.

407
00:33:50,112 --> 00:34:04,877
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we as a city also need to take, you know, going forward, this is an example of why we need more resources for housing stability, more than just a couple people, more than just a couple affordable units, because it takes months and months and months.

408
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:09,723
[SPEAKER_00]: to find housing in this market and with the very limited supply of housing.

409
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:14,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So I again I'm also very sorry that this is happening.

410
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:18,720
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, big corporate change has just suddenly uprooted your lives.

411
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:31,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish that we had more power to help, but certainly we can advocate, continue to reach out to this person, ask them to be compassionate, as Councilor Caravaglio said, ask them to extend the time period.

412
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:44,700
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they won't do anything more there, I certainly would suggest that you avail yourselves of all of the options that come before you in the legal process to extend this and give yourself as much time as you can to find

413
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:46,112
[SPEAKER_00]: new housing.

414
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Barris.

415
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:54,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And then actually, if I could just read the update from Planning, Development, and Sustainability, that might just be helpful to any questions that come up.

416
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:56,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, everyone is still welcome to speak.

417
00:34:57,256 --> 00:35:01,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is from Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

418
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:05,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of this is coming verbatim from the person who purchased the property.

419
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,820
[SPEAKER_06]: So if this is incorrect, I apologize.

420
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,481
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just the story that they are getting.

421
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a 34-unit building.

422
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:19,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So the director of planning development sustainability and the housing planner spoke with the owner and some of his representatives this past Friday.

423
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:26,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a 34 unit building and the owner let them know that 18 units for tenants at will, 14 have leases until the fall.

424
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:36,219
[SPEAKER_06]: The new owner purchased the building one year ago in March 2021, and he said that all units that are tenants at will were in that status when he purchased the building.

425
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's clear that his plan is to renovate kitchens, bathrooms, and redo floors, and that the tenants must vacate the apartments for this to occur as they are one-bathroom units.

426
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:46,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It was clear that rent would go up after the renovations.

427
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:52,676
[SPEAKER_06]: He agreed to extend the notice for the tenants at will an additional 30 days for those who needed an extension.

428
00:35:53,217 --> 00:36:02,507
[SPEAKER_06]: His representative, Jay Walsh, contacted the department on Friday night to let them know that everyone who had received a notice to quit had been notified that they could have an additional 30 days.

429
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:11,728
[SPEAKER_06]: The director with the city requested that the owner give the tenants with leases as much notice as possible as it's necessary to look for now.

430
00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:18,430
[SPEAKER_06]: New rental units in September, given this market, look sorry, look now for rental units in September, given the market.

431
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:26,042
[SPEAKER_06]: The owner indicated that he understood and would take into advisement and give more notice that he had been planning.

432
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:33,789
[SPEAKER_06]: The city director requested that he give the tenants the opportunity to stay in the building, potentially by giving them the option to return to the renovated apartment.

433
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:46,680
[SPEAKER_06]: This seems to be a new idea to him, but he seemed to think it was very reasonable and suggested that once some apartments were renovated, those with longer leases could be offered the option to lease one of the renovated apartments rather than being required to move out.

434
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:51,862
[SPEAKER_06]: we emphasize, the city emphasized that we very much would like to retain Medford residents in Medford.

435
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:53,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will make sure you guys get this.

436
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,064
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just like two more paragraphs.

437
00:36:56,045 --> 00:37:13,277
[SPEAKER_06]: The city also presented him with information from the Medford Housing Authority on their opportunity for landlords to receive $1,000 for leasing a unit to a section eight voucher holder that hadn't previously leased to someone with section eight and let them know that the maximum section eight rents are what the maximum section eight rents are in Medford.

438
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:18,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the city director's hope that he would consider Section 8 voucher holders for the renovated units.

439
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:26,222
[SPEAKER_06]: The current Section 8 tenants are through the Arlington Housing Authority, and the landlord has been in touch with them to verify that everything that they did was legal.

440
00:37:26,982 --> 00:37:33,507
[SPEAKER_06]: The city director did not ask him about current or future rent rates, as they were focused on keeping Medford residents housed at this time.

441
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:41,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just went out to note that they did flyer every door in the building with the flyers with regard to ABCD and the move in, move out program.

442
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:46,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if anyone didn't get that information, we can make sure that that gets to you.

443
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:56,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so any further questions we can relate to them and as fellow council just said, we, as a, we, as a body don't have any statutory power, but we can absolutely advocate.

444
00:37:56,222 --> 00:37:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: We can reach out to, you know, the city departments.

445
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:03,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I put in a call to Senator Jalen to see if there's anything that, you know, we may not be thinking of that can be done.

446
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:07,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think even though we don't have direct power in this situation,

447
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:10,848
[SPEAKER_06]: As fellow counselors said, you know, my heart breaks for you guys.

448
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,208
[SPEAKER_06]: This is obviously also this is the tip of the iceberg, right?

449
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:25,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this is stuff that we've been trying to stave off for the past two years and the housing market being what it is, we're unfortunately going to keep, you know, this is going to keep happening to our residents and it's not right.

450
00:38:26,462 --> 00:38:28,223
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll do what we can to stop it.

451
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:30,404
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, we don't have a lot of power in this situation.

452
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:32,706
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you for bearing with me.

453
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:35,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Please just name and address.

454
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:38,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we know the address, but name and address for the record, please.

455
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,585
[SPEAKER_10]: many people here today.

456
00:38:44,165 --> 00:38:47,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And ultimately, everyone kind of said what we're all thinking, right?

457
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:51,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we all wish that there could be a better resolution, we wish that someone would step in and help us.

458
00:38:52,469 --> 00:39:06,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I think at the end of the day, the biggest issue that we have is that these companies are not going anywhere, they're going to buy more buildings in this town, they're going to buy more units, they're going to kick more people out and leave them without an option.

459
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:07,777
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're going to do it in a way that

460
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:20,060
[SPEAKER_10]: is unethical, is immoral, and I just don't think that this is a direction that the town of Medford, the city of Medford should want to trend in because, listen, I've lived here since 2015.

461
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't always live in this building, but I've lived in Medford because I love living in Medford.

462
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:28,322
[SPEAKER_10]: As of May 1st, I'm living in Brighton, Massachusetts.

463
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:34,263
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to, but luckily I found a place because I didn't know my options, right?

464
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:36,444
[SPEAKER_10]: And ultimately, you know, I'm lucky.

465
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:39,225
[SPEAKER_10]: other people in our building are not going to be as lucky.

466
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:42,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are citizens of our town.

467
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:45,646
[SPEAKER_10]: These are residents of our town that love being here.

468
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:46,666
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to be here.

469
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:55,128
[SPEAKER_10]: And for someone who has never been in the building to take that away from them and not give them a real option, it's just morally bankrupt.

470
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:55,968
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wrong.

471
00:39:56,488 --> 00:40:00,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand that there's limited power here for all of us, right?

472
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:02,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Us as residents, you guys as

473
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:11,032
[SPEAKER_10]: as president, as, as, as counselors, we understand that, but, you know, we're an example of what's going to happen to more and more buildings in this town.

474
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:11,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

475
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and ultimately you don't want that.

476
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:18,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel I wouldn't want that because I love Medford for everything Medford has.

477
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:23,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And if Medford ceases to be Medford, why are we going to be here and why are we going to spend money here?

478
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:24,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are we gonna spend time here?

479
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:29,736
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to make it known that this company, there's a lot like them, right.

480
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:30,856
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're not going anywhere.

481
00:40:31,116 --> 00:40:33,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think that there needs to be more sort of

482
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:37,880
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it's a free market, but what are they doing for the people who live here?

483
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And how is it trending?

484
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Because at the end of the day, kicking us all out, putting a fake marble kitchen in and charging double the price, who are you bringing in really?

485
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:51,368
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to bring in people that don't care about this town and don't want to be here and don't want to settle down.

486
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,590
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's all I got to say about it.

487
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for giving me the time.

488
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm not good at this kind of, everyone's in a suit.

489
00:40:58,513 --> 00:40:59,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel really uncomfortable.

490
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:00,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sorry.

491
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:01,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

492
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:05,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anyone else like to speak?

493
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:09,037
[SPEAKER_06]: See if there's anyone on Zoom.

494
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion from the council?

495
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:32,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I will make sure, is there, I'm trying to think as far as if just to get, I'll work with the Planning Development and Sustainability Office just to make sure the contents of that email that I just read out gets to you all.

496
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:43,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I'll work with the director of the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability to make sure the contents of the email that I just read gets to everyone.

497
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:51,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've probably been given that information in a few different forms, but I'll make sure it's packaged and it gets to everyone.

498
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:58,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand, I know, I apologize.

499
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:01,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

500
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:05,183
[SPEAKER_16]: If you do want to come up to the microphone.

501
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:29,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this whole process here is a little bit mute, mute, you mean it's, we have no rights, because these corporations come in, and they just take over and they in this has been going on.

502
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:44,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been in the Boston area, 40 years and as councilmen as statesmen, the people, you're supposed to know what's saying that you're not, but people should represent the people and they're not representing the people they're representing the corporations who's got the deep pockets, who can do whatever they want.

503
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,120
[SPEAKER_13]: And it isn't right.

504
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not mad at you.

505
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:50,462
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is the wrong forum.

506
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:51,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

507
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,223
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think, yeah, exactly as the inappropriate for you're in the wrong.

508
00:42:54,263 --> 00:42:54,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with you.

509
00:42:54,964 --> 00:42:55,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with you.

510
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:57,505
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm coming to that conclusion.

511
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:03,047
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, what is the next phone, we take it, we have to take it to the next state level.

512
00:43:03,107 --> 00:43:03,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that where it goes?

513
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,808
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, but at that point, it'll be new.

514
00:43:05,988 --> 00:43:07,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it'll be I'll be gone by then because

515
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:11,205
[SPEAKER_14]: No one can throw you out of that apartment but a judge, right?

516
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:15,307
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like after 60 days, they're gonna lock the doors, take away the key and take all your stuff.

517
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:16,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they can't do that, right?

518
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,609
[SPEAKER_14]: It has to go through a process.

519
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:28,317
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanna let you know how traumatizing it was to get a message Monday afternoon at 1258 saying to me, you need to vacate the property and all your belongings in 30 days.

520
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:32,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I called the property management, they would not pick up the phone.

521
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:38,435
[SPEAKER_13]: I spoke with them, I said, you know, I have an ankle injury and I'm in physical therapy because I fell in the pool.

522
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:39,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And they still said, no, you have to go.

523
00:43:39,936 --> 00:43:43,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that everybody has a personal circumstance, there's 32 units in the building.

524
00:43:43,777 --> 00:43:46,639
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, ultimately, right, it's, you have to vacate, or what?

525
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:48,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're gonna take you to court, right?

526
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:51,040
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't wanna be, I don't want on my record to be evicted.

527
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't need that on my, I don't need that.

528
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:55,262
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a no fault eviction because it's not for non-payment of rent.

529
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:56,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

530
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:57,043
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

531
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,184
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not for non-payment of rent, it's not for, you know,

532
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:01,086
[SPEAKER_14]: selling drugs out of the apartment.

533
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:08,070
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no cause right it's it's a contract issue right it's a contract issue between the property owner and the tenants that are in the property.

534
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:08,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

535
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:19,418
[SPEAKER_14]: So, ultimately, the forum where it's going to be resolved would be in some type of mediation, whether in the court system, you know what I mean as this goes through the process but the notice to quit.

536
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:23,849
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like, listen, in 30 days, we're filing an application.

537
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:25,110
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really what it is, right?

538
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,611
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, they're giving you a 30 days notice to say they're going to take action.

539
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:34,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, through the discussions that have happened here at this body and through the administration, they've said, look, it's not going to be 30 days now.

540
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:36,095
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be 60 days.

541
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:36,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

542
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:37,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

543
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And if anybody is a tenant at Willow's leases up, we're not going to move on them.

544
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:41,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

545
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:42,898
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to wait 60 days.

546
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:43,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

547
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:44,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

548
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,281
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's going to initiate the process, but think,

549
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:50,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Between the, what was it?

550
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,246
[SPEAKER_14]: 18 units that have leases and 14 that don't?

551
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:54,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

552
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:54,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Or vice versa.

553
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:56,409
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

554
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 18 without leases.

555
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,055
[SPEAKER_14]: 18 with leases, right?

556
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,817
[SPEAKER_14]: All probably expiring at different times.

557
00:45:05,298 --> 00:45:06,659
[SPEAKER_14]: All the 60 day notice to stick with.

558
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,622
[SPEAKER_14]: By the time this building gets empty, how long, how much time is this going to pass?

559
00:45:10,348 --> 00:45:14,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, it's gonna be at least six months because I don't know my name.

560
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,071
[SPEAKER_13]: My neighbor my neighbor just signed a lease.

561
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:19,433
[SPEAKER_13]: She just moved in and she's the leases over in August.

562
00:45:19,813 --> 00:45:20,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I honestly don't know sir.

563
00:45:20,854 --> 00:45:21,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

564
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:25,517
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the manner in which they did this was inhumane.

565
00:45:26,237 --> 00:45:34,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and I mean I understand they have a right to buy a building I understand they have a right to do whatever they want with the property, but it's the manner in which they went about doing it to people.

566
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:37,025
[SPEAKER_13]: was totally wrong.

567
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:40,768
[SPEAKER_13]: And they wouldn't knew when they bought the building, how long those tenants were in that building.

568
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:49,173
[SPEAKER_13]: So they knew they should be dealing with this in an appropriate manner with people who have been residents there for a long time.

569
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:55,277
[SPEAKER_13]: People recognize business is business, but there's also a humanity part of this too, which is more, it's principle.

570
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:58,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, you're talking about public service.

571
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,640
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's the principle and I'm not mad at it.

572
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,062
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the principle matter of this and the manner in which they did it.

573
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:05,643
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm totally traumatized.

574
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:06,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

575
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, that's fair.

576
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:16,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's the answer that counselor and I just gave you, which is about the specific circumstance in the court of law and your legal rights.

577
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, then there's the other question that you're bringing up.

578
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:19,966
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been here for 40 years.

579
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:27,110
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you remember 30 years ago when it, you know, voters in Wellesley voted away, went control for people in Boston, you know,

580
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:30,945
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think owns the corporations that are buying up the apartment.

581
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:43,635
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it is, you know, we are extremely limited by state law, there's a couple things that we can try to do, we can try to provide more resources and notice about your legal rights, which is what we're able to do in this case, that's something we can do.

582
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:48,399
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm an advocate of asking the state to implement a lot of laws to kind of create

583
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,240
[SPEAKER_00]: create a better set of conditions for people.

584
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:56,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it needs to go to the state legislature, honestly, because, you know, if it's not me next, you next.

585
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,222
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if people don't speak up.

586
00:46:58,883 --> 00:46:59,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

587
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a, you know, there's a lot of groups.

588
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:03,664
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be like California, you won't be able to live here.

589
00:47:03,764 --> 00:47:16,109
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of groups and tenants, advocates and people who are saying, you know, begging the state government, you know, they'll do anything, you know, unanimously they'll pass a law that says, you know, we'll free up this zoning and you can build something bigger, but

590
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:30,350
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't attach to it just cause eviction or rent stabilization so you can have a 30% rent increase in a single year, or, you know, the tenant opportunity to purchase or all these other things that would give tenants more of a balance in this fight.

591
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's something that we can advocate for but

592
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:37,834
[SPEAKER_00]: we legally can't implement any of that unless the state lets us.

593
00:47:38,514 --> 00:47:48,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just saying, it's worth going to the next level and saying, this happened in your state rep district or your state Senate district, and we need you to take, we need you to do something.

594
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:55,937
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, yeah, I think you've made a very strong point about the conditions of who's making the law in Massachusetts.

595
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:59,417
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do appreciate your time and the resources.

596
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:03,018
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I mean, I did call some of the numbers and I feel as though that,

597
00:48:03,478 --> 00:48:06,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I called this number and then I could go to this person.

598
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:09,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, now we're gonna go to this person, then it's like this person.

599
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:13,089
[SPEAKER_13]: This is why I never became a public servant because I like to produce and I like results.

600
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hear you.

601
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,092
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like passing.

602
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:20,417
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not saying you are passing the buck, but people will take the pass the buck.

603
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:22,139
[SPEAKER_13]: And when is the buck stop.

604
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:37,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, you know, and I'm just saying, and I'm not saying you know maybe we can maybe we can maybe we can ask, I'm assigned to, I know they're thin but with this being such a dire situation having a assigned member for office.

605
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:49,239
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working directly with the families and the homeowners of Bradley will be an advocate even for the state because you know this is really this is this is getting out of control, but I think with this is such a dire situation I think that.

606
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:53,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the biggest things is having someone on the other line I think that's important.

607
00:48:54,002 --> 00:49:08,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the least we can do is recommend that, uh, Miss Hunts puts a identified representative from their office that's going to work directly with the people of Bradley Road because of because of this die situation.

608
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:09,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they'll block at that.

609
00:49:09,894 --> 00:49:12,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they'll they'll really work hard to do that.

610
00:49:12,936 --> 00:49:14,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that's very important.

611
00:49:14,857 --> 00:49:29,754
[SPEAKER_07]: That, you know, where we were handcuffed, at least you should have an avenue within our city hall that are going to at least point you in the right direction and make sure that someone's going to be on the other line because I can't, I can't even imagine what you're going through right now.

612
00:49:30,295 --> 00:49:32,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And the stress level, at least we can do is ask the city.

613
00:49:33,328 --> 00:49:44,342
[SPEAKER_07]: to take that stress level out, so they can help you move forward those chores so no thank you if I could recommend that that'd be something that no I appreciate that because you know I did make a call this week and the woman says where you can go live in a shelter.

614
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:46,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Well that's great.

615
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:47,786
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what they told me disgusting.

616
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:50,509
[SPEAKER_13]: My sister lives in a shelter and I used to go to that shelter.

617
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:59,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think if we can do that, because there are avenues and I know that it's easy for us to sit on this side.

618
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:05,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's easy because we have, you know, we have homes right now but the idea of what you're going through.

619
00:50:06,154 --> 00:50:15,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't, we can't say we understand because we don't, but we can also understand that if we can do this and we could follow from what I've, I've talked to a few different attorneys I can't.

620
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:17,805
[SPEAKER_07]: By law, I can't tell you I get it.

621
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:18,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

622
00:50:18,466 --> 00:50:21,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that like Councilmate says, this isn't an easy process.

623
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:36,058
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and you have to go to even as you as residents there if you take advantage of what we have in the city to finance legal representation that that building can stay the same for a long time.

624
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And you just what you're doing is banded together that's very important.

625
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:48,476
[SPEAKER_07]: have someone direct you from the city to the right avenues and make sure that someone's on the other line and follow through with the resources we can offer you.

626
00:50:48,937 --> 00:50:55,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that at least gives us some time to find out other ways that we can get to the state and have the state representatives

627
00:50:56,272 --> 00:51:06,337
[SPEAKER_07]: look at different options, whether it's finding ways to, uh, you know, work directly with housing within different state housing, um, processes or whatnot.

628
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:20,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's got to be something out there that, like you said, this is the worst case scenario, and I know what's happening today, and like Councilor Behr says, this is probably the beginning of something more drastic moving forward.

629
00:51:20,653 --> 00:51:25,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you look at the rents out there, the rents out there, and I've already saw four apartments and I just cried.

630
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:27,356
[SPEAKER_13]: I just cried.

631
00:51:27,396 --> 00:51:30,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just like, and what they're charging for $1,700.

632
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:40,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's pretty, I mean, you walk in these carpets are dirty, you go out, you know what I mean, two feet and you get a big plate of salt and use your shovels, you can shovel your own walk.

633
00:51:40,703 --> 00:51:43,924
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really what, you can live in this basement apartment, but we're not gonna clean it.

634
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:45,665
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can request it to be cleaned.

635
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:47,326
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, excuse me, it's not clean.

636
00:51:47,366 --> 00:51:48,907
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you're not gonna clean it after I move in.

637
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,992
[SPEAKER_13]: or before I move it after I said Alicia, I. So at the recommendation of Councilor- Yeah, I appreciate that.

638
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:56,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize that I'm so upset.

639
00:51:56,092 --> 00:51:57,433
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, you have every right to.

640
00:51:58,894 --> 00:51:59,854
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the reason why we're here.

641
00:51:59,894 --> 00:52:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: We wish we could do more, but we're here to listen and help in any way we can.

642
00:52:04,816 --> 00:52:05,576
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I appreciate that.

643
00:52:05,616 --> 00:52:13,279
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is little that we can do, and at least let you know that you have seven people that understand, excuse me,

644
00:52:14,903 --> 00:52:16,544
[SPEAKER_07]: can be there for you just to listen.

645
00:52:16,764 --> 00:52:18,205
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best we can do.

646
00:52:18,225 --> 00:52:18,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that can help.

647
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:21,207
[SPEAKER_07]: But listen, I wish I could do more.

648
00:52:21,227 --> 00:52:22,127
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been wonderful.

649
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:22,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

650
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,588
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate you taking the time.

651
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:24,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we could do more.

652
00:52:24,428 --> 00:52:26,410
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good that it's voiced here.

653
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it needs to be representative of the state.

654
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,073
[SPEAKER_13]: I've just seen so much.

655
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:34,194
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredible.

656
00:52:34,214 --> 00:52:36,115
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just incredible what happens.

657
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:44,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll call up the director to get you guys a dedicated contact person just to at least try to mitigate the call here, call there.

658
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:48,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I can be an advocate because it has to stop.

659
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,156
[SPEAKER_13]: It really has to stop somewhere.

660
00:52:50,436 --> 00:52:50,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

661
00:52:51,116 --> 00:52:53,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

662
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:53,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

663
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:54,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

664
00:53:16,304 --> 00:53:16,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

665
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:18,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

666
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:19,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

667
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:24,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I mean, the firm is doing the negative.

668
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:33,387
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes reverting to regular order of business reports of committees to 2-012 March 29 2022 subcommittee on ordinances and rules.

669
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:37,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, vice president Ferris, if you could provide us a brief overview of that meeting.

670
00:53:37,469 --> 00:53:38,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

671
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:43,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, last week we met again in subcommittee on rules and ordinances.

672
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:45,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think our third meeting

673
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:50,515
[SPEAKER_00]: At our March 9th meeting, we reported out a number of suggested changes.

674
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:56,019
[SPEAKER_00]: We reported out a number of additional suggested changes at our March 29th meeting.

675
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will be, I believe, included in packets this week, both a track change document and a clean document.

676
00:54:04,525 --> 00:54:20,936
[SPEAKER_00]: The other item we reported out was an item for further discussion, which was around our meetings, days, times, Tuesday to Wednesday, biweekly, a number of other matters that the subcommittee felt required the full discussion of the council and not a recommendation from just three councilors.

677
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:30,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be kind of the agenda is going over the suggested changes, as well as a discussion of the meeting times for the council.

678
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:34,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Harris.

679
00:54:34,629 --> 00:54:41,734
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve the committee records, seconded by Vice President Harris.

680
00:54:41,794 --> 00:54:42,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

681
00:54:44,636 --> 00:54:44,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:46,137
Yes.

683

Yes.

684
00:54:46,577 --> 00:54:46,757
Yes.

685
00:54:55,305 --> 00:54:57,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 74-0 negative, the motion passes.

686
00:54:57,946 --> 00:55:02,168
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-078, March 30th, 2022 can be the whole meeting report.

687
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,770
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a meeting on the proposed polystyrene ban.

688
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,332
[SPEAKER_06]: We reviewed the draft that was edited by KP Law.

689
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,653
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no debate over the minor edits that were made.
