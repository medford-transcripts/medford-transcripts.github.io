00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:54,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_08]: President Behrs, present.

00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:11,037
[SPEAKER_08]: 24475 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

9
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:22,926
[SPEAKER_08]: be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a question and answer session to discuss the definitions and terminology regarding the proposed Proposition 2.5 overrides and the proposed debt exclusion measure.

10
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,873
[SPEAKER_08]: To that resolution, the following amendments were added.

11
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:30,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli asked that the administration and Council on Aging do outreach to seniors about this meeting.

12
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:36,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan requested outreach to parents of school-aged children, not just teachers, and specifically requested outreach to the PTOs.

13
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:46,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Sang requested general outreach and specifically requested that the community liaisons translate into other languages the information that is on the city website about the overrides and the debt exclusion.

14
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:54,995
[SPEAKER_08]: To ensure that the council is able to answer questions in a timely manner and that decorum is maintained, the council president, myself, will be enforcing the following rules.

15
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:57,758
[SPEAKER_08]: One, members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.

16
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:04,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until all who seek to ask a question have had the chance to ask their first question.

17
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:11,069
[SPEAKER_08]: The president will verbally request that residents not ask duplicative or largely similar questions to questions that have already been answered.

18
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,982
[SPEAKER_08]: and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar question is asked.

19
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:18,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Each counselor will have up to two minutes to answer per question.

20
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:29,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The president will verbally request the counselors not answer if a duplicative or largely similar answer has been given by another counselor and may move to the next question if a duplicative or similar answer is given.

21
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:37,432
[SPEAKER_08]: After members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, the president will open the floor to either a second question or a short public comment by members of the public in attendance.

22
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And before we start, I just want to say

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,282
[SPEAKER_08]: that the council itself is in mourning today.

24
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:48,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Last night, we lost our city messenger, Larry Lepore, who has served us for many years.

25
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:56,167
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be having some condolence remarks made at our regular meeting that will begin after our committee of the whole meeting.

26
00:03:57,108 --> 00:04:06,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope that folks will stick around if you knew Larry or otherwise to say a kind word or story that you may have shared with him during his many years serving the city behind this rail.

27
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:11,419
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, I do want to invite our city assessor, Ted Costigan.

28
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:19,042
[SPEAKER_08]: The council had requested some answers and updates from him, and I know that he's here to share some information that his office has been working on.

29
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:22,484
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, I will go to our assessor, Ted Costigan.

30
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:27,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we go on, can I just address my original question?

31
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,186
[SPEAKER_03]: resolution?

32
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:29,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

33
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:30,588
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll go to Ted.

34
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:31,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Pete, there are questions.

35
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:42,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there were some questions about council rules, about limitations when it comes to meetings, minutes, and how long we could speak.

36
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:50,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there are follow-up questions, and if there's one question, I believe Councilor Villes explained the process that we're using.

37
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Council President, I think he wants to move this meeting along, but I just, there were some senior citizens that mentioned

38
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:06,093
[SPEAKER_03]: if there's some confusion, I hope we have a little leeway when it comes to maybe asking the same question twice because of maybe not understanding it.

39
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope we would do that.

40
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:17,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the other question that, uh, council bears did read this speak about is that, uh, we all asked for information to be sent out to the community.

41
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the mayor's response, I believe, um,

42
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:35,616
[SPEAKER_03]: The chief of staff did respond that legally the city couldn't inform or give an, I'll just read if I can just so people understand, cause it's a little confusing to people.

43
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:49,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Sending this information request, so it's, we sent this email to legal on today to guide us on what we can do, should avoid doing before we can assist given the OCPF guidelines.

44
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:58,148
[SPEAKER_03]: One specific question in mind is whether we can intentionally direct notification advertisement to subset of residents.

45
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:05,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So the following is up on my email below, per council, we can't send unsolicited information

46
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:11,404
[SPEAKER_03]: to all voters or a portion of voters of the city, whether by mail or by email.

47
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We got that, that response was today, correct, Council Beers?

48
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 10 a.m.

49
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:18,308
[SPEAKER_03]: today.

50
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:32,132
[SPEAKER_03]: If we knew that and we needed to change wording, I think sending out an all call that we were having a meeting that would, it's open to the public, that just read the resolution, I think that that wouldn't have been an issue.

51
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:34,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to share that with you.

52
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:34,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

53
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:37,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, and per council, you mean legal council?

54
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that I was on that email.

55
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:39,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you are.

56
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:40,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Was I on that?

57
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:40,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it was.

58
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:47,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Council, Adam, did you forward this to everybody?

59
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:47,588
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

60
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:49,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I did.

61
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:49,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

62
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I did forward that to everybody.

63
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was, I thought it went to everybody.

64
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it only went to the, to the three who had amendments.

65
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:56,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I did for that area.

66
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:57,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

67
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:57,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

68
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:58,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

69
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:59,373
[SPEAKER_08]: She means legal counsel, right?

70
00:06:59,574 --> 00:06:59,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

71
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:00,774
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

72
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:00,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

73
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:03,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want her to think about this council.

74
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

75
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:06,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

76
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:10,539
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, I'll go to our city assessor and let me know when you want me to put slides up.

77
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,001
[SPEAKER_08]: The new mics are coming on Thursday.

78
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:31,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane's going to come out.

79
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:31,987
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to fix it.

80
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear the chair moving.

81
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Shane.

82
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:07,192
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.

83
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:08,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

84
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:08,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Shane.

85
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:17,240
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty big guy, so sorry about that.

86
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but if we could go to the slides.

87
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:28,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Just out of a point of information, the Department of Revenue received our valuations for fiscal year 25.

88
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:31,289
[SPEAKER_02]: They approved it actually this morning.

89
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:37,613
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm able to share with you our evaluation changes for fiscal year 25.

90
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:43,177
[SPEAKER_02]: As a reminder to everyone, on a yearly basis, the Department of Revenue and the state mandates that

91
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:50,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We the assessing office update valuations to full and fair cash value again on that fiscal year basis.

92
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:55,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We share those valuations in January, but we worked really hard in the office this year to get them done.

93
00:08:55,813 --> 00:09:01,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And as of this morning they were approved so just sharing this information, because it will apply to the override.

94
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:03,822
[SPEAKER_02]: in those override options.

95
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:14,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So residential valuations went up approximately 4% this year and the commercial industrial personal property which is our commercial base went up about 3% in value this year.

96
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Our new growth which is when you think of like new single family homes

97
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:28,401
[SPEAKER_02]: new condo conversions, any exempt property that goes to taxable, that's a $2.5 million in new growth, which adds to our levy.

98
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:41,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just wanted to point out that, you know, absent any override vote, the average tax bill would go up approximately $175 on our median single family this year.

99
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,312
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of the effects of Prop 2.5.

100
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:58,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Next page, so we obviously have our override votes just as a reminder to people, questions, just as a note, question six, whether it passes or not will not have an effect on fiscal year 25 tax bills.

101
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:10,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because the debt service payment would have to be paid in fiscal year 25, which would not be possible given the time it takes to issue the debt and obviously the six month period before the first debt payment would be due.

102
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:19,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at questions seven and eight tonight which would have an effect were they to pass on the fiscal year 25 tax bills.

103
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:21,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And just next slide.

104
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:22,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to

105
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: four people to death, so I just took one example, which is our median single family tax bill.

106
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the numbers might be a little small, but again, the way we arrive at your tax bill is multiplying your valuation by the tax rate.

107
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:48,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, you know, our tax rate is in a lot of ways, determined by how much we can levy on taxpayers.

108
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So the levy the last year was about 139.9 million.

109
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:58,341
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Prop 2.5, which pushed up the levy by 3.5 million.

110
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:04,226
[SPEAKER_02]: The new growth, which is 2.5, which gives us our fiscal year 25 levy at $146 million.

111
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:11,472
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the amount of money that the city can collect in real estate, personal property taxation from its residents, taxpayers.

112
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:19,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Our estimated tax rate, given all this, and we do have a split rate between the commercial and the residential, we'll focus on the residential is $8.37.

113
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:27,116
[SPEAKER_02]: On the median single-family home, that would mean a tax bill of $6,519 for the year.

114
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:30,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's a year-on-year difference from last year of $195.

115
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:38,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the next two columns contemplate the passage of question seven and eight respectively.

116
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:44,768
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, the year-on-year differences, and then I'll just go move on to the last column.

117
00:11:45,249 --> 00:12:05,905
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were both passed, instead of a median single family home in Medford having $195 a year-on-year increase, the increase would be $529, giving us a net effect if both questions were passed of approximately $334 to the, again, median single family in Medford.

118
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:06,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a,

119
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:13,754
[SPEAKER_02]: run the calculations for the median condo, which would be a year-on-year change of $345, and the two families would be $873.

120
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:15,155
[SPEAKER_02]: That's again the median.

121
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:39,714
[SPEAKER_02]: What I will pledge to do, and I'm working with the mayor's communications office to get this done on our website, now that as of this morning I have the approval from the Department of Revenue, I will publish all our addresses and values of residential properties on our website.

122
00:12:40,715 --> 00:13:02,095
[SPEAKER_02]: with these contemplated tax rates which could change slightly and I'll get that in the next slide so that every resident in Medford that would like to can go on to our website as they can normally you could go right now and find your 24 value but in advance get their fiscal year 25 value and the contemplated tax bill that would be associated with that value.

123
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:04,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So just go real quick to the next slide.

124
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:12,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a caveat that we, those tax rates are dependent on councils tax rate hearing.

125
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:17,896
[SPEAKER_02]: They are dependent on the department of revenue, uh, approving our tax rate recap.

126
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a rounding issue that comes in because we split the rate.

127
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't go all the way past the levy.

128
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So occasionally the tax rate will be, you know, off by a penny that way.

129
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's to say, um,

130
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,044
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done with evaluation.

131
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:35,547
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be as transparent as possible as people are starting early voting on this issue.

132
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:37,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe this weekend.

133
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:48,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will commit this week to as long as the mayor's office communications team can help me do it, get all the values and the impact of these overrides on our website.

134
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions from the council?

135
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:59,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure, and just thanks, Ted, I wanna appreciate your hard work getting this done.

136
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:01,763
[SPEAKER_08]: In October, it usually gets done in January, so it's appreciated.

137
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:02,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarbelli.

138
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:16,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that the word transparent gets thrown around, Ted, and I hate for you to get dragged into this, but you weren't part of any financial task force for the override, correct?

139
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:16,794
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was not.

140
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:17,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

141
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, when communities put this into place,

142
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:38,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm told from different communities, different assessors, finance directors, that they usually line this up prior to any budget meetings, so we can help our most vulnerable people in our community understand what any impact it would make.

143
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:48,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So having this calculation that you're doing for us, and thank you so much for doing it, because I know there were so many questions with the calculations that have been public on the side that you had nothing to do with.

144
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it came out of a state website, but it didn't truly,

145
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,769
[SPEAKER_03]: calculate the newer assessment.

146
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's correct, right?

147
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, right.

148
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:13,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we look at this and now we're doing it on the 11th hour, the question was normally in your experience, other professionals in your field, this is done usually during budget season.

149
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:20,959
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can prepare our residents that if there was an increase of 373 median price,

150
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:23,374
[SPEAKER_03]: They're prepared.

151
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:27,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it sounds minimal to some people because it's only, that's all we keep hearing, it's only.

152
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,238
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it odd that we're doing this so late?

153
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:45,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, I think you described the typical circumstance where the vote, you know, as we know, we look at the votes online are done in April or May.

154
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:46,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

155
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:47,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that.

156
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:50,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

157
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:54,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins.

158
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:56,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Barras.

159
00:15:56,325 --> 00:16:05,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for being with us here tonight and for all the legwork that you've been doing to get the FY 25 estimated valuations online months earlier than you otherwise would.

160
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:15,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Really appreciate that, and I appreciate that it helps folks get a clearer picture of what precisely their bills might look like in the future based on various

161
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,819
[SPEAKER_11]: how the votes go in various directions.

162
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,967
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to make sure that I understand the information that's available, and it would be, is it on the Assessor's Department page or the Finance Department page on the city website?

163
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I just got the values done today.

164
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I just prepared the PowerPoint.

165
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:38,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with the, going to have to work with the Mayoral Communications Office to get it onto our assessing page.

166
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:41,660
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also have anyone who doesn't

167
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:45,864
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they can call the assessing office and we can look it up very quickly for them.

168
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:50,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want to call in, or if they want to access our website, either way.

169
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:51,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

170
00:16:51,190 --> 00:17:02,421
[SPEAKER_11]: So up until today, people can call your office or look on the assessor's department website webpage and find the webpage is going to be dependent on like, I'm going to try to get it up this week, but like, it's just however fast we can do it.

171
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:04,563
[SPEAKER_16]: So probably let's say by Friday.

172
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:05,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

173
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:05,564
[SPEAKER_11]: But

174
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:16,086
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the FY 24 based calculations and now you're expediting getting the FY 25 based valuations so that people can have even more clarity.

175
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:16,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

176
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so much for updating that ahead of schedule.

177
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:19,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it.

178
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:21,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Ted.

179
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Just two more questions.

180
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:30,014
[SPEAKER_08]: One, given your estimates, if neither of the overrides pass, based on your estimates, the tax rate would once again be going down.

181
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:30,915
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

182
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:32,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

183
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:41,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And before today, when you had the approved fiscal 25 values, would it have been possible for anyone to provide an update using anything other than the fiscal 24 values or an estimate?

184
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:45,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone from the public, not from your office.

185
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it's possible they might have gotten close, but it's kind of hard to, you know, drill down and get it accurately presented.

186
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would say no.

187
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:56,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

188
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:57,589
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

189
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:59,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions from members of the council?

190
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Say.

191
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:00,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

192
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:05,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand, you know, one of the council's main priorities going in before

193
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:20,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Knowing that this might be an option in the coming years was to maximize this senior circuit breaker for the tax deferrals and to push for the senior work-off program to get more of that done.

194
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:28,096
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my understanding that folks can find out more about the senior tax deferral from the assessor's office, is that correct?

195
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:39,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so there's, as you mentioned, our senior work-off program is staffed, I believe over at least 20 senior work-off participants this year across the city.

196
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,206
[SPEAKER_02]: The senior deferral applications are available as well as the personal exemptions for low-income seniors.

197
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:48,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of two different programs.

198
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:51,151
[SPEAKER_02]: They have both asset and income limits.

199
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

200
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:55,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

201
00:18:56,354 --> 00:19:02,678
[SPEAKER_03]: With just a couple more questions, I know that you mentioned that this doesn't have any impact on question six, correct?

202
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in fiscal year 25.

203
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:08,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not enough time to put everything in, correct?

204
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,585
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know the actual numbers, correct?

205
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't calculated that.

206
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, interest rates could change drastically.

207
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:18,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but we still don't know how much for question six.

208
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an open-ended, as it said in the question, there's nothing there.

209
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:28,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I, you know, I can't really tell you what the market's going to do right on the on the bond market.

210
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:29,303
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

211
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:32,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize the exemptions are great.

212
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:39,406
[SPEAKER_03]: but I know that there are options when you do this ahead of time, is to really prepare your seniors.

213
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:47,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the exemptions sound good, but when you read them and you talk to actual people, there are a lot of senior citizens that really don't fit in that category.

214
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,028
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are no other options.

215
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:59,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know the buzzwords easy to say, we do have exemptions, but when you put it apples to apples and you sit with the senior citizen and you go through their situation, I'm sure you know,

216
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Jones bought her house with her husband 55 years ago for 50,000.

217
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:08,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the house is appraised at $100 million.

218
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:11,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It really doesn't help what we're offering.

219
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:18,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a funny number and there could be something done more if we had time for an exemption.

220
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:19,203
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm saying.

221
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:24,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that if we had time, this is something we could petition to see if we can really, truly

222
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,488
[SPEAKER_03]: support our senior citizens.

223
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:27,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that must be said.

224
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:40,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the, the last piece to this, I think that when they look at this and because one question I have Ted is that a lot of people have asked, not just seniors, um, that the, this is like a one time tax.

225
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:40,812
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't.

226
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:48,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you see that 4% above your two and a half percent increase, that's going to be compounded year after year after year.

227
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:51,456
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't something that's going to go away like debt exclusion, correct?

228
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, the levy is set at the new limit and the two and a half is on that new levy.

229
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:58,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so that'll grow forever.

230
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:03,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the other piece that people have to understand too, and it's a tough office.

231
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:14,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, when you hear the misconceptions, I just need your input to educate our residents in understanding that, again, I believe the mayor said her house is only $13.

232
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:19,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Some others here said their house is $40 a month or whatever, and we can handle that.

233
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:31,566
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be the first year, but again, we were told, I think someone from your office emailed us and said that we'll be reassessing again in 2025 for 2026 using the data for 2023, correct?

234
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the 25 values used calendar year, 23 sales.

235
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:42,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

236
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:46,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So next year we're going to see a 26 using calendar year, 24 sales.

237
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to say that happens every year.

238
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a every year.

239
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:50,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

240
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:51,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good.

241
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:52,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So it happens.

242
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:53,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for helping with that.

243
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:53,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So it increases.

244
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:54,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So

245
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, when this tax goes in, it's now assessed again, the homes will be assessed again.

246
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:03,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I can't predict what the final 24 numbers are going to be, but it could go up, could go down, depends on the market, right?

247
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:15,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but we're seeing that most assessments, because I could tell you, I'm dealing with my own family members that are looking at a $400 increase per month for his new assessment.

248
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:17,000
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real.

249
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that what people also have to understand is that it's not just the home tax.

250
00:22:22,144 --> 00:22:26,288
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen their cars.

251
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:27,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Motor vehicle excise.

252
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Vehicle excise tax is going to go up.

253
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:34,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see the CPA tax because your homes are going to be assessed higher now, right?

254
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:37,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the CPA tax will also be taxed higher.

255
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:39,520
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see that a little bit higher, correct?

256
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,561
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that's yeah, that's generally correct.

257
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:46,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally, the CPA was included in the calculations presented.

258
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:47,203
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so thank you.

259
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:53,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're seeing is it's not just it's not just an override tax.

260
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an override tax.

261
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:56,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It's compounded year after year.

262
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tax that increases in the CPA as well.

263
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the excise tax that increases as well.

264
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,346
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much more than just 13.

265
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,847
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my point I'm trying to say.

266
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's easy to look at a site that wasn't put forth by our office because we know that although it's correct, the numbers that my colleagues did put out there on a page, it does give the numbers that are true and factual, but

267
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:32,452
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't include the assessments that residents had, and I'll use my brother's example, because his house was appraised at, on the calculations, at $800,000.

268
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:35,215
[SPEAKER_03]: His house is now appraised at $1.2 million.

269
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:37,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we're seeing that.

270
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not odd.

271
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,582
[SPEAKER_03]: This is family-owned homes that

272
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:45,627
[SPEAKER_03]: that we passed on to generation to generation, just like most people in this room.

273
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but thank you.

274
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:57,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm monopolizing the time because I think it's important, because these are the questions the people that are sitting in this room right now and their friends have contacted me and said, we're very confused, Mr. Scappelli.

275
00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:04,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even something simple as, Mr. Scott Pelley, why are we fighting for $7.5 million for a new high school?

276
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, no, no, this has nothing to do with the new high school.

277
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's down the line.

278
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:14,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And people understanding that, well, this is a fight between schools and kids and senior citizens.

279
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:16,322
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true at all.

280
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:21,387
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to make sure all the information's out so every resident understands the impact.

281
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:26,200
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and we could talk about solutions as we go, because there are solutions.

282
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,902
[SPEAKER_03]: There were solutions back in April, but thank you.

283
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:31,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Ted.

284
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:33,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate the hard work of your office.

285
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:42,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to note, certainly this council, and you've shared some recently, has taken several votes to maximize the exemptions allowed by state law.

286
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:51,155
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see anything more that we could do on that front, I believe in 2022, we voted to tie it to the law so that we wouldn't have to constantly be updating it as the state did.

287
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,754
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see anything, please let us know.

288
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:57,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly our intent is to be maximizing everything, and I believe we have.

289
00:24:57,717 --> 00:25:04,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just the HEROES Act that just was passed allows us to tie the veteran personal exemption to cost of living.

290
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:08,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just passed, so it would be a new action by council.

291
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:09,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

292
00:25:09,827 --> 00:25:10,387
[SPEAKER_08]: We will do that.

293
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:10,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

294
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:11,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

295
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:12,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

296
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,010
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

297
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to read off the rules one more time.

298
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:16,913
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to move to question and answer.

299
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,763
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we're gonna follow the following rules for this part of the meeting.

300
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:29,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Members of the public will have one minute to ask one question.

301
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:34,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Members of the public will not be able to ask a second question until everyone has had a chance to ask their first.

302
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:41,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna verbally request that we not ask duplicative or largely similar questions and may move on to the next question.

303
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:48,276
[SPEAKER_08]: If a duplicative or similar question is asked, counselors will have up to two minutes per counselor to answer each question.

304
00:25:49,653 --> 00:26:00,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm requesting that counselors not provide duplicative or largely similar answers to answers that have been already provided by other counselors and may move on to the next counselor for an answer if that happens.

305
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:07,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And after members of the public have had the chance to ask their first question, we'll open the floor to a second question or a short public comment.

306
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:10,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to be alternating between the chamber and Zoom.

307
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:12,909
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will start at the podium.

308
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:18,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Castanetti, you'll have one minute to ask a question and then we'll go to Zoom after answers from counselors.

309
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:26,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Beers, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, East Medford, Massachusetts.

310
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:30,279
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very devastated that we lost Larry Lepore.

311
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,400
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a wonderful man.

312
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,082
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a good friend.

313
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the microphone on?

314
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:39,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew, is the mic, turn the mic down.

315
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:41,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there you go.

316
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:42,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry we lost Larry Lepore.

317
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:47,434
[SPEAKER_12]: The minutes, thank you.

318
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:55,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you all had a good Columbus Day yesterday, because he is the greatest world naval explorer in history.

319
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,130
[SPEAKER_12]: He said the world is round, not flat.

320
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:01,812
[SPEAKER_12]: He had more courage than all of us combined.

321
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,373
[SPEAKER_12]: He is also a hero to me and others.

322
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:08,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Also hope you had a good Indigenous People's Day.

323
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:10,575
[SPEAKER_12]: I also hope the same for the Jews.

324
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,846
[SPEAKER_12]: in the Mideast, because they've been there more than 2,000 years.

325
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Now let's talk Prop 2.5 overrides.

326
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,353
[SPEAKER_12]: As I told you all before, Method never had a Prop 2.5 override.

327
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:24,594
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not Winchester.

328
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:28,137
[SPEAKER_12]: We are all Method here, a working class town city.

329
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:34,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Our problem is fiscal management and lack of building maintenance, period, full stop.

330
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:44,230
[SPEAKER_12]: My ask is for you honorable city councils to stop this real estate tax assault on we the homeowners and leave the people alone.

331
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop the bleeding.

332
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:48,914
[SPEAKER_12]: We're already having trouble with all this Biden inflation.

333
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:49,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy, thank you.

334
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:50,555
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a minute.

335
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:52,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, does it have one sentence?

336
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:55,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and say the sentence minutes up.

337
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,580
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's up.

338
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:58,781
[SPEAKER_12]: You can say the sentence.

339
00:27:58,841 --> 00:27:59,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Andy is a minute up.

340
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:00,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, sir.

341
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:00,603
[SPEAKER_12]: It is up.

342
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:00,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

343
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:01,143
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

344
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,704
[SPEAKER_12]: My motto was this.

345
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:04,686
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no further taxation.

346
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:06,735
[SPEAKER_12]: He's allowing me to speak.

347
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:07,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to interrupt me?

348
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to interrupt me?

349
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:12,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just hold on here, guys.

350
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I can't believe we're doing this on the first question.

351
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,140
[SPEAKER_12]: This is crazy.

352
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:16,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop it.

353
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:21,365
[SPEAKER_12]: My motto was this, no more further taxation without proper representation.

354
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:21,865
[SPEAKER_12]: The end.

355
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:25,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew said that dark call.

356
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:26,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Andy.

357
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:27,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone have a response?

358
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:28,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Your time.

359
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone want to answer the question?

360
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lemke, you have two minutes.

361
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to respond to one thing there.

362
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:43,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hear a specific question, but you did say that Medford's not like our surrounding towns.

363
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:44,781
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I said Winchester.

364
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're not like Winchester.

365
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:52,143
[SPEAKER_04]: 90% of cities in the state of Massachusetts have had an override.

366
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:55,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford has one of the low, has

367
00:28:56,384 --> 00:29:03,867
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the lowest operating budgets per capita of any mid-sized city in the state of Massachusetts.

368
00:29:04,447 --> 00:29:11,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is in large part because we are one of the 10% of cities that has never had an override.

369
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:18,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're right, we are not like our neighbors that have had overrides and we have less money for it.

370
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:20,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

371
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:24,474
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll move on to the next question, unless anyone else has an answer.

372
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:26,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Andy.

373
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:28,289
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Michelle B on Zoom.

374
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

375
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll have one minute to ask your question.

376
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:35,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Michelle Barkson.

377
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 23 Diane Road in Medford.

378
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:43,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you everyone for your work with this important progress.

379
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:54,144
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is, can you please speak to the ramifications of what will happen if questions seven and eight do not pass specifically to the school budget and how that will affect our students

380
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:55,664
[SPEAKER_10]: learning environment.

381
00:29:55,724 --> 00:30:03,548
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to remind everyone listening that teacher working conditions are student learning conditions, and those two things cannot be separated.

382
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:08,731
[SPEAKER_10]: As a public school teacher in another town, I can speak to that being very true.

383
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:15,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would love to hear, or I would not love to hear, but I want to hear what might happen if these don't pass so we can highlight the importance of them passing.

384
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:16,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

385
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:17,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

386
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:20,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Vice President Collins, then

387
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:24,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Behrs.

388
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the question.

389
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:34,040
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna add a disclaimer that I obviously sitting behind this rail on this date, I'm not a school committee member.

390
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:40,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have that level of granular knowledge of the school department and the school department makes its own budget.

391
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:41,602
[SPEAKER_11]: The city council does not.

392
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:50,783
[SPEAKER_11]: That being said, I have discussed this matter extensively with people in the community, with people involved in the schools, with school committee members.

393
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:53,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that

394
00:30:54,224 --> 00:31:06,198
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, what we stand to lose if these questions do not pass includes, you know, some of the stuff that people involved in the schools may remember from when we had to cut the school's budget during the pandemic.

395
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,187
[SPEAKER_11]: And that includes eliminating positions, including teachers, nurses, behavioral specialists, literary coaches.

396
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:23,593
[SPEAKER_11]: We lose the opportunity to add programming within the schools that supplement the curriculum that is state mandated.

397
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:32,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So, some programming that is really beloved by students and their families, such as arts and musical curricula.

398
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:36,980
[SPEAKER_11]: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with those types of classes.

399
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,384
[SPEAKER_11]: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with more people in supportive roles.

400
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:59,115
[SPEAKER_11]: such as therapists, nurses, people outside of the classroom who are nevertheless there to make sure that students can thrive in our schools and achieve the best learning that they can?

401
00:31:59,275 --> 00:31:59,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

402
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:10,223
[SPEAKER_11]: These two questions combined also limit our ability to offer competitive and living wages to the many, many people who work in our schools and offer

403
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:14,007
[SPEAKER_11]: students the experience that they really deserve.

404
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:20,356
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that we need to be offering living wages to our teachers and paras and all school staff because it's the right thing to do.

405
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:27,285
[SPEAKER_11]: We also know that we need to be able to do that in order to keep these people in our school system so that our students are served in the way that they deserve.

406
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:31,020
[SPEAKER_11]: This will also have impacts on building maintenance.

407
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

408
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Councilor Sang.

409
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:34,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

410
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:41,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins, I think, touched on a list of positions that, subject to the school committee talks, might be at stake.

411
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:46,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Literacy specialists, school nurses, guidance, mental health specialists, increased class sizes.

412
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:49,241
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's not fear-mongering when a lot of this stuff has already happened.

413
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,282
[SPEAKER_13]: happening in our school districts.

414
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:51,963
[SPEAKER_13]: We've already had to make a lot of these cuts.

415
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:56,505
[SPEAKER_13]: We've already found it hard to retain our long-term teachers.

416
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:59,747
[SPEAKER_13]: We also need to take a step back and look at this big picture-wise.

417
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:09,753
[SPEAKER_13]: We know when we invest in our schools, your investment and your value of your property goes up as well, that your public safety around you, crime goes down and public safety goes up.

418
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:15,877
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we, I think there are longer, bigger picture benefits to everyone, even if you don't have kids in the schools.

419
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:20,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Touching on the roads real quick, because that's also a part of question seven.

420
00:33:21,581 --> 00:33:24,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to look at the opportunity we lose.

421
00:33:24,723 --> 00:33:29,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, the basic role of government, of local government is to fix your potholes and to send your kids to school.

422
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:34,049
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're not, if we can't do either of those, then we're not, you know,

423
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:38,550
[SPEAKER_13]: we're not doing our jobs, but we were asking the voters to give us the tools to do our jobs.

424
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:47,733
[SPEAKER_13]: And something about question seven with the roads and sidewalks is that it would give us a crew that would work full time on fixing our potholes and sidewalks in the city.

425
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:51,054
[SPEAKER_13]: That's something that we don't have right now because our resources are too constrained.

426
00:33:51,474 --> 00:34:00,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something that I believe if passed, will show, will give our residents a real benefit, a real benefit that you can see and live in our city.

427
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:05,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the question.

428
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:16,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me start off by first saying that, unfortunately, this administration has divided this community for the children in the schools and the seniors or the homeowners or renters.

429
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:23,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say shame on this administration, shame on this council, shame on the financial task force, because the bottom line is this.

430
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:30,631
[SPEAKER_03]: this group knew that we were heading in some tough waters back in June 20th of 2023.

431
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:40,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see that in a city council budget meeting when council beers met with the mayor behind closed doors to set up some sort of deal.

432
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:52,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't know what that deal was, but they created a financial task force and that financial task force put together a plan of an override without anybody's knowledge, anybody's input or any,

433
00:34:54,026 --> 00:34:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: or any community participation.

434
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:01,949
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no issues with our school department.

435
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:06,590
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a fair tactic and fair tactic only for the fact that we should remember this.

436
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:17,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in April, back in May, back in June, when the city had $25 million in free cash, it was my responsibility to bring forth that we take that $5 million

437
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:30,052
[SPEAKER_03]: levy that budget, make sure there were no cuts, understand the process, and then move forward to see if we truly need an override, which I never said that should never be an option.

438
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:37,117
[SPEAKER_03]: But to hear parents and teachers and friends and family say, George, explain this to me.

439
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:46,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Villes knew that this was going to be a devastating situation, but it could have been solved and still could be solved with free cash.

440
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:52,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We have plenty of free cash in the system not to turn the city upside down or divide the city.

441
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, remember, I'll leave you with this.

442
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:58,414
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're asking for in the budget

443
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:04,122
[SPEAKER_03]: in this override doesn't mean you'll get exactly what you think you're gonna get.

444
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:09,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all these cuts were made to set up this override as a fair tactic.

445
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:13,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, Dr. Scarpelli is not against the children.

446
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:17,112
[SPEAKER_03]: We just hope that people understand that this could be solved.

447
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:18,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President.

448
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

449
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:24,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Just gonna say a few things really quick.

450
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:29,842
[SPEAKER_08]: the council.

451
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:31,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'll go to, okay.

452
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:32,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait.

453
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:33,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilors are councilor.

454
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me two minutes.

455
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:40,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one thing that I want to mention about to answer the

456
00:36:41,644 --> 00:36:44,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoom residents question, Michelle.

457
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:59,554
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we would lose if this question, question seven in particular, does not pass, it's a very specific, I believe it's question seven, it's a very specific thing about the high school schedule, which right now does not allow

458
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:12,083
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the students who are taking specific classes, I believe it's in the vocational school, to take certain art classes, theater classes, visual arts.

459
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:18,087
[SPEAKER_01]: It limits our students in being the fully well-rounded students that we want them to be able to be.

460
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,630
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in high school, you want to be able to explore

461
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,632
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out who you are, what you're interested in.

462
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:29,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to give all of our students the best opportunity to be everything that they can be.

463
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:37,581
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want to limit them because we haven't had the opportunity to expand the schedule to really experiment with what that can be.

464
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:44,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also say that in 2019, I worked for the school district and I knew then that we were underfunded.

465
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:48,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started thinking about running for city council to make something like this happen.

466
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,011
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been happening for a long time.

467
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:51,492
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had underfunded

468
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:53,013
[SPEAKER_01]: schools for a long time.

469
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:54,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been in the works for a long time.

470
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,795
[SPEAKER_01]: This has needed to happen for quite a long time.

471
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:57,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

472
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:00,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lemming, two minutes.

473
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:15,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying that we can address the budgetary problems of the Medford public school system with free cash is like me saying the government gave me a $1,200 check from COVID.

474
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:20,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have to look for a job right now because that check is going to last me another

475
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:22,433
[SPEAKER_04]: another two weeks.

476
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:24,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing.

477
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:28,534
[SPEAKER_04]: The government gave us, the government gave the city of Medford some money.

478
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:34,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a one-time thing from COVID and the proposal that we can plug ongoing costs from free cash.

479
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:41,716
[SPEAKER_04]: All that would do is drain our reserves and we'd be back at square one in five years.

480
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:50,438
[SPEAKER_04]: If these overrides don't pass straight up, there will be layoffs in the school system and the roads will continue to be in disrepair.

481
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:50,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

482
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:54,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, nope, one time, sorry.

483
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:57,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It's question eight, yeah.

484
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And any other councilors wanna go?

485
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be quick, give myself two minutes.

486
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:06,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to list it out.

487
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:12,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Two literacy interventionists, two behavior specialists, one nurse, four teachers, and four department heads.

488
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:16,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were cuts that were postponed because we used one-time funds this year to plug the hole.

489
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,873
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another 25 positions, two school counselors, four classroom teachers, two security monitors.

490
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:31,886
[SPEAKER_08]: one attendance and re-engagement officer, five paraprofessionals, and 12.2 additional staff members that are on one-time federal funds this year.

491
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:35,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's about 35 to 45 staff in the schools.

492
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:36,893
[SPEAKER_08]: We would not have a

493
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:42,724
[SPEAKER_08]: permanent dedicated street and sidewalk crew to use the machines that we already own.

494
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:46,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have enough staff in the DPW to actually run those machines four times a week.

495
00:39:47,845 --> 00:40:08,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And there would not be significant room for looking at additional compensation for educators, paraprofessionals, and staff in our schools, whether that's just to raise their pay, because it's a contract year, or whether that is when we're talking about extending potentially 10 to 15 minutes to school day to align vocational with the comprehensive high school schedule.

496
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:11,811
[SPEAKER_08]: or just to address any issues on time on learning.

497
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:12,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks.

498
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:14,754
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we would lose.

499
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:17,277
[SPEAKER_08]: We will go to the podium.

500
00:40:17,697 --> 00:40:19,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

501
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:21,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have one minute to ask one question.

502
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,966
[SPEAKER_15]: John McGonigal, 20 Ross Street, Medford.

503
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:32,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Question is the residential

504
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:37,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Override not override the assessments on each house that are going around now.

505
00:40:37,927 --> 00:41:02,021
[SPEAKER_15]: They're roughly around $60,000 for each house for the last three years So if you take the $60,000 and you multiply it by your nine dollars a thousand You're coming up to five hundred forty dollars a house every single year so Multiply that by your twenty six thousand seven hundred houses that are in Medford which is

506
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:04,972
[SPEAKER_15]: $13,857,000.

507
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:04,972
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is, where does that go?

508
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:13,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's not actually how the tax rates calculated.

509
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:16,212
[SPEAKER_08]: The assessor just presented the information.

510
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:21,015
[SPEAKER_08]: The levy changes based on the two and a half and new growth.

511
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:24,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's only about 6 million this year, not 13 million.

512
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:29,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And generally that amount is only going towards fixed costs.

513
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:37,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have union contracts, increasing health insurance costs, increasing retirement pension costs, increased costs of materials and pavement.

514
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:41,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's generally what the normal two and a half new growth increase goes towards.

515
00:41:41,688 --> 00:41:49,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that assessment, one thing you didn't put in as a cost increase to the citizens of Medford is your homeowner's insurance.

516
00:41:50,153 --> 00:42:03,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Your homeowner's insurance, if your residential area goes up 160,000 over three years, that's going to be probably another three, $400 a year that I don't think anyone's talked about yet.

517
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:05,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

518
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:06,583
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was my question.

519
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:07,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

520
00:42:07,994 --> 00:42:09,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone else want to answer that question?

521
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:11,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if I can.

522
00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:24,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I heard some similar situations with, I know what the assessor came up, he gave us medium price homes, but we're seeing real people have told me that this is what we're seeing.

523
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:31,349
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing the increase close to $60,000, most homes that you're seeing an increase at a higher percentage rate.

524
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:34,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, on top of all of what we talked about,

525
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:37,553
[SPEAKER_03]: with this, so it's not the $13 a month, the $40 a month.

526
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:48,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the pieces that this gentleman just said is the understanding that I never thought that our home insurance now will now increase.

527
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:52,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this isn't them against us.

528
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:58,865
[SPEAKER_03]: This is understanding that we have viable options right now to fix this.

529
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:10,090
[SPEAKER_03]: with free cash and then work together to see how we can have an open process to really include all the stakeholders to make sure that, uh, that no one is hurt.

530
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

531
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:15,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from answers from members of the council?

532
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:19,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we'll go to the next question on zoom.

533
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:21,815
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Lizzie Charbonneau.

534
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:24,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Lizzie, you have one minute to ask one question.

535
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Please provide your name and address for the record.

536
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:28,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my name is Lizzy Sharpener.

537
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:30,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 18 Stickney Road.

538
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, why do we need to do the override now?

539
00:43:35,443 --> 00:43:49,072
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, I'm curious to hear you speak to the rising inflation the last few years that has exceeded the rate that the levee limit has been able to increase as well as which costs increase even faster than inflation.

540
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:53,876
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is that insurance and pensions and other fixed costs that the city has to

541
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:58,606
[SPEAKER_00]: for our rising faster than inflation and faster than those levy increases.

542
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:13,071
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also like to hear you speak to the increased costs in schools that are exceeding inflation rates and our inability as a city to provide some basic infrastructure like maintenance of roads due to our low budget.

543
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:20,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could speak to why we need this override now, especially in relation to those items, I would like to hear that.

544
00:44:21,894 --> 00:44:22,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

545
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:26,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Councilor Callahan.

546
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:28,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

547
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:33,651
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think this is a basic question why do we need these overrides.

548
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:41,798
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Councilor Lemming stated, we, we actually I will say we rank 320th out of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns.

549
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:47,103
[SPEAKER_14]: in the amount of budget we have per person.

550
00:44:47,623 --> 00:44:54,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we have less budget per person than every other city in Massachusetts and we have less budget per person than 90% of towns.

551
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,434
[SPEAKER_14]: All of the others that spend less per person than we do are much smaller than we are.

552
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:03,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Our budget is too small to provide the services that we need.

553
00:45:04,477 --> 00:45:10,241
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to go ahead, I don't know, this is probably gonna be too small for people to see, but this is a chart of our budget.

554
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:14,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And this large blue area here is the schools.

555
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:19,406
[SPEAKER_14]: That is what we are looking for more money for, so we cannot cut that.

556
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,989
[SPEAKER_14]: The next one is insurance.

557
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:26,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Insurance is something that we are required to have by law.

558
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,692
[SPEAKER_14]: We cannot cut that.

559
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:30,055
[SPEAKER_14]: The next one is pensions.

560
00:45:30,155 --> 00:45:31,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are contractual.

561
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:33,139
[SPEAKER_14]: We cannot cut pensions.

562
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,204
[SPEAKER_14]: The next two are our fire department and our police department.

563
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:45,495
[SPEAKER_14]: My feeling is that no one on either side of the Prop 2.5 debate wants to drastically cut our police and fire departments.

564
00:45:46,016 --> 00:45:48,720
[SPEAKER_14]: The next one after police and fire is our roads.

565
00:45:49,461 --> 00:45:59,814
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate your question about the roads, because underfunding of our roads has caused us to have $67 million in essentially road debt.

566
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:00,996
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called the road backlog.

567
00:46:01,096 --> 00:46:01,557
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 seconds.

568
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:02,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

569
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:13,741
[SPEAKER_14]: After that, our bonds, which we are also required to pay, and then we get down to smaller things, the library facilities, many other small departments.

570
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:22,224
[SPEAKER_14]: None of these, if we even cut the entire department, could possibly fix the $3 million to $5 million that we need for the school budget.

571
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:24,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Our budget is simply too small.

572
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:27,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let someone else talk about which of these increases more than inflation.

573
00:46:27,105 --> 00:46:27,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

574
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:28,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

575
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Councilor Lemming, two minutes.

576
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:51,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So adding on to what Councilor Callahan said, partially this is due to the lingering costs of COVID, which resulted in both decreased funding going to the school system, partially that was just because you have fewer students going into public schools, and partially because

577
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:55,713
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a lot of activity in the healthcare system from COVID.

578
00:46:55,793 --> 00:47:01,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a sort of a, so the cost of health insurance, which we have to pay ended up rising.

579
00:47:01,504 --> 00:47:04,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some of the more short term reasons why we need this now.

580
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:05,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Longer term,

581
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:15,469
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that Prop 2 NAP is designed is the total amount of money that the city can take in basically can't go up by more than 2.5% every year.

582
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:22,376
[SPEAKER_04]: While inflation has averaged for the past 44 years at 3.1% over time, that compounds.

583
00:47:22,436 --> 00:47:23,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So the budget today

584
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:32,143
[SPEAKER_04]: is only a fraction, well, it's only about 78% as valuable today as it was back in 1980.

585
00:47:32,464 --> 00:47:38,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So Prop 2.5 has this effect long-term on municipal budget where it squeezes resources.

586
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:47,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Most cities in Massachusetts have addressed this with the intended mechanism for overcoming this, which is periodic elections.

587
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:50,858
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just the first time we're doing that, and that's part of the reason.

588
00:47:51,318 --> 00:48:07,514
[SPEAKER_04]: the fact that we're so late to the game there is part of the reason that again we are 320 out of 351 cities in terms of our per capita budget and that is the reason why our schools could definitely be doing

589
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:07,854
[SPEAKER_04]: better.

590
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:10,115
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the reason why you see so many potholes.

591
00:48:10,435 --> 00:48:14,497
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one step in addressing that situation.

592
00:48:14,918 --> 00:48:21,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, free cash, one time funding is not an actual longer term solution.

593
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:32,826
[SPEAKER_04]: If we just went with free cash, that would be drained in a couple of years, even shorter than the four to five year span I put, I said earlier, and then that's time.

594
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:33,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

595
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:35,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

596
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Councilor Scarpelli you have two minutes.

597
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:37,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

598
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:52,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think my council is not understanding the free cash should be used now to fix a problem now, which we have, and I appreciate the clarification it's only $3 million to Councilor Kelly I just said to fix the school budget, but the key issue isn't

599
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:56,685
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't the process of getting this fixed now.

600
00:48:56,745 --> 00:49:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem that we've had, and we could use the pandemic and use the pandemic over and over again, but what neighboring communities are doing during the pandemic with the infrastructure money that was given through ARPA, that wasn't intended for, for the roads and sidewalks that you're asking for right now.

601
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mayor didn't do that.

602
00:49:12,848 --> 00:49:16,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mayor had to balance our budget through ESSER and ARPA funding.

603
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:18,610
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the easy way out.

604
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,831
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like paying your mortgage with a credit card.

605
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you why.

606
00:49:22,372 --> 00:49:23,052
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the difference.

607
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody hasn't said it, but the difference between why we're here and we're in trouble is because of new growth.

608
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:31,296
[SPEAKER_03]: New growth is what pushes

609
00:49:33,257 --> 00:49:35,098
[SPEAKER_03]: our value, our income up.

610
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:37,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives us more tax base.

611
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It brings more money so we can do all the things we're talking about.

612
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:41,662
[SPEAKER_03]: This mayor has done nothing.

613
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had shovel in the ground in five and a half years.

614
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:55,350
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about, I know my council friends have gone out and told people that Massachusetts is the number one, Medford is the number one community new growth in permitting.

615
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrong, I sat with the commissioner.

616
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:05,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Permitting their fine, the biggest concerns we're having, look at the process that she lost fighting 40B projects.

617
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:10,838
[SPEAKER_03]: One project alone was $3 to $5 million in permits.

618
00:50:10,878 --> 00:50:14,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And then an additional $7 to $9 million that would have come in as new growth.

619
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And one job that she fought in court, lost, and appealed it, and this group had to leave.

620
00:50:21,224 --> 00:50:24,706
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem isn't our tax base, because our assessments are up.

621
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're paying more than anybody else in neighboring communities because our assessments are so high.

622
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:33,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I will share my last point.

623
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:41,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Neighbor communities per child, Malden, Arlington, Winchester, between 15 and 17,000.

624
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford, we pay $22,000 per student.

625
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:49,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a management issue or is it really we don't have enough money?

626
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it because it's public.

627
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:51,953
$22,000.

628
00:50:52,013 --> 00:50:52,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

629
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:56,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Councilor Seng.

630
00:50:58,063 --> 00:51:00,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Seng, and then Councilor Collins.

631
00:51:01,704 --> 00:51:01,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

632
00:51:02,004 --> 00:51:02,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Seng, two minutes.

633
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:03,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

634
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:09,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Touching very quickly on the topic of new growth, I think our council is very aware that new growth is the priority for Medford.

635
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:19,229
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when we look at the last three years of new growth, so the last two years plus the estimates that we have right in front of us presented by the assessor,

636
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:30,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually shows that our first round of zoning reform, which was the first round in almost 50 years of zoning reform, actually has led to the most new growth our city has seen in decades.

637
00:51:30,612 --> 00:51:42,634
[SPEAKER_13]: We are currently working on round two of zoning reform and we are very, very optimistic that that new growth will help us achieve more financial stability going into the future as long as these questions pass.

638
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:44,015
[SPEAKER_13]: I think

639
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,637
[SPEAKER_13]: I also have this chart right here.

640
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do what Councilor Callahan does.

641
00:51:51,301 --> 00:52:00,769
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not really easy to see, but you can see that the new growth is growing, is growing throughout the last few years with the reforms that we've instituted.

642
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:05,633
[SPEAKER_13]: We are permitting more units as Councilor- Could you put that chart back up?

643
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:05,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

644
00:52:07,214 --> 00:52:08,595
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also permitting more new,

645
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:14,705
[SPEAKER_13]: New units than ever before, as Councilor Scarpoli states.

646
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:23,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing, because on the topic of new growth, we're getting a little bit away from the why now question.

647
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:28,611
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a plan, that plan is being implemented, and the results are already bearing fruit.

648
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:31,172
[SPEAKER_13]: We fell behind decades.

649
00:52:31,312 --> 00:52:32,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's just the truth.

650
00:52:32,512 --> 00:52:33,553
[SPEAKER_13]: We fell behind decades.

651
00:52:33,853 --> 00:52:40,736
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't agree with every decision that the mayors previous have taken, but we are in a situation now where we need

652
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:43,278
[SPEAKER_13]: to face the facts as they are now.

653
00:52:43,438 --> 00:52:57,113
[SPEAKER_13]: High inflation, lack of new growth over the last few decades means that we need to do a short-term plan, which is these three questions, and then a long-term plan, which is investing in new growth, which is what our zoning efforts are.

654
00:52:59,075 --> 00:52:59,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

655
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:00,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor Collins.

656
00:53:01,923 --> 00:53:02,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Behrs.

657
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:05,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow councilors on this topic.

658
00:53:06,525 --> 00:53:09,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't go into the topic of new growth.

659
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:10,867
[SPEAKER_11]: My fellow councilors have covered that.

660
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:23,073
[SPEAKER_11]: We are very optimistic about how the council's current work on zoning and permitting, which we've been keeping up for two terms, will continue to accelerate new growth and augment the city's operating budget to the greatest extent possible.

661
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I do just want to note that on the issue of free cash, just to, I think,

662
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:31,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Different ways of framing the issue are helpful for me, maybe for other people.

663
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:53,064
[SPEAKER_11]: It's no secret that we accrued free cash over several years, and that was not dispersed into savings accounts where it could be used and spent on capital expenditures because our city, unlike almost every other city and town in Massachusetts, before this year did not have any stabilization accounts.

664
00:53:53,504 --> 00:53:54,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we do.

665
00:53:54,204 --> 00:53:56,705
[SPEAKER_11]: That means that that money can go to the purposes that I think

666
00:53:57,225 --> 00:54:02,068
[SPEAKER_11]: City staff and many residents really wanted it to be going to expected it to be going to all along.

667
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:05,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Things like capital expenses and also repairing our infrastructure.

668
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:14,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Putting aside some of that money that's already been allocated to things that people can see out on the street, helping our DPW and other departments improve life and do basic maintenance in the city.

669
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:18,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you say, okay, let's forget some of those capital expenditures.

670
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:22,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's pretend that we still have $25 million in free cash just using an easy number.

671
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:33,155
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one-eighth of the city's annual operating budget, which means, you know, if it's one-eighth, you can understand how quickly we would run through that if we were using that as things to plug the hole in the budget.

672
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:38,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do want to emphasize that doesn't include any capital expenses whatsoever.

673
00:54:39,618 --> 00:54:46,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Going back to the resident's question on why now, I think it comes down to we know that free cash is not sustainable.

674
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:54,005
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that we're already full steam on new growth, but we need more and better funding and services for our residents now.

675
00:54:54,686 --> 00:55:01,310
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the question is, do we want to punish residents and students for past shortcomings by failing to invest now?

676
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:06,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do we want to take this opportunity to start making Medford better for all residents and students in the public schools?

677
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:08,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

678
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:11,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody went on that.

679
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:19,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to avoid everybody answering every question if we can at all possible, but everyone did give a different answer, which is appreciated context.

680
00:55:21,757 --> 00:55:27,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to be brief myself to ignore my own advice and say, light poles are falling down.

681
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:35,922
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a meeting two weeks ago where a light pole fell on a public way, and luckily it happened at night, so it didn't hit a car or a person and hurt them.

682
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:38,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's the situation that we're in.

683
00:55:38,783 --> 00:55:39,463
[SPEAKER_08]: We have finally,

684
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,764
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriated some funds to a capital stabilization fund.

685
00:55:42,804 --> 00:55:45,985
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a paper on the meeting at seven o'clock to look at that.

686
00:55:46,585 --> 00:55:52,527
[SPEAKER_08]: We are in a historic multi-decade deficit where we have massive needs.

687
00:55:53,787 --> 00:55:56,148
[SPEAKER_08]: The free cash that is being spoken of is spoken for.

688
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It is spoken for, it needs to go to our roads, it needs to go to our schools, it needs to go to fix things that are already broken.

689
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:06,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you, please stop, thank you.

690
00:56:07,286 --> 00:56:09,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just reality.

691
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:15,652
[SPEAKER_08]: If we use that to plug operating budget holes, we'll have to plug those holes with new revenue in the future.

692
00:56:16,192 --> 00:56:20,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't wait for the new growth from our new zoning, which will take five to 10 years to propagate.

693
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:25,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think any of us want more light posts falling in the sink, we certainly

694
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,941
[SPEAKER_08]: should be grateful that so far they've only been falling at night.

695
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:30,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

696
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:32,843
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to the podium for the next question.

697
00:56:32,863 --> 00:56:34,264
[SPEAKER_08]: You have one minute to ask one question.

698
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:35,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

699
00:56:36,045 --> 00:56:40,047
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Maureen Tardelli, 11 Chester Avenue, Medford.

700
00:56:40,848 --> 00:56:42,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is my question.

701
00:56:43,322 --> 00:56:58,632
[SPEAKER_09]: where financial professionals, business owners, residents, firefighters, school administrators, teachers, parents, the chief assessor, and the DPW commissioner, part of the financial task force.

702
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:01,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your question.

703
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:02,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Would anyone like to answer the question?

704
00:57:06,237 --> 00:57:07,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

705
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:08,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

706
00:57:09,108 --> 00:57:20,377
[SPEAKER_11]: The financial task force was a group explicitly made up of elected to consider the question of what we would put before our elected bodies to deal with solutions around this problem.

707
00:57:21,258 --> 00:57:24,060
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I feel really comfortable in saying that all of the.

708
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:33,892
[SPEAKER_11]: above types of people, city staff, members of the community, were consulted in various ways, formally and informally, throughout this process.

709
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:41,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Some that people talked to, some that members of the financial task force talked to while we were considering these matters that were discussed in our meetings.

710
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:43,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of that were explicitly consulted.

711
00:57:44,705 --> 00:57:57,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And others that have just been part of this greater conversation around what should we do with about what should we do about chronic underfunding in Medford over the course of months and months and years and years of challenges that have led up to this year in which we are.

712
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:14,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Working together to try to solve these issues once and for all, instead of having budget season after budget season, where the school budget is essentially held hostage by our inability to raise enough money to add to provide the services that residents.

713
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:16,947
[SPEAKER_11]: students and teachers expect and deserve.

714
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:31,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also just want to underline, again, that these ballot questions, every single resident, every single voter in Medford, whether you're a parent, a teacher, a union member, somebody who works for the city, who also lives in the city, you get to use your voice.

715
00:58:31,436 --> 00:58:32,537
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to cast your vote.

716
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:33,698
[SPEAKER_11]: You can vote yes on all three.

717
00:58:33,738 --> 00:58:34,979
[SPEAKER_11]: You can vote no on all three.

718
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:37,741
[SPEAKER_11]: You can choose which ones you feel comfortable voting yes and voting no on.

719
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:43,004
[SPEAKER_11]: You are a part of this conversation because every single person who votes gets a vote.

720
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:43,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

721
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:48,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

722
00:58:48,874 --> 00:58:49,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other one?

723
00:58:49,615 --> 00:58:50,215
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's all I have.

724
00:58:50,295 --> 00:58:51,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can, Mr. President.

725
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:52,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Two minutes.

726
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:52,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

727
00:58:52,916 --> 00:59:02,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this financial task force was put together without any individual involved in that comment that a young lady put forth.

728
00:59:02,961 --> 00:59:03,962
[SPEAKER_03]: This was done in a bubble.

729
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,863
[SPEAKER_03]: This was done behind closed doors.

730
00:59:06,503 --> 00:59:16,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't planned to educate our seniors, educate our residents, educate our renters, educate our landlords so they could prepare themselves for what's being asked for.

731
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:22,548
[SPEAKER_03]: within a vote that was presented, a discussion was presented on a Thursday, voted on a Tuesday.

732
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:25,607
[SPEAKER_03]: not one community meeting.

733
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:28,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a matter of fact, I will share this with everybody.

734
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:35,011
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a FOIA request put out by a resident that asked a simple question.

735
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:52,278
[SPEAKER_03]: They asked for all of the information, minutes for the meetings, any information, letters, any emails, any text messages, with this financial task force, with any building or any entity within the city to figure out if this is needed or how it will be used and how it can work.

736
00:59:53,581 --> 00:59:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: 150 pages later, all the information that was in that FOIA request were information about when we
