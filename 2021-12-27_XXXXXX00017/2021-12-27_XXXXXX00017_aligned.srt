00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,731
Today's episode is the final one for 2021.

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:10,174
Thank you so much for listening to and supporting the podcast this year.

3
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:16,117
I'm so grateful for all the people I've been connected with during this short time since beginning the podcast.

4
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:20,059
I'm looking forward to the opening of the new library and Medford Brewing.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,384
I'm also looking forward to seeing plans unfold for many of our parks and to opening the first page of the community calendar.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:39,511
Today's interview has also made me hopeful for the ways in which Medford can move towards being more inclusive as we discuss the not menorah incident at City Hall's holiday celebration.

7
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:40,532
Hope you enjoy.

8
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,774
Wishing you all a happy and healthy 2022.

9
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:53,331
All right.

10
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:54,012
Hi, everyone.

11
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:55,933
Thanks for meeting with me tonight.

12
00:00:56,134 --> 00:01:02,319
If we could start by just saying your name and pronouns and anything else you'd like to share about yourself.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,881
I'm Sarah Beardsley.

14
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm a Medford resident.

15
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:10,585
I've been here for 30 years.

16
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,751
And I'm an artist.

17
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,172
I'm current president of Arts Medford.

18
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:28,837
And parent of a now 22-year-old who went through the entire school system here in Medford.

19
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:32,559
And I definitely consider Medford very much my home.

20
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:33,660
And I'm a she, her.

21
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:35,781
Thanks, Sarah.

22
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:43,773
I'm Shira Cohen-Goldberg, and I have lived in Medford for five and a half years.

23
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:51,656
And before that, for the last 20-ish years, I've been living in the Somerville, Cambridge region.

24
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:57,197
And I'm mom of three kids, ages 10, 7, and 3.

25
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:01,038
The two big kids go to the Missittuck.

26
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:10,311
And I'm also a member of Temple Shalom.

27
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:24,621
And in my spare time, I'm Director of Client Services for Hill for Literacy, which is a nonprofit that consults with schools and school districts on teaching reading to kids.

28
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:27,283
And Shira, could you just say your pronouns?

29
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:28,484
Oh, yes.

30
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,805
My pronouns are she, her.

31
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:30,786
Awesome.

32
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:31,306
Thank you.

33
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:39,396
And I'm Susan Bibbins, and my pronouns are she, her, and they.

34
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:49,240
And I am a resident of South Medford since 1996.

35
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,802
That's a good chunk of time.

36
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:59,004
I am the parent of two adult children.

37
00:02:59,024 --> 00:02:59,144
One is 21.

38
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:09,155
And he is a senior in college in New York state.

39
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:17,878
And the other is 23.

40
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:28,422
And they are living at home and figuring out what to do with their lives.

41
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:39,868
They got derailed from the, due to the pandemic, but they'll figure it out soon.

42
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:51,115
And I am present chair of the commission for persons with disabilities.

43
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:58,100
Although I'm not speaking with that hat on tonight.

44
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:22,461
And I am retired, but I was a behavioral consultant for families with high needs, children and behavioral health needs.

45
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,198
So thank you for sharing.

46
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:36,186
And so the question that I ask every or all the people that I interview just to start off is what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

47
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:44,152
Well, family favorite has been actually for quite a few years is Rassos.

48
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:44,853
We love Rassos.

49
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,011
We pretty much like to eat just about everything that's there.

50
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:57,392
My husband especially loves the ribs.

51
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,332
He's a big fan of the ribs there.

52
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:08,475
I tend to go for the, I mean, I like everything, but I more often than not will eat the shrimp scampi because my husband doesn't like shrimp.

53
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:11,756
And so it's about the only chance I get to eat shrimp is when I eat out.

54
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:15,417
So yeah, but all their food is so good.

55
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:16,417
I mean, you can't go wrong.

56
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:33,385
Um, well, I would say my two favorite places to eat in Medford, um, in this phase of my life that is called parenting of young children, um, are Colleen's and Dunkin' Donuts.

57
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:39,287
And, um, and we use these trips to both Colleen's and Dunkin' Donuts as incentives.

58
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:43,967
And, um, my kids will only sit for two seconds at a time to eat anything.

59
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:47,748
And so these are perfect places, um, for the entire family.

60
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:49,483
Relatable, yes.

61
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:50,704
Yeah.

62
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:58,372
And my favorite place to eat is Salvatore's.

63
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:11,606
And my favorite dish to eat is the eggplant parmesan or the chicken parmesan or the pizza.

64
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:14,698
All solid choices.

65
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:15,538
Thank you.

66
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:25,763
So we sort of connected together after the non menorah incident at the City Hall holiday celebration.

67
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:34,628
So I wonder if we could spend a little time if any of you want to sort of reflect on that experience or share any thoughts about it today.

68
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:43,124
It's hard to know where to begin.

69
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:48,769
I mean, I have so many thoughts on it.

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:14,065
First off, I just found it really upsetting troubling that the city did not do their due diligence and actually go through the main Jewish community even contacting the synagogue beforehand, you know, to just for guidance like they have like all the past mayors have, and this one did not, I just.

71
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:31,004
I found that very troubling that they, for an administration that says that they are a very inclusive administration, really did not show any inclusivity with us.

72
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:35,746
In fact, sadly, it wound up being exact opposite of it.

73
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:41,328
And I just found that very disturbing that they didn't even consult

74
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:53,197
their own people in their own congregation, their own community first, when all they had to do was make a phone call or even just like go down the street.

75
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:57,722
I just, I find that a big problem.

76
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:11,686
Yeah, I mean, I think that it is very much an afterthought, and it was, just because when I was, and I said this in my little soundbite, but it was the fourth night of Hanukkah that they held this celebration on.

77
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:21,572
There was no, in the publicity, no acknowledgement that there would be anything that might even echo Hanukkah.

78
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:25,494
So I really do think, and I don't know

79
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:48,764
I don't know what the process was, but it really did seem evident that there was no planned effort to be anything more than a Christmas celebration, or whatever, quote unquote holiday celebration with all of the trappings of Christmas, however people want to call it, right?

80
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,246
And I think that that's like,

81
00:08:52,318 --> 00:09:00,367
And I mean that's one of the main things that I that I sort of wanted to talk about or that I want to move into at some point in this conversation is like.

82
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:19,017
There is like there is a unique situation for Jews, this time of year, and in that there, you definitely see some nodding to the idea that like Jewish people could possibly celebrate something other than Christmas.

83
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:25,539
But, but I mean,

84
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:35,848
you can tell when it's done poorly or in an unthoughtful way or in a like, we're really sad that you don't celebrate Christmas.

85
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:42,010
So here, come along with us and like ring these bells and sit on Santa Claus's lap, you know?

86
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:54,995
So I think that like, that like, that's one piece that really got me is, I feel like I'm reliving the eighties in New Jersey as like my childhood.

87
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:58,504
Because like you would see the same thing, right?

88
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:01,787
It's as if there's no progress that has been made.

89
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:17,123
So here Medford is holding their quote unquote holiday celebration, which by all indications, there's a Christmas tree sale, there's a wreath sale, there's pictures with Santa, like it's on the fourth night of Hanukkah.

90
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:37,266
And like, I get it, like Hanukkah moves around from year to year, fine, you don't always need to know, but like, you're having it like, on like December, whatever that was, December 3rd, December 2nd, whatever it is, Christmas is four weeks away, and like, you're having Christmas celebration.

91
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:45,809
So on one hand, I would say, okay, Medford's having a Christmas celebration because they're doing things the way they've always done them.

92
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:50,356
And that's how Medford is, it likes to do things the way that it's always done them.

93
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,218
Medford doesn't like new traditions.

94
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:54,080
Medford doesn't like new people.

95
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,565
I'm hardly a legitimate Medford resident because I've only lived here for five and a half years, right?

96
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:02,187
And so like, I don't know.

97
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:09,995
So I think that, I think my point is that this is not uncommon to see

98
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:16,066
a Christmas celebration labeled as a holiday celebration.

99
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:21,790
And it's not uncommon to see this like very thoughtless afterthought, not uncommon.

100
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:23,692
It wasn't uncommon in the 80s.

101
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:25,573
It wasn't uncommon in the 90s.

102
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:27,775
It wasn't uncommon in the 2000s.

103
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,777
Now we're in 20, almost 2022.

104
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:34,220
It's still, you know, it still is the way it is.

105
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,922
And it doesn't have to be that way because we know better.

106
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:59,860
Well, under two mayors ago, they used to have a nice silver tall menorah with blue lights and they would light up a light each night.

107
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,142
And I'm wondering where that went.

108
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:05,164
That's a very good question.

109
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:15,034
Cause I haven't seen since that mayor retired or went somewhere else.

110
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:17,175
Yeah.

111
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:29,060
Well, it sounds like, you know what I'm hearing is like this, like it's a Christmas celebration labeled a holiday celebration and an attempt to be symbolically inclusive in some way.

112
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

113
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,141
Yeah.

114
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:32,201
Yeah.

115
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,983
And it, it, in my opinion,

116
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:48,297
that failed miserably on the Hanukkah, tiny menorah that wasn't, it was like an afterthought.

117
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:59,465
And we're not, we as a community of Jews, of religious individuals and a community are not an afterthought.

118
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:04,428
We've been here historically

119
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:23,008
There's a community of us, you know, we've got the temple and the Tufts Hillel and the Tufts Chabad for quite a while.

120
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:32,670
It's in Medford, so it's not like we're newcomers or outsiders.

121
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:34,924
Right.

122
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:38,446
And even if we were, we should demand inclusion.

123
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,047
And I think that that's the other piece.

124
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:40,807
Right.

125
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:45,690
And that's like, I think that that's the piece that is, that is quite hard to summit.

126
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,170
Right.

127
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:53,714
That, that there's, it really does seem like there's only one culture that matters and whatever.

128
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:55,494
I don't, I don't know how to label that culture.

129
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:55,775
Right.

130
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:56,835
I'm not exactly sure.

131
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:02,418
It's like what Medford has been, it seems for a very long time and what

132
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:12,432
those with loud voices or those in City Hall, it's a vision that people want to preserve.

133
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:30,200
And it's a vision that is very narrow and that might say, we welcome all people from all over the world, from all religions and races and sexual orientations and genders and da, da, da, da, da.

134
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,441
And it's like one thing to say that, that that's your vision.

135
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:41,203
And then it's another thing to really evaluate where you are with respect to that vision and actually do something about it.

136
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:42,283
Yep.

137
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,864
And that's and we're stuck in that spot right now.

138
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,965
Because that may be a vision.

139
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:50,387
But like, we are very far from that vision.

140
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:57,590
Doesn't feel like it doesn't feel like we're living up to it.

141
00:14:59,211 --> 00:14:59,671
provision.

142
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:08,118
Yeah, like I think one thing that I've taken away from like a lot of conversations over the last couple of years is like how uncomfortable it is to confront some of those things, right?

143
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,982
Like, this is the thing that this is like the status quo here in Medford.

144
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:19,127
And like, in order to actually be inclusive, we have to look at what we're doing, that's like not including those people or even erasing some of those identities, right?

145
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:24,051
And, and that sounds like, and I think, you know, that it does expose a lot of cracks.

146
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,133
And those are important to figure out.

147
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,235
And I think it's a, you know, I think

148
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:34,339
I often see a lot of resistance to that because we don't want to admit what we aren't doing well.

149
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:40,263
Well, I mean, honestly, change of any kind is always hard, right?

150
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:43,365
I mean, it's never easy, no matter what it is in life.

151
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:57,214
But that being said, as Shira and Susan have both espoused on, it really comes down to

152
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:01,147
making this a really inclusive community.

153
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:08,472
One other thing I did not mention, too, that I also did raise with concern.

154
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:21,939
I mean, the non-Menorah display also included display of two other religions and or cultures, depending on how you look at it.

155
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,545
And so it had Christmas represented there as a Christmas tree.

156
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,908
And then it also had the canara there for Kwanzaa.

157
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:46,097
So, I mean, I don't even begin to be an expert on either of those things, but, you know, I did question, so what is the,

158
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:50,919
what was the information that was put out about Kwanzaa?

159
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:51,760
Was that correct?

160
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,801
Was it not?

161
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:54,242
That's what my husband said.

162
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:58,085
Did they ask anybody who knew a thing about Kwanzaa?

163
00:16:58,145 --> 00:16:58,385
Right.

164
00:16:58,425 --> 00:16:59,766
That's what I was wondering.

165
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:00,647
Did they ask?

166
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:02,348
Was that information correct?

167
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:03,749
Did they ask anyone?

168
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:08,253
And then I did see actually all the aftermath of all this.

169
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,895
I saw one person who mentioned

170
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:35,381
Um, that using a Christmas tree as the symbol for Christmas was like she was greatly offended and because she said, that's not you know you should have a crush, if you're going to have a real to symbol for the holiday because that's what it really is all about that Christmas trees nice to but that's not really the main symbol of it.

171
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:54,763
Um, which I found kind of interesting and of course it was a whole conversation that's gone on since then about separation of church and state which I actually 100% agree with, I don't really think any of this religious, any single religion should have any representation.

172
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:58,626
in city or in government.

173
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:04,187
To have a celebration, a holiday celebration, I'm all for.

174
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:08,828
You know, it's wintertime, it's December, it's the darkest time of the year.

175
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:23,212
Having a lot of just really lovely lights with no religious underlying tones to it, I think would be wonderful.

176
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:23,433
And

177
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:37,395
no matter what religion, culture you practice belong with, it would be inclusive to everyone and everyone would feel comfortable there.

178
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:46,523
I mean, I honestly, the only two times I've ever gone to City Hall for any of these holiday events was because I was selling art a couple of times.

179
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:49,826
Other than that, I've never gone because I've never,

180
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:52,088
I haven't felt comfortable.

181
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:59,672
And because of the whole religious undertones and a religion that I don't practice.

182
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:04,114
So, and again, I don't feel like it should be there.

183
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:07,215
I mean, there is such a thing as separation of church and state.

184
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:07,796
So.

185
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:11,217
I would like to say something about that.

186
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,938
And I'm really glad you mentioned that.

187
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:18,201
I mean, that's, and I think that that's like, it's a hard topic for a lot of people.

188
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:35,753
again, because there has been this emergence of church and state in this sort of very implicit way for, like, my parents grew up, like, saying a prayer that wasn't a Jewish prayer in public school every day.

189
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:41,897
Like, and so, and so, like, that might've been more explicit and they were kind of exempted from it.

190
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:47,641
But, you know, like, there've been these very implicit emergences of emergent,

191
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:52,557
connection of church and state in the public schools forever.

192
00:19:53,498 --> 00:20:06,586
And you know, like we used to sing lots of songs about Jesus in chorus in public school in New Jersey in the 80s and 90s.

193
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:11,409
And you know, and it was okay, because we sang a song about Hanukkah.

194
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:12,429
And

195
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,364
And, and, you know, and I think that this is something that is, that is very hard to separate.

196
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:29,950
Um, you know, I think it's, I think a separation of church and state is necessary because I don't want my kids doing Christmas things in public school.

197
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:33,753
I don't want my kids doing Easter things in public school.

198
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:40,577
Um, I don't think that they should have to, and I don't think that they should have to self exempt if they're not comfortable with it.

199
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,299
Um, I don't think my, my,

200
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:57,290
My first grader and my fourth grader should have an art activity in class that is making ornaments, you know, like, I mean sure like we can hang them somewhere else but there's this implicit thing that what is an ornament for and so.

201
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:09,600
So I think that this just becomes a problem in that it's very hard for those in a majority culture to parse out what is religion versus what is culture.

202
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:22,812
And I think that that was something that Reverend Wendy spoke to in her statement about the Not Manohara incident, where she said, it's very hard for us to see

203
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:32,973
To see beyond the lens, I am going to be miss paraphrasing her but like it's very hard for us to see beyond the lens that we were given.

204
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:38,442
And I think that that is that that is the case, it is very hard for a majority culture.

205
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:44,867
to understand when things could possibly be alienating to others who are not in that majority.

206
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:50,771
And I think that that's when you defer to those who are not in the majority and say, how's this making you feel?

207
00:21:51,791 --> 00:22:04,298
Or you say, we are deciding not to do this because we understand how this makes those in the minority feel, or the position that it puts those in the minority into.

208
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:09,947
So, you know, and also like don't get me wrong I love the school.

209
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:19,751
I love the teachers, but it's it's a fact of life being a Jew in a place where, where you're not the majority that these things are just normal and it's sad.

210
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,772
I don't like it.

211
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:22,793
and I don't know what to do about it.

212
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:27,617
Yep and you know it's been like that even when as a kid too growing up.

213
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:44,211
I grew up in um in western New York and I had similar experience to you with yeah so sure we could do we do Hanukkah songs too but there's also all these other Christmas songs and Christmas carols and all that and yeah they're lovely but

214
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:47,874
to a certain extent, I will tolerate it.

215
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:59,202
But after a while, I mean, to me, and not to be rude and insulting, because I'm Jewish, it gets to be a bit much after a while.

216
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,984
So I mean, every case in point.

217
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,226
So it's holiday time now.

218
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:11,011
So normally, when I'm driving around just doing errands in town, I'll have my radio on in my car.

219
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:20,650
And since just before Thanksgiving, there are now two radio stations that are all playing Christmas music, all the time.

220
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:31,939
Well if you Jewish, you know, for me, it's like, okay, a couple of Christmas carols here and there fine frosty the snowman fine, but I don't want to listen to this all the time.

221
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,224
The radio was off in my car, and I'm playing other music instead, like through my phone or whatever.

222
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:43,807
I'm not, I refuse to listen to the radio because I don't want to have to deal with that.

223
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:53,333
So it's, it's, again, not to be rude and not to be insulting to people who celebrate Christmas, but for someone who doesn't.

224
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:56,095
And I can only imagine.

225
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:57,856
I mean, here's a good question.

226
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:01,198
What do the Muslims feel like during this time of year, you know?

227
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:05,441
I mean, really, what do they, how do they cope with this?

228
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:11,767
How, you know, again, another minority, another, you know, how do they feel about this?

229
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:17,552
Because I, you know, that's another group that really, I think, should be a part of this whole conversation.

230
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:18,273
Sure.

231
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:20,875
Yeah, I'm Buddhist.

232
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,717
Yep.

233
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,442
Yeah, I mean, we have a whole

234
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,833
And all of them are in Bedford too.

235
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:37,438
I mean, why not invite them also, I think would be good to have as part of a continuing conversation on this.

236
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:38,119
Yeah.

237
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,620
It's a great idea.

238
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,382
And I don't hate Christmas.

239
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,344
I love Christmas for other people.

240
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:44,665
Like love it.

241
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:50,331
Like my three-year-old said to me this morning, which I thought was really beautiful because like

242
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,240
Cause I heard her actually stating our values.

243
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,600
She's like, no mama, we don't celebrate Christmas.

244
00:24:57,901 --> 00:24:58,561
No, we don't.

245
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,721
Other people celebrate Christmas.

246
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:01,301
Yes.

247
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,001
Yes, they do.

248
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:03,202
Yes.

249
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:05,142
Other people celebrate Christmas.

250
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:09,563
This Cohen Goldberg family, Jewish family, we don't celebrate Christmas.

251
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:10,343
Great.

252
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:16,505
So, so the thing is like, I'm not ruining your Christmas by telling you that I don't celebrate it.

253
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,225
I'm sorry.

254
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:21,306
You know, I'm not ruining your party by telling you that I'm sick and I can't come.

255
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:26,788
And I think that, or by telling you that I have whatever social phobia, it doesn't matter, right?

256
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:29,268
It's like, this is the analogy.

257
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:40,732
And so like, I'm not ruining your tradition by telling you that I do not want it force fed to me when I'm in a public location.

258
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:42,857
Sure.

259
00:25:43,178 --> 00:26:02,277
Yeah, when I think you bring up a lot of really good points about like I think what is like sort of unchecked around like what you know the impact of the dominant like culture dominant religion, and I, we talked a little bit before we started recording but if anyone wants to like think about or share like what you think would

260
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:11,870
help Medford be more authentically inclusive or moving towards a culture that is more inclusive of more people.

261
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,814
Actually listening to each other.

262
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:30,062
Actually meeting with us and actually listening

263
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:33,499
to us.

264
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:50,464
There's been all these conversations that we are having as a community to each other, you know, meetings and as a community, but we haven't

265
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:06,534
It seems like we haven't been meeting with the people in city hall.

266
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:16,538
We can actually do something.

267
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:18,178
Yeah.

268
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:20,299
Or like visibly drive the efforts.

269
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,241
I mean, I think that like city hall only goes so far, but they are the, um,

270
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:34,858
but they are the visible entity.

271
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:48,628
So there was this project that I wanted to talk about, which was that I was part of a few years back when I first moved to Medford called Medford Conversations.

272
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:51,870
And it was an incredible project.

273
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,653
I think it's now been renamed and reformatted.

274
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:56,534
I think it's Medford,

275
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:58,903
Medford Health Matters or something.

276
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:09,626
I don't know exactly, but it was this idea of like trained facilitators who were really like just normal people in the community who went through a training.

277
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:13,327
Like myself, I was one of the facilitators there.

278
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:22,391
And like the idea was that you were put into these sort of random groupings and you discussed a topic.

279
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:26,272
So the first year it was race in Medford and who belongs.

280
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:33,513
And then the next year it was, I don't know, it was something about transportation, housing and food security.

281
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:45,051
And the idea was to really sit and get to know your neighbors, to talk about something hard in a facilitated environment, and then to listen.

282
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:51,393
And I thought that that was like really an incredible effort.

283
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:58,496
And I was so, I felt like I was able to connect with so many other people, voices.

284
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,117
Like I developed this,

285
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:21,387
I worked on myself a lot during that Medford conversations because I was introduced to these new ideas and concepts and people and voices that I found very challenging and in a good way, because it helped me grow from it.

286
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:26,172
And, you know, like not on Facebook where you like get into fights and then you're like, bye.

287
00:29:26,312 --> 00:29:27,953
And then you just leave the conversation.

288
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:32,577
And I just thought that it was, it was an incredible effort.

289
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:50,670
I know that there was some involvement from the, from the, from City Hall, and like, that's, I feel like that is the kind of efforts that we want to continue to have, but in such a way that City Hall can then take it and use

290
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:57,596
their learning, use their knowledge, use their connections with the community to then do something about it.

291
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,997
That's what I was thinking of.

292
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,519
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking of.

293
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,742
But I don't know what happened to that.

294
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:13,244
Well, I think part of it right now, of course, COVID happened for some of it.

295
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:20,428
And then there was also a change in mayor too, which, so I'm not sure if,

296
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:24,729
But it may have changed and then COVID happened.

297
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:31,673
So I think that that may have been part of it, why it hasn't continued.

298
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:38,137
But I do remember that because I was, I actually sat part of those two and they were fabulous conversations, loved it.

299
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:46,560
loved it and just really very interesting conversations to have with people you wouldn't necessarily have known beforehand.

300
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:55,823
I'm also really positive and just very, yeah, I mean, a very good thing and just to have that continuation.

301
00:30:56,263 --> 00:31:00,625
And I don't know because unfortunately because numbers are going up again now whether

302
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:18,801
Whether there's a way to do that, and just do it via zoom and have like some breakout rooms or something like that and do it that way to keep you know to get it started again I think, you know, at least for now until it's safe that we can all be, you know, safely meet and, and chat in person again.

303
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:22,885
You know, I think it's totally possible.

304
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,566
And I think it would be excellent to do that.

305
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:28,648
And I totally forgot about the Medford conversation till you brought that back up.

306
00:31:28,688 --> 00:31:30,769
It's like, oh yeah, I mean, that was fabulous.

307
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:31,449
I loved it.

308
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:34,150
It was like a formative experience for me.

309
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,892
I can't even say, there I was 40 and like had just moved to Medford.

310
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:46,656
And like, I just, I went through this growth spurt of like getting to know different people and getting to know different ways of being and thinking.

311
00:31:48,096 --> 00:31:48,597
And you know, yeah.

312
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:57,739
Well, it sounds like that allows for some ability to be proactive rather than what we've seen recently, just being reactive in this really awful situation.

313
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:10,147
And I've heard City Hall asking for input from residents, and that feels like a really, I mean, I think the question is, what do you do with it, or what do they do with it after that?

314
00:32:10,187 --> 00:32:14,911
But that sounds like a really great opportunity to do some of that.

315
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:15,891
Absolutely.

316
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,933
So any of you are going to start that back up again, sounds great.

317
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:34,283
You know, I also like I do think our city hall and our general like Medford governmental bodies are very understaffed and under resourced and so I think that you're also I mean just look at like.

318
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:39,972
you know, like Neil Osborne is doing the job of like three people, right?

319
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,253
Like, yeah.

320
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:54,865
Also, I mean, that's also, I think that particular position got combined because the mayor combined them, not because of understaffing necessarily.

321
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:59,849
When the new mayor came in two years ago, she, you know,

322
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:23,902
you know, because every mayor changes things up, you know, depending on how they run their, you know, their government, but she combined some offices, which is why there are, you know, fewer, some offices, in fact, the one where Neil is working, I mean, I still don't think was a good idea, because it was it was diverse.

323
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:25,503
It's diversity office.

324
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:29,205
And I mean, personally, I personally think it should be expanded, not

325
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:35,228
not shrunk and had one person doing like three different jobs and he's ahead of that as well.

326
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:52,336
So, you know, it just, it's hard enough for anyone to do one job, but then to do something that's so important, especially with all the inclusivity issues going on, which is, you know, and there's more that often should be expanded and have standalone, in my opinion, rather than, you know.

327
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:57,139
There may be a change forthcoming.

328
00:33:58,749 --> 00:33:59,550
Oh, that would be good.

329
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:06,976
But I mean, I mean, I know a lot of this too could be budget, you know, because there's always, you know, money, it's always an issue.

330
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:11,600
It's like, yeah, I mean, if they charged higher taxes, I think that we'd be in a better situation.

331
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,382
But I guess that's another property.

332
00:34:14,663 --> 00:34:15,564
That's a whole nother.

333
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:22,383
But I don't think it's all a staffing issue.

334
00:34:22,464 --> 00:34:25,305
I think it was also just a choice issue.

335
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,506
Yeah, like a prioritization.

336
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:28,406
Right.

337
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:29,867
Interesting.

338
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:46,914
So I wonder like if so, if you want to share kind of like maybe one thing that you're taking away from this experience over the last month or so, and then maybe one thing that you hope the city is taking away from witnessing this or hearing from all of you.

339
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:58,215
Well, I mean, for me, one thing I've taken away from this is that I actually have been

340
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:06,709
really liking some of the support from the non-Jewish members of the community.

341
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:15,355
And many of them just not even realizing what the big deal was until we started making noise about it.

342
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:24,621
And then once, you know, many of the non-Jewish community members are getting educated because that's what this is all about.

343
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,282
It's about educating and learning.

344
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:26,362
And

345
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:34,546
You know that's something we all do through life Lisa certainly hope we all do life is to learn and grow.

346
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:40,810
So when people have learned about really why, why it's such a big deal.

347
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:49,775
And I've had so many people tell me said oh my gosh, I had like, I mean, I knew it just seemed wrong but now that you're kind of pointing out why.

348
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:52,476
I realize why it's such a big deal.

349
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:59,538
And thank you for pointing that out and say, not not being Jewish, I wouldn't necessarily know these things.

350
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:09,681
And of course not, because, yeah, I mean, and that's fine, just like if there was something in your religion, I wouldn't necessarily understand unless it's what's explained to me.

351
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:10,861
And that's fine.

352
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:25,949
But I do find that it is heartwarming in some ways to hear that many other members of the community that's not Jewish are standing in solidarity with us and to say that, hey, this is wrong and we need to make change.

353
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,991
So I think that's excellent.

354
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:39,616
As far as what I would like to see the city do, first off, I think, Shira, your idea of Medford Conversations is an awesome one and it should get started again, honestly.

355
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:43,499
Even if we do it through Zoom, it's totally doable.

356
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,340
It's totally doable.

357
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:54,166
In some ways that might be even easier right now because you don't have to worry about, well, where's it going to be and all that, you know?

358
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:57,389
Sometimes even with a pandemic, you know, there's

359
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:03,171
That's a good thing that's come up.

360
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:16,135
But I would really like to see the city take action, not just words, and they said that they're going to do all sorts of different things they've spoken with the ATL and that's awesome.

361
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:18,776
And they're speaking with Temple Shalom and that's awesome.

362
00:37:20,397 --> 00:37:33,911
Um, and I know that from my personal response back from the mayor she had said that the staff at City Hall is going to undergo training come January, and which is great.

363
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:48,139
But I want to see, make sure that all those things are happening and that she's taking action to make, make change and make a difference, not just for the Jewish community, either.

364
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:51,200
I mean, this needs to go further than just the Jewish community.

365
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,444
This needs to go with everyone, no matter what gender, what religion, what culture.

366
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:03,230
Because we are so diverse in the city, so diverse.

367
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:09,155
And that's one of the best things about Medford, in my opinion, is our diversity.

368
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:09,715
It's awesome.

369
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:18,222
And I really hope that this is just the starting point to have all these more inclusion

370
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:25,607
and inclusion that is shown by the city, not just in words, but in action.

371
00:38:25,627 --> 00:38:32,752
Thank you.

372
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:34,833
Hey, thanks so much for saying that.

373
00:38:34,953 --> 00:38:36,274
That was amazing.

374
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:45,380
I think for me personally, a couple of takeaways, and not great, but like,

375
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,682
I think one takeaway is, I grew up in New Jersey.

376
00:38:50,702 --> 00:39:08,293
Yes, we have this ridiculous way of having to celebrate Christmas in public school, but I grew up with a certain amount of privilege that Jews are visible, Jewish people are everywhere, like tri-state area, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

377
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,414
New York City is the center of that.

378
00:39:10,494 --> 00:39:12,015
There's a ton of Jewish people.

379
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:15,177
And that's how I carry myself around thinking,

380
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:38,365
oh my god how could people be so ignorant like like this whole thing with the with the not menorah like like did you go did you graduate from high school like did you know anybody who was jewish like but but i think that i that i um that i that i carry around this privilege that like judaism is is like a well-known

381
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:47,668
present and, and, you know, invisible religion and, and it may, it may very well not be and so that was like sort of a new view for me.

382
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:56,134
Um, but then the other and the other on the other personal note for me is like, and this is the part to me that really matters.

383
00:39:56,774 --> 00:40:00,097
Like, I can live in the public sphere and my kids.

384
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:08,126
know my values, my kids know our family values, and we are conveying that and we are living those values.

385
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:16,515
And so, part of me is like, you know what Medford go off and do your own ignorant things, because I know who I am.

386
00:40:16,535 --> 00:40:20,760
My kids know who they are, our family knows who we are and we're fine.

387
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:38,225
You know, and so that's, it's a hard thing to grapple with, but I think bottom line, when I think about what matters most to me, it's that my family is Jewish, that my kids know their values and that we're all moving forward, you know, in this life, in that way.

388
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:42,286
So those are my personal takeaways.

389
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:46,768
And my Medford takeaway is like, I'm a systems thinker.

390
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:51,460
Um, like there are systems that exist.

391
00:40:51,520 --> 00:41:02,963
And we talked about this before we started recording, like their systems that exist in Medford that actually the mayor's office and city hall can utilize, for instance, the interfaith group coalition.

392
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:10,465
So like, if you really want to know, or if you want a spokesperson from any religion in the city.

393
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:15,719
you can actually go to the Interfaith Coalition and speak to somebody about it.

394
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:25,685
And so like, to me, it's, I think that as a takeaway, Medford meets, Medford only likes Medford things, I get that.

395
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:28,566
Fine, don't go to Somerville, don't go to Cambridge, it doesn't matter.

396
00:41:29,026 --> 00:41:34,789
But like, you have these institutions and systems within Medford.

397
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,972
So it's ridiculous not to go through those channels.

398
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,593
So I would just all things remaining equal.

399
00:41:44,154 --> 00:41:51,139
If Medford could simply use the channels that existed, then we'd be in a lot better spot than we are right now.

400
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:54,541
Thank you.

401
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:10,937
Um, inclusivity, I think they need to do much better job on inclusivity.

402
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,142
They talk a lot and they've always talked a lot.

403
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,524
It's, I've lived here for

404
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,907
26 years, 24 years, I don't know.

405
00:42:21,927 --> 00:42:22,567
Some odd years.

406
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:23,248
And it's, it's,

407
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:41,649
It's they've been talking about it for years and changes.

408
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:52,915
And, you know, we've got to change and include people and, and diversity and inclusion.

409
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:55,917
And it's a whole lot of.

410
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:57,737
This and you know, it's.

411
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm very glad to hear that the City Hall is going to do trainings and take trainings, but I'm awaiting to see what's going to happen.

412
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:31,682
Trust but verify.

413
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:33,523
Yep.

414
00:43:36,105 --> 00:44:00,934
And, you know, I'd like to see inclusion on all senses and inclusion without disabled people or people with disabilities is not really inclusion.

415
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:32,559
So we need to include all religions and races and ethnicities, all genders and sexual orientations, and it runs the gamut.

416
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:44,355
We need to really think of inclusion and immigrants and, you know.

417
00:44:47,623 --> 00:44:56,791
And the way that you all answered that question, it seems like there is like, I don't want to simplify it, but like there, like, uh, there's a method that you could draw from what you're suggesting.

418
00:44:56,831 --> 00:44:56,991
Right.

419
00:44:57,032 --> 00:45:03,878
It's like, we ask the people that this impacts, we like check in, we listen to the community and that feels like it could be like a tool that's like transferable.

420
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:04,118
Right.

421
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:07,901
So, um, you know, I appreciate those reflections.

422
00:45:08,562 --> 00:45:14,207
Um, I'm wondering if, uh, before we wrap up, if there's anything else that anybody would like to speak to or share.

423
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:21,729
I don't know.

424
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:27,613
I mean, I think I've said plenty.

425
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:37,100
So I can go back to say change isn't easy, but it's so necessary.

426
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,343
It's just so necessary.

427
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:46,127
I can say I'm hopeful for the future.

428
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:49,389
I've got to be optimistic.

429
00:45:53,470 --> 00:46:13,861
I think the more we put a human face on these things that are so challenging, and the more that we put a voice to it in a way where we can say, you are my neighbor, and I need you to understand that this is how it's affecting me.

430
00:46:13,961 --> 00:46:15,342
This is how it's hurting me.

431
00:46:15,362 --> 00:46:20,645
I want you as my neighbor to tell me if there is something

432
00:46:21,307 --> 00:46:26,011
that I can do to help you feel like you belong in Medford.

433
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:47,607
And if we can create this culture where we can actually talk to each other, where there's a culture of feedback and difficult conversation, then I can assure you that like my neighbor doesn't want me to feel like a stranger or like I don't belong in Medford.

434
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,561
None of us want that for each other.

435
00:46:51,641 --> 00:47:07,654
So I do think that the more we can, I almost had this little idea that I was going to show up at city council meetings, like literally every time they met to just like give them a little like information about Judaism.

436
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:12,137
And like, this is how I teach fourth grade Hebrew school, thought you'd want to learn this.

437
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:18,923
But I do think the more we're talking to each other, the more we can say like,

438
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:35,442
Not, you know, I'm expecting you, you was my like mayor to do like a bazillion things with very little resources, like, but we can say like you have stated that you want the citizens of Medford to

439
00:47:36,516 --> 00:47:54,367
feel as if they belong, and this is a way that you have explicitly made me feel like I am an outsider, like, if these are the conversations that we can have, then we can come to like a healing spot where, like, we can

440
00:47:55,398 --> 00:47:57,521
actually help each other feel like we belong.

441
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:01,586
So I think that that's like, I don't want to be a complainer.

442
00:48:01,606 --> 00:48:06,172
I really want to be a problem solver, all of us do here.

443
00:48:06,473 --> 00:48:13,522
And so I do think that there are ways to move forward with also very little money or, you know, lagging resources.

444
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:14,213
Hmm.

445
00:48:14,754 --> 00:48:14,954
Yeah.

446
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:18,357
And Sarah, there was something in your letter to the mayor that I kind of similar sentiment.

447
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:20,158
It felt like about like, I don't know.

448
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:24,502
I've been like thinking about this idea recently about being like a critical lover of something.

449
00:48:24,562 --> 00:48:24,702
Right.

450
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:27,885
Where like, you can be critical of something almost because you love it.

451
00:48:27,945 --> 00:48:28,065
Right.

452
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:32,488
And being able to like give that feedback to the city, to your neighbors, like to yourself.

453
00:48:32,548 --> 00:48:32,809
Right.

454
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:37,112
Like how can we make the place that we live and like a little bit better.

455
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:38,353
Right.

456
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:38,673
Yes.

457
00:48:39,194 --> 00:48:39,874
Absolutely.

458
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:41,135
Absolutely.

459
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:42,768
