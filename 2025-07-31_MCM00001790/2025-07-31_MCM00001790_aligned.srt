1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,792
All right, sounds good.

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:15,039
In that case, I call the, I believe this is still July, yes, the July 2025 Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission meeting to order.

3
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,060
Secretary, will you please call the roll?

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,141
Daniel Nizzle-Miller, chair.

5
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:20,562
Present.

6
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:23,903
Emilio Bryan, vice chair, not present.

7
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,565
Bruce Kulik, secretary, present.

8
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:28,245
Jared Powell.

9
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:29,146
Present.

10
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:30,677
Bernie Muneer.

11
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:35,358
You are muted.

12
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:36,258
I see you.

13
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:38,438
Noam Uveni.

14
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:41,399
Not present.

15
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,499
Mary Kate Gustafson.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,160
Present.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,040
Right.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,420
You are listed as someone else, right?

19
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:52,081
Leah Grodstein.

20
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:53,981
Not present.

21
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,001
Rebecca Wright.

22
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:56,001
Here.

23
00:00:57,322 --> 00:00:57,962
Adam Shire.

24
00:00:57,982 --> 00:00:59,202
Present.

25
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:02,369
Chris Stivers, is that Stivers or Stivers?

26
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,732
Stivers, present.

27
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,114
Chris Stivers, thank you.

28
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:06,477
Anna Renkers?

29
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:07,399
Present.

30
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:12,148
Okay, we have a quorum and we can proceed with the July meeting.

31
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:17,826
Bruce, I have a quick announcement.

32
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:30,555
I believe Lisa's son, who might be on your list, responded to me and told me that she is no longer interested in being part of the Medford... Yes, I was on that thread.

33
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:31,956
I received it and I removed her.

34
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:33,117
Okay, great.

35
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:35,259
I don't ever listen to you in the minutes either.

36
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:36,800
Okay, perfect.

37
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:40,896
Sorry.

38
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:43,059
Guest introductions are next.

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:43,780
Yep.

40
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:48,707
I think we have a guest, Paul Morgan.

41
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:49,368
Yep.

42
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,210
Hi, I'm Paul Morgan.

43
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,395
Are you a Medford resident?

44
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:56,945
No, I'm a resident of Somerville.

45
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:15,778
I'm on the Somerville version of this committee and, um, I'm here just in case there's any time to talk about a ride that I'm going to organize, which is going to promote the Clippership connector, but I may have to leave because, um, my two kids, my wife's out to dinner.

46
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:18,100
So, and I have two kids here, so I don't know.

47
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,640
Okay.

48
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,341
We will have announcements coming up shortly.

49
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:23,683
I think we'll be able to figure in, uh, briefly in that period.

50
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:24,344
Okay.

51
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,331
Yeah, Bruce, we've got an agenda item for that.

52
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:34,734
It's the 740 thing, but maybe if you all are okay with it, we might be able to shift it.

53
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,376
We might be able to shift it forward and after the announcements.

54
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:44,079
Would anyone, after the announcements, perhaps someone wants to enter a motion to move that forward for Paul?

55
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:44,519
So moved.

56
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:45,519
Okay.

57
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,720
Anyone seconded?

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,260
Seconded.

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,161
Okay.

60
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,081
All in favor?

61
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:50,282
Aye.

62
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:50,802
Aye.

63
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,495
Uh, I opposed who seconded it.

64
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:56,717
I think you're right.

65
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:57,097
Thank you.

66
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:01,620
Sorry, opposed.

67
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:06,223
Okay, hearing none, I say the eyes have it.

68
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:09,145
We will move that to immediately after announcements.

69
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:17,154
Okay, announcements, I guess, in that case.

70
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,535
No, approval of minutes.

71
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:21,896
Oh, I'm sorry, skipped over that.

72
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:24,078
Approval of minutes.

73
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:26,119
Do I hear a motion to approve?

74
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,400
I did see one note that you had in there, Bruce.

75
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,301
Yes, so moved.

76
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:32,542
We can discuss that after the second.

77
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:35,403
Okay, do I hear a second?

78
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:36,924
Aye.

79
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:40,006
Okay, I hear a second from Mary Kate.

80
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:42,087
All in favor?

81
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:43,729
No, not yet, we gotta discuss.

82
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:53,874
The problem I've got, somehow or another, I neglected to retain the record of who attended last week's meeting.

83
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:58,577
I think because I was paying attention to the new people.

84
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:06,241
And so I just wanted to go around the room and recall who was actually present at the meeting.

85
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:09,083
Daniel, did you recall that you were here?

86
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,802
Uh, I was here.

87
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,165
I'm trying to remember all the names off the top of my head.

88
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:16,286
Emily was here.

89
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:20,228
Uh, here she was here.

90
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,150
Yep.

91
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,611
Mary Kate was not here.

92
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,271
Is that true?

93
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:24,792
Mary Kate?

94
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:27,574
I was not there.

95
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:28,274
You were not there.

96
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:28,594
Okay.

97
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:28,955
Thank you.

98
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,117
Rebecca and Ernie was late.

99
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,540
Jeopardy.

100
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:41,164
I was, I was here first.

101
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:43,546
Anna, were you here?

102
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:44,827
No, I wasn't.

103
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:45,767
You were not okay.

104
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,549
And I think no one was here, wasn't he?

105
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:52,512
I think I recall him being here.

106
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:53,953
You do or you don't?

107
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:56,915
I believe I recall him being there.

108
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:59,337
And Adam, I don't think you were here at the last meeting.

109
00:04:59,357 --> 00:04:59,918
Is that correct?

110
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:00,878
No, I was there.

111
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:01,719
Oh, you were.

112
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:01,979
Okay.

113
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:02,299
Thank you.

114
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,242
And Chris, you were there, right?

115
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:05,362
Yeah.

116
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:07,605
And Rebecca, you already said you were.

117
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,066
All right, thank you so much for all that.

118
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:16,067
And I think we had two guests, Caitlin Robinson and Simon Alcindor.

119
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,388
Anyone recall anyone else?

120
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,309
OK, that is it.

121
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,750
Otherwise, I am good and we can proceed to approve the minutes.

122
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,991
OK, in that case, moving back to all in favor.

123
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:33,032
Aye.

124
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:33,712
Aye.

125
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:34,372
Aye.

126
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:36,159
All opposed?

127
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:40,924
Okay, hearing none, motion passes, minutes are approved.

128
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:43,708
All right.

129
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:48,393
I guess moving on to announcements.

130
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,023
ClipperShip Connector is officially open.

131
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:54,744
I'm sure we've all seen that.

132
00:05:55,725 --> 00:06:01,932
There are a couple of final things that are being finished up there, but it is open to access.

133
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:14,023
I believe that the Contraflow lane on Mystic Valley, or sorry, Riverside Ave has been officially approved by the city.

134
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:27,013
It will most likely go out to bid, I believe, next year and then will probably be constructed near the year after that in conjunction with the main street redesign that is going through MassDOT.

135
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,507
So that is all I have there.

136
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:35,229
I'm sure we can cover that a little bit more later on with Paul.

137
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,811
Bruce, would you like to cover the landline Mystic Ride recap?

138
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,952
Yeah, there were about 50 people there.

139
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,173
It was really well attended.

140
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:53,298
We started down in Assembly Row in the park there with the steel uprights and rode up one side of the river.

141
00:06:54,597 --> 00:07:06,964
and examined exactly what we were talking about, crossing Main Street and coming across the Clippership and actually rode, formally rode the Clippership on the first opening day.

142
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:11,626
Was able to work our way down through it.

143
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:13,787
And let's see, then what did we do?

144
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:19,591
We worked our way up, basically on Revere Beach Parkway.

145
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:21,812
And let's see if anyone will...

146
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:37,382
Revere Beach Parkway, and then up along the Northern Strand Trail until, and we stopped at the bike kitchen, which I was actually quite impressed with.

147
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:44,807
It's a couple of containers that have bicycle tools and some spare parts and is occasionally staffed by volunteers.

148
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:46,769
So that was quite interesting.

149
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,773
And then we made our way over to Idle Hands.

150
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,674
and had a good social time.

151
00:07:55,314 --> 00:08:02,795
So it was a good fun Mystic ride and I do recommend if you're able to make it next year, they do this every year.

152
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,037
And there are also other landline rides that are of interest.

153
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:12,958
There will be another one tomorrow leaving from downtown Boston.

154
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,179
is the North Station area going up to Salem.

155
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:23,880
So that's going to be a pretty aggressive ride to look at some of the paths and so forth that are going on there.

156
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,220
So I'm looking forward to that if we don't get rained out tomorrow.

157
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,601
How does one get clued into these rides?

158
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:39,903
It's put on by the MAPC, which is the Metropolitan Area Planning Council.

159
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:41,923
They have a website.

160
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:52,269
And I don't remember if I was specifically placed on a list or whether I was able to subscribe myself.

161
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:57,492
But let me make a note to look up that information for you.

162
00:08:57,512 --> 00:08:58,173
All right.

163
00:08:58,193 --> 00:08:58,493
Thanks.

164
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:10,025
All right, yeah, so that's that.

165
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:21,473
And then the other announcement I wanted to make is that we will be reviewing the MBAC goals later in the meeting, just so we have enough time to really talk about it.

166
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:25,877
Sounds good.

167
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:35,961
All right.

168
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:46,445
With that, I believe we have moved the clipper ship connector forward.

169
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:53,827
Sorry, I haven't had a chance to look over this yet.

170
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,488
Clipper ship connector access.

171
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,588
Sorry, Daniel.

172
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:01,790
I think the thing we moved forward was the 740 fall family bike ride.

173
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,450
That's correct.

174
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,731
Oh, I'm sorry.

175
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:08,093
I have connector access.

176
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:09,574
Related topics, right?

177
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,676
So that was why Paul is here.

178
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:14,337
Perfect.

179
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:18,100
Paul, would you like to give a preface to this?

180
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:28,390
Oh yeah, so I'm part of a group that organizes rides marketed to families with children.

181
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:35,173
And we're working on our fifth annual Halloween ride.

182
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,735
The Halloween rides tend to be in the 300 to 400 person range.

183
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:40,135
They rotate.

184
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:46,777
around.

185
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:48,657
They don't repeat the same routes.

186
00:10:50,018 --> 00:11:03,920
This fall we want to highlight the Clippership Connector, promote awareness of it, and we're working on permitting for that and planning for that as we speak.

187
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:13,562
And the structure of the event is a gathering spot where there's bike-to-bike trick-or-treating

188
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:20,309
The attendees bring their own candy and then the kids go around to the different bikes and people do trick-or-treating.

189
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,077
There's a costume walk.

190
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:33,384
And then we start a ride, which is very conservatively planned.

191
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:43,819
with as few auto crossings as possible and as marshaled as possible, often with police details.

192
00:11:44,929 --> 00:12:01,432
And then we end at another location where there is play that might be a combination of a playground, our own play equipment, some crafts activities that we have some craft stations, and sometimes some musical entertainment.

193
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:03,913
It's sort of like a mini festival.

194
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:10,694
So if anyone's interested in being involved in this, either in planning or volunteering on the day of,

195
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:30,649
It's a fun event and a good way to promote awareness of the infrastructure that's along the Mystic River to people who are not like us, who are not heavily clued into what's happening in this world.

196
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,250
So that's about it.

197
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,831
Is that October 31st?

198
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,552
Is that Halloween?

199
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:39,195
No, Sunday morning, October 19th.

200
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:41,326
Okay, thank you.

201
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:42,106
Just for the notes.

202
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:45,068
A permit spending.

203
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,753
Exactly what permits do you need for a ride of this nature?

204
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:54,615
I wasn't aware that in Massachusetts, permits were actually required.

205
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:57,638
I know if you want to get police detail, that's a different thing.

206
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:58,858
Maybe that's what you mean?

207
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,702
Well, we are at a public park and we have 400 people.

208
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,905
It's hard to see how that doesn't require a permit.

209
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:20,188
I mean, I know that there are Boston Park Party doesn't do permits and that's great, but I don't see how I can get away with that.

210
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:28,950
And we often have food, in this case, trick-or-treating doesn't require permit, but we often have in our summer ride.

211
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,650
We have ice cream.

212
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:34,972
9 a.m.

213
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:43,239
So just as a matter of course, we get permits from the towns and in this case also DCR.

214
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,041
Okay, that's fine.

215
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,603
I'm just curious about that.

216
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:58,451
One other question is I saw on a thread that you had said something about the Arlington start site was not going to be in effect.

217
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:00,733
What happened there?

218
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:14,610
We had wanted to start at, uh, Waldo park in Arlington and, uh, Arlington staff have, um, told us that that is not going to be doable.

219
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,132
Um, and I don't have enough time to lay the groundwork to make that work.

220
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:22,913
So, um, I need to move on.

221
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:28,295
And, um, so we're potentially going to start at either deal boy or.

222
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:49,415
Condon shell, and I don't want to speak in a public forum too much about the pros and cons of each 1 of those locations, but there are some and then are in location was going to be a Mr. mystic riverbend park, but we may move it to assembly square.

223
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:53,337
I haven't decided yet.

224
00:14:53,377 --> 00:14:53,798
This is all.

225
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:55,819
sort of happened today.

226
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:07,764
I had my dream route for about a year, and I'm having to regroup based on my starting location not being an option.

227
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:15,668
So I'm going to figure out something else, but it's going to highlight the Clippership Connector and some Mystic River Pass nevertheless.

228
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,250
And what do you need specifically from us?

229
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,205
Um, right now I'm doing well on Medford permitting.

230
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:35,970
I figured out, um, who I needed to talk to for the most part.

231
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:41,694
And I need, uh, you know, if I, if I get stalled,

232
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:52,851
Then I might need help with some escalations if I'm not getting a response to emails or whatnot.

233
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,679
But right now, it's not a problem.

234
00:16:02,152 --> 00:16:03,133
Gotcha.

235
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:08,698
Paul, you can escalate those to me if needed.

236
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,281
I can... hold on.

237
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:23,232
I will send you my personal email if you do happen to need it, and I can

238
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:31,177
Um, try and follow up with the city of Medford if you're having issues there.

239
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:35,584
And I can loop in the rest of them back if needed.

240
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:37,628
Jared, sorry, go ahead.

241
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,545
Well, that's fine.

242
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:49,770
I just wanted to say for anyone who is unfamiliar with these events or the work that Paul does, it is an amazing event.

243
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,031
It is not to be missed.

244
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,072
We should absolutely be a part of it.

245
00:16:55,133 --> 00:17:01,115
The work that he puts into this, along with the volunteers, is ungodly in its scale.

246
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:03,036
There is so much work that goes into this.

247
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:09,939
He's a huge contributor to building awareness of biking in the region and infrastructure.

248
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,901
It's a big boon to all the kids who are going to grow up and see how normal it is to ride everywhere.

249
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:20,703
It's a big benefit to the city to get people who are predominantly

250
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:31,053
I would expect on this particular ride, probably not from Medford, though there'd probably be an arty portion, but lots of people from outside of Medford come to these rides, or outside of the point of origin come to these rides.

251
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:40,361
And we should, as many of us as possible, should volunteer to help with marshalling and all that kind of stuff to make sure that

252
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,864
crossings are safe and whatnot.

253
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:47,650
I've been a part of several of these rides as a participant and a marshal once.

254
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,831
Bruce, you did too.

255
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,293
And Mary-Kate, I think you did as well.

256
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:52,896
It's so much fun.

257
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:54,117
It's really great.

258
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:59,944
And it's a really good time to get our elected officials to be a part of it too and let them see all the

259
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:09,709
all the voters and the wallets that come riding into the city, you know, ready to spend their dollars in our lovely city.

260
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:12,250
So that's my spiel.

261
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,431
We should get behind this strongly.

262
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:18,353
What I'd love to hear is when people say to me like, oh, I didn't know how to get here.

263
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:21,094
I didn't know this path was here.

264
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:25,856
And then, you know, once they know, then they'll do it again and they'll tell their friends about it.

265
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,397
And so we're looking for a repeat.

266
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:36,209
Repeat trips from people going on these rides or even if they don't go on the ride, they'll see the map about it and just builds awareness.

267
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:38,613
So just in case I missed it.

268
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:42,319
Do you have an approximate time from and until.

269
00:18:44,919 --> 00:19:00,666
uh gathering starting at 9 departing at 10 a.m uh the ride lasting from about 10 to 10 45 or 11 a lot of times a lot of waiting um and then about a hour

270
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:12,514
an hour of play at the destination, maybe two hours.

271
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:20,723
It'll start petering out after an hour or so because people have already had the front end trick-or-treating time.

272
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:25,930
So about like 9 to 12-ish or something like that.

273
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:26,849
Okay.

274
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:27,689
Sounds good.

275
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:32,811
Um, just so people know what they can or can't, uh, can't sign up for.

276
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:39,752
I assume that marshals, if needed, could, uh, just be present for the ride portion.

277
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:40,753
Okay.

278
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:41,433
Great.

279
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:48,374
Um, just, just so that we know, just in case anyone here is only available during certain hours of the day.

280
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:51,155
Yeah.

281
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:52,335
Awesome.

282
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,096
Thank you very much.

283
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,547
And we appreciate that you are putting this on going through Medford.

284
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:03,850
Thank you so much.

285
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:05,471
Oh, thanks.

286
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,091
We're excited.

287
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,072
Should be fun.

288
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,253
Good luck choosing and finding some destinations.

289
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:16,257
If you need to talk about any of that, I mean, you know them better than anybody probably, but, you know, happy to chat about those options.

290
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:17,618
All right.

291
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:17,858
Great.

292
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:18,178
Thank you.

293
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:48,613
um and i'm not uh i we will have a couple of meetings before that uh ride so we can probably nail down who can or can't show up for that but um we could possibly put uh an agenda item for uh yeah i guess or we'll only have one more meeting but i guess we could put an agenda item on uh bruce for next month just to see if uh

294
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:52,055
Who can commit to those dates if people can't commit?

295
00:20:53,356 --> 00:21:01,602
We may end up with police at the auto crossings, but we might need people to just stand at forks to make sure people don't get lost.

296
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:08,627
So, if they're not comfortable, stop being a crossing guard, then there's things like that.

297
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:08,787
So.

298
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:16,111
I'd like to point out it's a great idea to have people at strategic points even along the route.

299
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:26,224
I know last year there was actually a key point that in retrospect we could have done better with right where we made the very sharp

300
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:30,410
I should say hard right turn to go under the Route 16 bridge.

301
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:41,578
Traffic had to slow down and there was one collision without any serious injury, but the potential could have been there for a little bit more of a pileup.

302
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:53,947
So I think one of the things we should consider is actually running the route and making sure that there aren't places that could be of that ilk.

303
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,509
I'm thinking, for example,

304
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:58,419
Where am I thinking where they might be?

305
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,405
Any place where you're crossing and queuing up, stopping, that kind of area is right for it.

306
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,969
You were going to come from Arlington, but I guess if you go from Delaware, we might still.

307
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,090
Cool.

308
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:19,755
I would love it if anybody wants to do some rides with me and go over the personnel planning.

309
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,516
That would be awesome.

310
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:22,937
Yeah.

311
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:24,718
I'd be willing to do that.

312
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,881
you can make a note, put an email for me so I know when you're planning to do it.

313
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:36,023
Thanks.

314
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:36,604
Perfect.

315
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:45,607
And also feel free to send me an email if you need to coordinate with the commission here, Paul.

316
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:50,069
I can forward things and or send mail on your behalf.

317
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,690
You can also reach out to us at, what was that?

318
00:22:54,303 --> 00:23:02,628
Medford Bicycle Commission at gmail.com if you need to reach us.

319
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,612
I think it's medfordbikes at gmail.com.

320
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:09,392
I'm sorry.

321
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,433
Medfordbikes at gmail.com.

322
00:23:11,754 --> 00:23:12,234
Thank you, Bruce.

323
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:21,331
OK, I think we've covered that.

324
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,753
Paul, thank you very much.

325
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:30,445
Unless you have anything else, feel free to take care of any other business you have in your personal life.

326
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:32,348
We appreciate you coming in.

327
00:23:36,702 --> 00:23:39,383
All right, let's see, go through that.

328
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:44,086
So I guess the next order of business would be the farmer's market recap.

329
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:49,108
Bruce, if you have any statements there, let me know.

330
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:53,070
I can also cover in at the later point of this.

331
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:55,898
It was pretty straightforward.

332
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:00,099
You know, we show up, we put the table up, and people come by and we chat.

333
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:10,581
I think we're still missing some good collateral to hand out, and we need to figure out kind of how to do that better, just so we have something.

334
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:18,743
Ernie eventually showed up with some bike lights at my request, and we were able to hand out some of them.

335
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:22,604
I have an agenda item later about helmets.

336
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:23,584
We'll discuss it there.

337
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:28,439
And that's basically it.

338
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,582
We talked to a handful of people, and I had to leave about 6.30-ish.

339
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,924
So I'm not quite sure if anything exciting happened after that.

340
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:39,846
But we had like three people at the table at all times.

341
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:41,507
So it was good.

342
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:45,149
Oh, there was also a ride.

343
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:46,370
Maybe Emily wants to know.

344
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,490
Emily's not here.

345
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:51,853
Was anyone else involved in the Clippership ride?

346
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:54,190
that came to the farmer's market?

347
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,831
I believe that was Leah, but she is not present.

348
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:58,992
She's not here either, OK.

349
00:25:00,352 --> 00:25:12,238
Well, they arranged a ride, and I think there was about a dozen people, kids and adults, that showed up at the market having ridden on the new Minuteman, the new Clippership Connector.

350
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:18,821
Yep, that's I got a quick recap from Leah.

351
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:31,357
It sounds like there were a couple of tense moments along Riverside Ave with the crossing, so I think that just reinforces for us that we do need to

352
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:41,326
press the city to not delay on perhaps choosing a bid and moving forward with construction in the next year.

353
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:45,610
Let's see, other items to note.

354
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,073
Yes, I mean, I was there as well with you, Bruce.

355
00:25:49,794 --> 00:25:51,936
I think there was good attendance there.

356
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:53,917
I agree that our materials are getting low.

357
00:25:53,937 --> 00:25:54,298
I think it might

358
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:12,233
makes sense for us to put together possibly a working group to come up with a couple of new items to both print out and possibly some new signage.

359
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:26,686
I know that our budget might be relatively limited, but if we come up with a couple of items that we need, I can probably go to the city and make a request for the budget for those items, or we can otherwise find a way to sort of fit those in.

360
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:33,908
So I agree with you, things are kind of sparse as things stand.

361
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:39,409
So that's all I have really to add into that.

362
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:51,872
If there aren't any other additions to that, Hormel Stadium follow-up?

363
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,986
I don't know.

364
00:26:55,786 --> 00:27:00,288
Should we do a working group like you're suggesting, Daniel?

365
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:08,912
As chair, I cannot raise that, but if you would like to make a motion for that.

366
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:15,455
As a new member, I'm still getting the lay of the land.

367
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:20,557
All you do is say, I'd like to move that we, and then you say what you'd like us to do.

368
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:26,886
I would like to move that we create a working group to replenish our supplies.

369
00:27:28,127 --> 00:27:29,870
Do I hear a second?

370
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,611
I hear a second.

371
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:31,532
All in favor?

372
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:33,194
Aye.

373
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:34,796
All opposed?

374
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:39,696
All right, hearing none, we will create a working group.

375
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:45,217
Is there anyone who would like to join this working group specifically?

376
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:50,759
I am not sure how city commissions work.

377
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:58,741
I'm not sure that I can directly be on this working group if I am going to bring this to the mayor for a budget request.

378
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,261
I do see Adam there.

379
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,842
Yeah, I could be on it.

380
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:04,422
Yeah, I'll help.

381
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,533
OK, so I see Chris, Bruce, Adam.

382
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:13,016
The only requirement on this is that we cannot have a quorum.

383
00:28:13,077 --> 00:28:14,838
So if anyone else would like to join.

384
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:17,488
Okay.

385
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:20,330
So we cannot have a quorum on the working group?

386
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:21,451
Correct.

387
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:28,637
I'll go over this a little bit later, but a working group cannot have a quorum because then it'd be a meeting.

388
00:28:29,237 --> 00:28:29,778
Exactly.

389
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:41,447
So a working group has to be less than a quorum and they can come back and bring their suggestions to the meeting for a vote, or sorry, to the entire commission for a vote at a meeting.

390
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:44,750
So that is the way it currently works.

391
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:50,254
So three does not make a quorum, and that is enough for a working group.

392
00:28:50,294 --> 00:29:00,321
So if there are no other hands, I guess in that case, Bruce, do we need to have a separate vote on the actual members?

393
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,563
No, I don't think we've ever done that.

394
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:04,865
I think we just, you know, we create the group and

395
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,538
and then the three of us will decide who should chair it.

396
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:13,427
It's pretty informal, that's why it's just a working group and not a quorum.

397
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,236
In that case, let's put that together then for Bruce, Chris, and Adam.

398
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,437
Cool.

399
00:29:21,837 --> 00:29:24,159
Thank you very much for offering to do that.

400
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,901
We've needed to do this for a little while.

401
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:34,007
So come to us with whatever recommendations that you have, and we will see how things can work with the budget that we have.

402
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:37,110
It is not that much, but I can possibly make a request

403
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:46,954
I, uh, Daniel, I don't know if Dennis, you might know what our budget is, but I feel like we don't spend it when we've got it usually.

404
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:47,274
Right.

405
00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:59,883
Like I think we should be spending it or in theory, we'd be spending it on bike lights, but, uh, Ernie gets those made up, I think, out of the city's budget through, through donations from corporate entities and whatnot.

406
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:02,024
So we might be sitting pretty, I don't know.

407
00:30:02,044 --> 00:30:05,067
I will check on the number right now and get back to you.

408
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:08,269
Tell us more at the, uh, at his slot.

409
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:13,037
Awesome.

410
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:14,739
Okay, sorry.

411
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:24,434
I had jumped right to the Hormel Stadium, but I guess in that case, is there anything else that people would like to bring up with that?

412
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:28,723
Okay, hearing nothing.

413
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,844
Um, for most stadium follow up.

414
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:38,207
I'm not sure who brought that into the I brought that up just because it was in the June meeting.

415
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:42,549
We had an action item and I'm going to take.

416
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:53,692
make a habit of putting action items in bold in the agenda so that we can review them, maybe nudge people or find out if they're no longer an action item, et cetera.

417
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:59,595
My note was that Dennis said he would check with the Hormel Commission to see how to proceed.

418
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:04,637
And I know people get very busy and sometimes don't get to it, but maybe you did.

419
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:12,628
I went over and asked your secretary and they were not meeting in the timeframe that I think we were sort of looking at.

420
00:31:12,668 --> 00:31:15,170
So they were, she said the next time they meet, she's going to bring it up to them.

421
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,290
Okay, cool.

422
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:18,852
Well, that's good action then.

423
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:21,554
All right.

424
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:23,016
Do they need our input for anything?

425
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:29,000
No, I just gave it to her and I said, like, have her talk to the chair and see if they want anything.

426
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,602
I said, if the chair does want stuff, then we'll come back to you guys.

427
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:32,443
Okay.

428
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:35,305
Okay.

429
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:44,078
Anything else with Hormel Stadium or shall we move on to the Police Working Group?

430
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,742
All right.

431
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:56,311
Moving on to the Police Working Group, me and Emily are discussing what we want to bring up with the police during our next meeting.

432
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:59,754
We have not actually officially established a meeting with them.

433
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:10,790
One of the items that we want to do is push the police to come up with a recurring bicycle patrol.

434
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:22,374
They have done so in the past, and we would like to push them to actually commit to having on some sort of recurring cadence a bicycle patrol done by their officers to help

435
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:28,101
you know, provide officers a way to see what is going on on the ground.

436
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:35,327
We are also going to push them to move forward with at least some sort of bicycle training.

437
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,010
These are things that we have not at this point

438
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:45,552
reached out to the police with yet, but I intend to do that before the next meeting.

439
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:56,576
So that is an action item for me is to consolidate all of my requests to them and put those forward and set up a meeting to see if we can push forward with that.

440
00:32:58,196 --> 00:33:04,819
Sadly, there hasn't been that much movement on that front, but it is on my list of things to do.

441
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,660
So that is my current set of requests that I will push out to them.

442
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,007
Bike patrol, what was the other one?

443
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:21,231
So we are going to try and put them through a bicycle training program.

444
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:36,800
So educate them as to the rules of the road with regards to cyclists and drivers so that they are aware as to what a cyclist can do, what a cyclist can't do, and

445
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:46,205
just where the vulnerability points for cyclists are on the road and what they should be on the lookout for.

446
00:33:49,106 --> 00:33:53,628
And who presents that information to them?

447
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:57,170
That is still TBD.

448
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,491
It would most likely be me or Emily.

449
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:04,673
I do know that, Bruce, you've done the League of American Bicyclists.

450
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:05,394
That's correct, yes.

451
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:07,435
I'm a certified league cycling instructor.

452
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:21,609
And for each state, we do talk about and refer people to the laws of the state, not as legal advice, but basically saying, here's a summary and here's where you can look for information.

453
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:29,971
Most groups, most state groups will have an advocacy group that's actually summarized everything by their legal staff.

454
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:33,791
And we can usually just crib from that and go through it.

455
00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:36,072
I believe the goal is,

456
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,762
how to say it, a lot of people have what I'll call default attitudes with regard to bicycling.

457
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:50,685
And that means that they don't fully understand what the rights or the responsibilities are for cyclists.

458
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:58,448
And that can create tension and can result in, you know, particularly with police officers, if

459
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:12,576
they're not aware of what an issue is and then they get called to a crash or something like that, they might not be aware or fully understand whether the cyclist was operating properly or not.

460
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:18,999
And sometimes people will blame a cyclist no matter what without really understanding it.

461
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:28,505
And so I would like to see that information be provided so that they at least have a better sense of what's actually

462
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:30,306
you know, important.

463
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:44,021
Bruce, as a quick follow-up to that, is there still a League of American Cyclists training situation that I could go through?

464
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,122
Yes, yes.

465
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:49,764
It's possible.

466
00:35:50,325 --> 00:36:04,261
I would need to look up exactly what the well you could either go on the League of American Cyclists website and find about becoming a bike instructor, but basically they have a typically it's a two day session where they walk through.

467
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:19,236
At the time they walked through a lot of operation on the road and what some of the pitfalls are and how to actually operate in a vehicular manner so that you can get through situations that might otherwise be uncomfortable.

468
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:35,440
I think that the curriculum has probably been expanded now to understand some of the pitfalls that you have to watch out for even when operating an infrastructure, whether it's a shared use path, bike path, or separated bike.

469
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,081
All these things have their own perils that you need to be aware of.

470
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:48,283
But anyhow, you would learn about all that and learn how to present that to people, as well as the basics of how do you learn how to ride a bike to begin with.

471
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,224
It's a fascinating course to go through.

472
00:36:52,284 --> 00:36:55,405
I did it five or six years ago, as I recall, maybe more.

473
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:00,248
It'd be kind of interesting to see how they do it again for it.

474
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:11,733
But yeah, if I don't remember to connect to you about it, let me, you know, look on the web, the league website, and you can probably find information on that.

475
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,865
All right, that's good to know.

476
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:23,012
I will try and follow up with that and investigate whether I can become an instructor myself.

477
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:31,080
I presume probably both me and Emily should investigate that if we're the ones who are liaising.

478
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:37,166
Yeah, and that might be the kind of thing where you could get a stipend perhaps to help offset the cost of

479
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:42,308
either lodging that you have or the actual cost of the training.

480
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:48,190
I don't recall that it was very expensive, but it also wasn't free.

481
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:51,351
Sounds good.

482
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:54,772
Daniel, one more thought.

483
00:37:57,513 --> 00:38:04,475
I know that there are in the area a couple of attorneys that specialize in

484
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:10,218
supporting cyclists who've been in an accident or whatever.

485
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:22,701
And I wonder if those people might also be good resources for information or even presenting potentially to the police.

486
00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:37,376
If you have any of the contact info or names I can reach out to, Adam, I would gladly welcome that.

487
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:39,558
Yeah, I'll see what I can dig up.

488
00:38:40,733 --> 00:39:01,902
okay that's a great idea yeah mass bike has some materials on that point including some of those people yeah um any uh any information that you can dig up is much appreciated i wish i had more time in my life to dedicate to only bikes but sadly work is

489
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:05,659
Work eats up a lot of it right now.

490
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,621
Anyways.

491
00:39:08,342 --> 00:39:25,579
Daniel, given that, I don't know if I could be so bold as to suggest that Bruce take on some of the responsibility of presenting to the police if he would be up for it, given his experience with this and encyclopedic knowledge of all of the streets of Medford.

492
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,281
I'm happy to do so.

493
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,438
I fully intend to Bruce in if possible.

494
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:36,546
My thought more goes to us.

495
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,590
Probably wanting to have.

496
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:48,048
a backup, a secondary person with that knowledge if needed, even tertiary if needed.

497
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:52,672
But yes, I will 100% rope Bruce in.

498
00:39:53,073 --> 00:40:00,480
That was our original intent between me and Emily, was to set this up and at some point see if we could rope Bruce into doing this.

499
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,522
You're not roping me.

500
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:04,088
Okay.

501
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:05,048
All right.

502
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:06,830
Well, that's wonderful then.

503
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,552
So I will keep that in mind.

504
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:12,274
Wonderful.

505
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:14,176
Let's see.

506
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:18,900
Are there any questions about the police working group or any other comments?

507
00:40:22,322 --> 00:40:23,302
It's a bold move.

508
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,083
I'm glad you're doing it.

509
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:31,645
Asking them to take a crash course in the laws of the state is a strong stance.

510
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:33,726
I'm glad you're doing it.

511
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:34,786
It's appreciated.

512
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:36,927
We can try.

513
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,609
As we all know, we can do our best.

514
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:43,170
It doesn't mean we'll succeed.

515
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:48,781
Let's see, Ernie, would you like to give a bike lights report?

516
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:49,942
Sure, sure.

517
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:52,765
Let me tail off of the league.

518
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:57,169
It was a reminder for me to check supplies there.

519
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:08,160
The informational material, training material that's in the bike light kit is of course the league's guide, which I hadn't talked about.

520
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,084
for quite a while because we had a surplus of those booklets.

521
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:18,149
We're now down to less than I would need

522
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:23,115
maybe less than half of what I would need for this fall's distribution.

523
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:25,255
So it's a good time to order those.

524
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:38,518
So that's a note to the working group that was just formed to order a case of 500 of the league's quick guides.

525
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:42,259
At that level, they drop from $4 each to $1.25 each.

526
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,381
And that's what we've been ordering.

527
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:52,664
And that's why they're not ordered too often, because 500 is a large quantity.

528
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,725
But it's time to get those.

529
00:41:55,265 --> 00:42:00,088
So that sits also into the discussion about what our budget is.

530
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:11,194
I happen to run into Alicia, who is, I think, supposed to disperse and manage our budget.

531
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:13,675
But the

532
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:24,660
Attitude I get is that there's no one currently watching it or tallying it as a fixed amount to be managed throughout the year.

533
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,820
In that, and I'll now go to the bike lights.

534
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:41,463
Last year, I fronted the funds to buy and assemble all the bike lights, and I had sufficient quick guides to do so without having to order any.

535
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:49,461
she is finally saying that she will reimburse me for that.

536
00:42:50,742 --> 00:43:05,194
Running on its heels a few weeks ago, as I mentioned I think at the last meeting, the lights themselves for the next fiscal year arrived as we agreed to order them early because of the threat of tariffs.

537
00:43:06,576 --> 00:43:14,582
That's been wonderfully successful in that they've arrived with only an increase in cost of 4% from last year.

538
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:23,188
So I will have to present through JRA cycles an invoice for the next coming year.

539
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:33,416
Following Jared's comment about corporate sponsors, I've only been able to

540
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:44,526
consistently get Brookline Bank to give us $500 a year toward these expenses.

541
00:43:45,727 --> 00:43:54,934
So we have some work to do to get more corporate benefactors, as well as to figure out

542
00:43:56,334 --> 00:44:09,349
what kind of budget we have and how it's to be spent and whether it's not just loosely monitored once in a while by the development office.

543
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,854
So that's all sort of interesting.

544
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:16,217
I have never been

545
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:32,254
in the last at least two years been told or operating within a referred balance sheet showing what funds we have available, total spent, et cetera.

546
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:58,107
I know that we had been told years ago that we had a $1,500 per annum balance, and that was what prompted me to seek, as well, corporate sponsorship for the bike lights, because that and the other supplies we've purchased and promotional materials and hardware exceeded that amount per annum.

547
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,449
There was talk of doubling that budget,

548
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:03,093
maybe to two or three grand a year.

549
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:06,655
I don't think anything became of that.

550
00:45:08,317 --> 00:45:18,885
So now we are operating in this open without restriction area as far as I can see.

551
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:28,113
Alicia, when trying to decide how to pay me for last year's lights, said she would come up with the money from somewhere.

552
00:45:29,505 --> 00:45:36,547
and not indicating that it's working off of a budget that is bequested to us.

553
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:40,028
So there are the subtleties around that.

554
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:47,511
I have in my front hall, all the lights we'll be needing for this fall and next spring.

555
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:49,031
They just have to be assembled.

556
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:57,074
I get the city to pay JRA for that invoice, smaller,

557
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:17,401
expenses like for Ziploc bags and printing and that kind of stuff, I just donate that because I'm not going to go through the bureaucracy of getting POs from the city for $30 or $40 or $50 amounts.

558
00:46:19,704 --> 00:46:20,444
here and there.

559
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:23,306
I'm just getting too old for that shit.

560
00:46:24,026 --> 00:46:33,632
So just the larger invoices have to be washed through the city and that's for the bike lights themselves at $1,100 per annum.

561
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:54,839
And maybe, yeah, almost once a year, $625 for the 500 League Quick Guides, which I think we should have as a standard giveaway at events.

562
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,502
And maybe include, I know this isn't the promotional

563
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:10,581
working group that you just put together, but you know, we could put our 10 cent MBAC sticker on the back cover of that as an example.

564
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,943
That's something to have as a handout.

565
00:47:14,684 --> 00:47:17,265
So that's that.

566
00:47:17,345 --> 00:47:27,432
If anybody wants to help me assemble a couple hundred or so kits we'll need for September and fall events,

567
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:34,721
you can come over, we'll have pizza and go to Espresso and put together some kits.

568
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,086
So that's, I think that's all I've got.

569
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:38,686
Thanks.

570
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:41,010
Thank you, Ernie.

571
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:41,971
Anna.

572
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:44,920
Hi, everyone.

573
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:47,682
This is my first meeting, so it's nice to meet everyone.

574
00:47:47,822 --> 00:48:01,029
I just wanted to say, Ernie, that in my day job, I do fundraising and communication, so I want a little more time to get my head around the commission and everything we're doing and also would need some guidance surrounding how the commission differs.

575
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:10,053
I work at a nonprofit in terms of asking for donations, but I'm happy to help with that in the future, and I'm also happy to help put together bike lights.

576
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:11,754
So, yeah, we should connect.

577
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:12,835
I can definitely help with that.

578
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:13,997
Well, thank you.

579
00:48:14,178 --> 00:48:16,139
I've... Recording stopped.

580
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:18,880
Standby.

581
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:19,621
Yep.

582
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:19,981
Yep.

583
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:20,281
Yep.

584
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:23,643
Recording in progress.

585
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:43,015
In the couple of years of doing this, I've noticed that larger potential donors, big banks, corporations, even real estate firms tend to have such boilerplate around the application

586
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:49,640
process that they never come through or put you on a waiting list even to communicate with them.

587
00:48:50,201 --> 00:49:02,346
It's the small mom and pops who are apt to support us, but don't come through with a $250 or $500 ask that I put forward.

588
00:49:02,826 --> 00:49:06,227
So sort of run out of steam there, Mr. Wenderman.

589
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:10,349
So yeah, it's like nonprofit fundraising.

590
00:49:11,069 --> 00:49:12,870
I understand, and you understand.

591
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,631
what I'm talking about too.

592
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:15,551
Yeah.

593
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:17,313
That sounds good.

594
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:17,513
Yeah.

595
00:49:17,553 --> 00:49:23,797
Maybe if I can come over and help with the bike lights, we can discuss what you've done and any ideas I have and talk about it.

596
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:24,638
Great.

597
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:26,519
Should be in about a month or so.

598
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,841
I'll get around to this early September.

599
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:34,945
We hit the schools in late September, early October and stuff them with these.

600
00:49:35,646 --> 00:49:40,289
If there are any events where bike light kits would be needed,

601
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,766
in the next month, please let me know.

602
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:44,066
I have nothing on the calendar.

603
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,187
Quick question for you there, Ernie.

604
00:49:47,928 --> 00:49:52,870
Do you have limitations on types of businesses that you will work with?

605
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,811
I mean, obviously, you work with JRE, our local bike shop.

606
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,794
Will you work with cafes, real estate, hardware store?

607
00:50:02,814 --> 00:50:05,675
Do you have any limitations on that sort of thing?

608
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,936
I don't think so.

609
00:50:07,956 --> 00:50:17,404
I would like a sponsor to be oriented philosophically to what we're doing.

610
00:50:18,424 --> 00:50:29,874
So, you know, I haven't approached automobile dealerships as an example, who might have an anti-bike lane agenda for all I could tell.

611
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:38,305
No, I remember that that was the case in the past, but I don't recall specifically.

612
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:46,832
I was really hoping to get, as an example, Waste Management as a corporate sponsor.

613
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:50,756
And once again, they just put you in line and you never hear from them.

614
00:50:54,169 --> 00:51:05,016
But yeah, I can certainly, with Anna's help, restart this process of trying to get, if not the full, let's say, $1,500 or $2,000 worth of supplies covered each year.

615
00:51:09,093 --> 00:51:10,914
more than just a quarter of that.

616
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,375
So that's the answer to your question, Jared.

617
00:51:13,435 --> 00:51:17,677
I'd say about a quarter of this whole activity is sponsored.

618
00:51:17,997 --> 00:51:34,324
JRA put up a couple hundred dollars in the past, but since they're doing now the shadowboxing with the city in terms of getting payments through the system, I'm not gonna ask them for,

619
00:51:36,383 --> 00:51:37,965
any actual funds anymore.

620
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:45,556
It's generous of them to act as the purchaser so that I can be reimbursed for outlays.

621
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:51,705
The city has it such that no member on the commission can actually

622
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,819
be reimbursed for large outlays.

623
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:05,061
It has the money has to go directly to the provider of materials.

624
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:10,303
So that's how I got the lights from Singapore to be washed through JRA.

625
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:25,154
and how maybe a check in the future to the league for 625 bucks may have to come from the city to the league of bicycles rather than wash through any of us buying them.

626
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:31,620
I'm not so clear on that, but we do need 500 more of those guys this fall.

627
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:32,962
Sooner the better.

628
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:49,313
So I should put that in as a proposal that we, as a commission order, another case of 500 of the league of American bicyclists, quick guides at what had been a dollar 25 each.

629
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:50,733
I suspect it still is.

630
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:52,994
So a total purchase of $625.

631
00:52:53,134 --> 00:52:53,814
Is that a motion?

632
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:56,115
Yes, that's a motion.

633
00:52:56,976 --> 00:52:57,796
I'll second that.

634
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:09,262
Okay, should be noted, Dennis did send to me, we have a budget for this year of $1,500.

635
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:10,603
So do I hear any ayes?

636
00:53:10,623 --> 00:53:11,764
Aye.

637
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:12,745
All opposed?

638
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,322
Okay, hearing none, the ayes have it.

639
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:28,126
Ernie, that expense is approved.

640
00:53:28,386 --> 00:53:34,413
Why don't you reach out to me if you need anything on my side in order.

641
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:42,704
The question will be whether I, since they know me from past purchases, should make the purchase and submit the bill.

642
00:53:43,244 --> 00:53:58,351
to Alicia or whether she will want to go through the process of getting a quote from me, issuing a PO, and then making the purchase directly, which might take months or years.

643
00:53:59,011 --> 00:53:59,952
And that's my fear.

644
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:11,117
So I don't mind fronting the money because, you know, eventually, maybe I'll get paid.

645
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:14,209
Well, let's see if we can't.

646
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:18,492
We'll try and move that along.

647
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:20,474
We'll try and groove in again.

648
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:21,535
Yes, indeed.

649
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:22,575
Thank you, Daniel.

650
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:26,498
That's it for me.

651
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:28,160
OK, helmets.

652
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,741
I believe, Bruce, that was you.

653
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:38,682
Yeah, that was my item, and that came up because one of the questions I was asking at the farmers market was, didn't we used to give away helmets?

654
00:54:39,182 --> 00:54:45,624
And so I just wanted to figure out, I think Pat might have been coordinating all that in the past.

655
00:54:46,404 --> 00:54:57,207
I wasn't certain about that, but I wanted to know if anyone recalls how it is that we ended up with a bunch of helmets, whether we still have a bunch of helmets, and if we can get more.

656
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:00,647
I can speak to that.

657
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,829
Jared might also have a little bit of info on that as well.

658
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:11,995
I believe Berkshire White & Gluck was the law firm that sponsored the helmets.

659
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:15,618
Breakstone White & Gluck.

660
00:55:15,658 --> 00:55:20,122
They run a non-profit called Project KidSafe that provides the helmets.

661
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:22,063
They're active across the state.

662
00:55:23,084 --> 00:55:24,505
But they're in Boston, I think.

663
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:26,987
What is the name of that organization?

664
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:27,588
Breakstone?

665
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,643
Breakstone, White, and Gluck is the name of the law firm.

666
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:36,047
Project KidSafe is their helmet distribution initiative.

667
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:42,292
What was the stipend or support amount each year?

668
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,674
It was a bunch of free helmets.

669
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:46,395
Yeah, OK.

670
00:55:46,415 --> 00:55:46,936
That's it.

671
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:49,778
How do we get back on board that train?

672
00:55:50,439 --> 00:55:51,259
Just contact them?

673
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,784
That was my understanding, unless it was Jared.

674
00:55:58,303 --> 00:55:58,983
I think that's right.

675
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:02,485
I think, I think Daniel, you might have had contact with them most recently.

676
00:56:02,585 --> 00:56:10,388
So it probably would be, I would hope, fairly trivial to, to do just that and get back on the wagon with them again.

677
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,829
I vaguely remember that.

678
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:19,452
I, Bruce, will you add an action item for me to reach out to

679
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:31,913
BWG, for lack of my being able to pronounce their name properly, just to reach out to them about getting a new shipment of helmets.

680
00:56:32,394 --> 00:56:39,917
One thing that I would like to note is that the helmet shipments are difficult to store.

681
00:56:40,017 --> 00:56:43,678
In the past, we have stored them at the Tufts Pool, I think.

682
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:52,262
We were able to get storage location there, but that meant that we would need to retrieve them from there if we ever did events.

683
00:56:52,862 --> 00:57:15,786
It might be helpful if we could distribute those helmets across multiple different people for storage purposes so that they could be brought to events from not just a single location or have a single person need to coordinate with, I believe, the Medford Recs Department, who were the ones that basically stored those.

684
00:57:16,206 --> 00:57:18,647
So if there's a way that we could get those

685
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:28,171
distributed to one or two separate members just for ease of access, that would be probably pretty helpful.

686
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:33,733
Was there any administrator reason we were storing them on city property as opposed to not?

687
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:44,737
I think specifically because helmets in large quantities end up taking up a large amount of space.

688
00:57:44,957 --> 00:57:50,643
For any of us, I'm sure space can sometimes be at a premium, and we did have free space there.

689
00:57:50,903 --> 00:57:56,889
I just meant, was there any city policy with regard to that that we had to adhere to?

690
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:03,997
No, I believe that the rec department did offer that up freely.

691
00:58:04,237 --> 00:58:06,679
They did have space that they were willing to donate to that.

692
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:18,424
Maybe we can figure that out as well and just have a handful at members' places, like a dozen or 10, so that we can arrive at the events with them more easily.

693
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:24,808
I was going to say, I don't know if it has to even stay with members, but I think a lot of the

694
00:58:25,928 --> 00:58:41,895
Local like walk bike to school groups would be a great place because they're already doing events with kids I know we would love we would hand out if I had bike helmets I would hand them out at like our fall festival when we have a biking table So that might be another way to think about distributing them.

695
00:58:41,955 --> 00:58:42,735
Not just through us.

696
00:58:44,356 --> 00:58:46,276
I think that's a great thought as well.

697
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,774
So yeah, thank you Mary-Kate.

698
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:52,195
Ernie and then Anna.

699
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,076
Yeah, two parts to this.

700
00:58:54,136 --> 00:59:02,080
We talked about this years ago as well, that the law firm was giving us what, 200 helmets a year or 125?

701
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:11,265
We had some discussions about how, or I wanted to at least ramp this up to several hundred a year at least.

702
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:13,046
And storage was an issue.

703
00:59:13,446 --> 00:59:15,347
I know I can easily store

704
00:59:16,649 --> 00:59:35,104
I don't know, 100, maybe 200 helmets and accessible to the members, basement, outside free entry area, you know, with bulkhead doors, dry for the winter.

705
00:59:35,264 --> 00:59:40,448
So I'm not sure storage is the issue, but I would like to see this part of a,

706
00:59:42,106 --> 00:59:55,095
Well, in addition to hitting up the law firm and seeing what they will provide for us, I would want to tipple them to see if the mass can be increased and if necessary for us to pay for them.

707
00:59:56,175 --> 01:00:08,085
On the other side of that, since we know that on the retail level at stores, Schwinn provides really good helmets in the $20 area.

708
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:10,707
Maybe that's before tariffs.

709
01:00:11,227 --> 01:00:14,250
And so those have to wholesale at 10 or 12 bucks a piece.

710
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:20,835
And indeed, the supplier of the bike lights in Singapore has been offering to me

711
01:00:21,756 --> 01:00:30,918
you know, a whole bunch of different styles of kids and youth helmets in the $10 to $12 per helmet area.

712
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:45,781
So that's just some information we should use in procuring helmets, whether we're buying them or trying to max the donation from our current supplier.

713
01:00:46,122 --> 01:00:47,122
I don't see that 100 or

714
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:51,580
200 helmets a year is sufficient.

715
01:00:52,380 --> 01:01:07,050
I would like to see this go up to the bike lights level, whereas you say with all these events we have, we should at least for a few years trying to put helmets on all the kids in a sort of large effort.

716
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,151
But they're tough to store.

717
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:15,235
The police officers have already told me there's no way they want to carry them in the back of their SUVs.

718
01:01:16,705 --> 01:01:23,091
Bike lights are easy, but our liaison of the police department said, no way are they going to carry helmets around.

719
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:24,352
They're just too bulky.

720
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,055
So that's all I got there.

721
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:28,136
Thanks.

722
01:01:28,316 --> 01:01:34,421
I'll make it a note to ask for, see what the upper limit of helmets are from BWG.

723
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:34,601
Anna?

724
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:48,254
Yeah, I was just gonna make a comment kind of going back to what Adam was talking about with the lawyers who might know information on this link that Jared sent for this project KidSafe.

725
01:01:48,274 --> 01:02:01,359
They mentioned working with police departments, so they could also, when you reach out about helmets, could be a good thing to just ask on the police front that we were discussing earlier, just to ask if they have any resources or if they ever do trainings.

726
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:08,575
OK, so I guess I can make a side request to them to see what they have.

727
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:12,358
Chris?

728
01:02:12,658 --> 01:02:14,519
Yeah, just real quick.

729
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,621
What's the mechanism for handing out helmets right now?

730
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:20,223
Is it at our various events?

731
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:22,965
Or are there other means of doing it?

732
01:02:24,552 --> 01:02:31,994
So generally, we hand them out at events that we table at, or any other events that we happen to be at.

733
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:38,256
They typically should be given out to kids who may not have a helmet, typically for free.

734
01:02:38,516 --> 01:02:39,736
Same thing with bike lights.

735
01:02:41,356 --> 01:02:41,536
Yep.

736
01:02:42,477 --> 01:02:44,037
I think, does that cover your question?

737
01:02:44,517 --> 01:02:50,999
Yeah, it just makes me think that maybe, if it's like trying to get helmets on kids, then maybe there's an opportunity for,

738
01:02:52,183 --> 01:03:01,926
events focused on at a school, for example, that's both educational in nature and outfitting with lights, helmets.

739
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:06,188
So I didn't know if we had focused events like that, or if that's something that we consider in the future.

740
01:03:07,048 --> 01:03:08,269
In the past, we have.

741
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:15,451
I believe, someone correct me if I'm wrong, that was the bike rodeo that we would do.

742
01:03:17,372 --> 01:03:17,932
Possibly.

743
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:30,003
I'm going to chime in and say that I think a lot of, again, the school site bike and safety activities are often put on by the safe routes to school groups.

744
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:33,425
So I lead one for the Brooks Elementary School.

745
01:03:35,207 --> 01:03:48,315
And I know that there's the representatives at each school are the ones who are working to try to get those pedestrian safety classes and biking safety classes put into the school day curriculum at second and fifth grade.

746
01:03:49,957 --> 01:04:10,743
I just want to remind everyone that whereas the bike-like kits are sort of self-explanatory and you can't really get into trouble or safety issues, with helmets, we've been giving them out at the Spring Rodeo, as an example, as part of helping to teach kids how to maneuver and ride a course.

747
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:21,022
but also to very carefully and personally hand fit on each child the appropriate size helmet and adjustment of straps.

748
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:24,903
So we have to be careful about how we do that.

749
01:04:25,103 --> 01:04:34,026
It's a fitting, not just a tossing of a product to a parent who has a kid at home, as an example.

750
01:04:34,906 --> 01:04:35,206
Yeah.

751
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:38,067
Fair call out.

752
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:53,525
Final thoughts from me, it seems like maybe there's an opportunity then to connect to some of these safe routes of school groups to have a more targeted impact if we're going to be giving away helmets in that fashion.

753
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:55,827
So maybe it's trying to link up with that.

754
01:04:58,781 --> 01:05:10,611
What I don't want to see is a big box of helmets at the back door of the gym of a big school where kids just willy-nilly grab the color they like and run away with it.

755
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:15,635
We want to be more careful about the safety aspects of being properly fit.

756
01:05:15,655 --> 01:05:17,636
Yeah, I think you're right, Aaron.

757
01:05:24,122 --> 01:05:24,482
Agreed.

758
01:05:28,996 --> 01:05:30,918
Sorry, okay, that covers helmets.

759
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:34,362
We already covered a family, fall family bike ride.

760
01:05:34,402 --> 01:05:39,809
I'm sorry, were there any other comments on helmets before I move on to the clipper ship connector?

761
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:48,359
All right, moving on, clipper ship connector access.

762
01:05:50,745 --> 01:05:54,047
Yes, the Contra Flow bike lane has been approved by the Traffic Commission.

763
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:55,888
It has not gone out to bid.

764
01:05:55,908 --> 01:06:06,033
It will most likely go out to bid, I believe, for next construction season, which means we are most likely not looking at completion until 2027.

765
01:06:07,233 --> 01:06:16,678
It will probably coincide with the MassDOT Main Street 93 underpass improvements that are scheduled.

766
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:24,686
So as much as I know that a lot of us would like to see that get added in sooner, we will most likely have to wait for that.

767
01:06:24,887 --> 01:06:31,274
As that was just recently approved, it's not even part of the bidding season right now.

768
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:33,696
So this is sort of where we are.

769
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:36,417
interim improvements.

770
01:06:36,477 --> 01:06:40,058
We do have some signage that will be getting added in the short term.

771
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:54,741
There were discussions over whether there should be signs added to the end of the path along Riverside Ave that say cyclists stop and dismount.

772
01:06:55,861 --> 01:06:59,062
That was an item that we as the commission pushed back on

773
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:19,848
against adding that specific signage or having that signage moved as far down towards Main Street as possible since we don't want to add on additional encumbrances for cyclists who are coming through that way since it is a relatively long walk along Riverside Ave.

774
01:07:21,492 --> 01:07:30,776
There will be wayfinding signage added as part of that and other directions, so that is at least a positive on that front.

775
01:07:31,517 --> 01:07:35,099
That is all I really have to report there.

776
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:37,640
If anyone has... Oh, Chris, go for it.

777
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,141
Yeah, I'm just curious.

778
01:07:40,402 --> 01:07:43,764
Is there any way to see what that way signage will look like?

779
01:07:43,824 --> 01:07:48,408
And as our function with the Advisory Commission, do we get to weigh in on that?

780
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:52,631
And it would be great to prototype it and ride around and see what does that look like?

781
01:07:52,671 --> 01:07:58,976
Because there's so many times where signage is just either not in the right place or it's just hard to see.

782
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:03,080
And so is it going to be effective is the thing I worry about.

783
01:08:05,156 --> 01:08:08,919
Also, what is the preferred route that we're being directed to?

784
01:08:09,739 --> 01:08:14,642
Having done that a whole bunch of times, I'm still not even sure what I would say is the best route.

785
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:18,925
At the moment, I don't think that we have.

786
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:31,614
I'm actually in the process of pulling up the email thread that I had been brought along on.

787
01:08:35,335 --> 01:08:45,041
I'm trying to make sure I have all the images before I do this.

788
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:57,589
Sorry, so I guess to follow up with that, right now the email is only between

789
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:03,311
Me, Todd Blake, Emily, and Carl Alexander.

790
01:09:03,451 --> 01:09:16,902
I'm not, I'm actually, I don't know enough about Carl to be able to comment on, he's part of the Mystic River Path, I believe, group.

791
01:09:17,482 --> 01:09:22,787
Let me, I can show some proposed signage.

792
01:09:24,088 --> 01:09:27,791
I think Carl is with the MWRA based on-

793
01:09:28,543 --> 01:09:29,183
No, no, no.

794
01:09:29,203 --> 01:09:31,104
He's with Mystic River Watershed Association.

795
01:09:31,744 --> 01:09:32,445
Thank you.

796
01:09:32,805 --> 01:09:33,425
What did I say?

797
01:09:34,406 --> 01:09:37,327
You said Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.

798
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:38,187
Right.

799
01:09:38,327 --> 01:09:39,088
Similar initials.

800
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:39,948
That's not what I meant.

801
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:41,769
Thanks for the correction.

802
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:44,290
This is the current signage.

803
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:52,932
We are pushing to have, there are still some discussion points to be had over this sign.

804
01:09:53,632 --> 01:10:04,195
I think that we have successfully pushed them to push back the decision, at least, on what that sign should look like.

805
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:29,835
Todd, the city traffic engineer, had suggested a sign that was, I realize I'm sharing the rest of this, he had suggested a sign that looks similar to this Oak Park, but just with bicycle and dismount, which was a suggestion that I had made as being there, sorry, there we go, dismount instead of Oak Park, less words.

806
01:10:30,295 --> 01:10:33,198
So these are some proposed changes that

807
01:10:34,278 --> 01:10:38,142
or these are the proposed signs that are being brought up here.

808
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:49,231
I think that the current decision is that we will move forward with the wayfinding signs, but not the dismount signs, and that is an ongoing discussion point.

809
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:52,454
I don't need to necessarily belabor that point.

810
01:10:53,755 --> 01:10:55,096
I'll move on to Bruce.

811
01:10:55,116 --> 01:10:55,877
Sorry, you have the floor.

812
01:10:57,024 --> 01:10:59,166
I think someone was ahead of me, or are they set?

813
01:10:59,606 --> 01:11:00,106
Oh, I remember.

814
01:11:00,306 --> 01:11:00,907
I guess it's me.

815
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:10,013
Yeah, so I just wanted to say that I have been riding the Clippership Connector currently at every opportunity.

816
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:19,739
I've been coming almost exclusively westbound at this point, and tried several different routes just to see how they fared.

817
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,182
And the one that was actually the worst

818
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:27,902
was to go down to the police station and try to cross there.

819
01:11:28,962 --> 01:11:33,903
And I found that crossing the street at that point, it's very difficult, especially with a bicycle.

820
01:11:36,524 --> 01:11:40,605
As a pedestrian, you can kind of step into the street and people will actually stop.

821
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:47,387
And I found when trying to do so with a bicycle, you can't really step in far enough without your bike kind of being in the way.

822
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:54,390
And therefore, I didn't seem to get as much cooperation, and it took a while to cross the street.

823
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:55,670
So that was one.

824
01:11:55,730 --> 01:12:01,133
Then further, once I crossed the street... Sorry, Bruce, could you clarify exactly where you're talking about there?

825
01:12:01,533 --> 01:12:08,756
Yes, at South Street, the South Street intersection with Main Street, right across from the police station.

826
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:12,293
Do you guys mind if I just pull up a map and share with you?

827
01:12:12,313 --> 01:12:12,994
Please do, sure.

828
01:12:13,215 --> 01:12:13,976
Yeah, thanks.

829
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:22,531
I can allow you to, you know what, my Zoom is... So I think, Bruce, you're talking about coming

830
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,922
Yes, a connector along Clippership this way.

831
01:12:27,962 --> 01:12:31,843
I actually stayed on the sidewalk on the side of the lane yet.

832
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:33,664
Yeah, down to.

833
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:35,745
Oh, sorry.

834
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:37,305
No, I guess it wasn't quite that far.

835
01:12:37,425 --> 01:12:40,446
It was just north of the police station at that light right here.

836
01:12:40,466 --> 01:12:40,787
Right.

837
01:12:41,447 --> 01:12:43,428
And crossed over to South street.

838
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:55,335
and then had to ride along the sidewalk a little bit there to dismount and get into the not quite contraflow lane that's at least marked with a yellow line currently.

839
01:12:55,895 --> 01:13:05,481
And I found it to be incredibly awkward and would not recommend it for people who were trying to serve who don't know how to work their way through here.

840
01:13:05,741 --> 01:13:06,862
It really was not

841
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:09,400
a good idea to do it that way.

842
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:16,183
So another approach I took, and this was on a Sunday afternoon, so traffic was quite light.

843
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:24,387
I was able to simply pull off the curb and make a left turn, similar to what will be proposed once the signal is in place.

844
01:13:25,327 --> 01:13:26,408
And that worked pretty well.

845
01:13:26,588 --> 01:13:34,612
I then took the bike lane south on Main Street and picked up the river path with the awkward kind of U-turn that you got to make to get on the path.

846
01:13:35,692 --> 01:13:36,673
And that wasn't so bad.

847
01:13:38,266 --> 01:13:55,840
The third approach that I took was to actually go down to the crosswalks in Medford Square proper, cross over those crosswalks, and then pick up the bike lane southbound on Main Street.

848
01:13:56,861 --> 01:13:59,022
So while that worked quite well,

849
01:14:00,045 --> 01:14:01,246
It was not very efficient.

850
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:10,695
It really took a while, because in order to get through those lights, there's got to be like three or four different things you've got to coordinate.

851
01:14:10,775 --> 01:14:13,877
And they're not designed so that you can just sort of go through.

852
01:14:13,897 --> 01:14:20,383
And I got frustrated and just had to cross one of them, even though it wasn't green.

853
01:14:20,403 --> 01:14:23,426
I've done that, Bruce, on a cargo bike.

854
01:14:25,408 --> 01:14:27,069
There's like no space in here.

855
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:28,290
Yeah, right.

856
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,051
That's the other thing.

857
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:33,876
One time I found people standing here and it's pretty terrible.

858
01:14:34,116 --> 01:14:40,542
Yeah, so I think what we're looking for here is the least worst of all the ideas that we have.

859
01:14:40,562 --> 01:14:42,784
The thing that I found to be the most

860
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:52,849
And this is why I think a conversation around what the way signage should be is pretty important, because it's such a terrible, your choices are really bad.

861
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:59,872
But I found that, honestly, the best way is just going following the road around here, taking the left.

862
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:02,473
I was going to tell you that that was my fourth approach.

863
01:15:03,073 --> 01:15:08,455
This way, and then just staying in the central lane here to go right across here.

864
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:11,477
And it's like the, it's actually,

865
01:15:12,527 --> 01:15:13,889
It's not great, but it's not that bad.

866
01:15:14,429 --> 01:15:21,277
And Chris, I'll say that that works great for experienced riders, those who aren't timid about it.

867
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:31,369
We've had reports that Medford Square is one of the more intimidating places to ride your bike through if you are not an experienced vehicular cyclist.

868
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,851
If you are, it's not so bad.

869
01:15:33,911 --> 01:15:36,994
I do it many times and I find it works well.

870
01:15:37,474 --> 01:15:41,337
And so from my standpoint, what you said is totally true.

871
01:15:41,497 --> 01:15:49,182
I was able to go up, do my standard route through City Hall as if I was coming from Riverside Avenue and that all worked.

872
01:15:49,263 --> 01:15:56,127
But I'm not going to recommend that as sort of a family or kid or inexperienced cyclist way.

873
01:15:56,988 --> 01:15:58,148
to get through the area.

874
01:15:58,188 --> 01:16:09,873
So I think we need to really figure out what's the least problematic of all these choices that still allow inexperienced people to get through.

875
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:19,737
And I think, unfortunately, it's probably to go to the lights in Medford Square, even though there's not quite enough room, like you said, with a cargo bike.

876
01:16:22,342 --> 01:16:28,266
because I think, I don't know, Chris, did you try going to the crossing down at South Street as well?

877
01:16:28,447 --> 01:16:30,228
And that technique, because that's just as bad.

878
01:16:30,588 --> 01:16:31,769
There's no space in the middle.

879
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:34,351
I haven't tried that so long.

880
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:35,892
I try not to go.

881
01:16:35,972 --> 01:16:37,633
Sidewalks with a cargo bike is really hard.

882
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,496
And so it's not a great stretch to go down.

883
01:16:41,536 --> 01:16:50,203
I think, yeah, I mean, this is, I think it's fine without people, without not other people waiting in that little island here.

884
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:51,224
Otherwise, it's...

885
01:16:52,843 --> 01:16:59,386
We could propose different solutions and basically say, if you're comfortable riding on the street, this is the best way.

886
01:17:00,106 --> 01:17:02,807
If you're not, this is the best way, or at least the worst way.

887
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,368
It's hard to put that on a sign though.

888
01:17:04,528 --> 01:17:05,428
Yeah, it is, it is.

889
01:17:05,528 --> 01:17:10,350
But maybe just suggesting alternative paths.

890
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:18,693
And the two alternative paths would be up around on Salem Street, and then the other would be going through the crosswalks.

891
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:25,896
So that way, people who aren't sure where to go can say, oh, yeah, there's no way I'm riding on City Hall Mall.

892
01:17:26,256 --> 01:17:27,157
I'm not going to do that.

893
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:33,139
Or people who are comfortable and say, oh, there's no way I'm going to ride down the sidewalk and through the crosswalks.

894
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:39,562
So that would at least give some wayfinding guidance to people on how to get through.

895
01:17:40,802 --> 01:17:43,343
So that's my observation from what I've done.

896
01:17:43,823 --> 01:17:55,808
Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I think what I end up doing most of the time, and I'm usually coming from my son's karate school here, but I just go through the parking lot, up the street here, and then onto the sidewalk here.

897
01:17:55,888 --> 01:17:56,368
Yeah, right.

898
01:17:56,428 --> 01:17:57,489
So that's another technique.

899
01:17:58,329 --> 01:18:08,913
And that's, I mean, you could kind of just do from the clipper ship, come into this parking lot area, through the parking lot, all the way through where

900
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:11,856
It's a little more protected.

901
01:18:11,876 --> 01:18:13,357
Oh, that's an interesting point.

902
01:18:14,678 --> 01:18:15,759
Yeah, I see your point.

903
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:24,746
So that's another alternative would be to use the parking lot, which has its own perils, but at least you're going in the right direction.

904
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:29,810
Yeah, it'll be less traffic, but you get cars backing up, which is tricky.

905
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:34,734
Does the thought of having differentiating signs like bike

906
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:37,653
Yeah, I concur with that.

907
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:52,670
feeling.

908
01:18:52,690 --> 01:19:06,013
I feel like adding multiple different pathways may just lead to confusion, though I do agree with the sentiment and more advanced route.

909
01:19:06,193 --> 01:19:11,795
Maybe the thing we would do would be suggested off-road route through Medford Square.

910
01:19:12,475 --> 01:19:13,796
Or like safest route?

911
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:19,739
Safest is a judgment, you know, because I don't consider it necessarily safest.

912
01:19:20,599 --> 01:19:27,183
I often find that riding in traffic is the safest approach for me, given my speed and abilities.

913
01:19:28,003 --> 01:19:31,105
So, you know, if you say it's off road, you're not

914
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:36,889
You're not making any judgment as to which way is safest.

915
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,051
And that provides guidance westbound.

916
01:19:40,972 --> 01:19:53,780
I'll continue to do these experiments eastbound, which, again, I haven't done, and offer my view of how that all works as well.

917
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,042
But where do we want to go with this, I guess, is the next question.

918
01:19:58,357 --> 01:20:03,159
I think it's probably worth giving Adam a chance to speak.

919
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:03,959
He's got his hand up.

920
01:20:04,059 --> 01:20:04,599
Oh, yeah.

921
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:05,200
Sure.

922
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:05,560
Yeah.

923
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:05,960
Yeah.

924
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,441
So, uh, two things.

925
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:17,964
I think I lost the plot a little bit, but I think what we're trying to, what we're discussing is now that the Clipper ship connectors open, there's going to be signage there.

926
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:20,685
Someone's asking us for signage recommendations.

927
01:20:20,745 --> 01:20:22,206
Is that, am I close to what we're?

928
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,801
Yes, effectively.

929
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:28,702
We have a chance to weigh in on signage here.

930
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:32,364
Okay, so two questions I had.

931
01:20:32,464 --> 01:20:43,089
Bruce, when you're going down however you want to get on to Main Street going south and then you're kind of jumping on South Street, do you have a destination in mind?

932
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:44,850
West.

933
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:47,271
Just west.

934
01:20:47,371 --> 01:20:51,413
So, I mean, so for signage, you know, maybe it's

935
01:20:53,467 --> 01:21:03,414
Maybe if we could think about the destination for some of the signage or information, like the library could be a destination.

936
01:21:04,515 --> 01:21:06,136
Let me add another clarification.

937
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:16,382
When I came down Main Street from the crosswalks, I went through what we've called Sleepy Hollow and across the dangerous crosswalk on Mystic Valley Parkway.

938
01:21:17,803 --> 01:21:23,728
And then across this route-studded path, that was not very fun to ride on.

939
01:21:23,808 --> 01:21:24,729
No, I didn't go that way.

940
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:25,429
I went on the path.

941
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:29,933
Yeah, I'd recommend going through the parking lot, and then I picked up the Contra Flow lane.

942
01:21:29,953 --> 01:21:30,894
Yeah, okay.

943
01:21:30,914 --> 01:21:32,455
Basically, the only reason I did that

944
01:21:33,095 --> 01:21:35,936
is because that's the natural way to go.

945
01:21:35,956 --> 01:21:47,039
I think actually one of the times I may have, yes, one of the times I also went along Mystic Valley Parkway and picked up the Mystic River Path by the Condon Shell instead.

946
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:47,159
Yep.

947
01:21:47,619 --> 01:21:48,500
I like that better.

948
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,761
But that's still, yeah, that's a little bit better choice.

949
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:54,421
Of course, the bridge and the sidewalk are kind of a pain in the butt there.

950
01:21:55,522 --> 01:21:57,062
But that's another approach.

951
01:21:58,803 --> 01:21:59,363
I've crossed.

952
01:22:00,323 --> 01:22:08,647
Mystic Street, both at that crosswalk and gone down to the path itself and crossed, those are six of one, half dozen of another.

953
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:20,394
There's not really any benefit to one or the other other than maybe you have a crosswalk light if you're on the path as opposed to crossing by the ballparks.

954
01:22:21,074 --> 01:22:27,737
Right there, you don't have any light, you just have to go, whereas up at Mystic Valley Parkway, you actually have a crosswalk light.

955
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:31,251
So those are different ways.

956
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:37,553
Normally, I just go through Medford Square and down High Street.

957
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:45,736
But I've been, as I said, deliberately using the path just to get a sense of what people are facing.

958
01:22:47,957 --> 01:22:57,081
So my two cents was if we're thinking about what goes on the sign, a destination could be one of the things to think about putting on the sign.

959
01:22:58,081 --> 01:23:00,184
I think there's probably a couple of places.

960
01:23:00,264 --> 01:23:07,512
Eventually, you'd love to see Minuteman bike path on there, because eventually, hopefully, all this connects out to there.

961
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:15,201
But right now, it could be Mystic River Path, or it could just be Main Street.

962
01:23:16,013 --> 01:23:33,901
I mean, I suppose we could have a series of, right, a series of paths that basically point in the direction, sorry, a series of signs, rather than having a diagram or something like that, that basically say, you know, Mystic River Path continues and direct them through the crosswalk directly.

963
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:42,245
And then once you're through the crosswalk, they can decide, you know, what is the best Mystic River Path to take.

964
01:23:43,802 --> 01:23:45,223
Actually, that would work well.

965
01:23:45,263 --> 01:23:53,548
You'd go through Sleepy Hollow, cross at the crosswalk, and then continue across the narrow bridge to pick up the path at the Condon Shell.

966
01:23:53,568 --> 01:24:00,813
That's probably actually the closest to the real route, the ideal route that we would ultimately want this path to take.

967
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:06,077
Yeah, it's actually not too bad if you don't cross that

968
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:17,886
that flashing yellow thingy on Mystic Valley and you just stay on the north side of Mystic Valley Parkway and cross at the crosswalk with an actual red light.

969
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,362
I find that one, I usually take that one.

970
01:24:24,382 --> 01:24:28,005
Yeah, I take that one in favor of the other one.

971
01:24:28,225 --> 01:24:28,585
Interesting.

972
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,547
I'll try that sometimes just to see how that fares.

973
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:31,487
I hadn't considered that.

974
01:24:31,928 --> 01:24:37,952
That feels like a lot safer, like the cars like don't blow through that as much as they do the other one.

975
01:24:37,992 --> 01:24:39,053
Yeah, good point.

976
01:24:41,384 --> 01:24:41,645
Cool.

977
01:24:42,527 --> 01:24:48,138
So, I mean, what I'm hearing from this is a series of wayfinding signs.

978
01:24:48,178 --> 01:24:50,583
Sorry, Jared, do you have something you want to add?

979
01:24:51,265 --> 01:24:51,745
I do.

980
01:24:53,146 --> 01:24:53,886
One, I agree.

981
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:56,187
I like that crossing behind the church there.

982
01:24:56,227 --> 01:25:01,509
I use that to get to the library, connect between the library area and the convent shell all the time.

983
01:25:02,309 --> 01:25:04,349
Don't tell the church that I ride through their parking lot.

984
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:18,734
But the other point I had was that Adam's point about destinations reminded me that either one or two years ago, the city had a small amount of money.

985
01:25:18,794 --> 01:25:19,935
I believe it was grant funded.

986
01:25:21,531 --> 01:25:38,397
for wayfinding signs, and they put up wayfinding signs in this area with destinations that provided walking and biking distances and estimated times from the point of the sign to whatever the destination was like.

987
01:25:38,437 --> 01:25:41,198
And it had things like the library and the condensation and stuff like that.

988
01:25:41,618 --> 01:25:46,780
They were made out of corrugated plastic, as I believe these are proposed to be for now.

989
01:25:47,860 --> 01:26:06,759
uh and i don't think they made it through more than a year and they tended to twist around on the pole and point you in the wrong direction that kind of thing um so well that's that's too bad but it does seem like we're talking about coming up with locations and distances and where to put them at least

990
01:26:07,735 --> 01:26:13,303
And to some extent regarding, it looks like we're maybe recreating the wheel a bit.

991
01:26:14,325 --> 01:26:15,927
And some of this work has been done.

992
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:22,417
So I'm not sure why leveraging some of those past materials wasn't on the docket.

993
01:26:22,597 --> 01:26:23,657
But I feel like it should be.

994
01:26:24,878 --> 01:26:40,943
And our job then, I feel like, should maybe be let's resurrect some of those old wayfinding materials if we believe they were effective and supplement them with specific guidance here in the areas where we're concerned about people not being able to get through.

995
01:26:40,963 --> 01:26:45,085
Do we know where those specs are?

996
01:26:46,565 --> 01:26:47,686
I don't.

997
01:26:47,706 --> 01:26:49,546
I mean, the city should certainly have them.

998
01:26:49,606 --> 01:26:50,587
It was a city thing.

999
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:53,781
Maybe Todd knows.

1000
01:26:54,382 --> 01:27:01,025
Yeah, I just, I don't feel like I saw any comment about that, which kind of is surprising me now that I'm recalling it.

1001
01:27:02,286 --> 01:27:06,027
Did we get corporate destinations to help out in this?

1002
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:13,891
I'm thinking, especially in the Contra Flora, South Street, and then getting back on to go West.

1003
01:27:14,652 --> 01:27:21,455
I would think Amazon and Whole Foods would be very interested in having wayfinding

1004
01:27:21,952 --> 01:27:22,892
to that location.

1005
01:27:23,813 --> 01:27:25,193
The other one has no idea.

1006
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:26,614
Sponsored destination signs?

1007
01:27:26,634 --> 01:27:28,595
Yeah, it's a destination sign.

1008
01:27:28,615 --> 01:27:34,857
Well, yeah, if they put up, you know, we'll put up one for them, and if they pay for the other four, along the way.

1009
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:46,041
I guess what I'm imagining, you know, for right now, for the next, until the contraflow lane is built, at least, because that provides a little bit clearer visual indication of where to go.

1010
01:27:46,201 --> 01:27:49,823
Right now, come off the Eclipse ship connector here,

1011
01:27:51,025 --> 01:27:52,285
And you have no idea where to go.

1012
01:27:53,226 --> 01:28:01,068
And so it's sort of a series of signs that at least lead you to the next place where it starts to make sense where you can bike.

1013
01:28:02,468 --> 01:28:07,970
So it's like, all right, bike path this way with a couple of signs along the way here.

1014
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,010
And then the left here, this is the way we suggest.

1015
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,211
Go here and then cross here.

1016
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:15,652
So just along the preferred route to guide people.

1017
01:28:15,672 --> 01:28:19,873
Because otherwise, at every intersection, you're left wondering, where do I go?

1018
01:28:21,271 --> 01:28:26,396
And it takes doing this a couple dozen times to figure out what works.

1019
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:36,444
I think the more mature ways of finding stuff could come along with a contraflow lane in the future.

1020
01:28:37,926 --> 01:28:43,290
I think ultimately that is what we are going for with this iteration.

1021
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:47,013
It is a temporary solution until the contraflow lane is installed.

1022
01:28:49,294 --> 01:28:56,817
probably our first iteration, we should just focus on optimal way wayfinding to continue along the Mystic River path.

1023
01:28:58,278 --> 01:29:03,340
And then I presume we should have an opportunity to add more wayfinding.

1024
01:29:04,001 --> 01:29:13,325
But in this case, I think that it might be more of a question as to what we consider to be an optimal path to continue along.

1025
01:29:13,585 --> 01:29:16,706
I propose that I can put together a draft

1026
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:25,483
based on what I've heard us discuss and maybe circulate it.

1027
01:29:26,943 --> 01:29:31,945
We wouldn't be able to make primary decisions, but we can gather information to bring to the next meeting.

1028
01:29:31,965 --> 01:29:39,887
Hopefully everybody will have reviewed it by then, and we can have a quick vote on how to proceed at that point.

1029
01:29:40,347 --> 01:29:44,569
Maybe making a recommendation to Todd that they purchase these

1030
01:29:45,855 --> 01:29:53,284
either temporary or perhaps a little bit more permanent wayfinding signs until the contraflow is available.

1031
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:56,408
So I'm willing to do that and distribute it.

1032
01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:59,131
I don't know if we need a motion for that.

1033
01:29:59,171 --> 01:30:00,633
It's just an idea I have.

1034
01:30:01,694 --> 01:30:02,115
What do you think?

1035
01:30:03,658 --> 01:30:05,599
I would love that.

1036
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,382
Ultimately, let me see, I'm looking into this.

1037
01:30:12,143 --> 01:30:17,745
I just got added to this email thread nine days ago.

1038
01:30:21,272 --> 01:30:26,793
I believe they're trying to put these out to print in short order, so I may need to make an executive decision.

1039
01:30:26,873 --> 01:30:40,677
So Bruce, if you would like to start on that and send me your recommendations, if I don't reach a deadline, if we don't have a deadline by the time the next meeting comes around, we can vote on it, but otherwise I'll have to.

1040
01:30:40,697 --> 01:30:42,817
Okay, so here's what I'll do.

1041
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:43,938
I will

1042
01:30:45,542 --> 01:30:52,207
I will go back out, maybe even take some pictures and figure out what signs ought to be where for eastbound and westbound.

1043
01:30:52,967 --> 01:31:00,573
And the goal will be directing people onto the Mystic River path, as opposed to any of the other solutions that we've said.

1044
01:31:00,593 --> 01:31:04,676
It basically will be, how do you get to the next part of the Mystic River path?

1045
01:31:05,707 --> 01:31:11,752
and people can decide, you know, how they might peel off and use a Chondroflolane or anything like that on their own.

1046
01:31:12,653 --> 01:31:19,699
But I think that would be at least helpful to people that have no clue, you know, they get to the end on either side, it's like, now what?

1047
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,362
So... Helpful and required.

1048
01:31:23,382 --> 01:31:24,823
Say again?

1049
01:31:25,604 --> 01:31:27,165
Helpful and required.

1050
01:31:27,885 --> 01:31:28,706
Yeah.

1051
01:31:28,866 --> 01:31:29,727
That's nice of you.

1052
01:31:30,327 --> 01:31:30,868
Yeah, thank you.

1053
01:31:30,988 --> 01:31:33,130
Okay, I've got that as an action item for me then.

1054
01:31:34,107 --> 01:31:53,380
My general thought on this is I don't really see how our proposal that we come up with as a really short-term thing, recognizing that it's terrible, but as a really short-term solution is really anything other than getting people up to Riverside on the sidewalks and using the horrible crosswalks to cross over and get back.

1055
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,081
When you say Riverside, do you mean Clippership?

1056
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:56,861
connector at Clippership Drive?

1057
01:31:57,201 --> 01:31:57,641
No, no.

1058
01:31:57,681 --> 01:31:59,842
I did mean Riverside, actually.

1059
01:31:59,902 --> 01:32:09,204
Like, if people are going... Share my screen again, because that's the question I'm wondering, too, Jared, about what's the... Okay, so your red line there, that.

1060
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:11,504
Something to that effect.

1061
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:18,646
Basically along this sidewalk all the way over here, and then you cross one... Oh, that's what you mean by getting to Riverside, okay.

1062
01:32:18,786 --> 01:32:24,027
Yeah, either that or cutting up through... What is that little, like, cut-through driveway street there?

1063
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:26,588
Roland Pothier way right there.

1064
01:32:26,628 --> 01:32:28,389
Yeah, one of one of those two options.

1065
01:32:29,409 --> 01:32:37,413
But something like that, just because I'm trying to think about like, people are going to start flowing in whatever way appears to be like the best choice.

1066
01:32:37,433 --> 01:32:41,234
These are terrible choices in general, as we've all talked about.

1067
01:32:41,274 --> 01:32:44,796
But that seems to me because there are existing crosswalks there.

1068
01:32:45,516 --> 01:32:48,598
That's probably the thing that when people start looking like, where do I go?

1069
01:32:49,358 --> 01:32:52,361
Well, the first thing they're probably going to do is look for a crosswalk.

1070
01:32:52,581 --> 01:32:55,403
So I feel like that's going to be the natural inclination of people.

1071
01:32:55,944 --> 01:33:01,669
It's a, it's not a, it's not a great, but you know, I'd almost pick an option.

1072
01:33:02,289 --> 01:33:11,697
I'd almost prefer something that's a little bit of a hybrid of these, which is like, go on this side, cross over here, and then.

1073
01:33:12,526 --> 01:33:15,788
Sure, yeah, you might know that path a little.

1074
01:33:15,848 --> 01:33:28,355
Point of order, we're coming up on 7.40, 8.40, and one of our main things we wanted to do today was to review the goals of priorities, which I think is going to take us half an hour.

1075
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:41,243
And I'd like to move that we curtail discussion on this particular item and pick it up on our standing Clipper Ship Connector Access agenda item in the future.

1076
01:33:41,988 --> 01:33:42,348
Fair enough.

1077
01:33:43,149 --> 01:33:43,989
That's a motion.

1078
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:45,531
Seconded.

1079
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:47,252
All in favor.

1080
01:33:48,153 --> 01:33:48,253
Aye.

1081
01:33:48,453 --> 01:33:48,553
Aye.

1082
01:33:48,893 --> 01:33:49,013
Aye.

1083
01:33:49,514 --> 01:33:50,574
OK, all opposed.

1084
01:33:50,594 --> 01:33:53,236
OK, motion passes.

1085
01:33:53,356 --> 01:33:54,057
OK, thank you.

1086
01:33:54,617 --> 01:33:55,058
All right.

1087
01:33:56,999 --> 01:34:00,922
Review of the, I actually put together a slide presentation for this.

1088
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:01,843
Don't worry.

1089
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:05,865
I go through slides relatively fast, especially because.

1090
01:34:08,007 --> 01:34:08,968
What item are we going to?

1091
01:34:10,683 --> 01:34:14,985
Sorry, we're going to 750 or there are no infrastructure updates.

1092
01:34:16,446 --> 01:34:22,508
I have not gotten anything from Todd, so we're just going over to review of goals, priorities.

1093
01:34:22,848 --> 01:34:25,009
I move to table this item until the next meeting.

1094
01:34:25,029 --> 01:34:30,191
I am happy with that too, unless there is opposition.

1095
01:34:30,391 --> 01:34:32,012
So is there a second?

1096
01:34:33,593 --> 01:34:34,233
I second.

1097
01:34:34,853 --> 01:34:35,854
OK, there's a second.

1098
01:34:36,834 --> 01:34:37,354
All in favor?

1099
01:34:39,035 --> 01:34:39,135
Aye.

1100
01:34:40,081 --> 01:34:41,661
All right, all opposed?

1101
01:34:43,322 --> 01:34:45,082
Okay, hearing none, the ayes have it.

1102
01:34:45,222 --> 01:34:47,443
That means we are- Now we're on review, right?

1103
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:49,963
Oh, I'm sorry.

1104
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:52,564
You are tabling the infrastructure updates.

1105
01:34:52,704 --> 01:34:53,504
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1106
01:34:53,884 --> 01:34:54,144
Okay.

1107
01:34:54,164 --> 01:34:54,384
Sorry.

1108
01:34:54,744 --> 01:34:55,564
I'm good with that too.

1109
01:34:55,964 --> 01:34:56,384
Oh.

1110
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:57,605
It's in favor.

1111
01:34:57,865 --> 01:35:01,265
I was- You jumped.

1112
01:35:01,285 --> 01:35:02,986
That's why I went back to it.

1113
01:35:03,006 --> 01:35:03,586
Sorry about that.

1114
01:35:04,766 --> 01:35:05,206
Fair enough.

1115
01:35:06,626 --> 01:35:07,507
Watch out what you vote for.

1116
01:35:09,876 --> 01:35:12,837
Fair enough, there wasn't much table there in any case.

1117
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:13,938
All right, moving on.

1118
01:35:13,978 --> 01:35:19,361
Let's go through slides, because everyone loves slides.

1119
01:35:19,441 --> 01:35:22,142
This is effectively a recap of what we had before.

1120
01:35:22,302 --> 01:35:24,163
Okay, Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission.

1121
01:35:24,203 --> 01:35:25,684
This is mostly for our new members.

1122
01:35:26,444 --> 01:35:27,765
Okay, going on.

1123
01:35:27,785 --> 01:35:31,326
Let me see, I've got the whole presenter's view over here.

1124
01:35:32,872 --> 01:35:34,493
Sorry, Daniel, just a quick question.

1125
01:35:34,513 --> 01:35:37,776
Are all of our new members on the meeting now?

1126
01:35:38,837 --> 01:35:41,659
We don't have any more that missed this meeting, do we?

1127
01:35:43,341 --> 01:35:50,666
There was only, I believe, Lisa Sun, who is not from the commission.

1128
01:35:50,686 --> 01:35:51,907
So I believe we have everyone.

1129
01:35:51,927 --> 01:35:57,332
Unless, Bruce, you'd keep me honest there?

1130
01:35:57,837 --> 01:36:00,259
I think that is correct, but let me go back.

1131
01:36:01,019 --> 01:36:04,041
The new members are Adam, Chris, Anna.

1132
01:36:06,822 --> 01:36:07,643
Yes, all set.

1133
01:36:08,415 --> 01:36:08,615
Cool.

1134
01:36:08,735 --> 01:36:09,195
Sounds good.

1135
01:36:09,215 --> 01:36:09,515
Thanks.

1136
01:36:10,135 --> 01:36:10,475
Okay.

1137
01:36:10,776 --> 01:36:12,916
And I'm mostly going to be reading off these slides.

1138
01:36:12,996 --> 01:36:17,117
So we're an ad hoc commission, not established by charter.

1139
01:36:17,437 --> 01:36:18,517
We're appointed by the mayor.

1140
01:36:18,577 --> 01:36:19,638
We serve at her pleasure.

1141
01:36:19,798 --> 01:36:24,359
She also appoints new members who we recommend to her.

1142
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:30,820
And then she sends out the official invites, which I think everyone here has gotten.

1143
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,501
We do provide an official function to the city of Medford.

1144
01:36:34,601 --> 01:36:37,882
We are not a non-profit advocacy organization.

1145
01:36:38,802 --> 01:36:44,405
advocacy group, though we do do advocacy, or advocate at least.

1146
01:36:45,605 --> 01:36:49,067
I'd like to augment why that's important in our experience.

1147
01:36:49,107 --> 01:36:54,690
People have come to us as if we are an advocacy group only, and we need to know that we're not.

1148
01:36:55,530 --> 01:36:55,650
Right.

1149
01:36:58,574 --> 01:37:00,295
All right, conflict of interest.

1150
01:37:01,436 --> 01:37:04,659
I think many people here at least understand the broad strokes of this.

1151
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:08,301
The law governs our operations.

1152
01:37:08,421 --> 01:37:17,648
We are officially considered municipal employees, although we, of course, don't make any salary from this or any money from this at all.

1153
01:37:18,929 --> 01:37:22,172
Rules regarding self-dealing, bribes, nepotism, so on.

1154
01:37:22,292 --> 01:37:24,574
So as you all know, you cannot accept bribes.

1155
01:37:25,114 --> 01:37:35,518
There is more on this, and you will all probably at some point go through the training for this, but do not accept wraps because you have so much control over the city.

1156
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:39,880
We have pretty straightforward guidelines, probably covered that before.

1157
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:44,863
There are some resources for conflict of interest law.

1158
01:37:45,063 --> 01:37:48,846
I will send out a link to this later so you can click on these links.

1159
01:37:49,627 --> 01:37:54,491
And we do have a city solicitor who is available to answer questions, provide best practices.

1160
01:37:54,571 --> 01:38:01,896
We do reach out to them every now and then when we have questions about the legality of certain actions or things that we are allowed to do and or say.

1161
01:38:02,357 --> 01:38:09,842
So when in doubt, please reach out to me and I can reach out to the city solicitor on your behalf if you think you might be

1162
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:15,235
treading into, you know, murky legal territory.

1163
01:38:18,141 --> 01:38:25,967
You can all stop me, but I, you know, stop me as you need and ask questions, but I realize we all have other things, so I'm going to continue on.

1164
01:38:27,208 --> 01:38:29,129
Open meeting law, right?

1165
01:38:29,569 --> 01:38:34,773
As I'm sure you've probably picked up by now, meetings by public bodies must be conducted in public.

1166
01:38:34,893 --> 01:38:39,617
So we cannot meet as a group outside of these public meetings.

1167
01:38:39,657 --> 01:38:42,579
This is why we generally don't text, email,

1168
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:51,929
do barbecues, so on and so forth, outside of our working groups or as a full commission at these meetings.

1169
01:38:52,410 --> 01:39:01,199
So as much as I'm sure everyone here is a wonderful person, try not to create conflicts with this.

1170
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:29,078
uh as you all know point point point of clarification we we can get together even as a quorum we just cannot discuss anything that is bicycle commission related and you gotta be real careful there because it's real easy to stray into something like that right we can't we can't deliberate right and we can't deliberate right under under the law of almost everything counts as deliberation could be construed that way

1171
01:39:30,156 --> 01:39:31,957
So be careful when you discuss that pothole.

1172
01:39:32,418 --> 01:39:33,459
We can talk about pets.

1173
01:39:34,579 --> 01:39:35,960
Yes, no bikes.

1174
01:39:36,581 --> 01:39:37,642
You all know how this goes.

1175
01:39:37,782 --> 01:39:44,267
And of course, as people who are probably somewhat into bikes, bikes do come up from time to time in our discussions.

1176
01:39:45,007 --> 01:39:45,908
What about tricycles?

1177
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:49,891
No, barbecue sauce.

1178
01:39:50,352 --> 01:39:51,212
Barbecue sauce.

1179
01:39:53,436 --> 01:39:54,437
And no unicycles.

1180
01:39:57,499 --> 01:39:59,961
So yes, I don't know.

1181
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:02,844
I'll double check on unicycles and tricycles at some point.

1182
01:40:04,925 --> 01:40:09,469
OK, so as we all know, Bruce is currently filling in for secretary.

1183
01:40:09,929 --> 01:40:15,654
I'm sure that at some point someone will perhaps offer to unload Bruce from this.

1184
01:40:16,494 --> 01:40:18,876
I think I'm actually officially secretary.

1185
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,818
We voted on that a couple back.

1186
01:40:21,364 --> 01:40:27,467
OK, I know that you had expressed some, you've been in this role before.

1187
01:40:27,487 --> 01:40:30,288
I know this is your second move through this role.

1188
01:40:30,808 --> 01:40:36,971
So just offering up if anyone would like to express interest.

1189
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:41,033
Bruce does a great job as secretary, but I will note that.

1190
01:40:41,873 --> 01:40:42,833
really quickly right here.

1191
01:40:45,274 --> 01:40:54,457
In any case, and sorry if I'm overstepping my bounds here, Bruce, but I just thought I'd put that in in case anyone needs that or would like to act on that.

1192
01:40:56,177 --> 01:41:05,400
Yep, so emails, as we all know, we still need to abide by open meeting law rules.

1193
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:09,481
And we have to always do that at normal businesses.

1194
01:41:10,903 --> 01:41:13,945
Resources for open meeting laws and the trainings.

1195
01:41:14,466 --> 01:41:17,087
Gosh, got this bug that keeps flying through my screen.

1196
01:41:17,968 --> 01:41:18,308
Okay.

1197
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:21,611
Sorry, quick question.

1198
01:41:21,651 --> 01:41:28,536
Daniel, when you get a chance, could you put the link to the slideshow in the chat just so I can make a record of it?

1199
01:41:30,117 --> 01:41:30,437
Yes.

1200
01:41:30,817 --> 01:41:37,242
Why don't I do that now so that... And is it publicly viewable?

1201
01:41:38,263 --> 01:41:41,165
It is not publicly viewable, but it should be.

1202
01:41:41,365 --> 01:41:41,665
Okay.

1203
01:41:43,586 --> 01:41:52,612
Maybe I can move it into our collateral material point and make it publicly viewable or make a copy of it.

1204
01:41:53,092 --> 01:41:54,953
One second, I'm making this.

1205
01:41:55,133 --> 01:42:00,477
Are there other, what are the formal roles within the bike commission other than secretary?

1206
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:11,735
Chair, vice chair, secretary, we have a somewhat unofficial position of a social media coordinator.

1207
01:42:11,755 --> 01:42:14,436
Here I will, sorry.

1208
01:42:14,476 --> 01:42:15,997
Who serves as each of those?

1209
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:21,680
I am the chair, Emily is the co-chair, Bruce is the secretary.

1210
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:31,325
We do not have a social media coordinator unless someone stepped in for, oh gosh, who is that?

1211
01:42:34,038 --> 01:42:42,302
Pat used to be, but then it moved on to... Kevin did some of that, but that's a title with lowercase letters.

1212
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:44,744
It was never an official thing, really.

1213
01:42:45,364 --> 01:42:45,584
Right.

1214
01:42:45,884 --> 01:42:46,104
Yep.

1215
01:42:49,626 --> 01:42:49,907
All right.

1216
01:42:50,167 --> 01:42:51,187
Bruce, I just placed it.

1217
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:51,367
Got it.

1218
01:42:51,427 --> 01:42:51,728
Thank you.

1219
01:42:52,148 --> 01:42:52,648
Okay, great.

1220
01:42:53,969 --> 01:42:54,209
Sorry.

1221
01:42:55,606 --> 01:42:56,026
Here we are.

1222
01:42:56,046 --> 01:43:04,471
All right, so generally meeting conduct and structure, we follow Robert's rules of order.

1223
01:43:05,272 --> 01:43:09,974
Slightly more flexible, as you can see, I just say, you know, all in favor, all opposed.

1224
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:14,597
I don't typically take a count, sort of do it by voice vote.

1225
01:43:17,036 --> 01:43:24,481
Bruce can probably give a better overview of that, or you can just Google it on your own and figure out Robert's rules of orders.

1226
01:43:26,022 --> 01:43:26,583
Zoom meetings.

1227
01:43:26,663 --> 01:43:28,504
Be mindful of others wanting to speak.

1228
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:30,185
Avoid talking over others.

1229
01:43:30,265 --> 01:43:31,586
Be responsible and considerate.

1230
01:43:31,966 --> 01:43:32,947
Subcommittee meetings.

1231
01:43:33,047 --> 01:43:34,468
Smaller working groups.

1232
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:38,011
You know, we do have those from time to time.

1233
01:43:39,392 --> 01:43:42,314
Regular meetings are the fourth Wednesday of every month.

1234
01:43:43,887 --> 01:43:54,254
As I'm sure you've all picked up at this point, sometimes we will skip meetings if it seems that we do not have enough people or it's during specific holiday times where it's difficult to coordinate.

1235
01:43:56,255 --> 01:43:58,916
It's possible that we have cancellations.

1236
01:43:59,157 --> 01:44:02,799
I don't think we've had technical problems in a while.

1237
01:44:03,139 --> 01:44:06,081
As you have all seen, we try to coordinate the best we can.

1238
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:09,823
We do have a requirement of a 48-hour notification to the city.

1239
01:44:13,265 --> 01:44:26,393
when we ask for agenda items to be sent in, that is sort of important that you send any agenda items that you want to Bruce so that he has enough time to send the agenda to the city.

1240
01:44:26,553 --> 01:44:28,335
And it has to be in a specific way.

1241
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:34,579
We have to send that 48 hours before our meeting so that it can be posted online on the city's calendar.

1242
01:44:35,099 --> 01:44:38,641
I generally put the agenda in by noon time on the Monday before the meeting.

1243
01:44:38,661 --> 01:44:39,562
Yep.

1244
01:44:40,412 --> 01:44:44,694
which is a little bit more than 48 hours, but that's right.

1245
01:44:44,934 --> 01:44:50,276
If we ask for items, please send items as soon as you can and be mindful of that.

1246
01:44:50,336 --> 01:44:53,038
So if it's a Wednesday, make sure you get them to Bruce.

1247
01:44:53,618 --> 01:44:58,460
But I mean, Bruce, you can say this latest Sunday night or... That's preferable.

1248
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:04,263
That effect should just be put up to the prior slide on open meeting law.

1249
01:45:05,503 --> 01:45:06,724
You'd like the previous one?

1250
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:10,338
Yeah, because that's what it's about, the 48 hours.

1251
01:45:11,058 --> 01:45:12,099
It's about the open meeting.

1252
01:45:12,559 --> 01:45:15,041
So add it as a line item.

1253
01:45:15,061 --> 01:45:18,162
I will do that after this.

1254
01:45:19,864 --> 01:45:28,469
Just wanted to cover that so that everyone knew the general guidelines for submitting agenda items.

1255
01:45:28,909 --> 01:45:29,309
Great.

1256
01:45:32,419 --> 01:45:54,988
uh main goals and functions we contribute to the bike master plan that the city has it has been a while since we've gone back over that that's generally recommended bike lanes bike infrastructure and the like that is on one of our large like sort of fold outs um i'm sure people may have seen that but we also need to improve that it's also on the website if you need to go there

1257
01:45:55,728 --> 01:46:01,132
We provide feedback to the City on road designs, work with the City on infrastructure.

1258
01:46:01,512 --> 01:46:07,577
We do try to attend other public meetings, including the Traffic Commission and the City Council when called upon.

1259
01:46:08,157 --> 01:46:19,025
Traffic Commission is actually somewhat important because the Traffic Commission hears from other residents of Medford and makes decisions on things such as bike lane and parking.

1260
01:46:19,565 --> 01:46:24,729
So if you do have a bike lane that you would like to see approved keep an eye out for it.

1261
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:37,880
I will generally get a heads up and send out you know that as a FYI item for people to be aware of that there are upcoming bicycle related infrastructure changes that are coming to the traffic commission.

1262
01:46:38,281 --> 01:46:47,188
It is helpful if you show up for those because adding voices in there does actually make a difference and differing points of view.

1263
01:46:47,328 --> 01:46:47,889
So please

1264
01:46:48,529 --> 01:46:53,032
If you can, join the traffic commission meetings.

1265
01:46:53,072 --> 01:47:02,478
Generally, we serve as consultants to the city and we do other public liaisoning, as you could see with who was at Paul earlier.

1266
01:47:03,619 --> 01:47:16,348
We do organize some events, we go to other events, and we do act as a voice to the mayor and other members of the city government to give them guidance.

1267
01:47:17,835 --> 01:47:21,057
Daniel, what's the comment about new dedicated bike officials?

1268
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:22,478
Sorry.

1269
01:47:22,918 --> 01:47:23,418
Sorry, Ernie.

1270
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:25,499
I said my question too.

1271
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:26,460
I don't know what that means.

1272
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:32,463
Sorry, am I... In the middle, with new dedicated bike officials.

1273
01:47:33,264 --> 01:47:35,045
The third to the bottom.

1274
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:40,428
Oh, that might have been an accident added in there.

1275
01:47:40,448 --> 01:47:41,168
Apologies.

1276
01:47:42,769 --> 01:47:44,070
I will correct that in the slides later.

1277
01:47:44,633 --> 01:47:48,857
I would capitalize planning and engineering in the last line.

1278
01:47:49,818 --> 01:47:51,999
Okay, real departments.

1279
01:47:53,621 --> 01:48:00,687
You noted in your original note, City now has dedicated bike related officials and engineers.

1280
01:48:01,207 --> 01:48:03,689
I think that probably means Todd and to some extent,

1281
01:48:07,594 --> 01:48:10,056
DPW Director Tim.

1282
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:19,161
And there used to be an engineer that was largely in that role who is no longer filled.

1283
01:48:20,142 --> 01:48:23,004
Yeah, I forgot about it.

1284
01:48:23,064 --> 01:48:29,168
We did have a city engineer who was specifically dedicated to bicycle infrastructure.

1285
01:48:29,348 --> 01:48:32,630
But yes, I blinked on Amy right there.

1286
01:48:33,611 --> 01:48:33,691
OK.

1287
01:48:34,991 --> 01:48:37,153
That is a role that we're hoping the city will fill again.

1288
01:48:38,657 --> 01:48:41,962
Okay, this is good.

1289
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,665
I'm getting a quick run through.

1290
01:48:43,685 --> 01:48:49,473
I had to set these up relatively quickly, but I will improve on them in the future.

1291
01:48:50,395 --> 01:48:52,117
Okay, boom.

1292
01:48:53,104 --> 01:49:03,455
Key engagement, social media.

1293
01:49:03,796 --> 01:49:08,521
If anyone is interested in helping out with the social media, that would be great.

1294
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:19,786
We also do our best to spread news about things like, for example, the Clippership Connector or new bike lanes going in on social media where possible.

1295
01:49:20,286 --> 01:49:23,628
I do have access to the social media accounts.

1296
01:49:23,788 --> 01:49:28,610
If anyone would like to take on the role of being the social media organizer, that would be great.

1297
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:31,871
Please reach out to me if you are interested in that.

1298
01:49:33,773 --> 01:49:35,574
Generally, key contacts.

1299
01:49:36,474 --> 01:49:39,014
Tim, he was a former member of the Bike Commission.

1300
01:49:39,074 --> 01:49:40,814
He is the Commissioner of the Public Works.

1301
01:49:41,515 --> 01:49:44,795
Todd Blake, he is the Director of Traffic and Transportation.

1302
01:49:44,855 --> 01:49:46,755
He shows up in this meeting every now and then.

1303
01:49:46,775 --> 01:49:51,476
He's very supportive of bike lanes and other bike infrastructure.

1304
01:49:51,496 --> 01:50:01,498
Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, also a good contact person, you know, and as Ernie has also pointed out, she has helped us with

1305
01:50:01,998 --> 01:50:30,700
several things including you know funds um and the mayor point of information there i think she might actually be a different title now part of community development or if she returned to her role strictly as energy and environment okay i think she was called the director of planning and development yeah they changed they changed the department name uh okay noted um i will

1306
01:50:32,037 --> 01:50:34,278
Let me... What is it then, currently?

1307
01:50:35,358 --> 01:50:37,398
Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

1308
01:50:37,598 --> 01:50:39,359
She's the director of that.

1309
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:40,639
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1310
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:42,980
Just a newer name for the department.

1311
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:43,880
They restructured a bit.

1312
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:45,200
Sorry.

1313
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,381
Planning... What was that?

1314
01:50:48,781 --> 01:50:51,622
Planning, Development, Sustainability.

1315
01:50:52,762 --> 01:50:54,442
Yeah, Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

1316
01:50:56,063 --> 01:50:57,423
All right.

1317
01:50:57,683 --> 01:50:59,003
Taking a note for myself.

1318
01:51:02,402 --> 01:51:05,104
I threw a link in the chat just to the web page on it.

1319
01:51:06,684 --> 01:51:07,345
Great, thank you.

1320
01:51:08,105 --> 01:51:11,207
Otherwise, it sounds like she runs a Zoom course.

1321
01:51:13,788 --> 01:51:14,208
Class.

1322
01:51:14,749 --> 01:51:15,049
All right.

1323
01:51:15,509 --> 01:51:16,429
And last slide.

1324
01:51:16,669 --> 01:51:20,231
My objectives as chair.

1325
01:51:21,752 --> 01:51:22,973
I would like to try.

1326
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:25,081
Got it.

1327
01:51:25,101 --> 01:51:26,142
I don't know if you all saw that.

1328
01:51:26,562 --> 01:51:27,544
Chrome needs relaunch.

1329
01:51:28,285 --> 01:51:28,505
Good.

1330
01:51:28,685 --> 01:51:29,226
I'm almost done.

1331
01:51:33,331 --> 01:51:35,855
My objectives as chair are to

1332
01:51:37,312 --> 01:51:45,115
get the Medford Police Department to actually commit to bicycle patrols on a regular basis.

1333
01:51:46,375 --> 01:51:51,537
I intend to get bicycle BRAC installation at least started in the city.

1334
01:51:51,557 --> 01:51:56,819
I need to follow up with Todd and Tim to see how that can be done, but that is a goal of mine.

1335
01:51:57,279 --> 01:52:02,921
And I would like to also try and promote efficient meetings where possible, as I know we all have a lot of time.

1336
01:52:03,561 --> 01:52:05,623
I or we don't have a lot of time.

1337
01:52:05,643 --> 01:52:18,751
I would like to see us move to the point where meetings could possibly be slightly more frequent if we needed them to be without being too much of a burden on everyone who joins them.

1338
01:52:19,251 --> 01:52:22,073
So that those are the three main goals that I have.

1339
01:52:22,233 --> 01:52:29,078
I don't need to belabor the point as we are approaching 9pm and I would feel sort of bad not being efficient with this.

1340
01:52:31,799 --> 01:52:35,642
Those are the goals that I have personally set for myself as chair.

1341
01:52:36,342 --> 01:52:37,623
That's the end of the slides.

1342
01:52:39,063 --> 01:52:40,144
There we go.

1343
01:52:40,204 --> 01:52:43,326
That is my attempt to get through those relatively quickly.

1344
01:52:43,506 --> 01:52:43,906
Comments?

1345
01:52:43,946 --> 01:52:44,526
Thanks, Sam.

1346
01:52:46,067 --> 01:52:46,607
Bravo.

1347
01:52:47,848 --> 01:52:48,108
Thanks.

1348
01:52:48,368 --> 01:52:53,271
I don't think you need to go back to the slide.

1349
01:52:53,531 --> 01:52:54,592
One question I had was,

1350
01:52:59,717 --> 01:53:15,768
How we engage with the city council and what I'm sort of thinking about there is I don't exactly know how the budgeting works, but I think the city council has something to do with the city's budget.

1351
01:53:16,148 --> 01:53:20,531
And there's sometimes I hear like, oh, there's not money for bike racks or whatever.

1352
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:29,182
maybe a pathway to having that money for bike racks is through the city council.

1353
01:53:29,242 --> 01:53:35,665
If the city council is like, hey, we should have a, you know, every year we should have like this line item for like bike infrastructure.

1354
01:53:37,966 --> 01:53:38,206
Yes.

1355
01:53:39,007 --> 01:53:44,069
You are correct that we have to raise these to the city council to get a line item specifically.

1356
01:53:44,089 --> 01:53:46,290
We missed the deadline of this year.

1357
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:50,492
And that is on me for not following up with that fast enough.

1358
01:53:52,038 --> 01:53:53,179
That is something that I...
