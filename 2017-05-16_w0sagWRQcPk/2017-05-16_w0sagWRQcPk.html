    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2923.226s">And</a>  we have to send a thank you to the parents, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2926.168s">Without</a>  their support, some of these things would not come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2930.192s">So</a>  thank you parents out there and everyone who has raised a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2937.577s">Now</a>  we'll revert to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2939.559s">Is</a>  there a motion by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2940.6s">Mustone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2941.581s">I</a>  believe that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2942.521s">Is</a>  someone seconded? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2944.363s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2945.904s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2949.775s">Approval</a>  of the minutes of May 1st, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2952.737s">Approval</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2953.438s">Disceri,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2955.139s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2955.72s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2957.441s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2958.221s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2960.924s">Congrats.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2963.846s">Approval</a>  of bills, transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2965.887s">Motion</a>  for approval by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2967.188s">Disceri,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2969.35s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2974.414s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2975.795s">Okay,</a>  on page 3 of 13, there's an amount of $2,188.17 for Frank D'Alessaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2980.396s">It</a>  says, student activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2981.497s">That</a>  seemed like a lot for a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2982.857s">Is</a>  it page 13? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2984.278s">3</a>  of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2984.738s">3</a>  of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2984.998s">Mr.</a>  Delosio is in charge of the Mustang Mall.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2997.06s">And</a>  so undoubtedly, this is reimbursement for product that he had to buy on behalf of that activity.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3001.501s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3003.042s">I</a>  had a couple others, Mr. Bellson, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3006.423s">On</a>  page 6 of 13, under method high miscellaneous charges, it's woodwind and brass wind, $2,125. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3022.895s">Is</a>  that for equipment for our high school band, or it just says miscellaneous charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3029.057s">It's</a>  not like directed to a department or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3031.477s">It</a>  said page six. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3032.778s">Page</a>  six of 13, three quarts, it's about eight.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3036.458s">Woodwind</a>  and brasswing, measure high, miscellaneous charges.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3039.279s">That's</a>  undoubtedly to support the woodwind orchestra activities.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3044.3s">Okay,</a>  it just seemed unusual to have a miscellaneous charge of that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3049.782s">It's</a>  an odd account.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3051.844s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3052.004s">Vanden</a>  Heuvel, point of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3053.344s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3053.705s">As</a>  a secretary, when I signed the bills, I remember signing that and looking at it specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3058.806s">I</a>  have to tell you, because it's two weeks ago, I don't remember what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3061.707s">But</a>  I specifically looked at it and checked it, because I, too, was like, the way that it was categorized seemed funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3068.549s">But</a>  once I saw what it was, it made perfect sense.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3072.35s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3074.291s">Also,</a>  did we? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3075.291s">All</a>  right, I'll ask at the end of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3078.148s">In</a>  relation to that, I was just wondering if we sold any of the pieces as well as any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3082.211s">I</a>  think so.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3082.451s">On</a>  Saturday, we actually, everything was sold at auction.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3085.873s">Saturday?</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3086.194s">And</a>  I believe that pre-discount, pre, you know, the auctioneer's price, which is 10%, that they brought in about $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3093.659s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3093.899s">So</a>  we'll get a report.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3095.64s">We'll</a>  get a report on that.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3097.101s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3097.542s">Happened</a>  on this Saturday, so we need a little more time.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3099.643s">And</a>  then my last question is the last two items on the list on page 13 of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3104.106s">And</a>  it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3107.633s">Professional</a>  tech services, educational, and there's a person's name with the amount of like $2,500 total.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3115.86s">Trying</a>  to, where is this again?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3136.503s">It's</a>  a weird number, 112. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3137.703s">It's</a>  like a grand capital account.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3139.623s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3140.584s">Yeah,</a>  I was just going to look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3142.004s">Yeah,</a>  I'd just like to have more.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3143.864s">I'll</a>  have to look that up when I get back.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3146.325s">Just</a>  like sometimes a little information and knowledge, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3149.065s">Sure,</a>  I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3150.346s">I</a>  have no problem with approving the bills and hearing back from the superintendent about that item.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3270.153s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3271.954s">In</a>  reference to our Committee of the Whole meeting and through you to the superintendent, after going through thoroughly these reports for many years, Mr. Superintendent, it seems that this school year there was an under amount of parent involvement and community reps, and I was wondering if we could instill in our principals to kindly build up the <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3294.598s">parents</a>  that advised them during the year and if we could get some more commitment from the community to work on these school plans and hopefully keep up the good work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3309.383s">I</a>  realize it's tough, but I really think there should be a fair amount of parent participation in these meetings during the year when they present their findings to us.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3318.706s">So</a>  I just would comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3320.327s">The</a>  parents participated in the council <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3324.665s">development,</a>  the attendance at the presentation on Wednesday evening was dependent on the school itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3332.992s">And</a>  several parents were there and were introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3336.014s">One</a>  school did not have anyone there specifically, except one member who was actually a member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3341.458s">But</a>  other than that, each school did introduce people. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3344.961s">And</a>  there are like seven members on a council, so it isn't like there's 50 people on a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3351.007s">I</a>  hear what you're saying and certainly will.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3353.029s">I</a>  just feel that there should be more parent input if we're going to foster transparency.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3356.372s">Well,</a>  it's probably in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3357.653s">It's</a>  in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3358.513s">I</a>  would hope that the councils would actually consult with the parents more completely, but it's a seven-member council, so, you know, theoretically the report reflects them. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3367.621s">The</a>  high school and the voc have students on it, but the other</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3373.603s">Just</a>  as one can remember I'd like to see more parent involvement in kids education Okay, miss miss Cugno Yeah, just points of information on this site councils Some of the schools actually if I'm not mistaking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3387.506s">I</a>  don't know if it was all the elementary schools It's been a while, but I do know that at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3392.408s">They</a>  have some type of almost I don't want to say an election, but they do have <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3398.829s">the</a>  letters that go out to the parents, asking if they are interested in joining, and then if they do get too many parents, because I guess the bylaws does say that there's supposed to be a certain amount on the site councils, that that's when it is brought into some type of an election or a voting system in each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3418.299s">Over</a>  the years, I have been involved, and so I know that that's how it's worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3423.742s">I</a>  know that that's how it's worked in the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3426.17s">And</a>  in the high school vocational side, I do want to mention that this year, the last actually couple of years, the high school and the vocational side have had a lot more parent participation than we've ever had from both sides over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3439.542s">Unfortunately,</a>  depending on people's schedules too, everybody's busy, that we have not had as many from the vocational side on the high school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3450.032s">So</a>  that was just point of information.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3452.662s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3452.862s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3454.043s">I</a>  noticed at the end of the minutes of the meeting that there were various different items that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3459.229s">And</a>  one we had spent considerable time at an earlier meeting, which was broadcast on TV publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3464.795s">So</a>  I just want to read it for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3467.458s">Meeting</a>  with Attorney General clarified the B1, B2 enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3472.182s">Schools</a>  are not an agent of the federal government for the enforcement of immigration law. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3476.765s">Therefore,</a>  our schools do not have to remove any existing B1, B2 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3481.348s">This</a>  was a concern among many of the members, if all the members of the school committee, so I'm just glad to see that that was resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3489.133s">Also,</a>  as a question, I see that there was a discussion to allow direct appointment of fine arts director and the technology director by the superintendent, and I want to ask the superintendent if he's made those</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3502.925s">The</a>  appointment letters are now in process and probably will go out either this week or the beginning of next.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3508.369s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3508.809s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3510.25s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3510.791s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3512.152s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3513.653s">Is</a>  there anyone wishing to speak this evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3515.654s">Anyone?</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3519.857s">Did</a>  we make a motion to accept these?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3524.643s">Reports</a>  of the Superintendent, Pre-Budget Report, English Language Arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3529.825s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3530.545s">We'll</a>  call upon our Director of English Language Arts and Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3542.568s">Dr.</a>  Chiesa. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3543.589s">Good</a>  evening again.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3547.01s">Is</a>  it possible to give the Ethics School update prior to going into the Pre-Budget Report?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3551.571s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3552.667s">I</a>  wanted to update you all on the Ethics Bowl competition that occurred in North Carolina during the weekend of April 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3560.048s">Thanks</a>  to the generosity of the Medford School Committee, our Medford High School Ethics Bowl traveled to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3568.49s">When</a>  they were there, they participated in the 2017 National High School Ethics Bowl competition along with 24 other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3577.272s">They</a>  won two rounds unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3580.598s">They</a>  lost the third round just by one point, and when they tally up the points to make it to the final round, they just fell short just a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3590.906s">Their</a>  poise, their character, and their skill was unprecedented, and I want to thank Mr. Esner, who led that group, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3599.512s">Parsons,</a>  who chaperoned the group as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3602.334s">I'm</a>  very proud to say that the Medford Ethics Bowl team finished in the top 10 in the nation, and that is <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3610.548s">impressive</a>  beyond me. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3611.929s">And</a>  so thank you for your generosity in supporting the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3615.572s">It</a>  was a wonderful trip, and we all greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3619.936s">And</a>  a few of the students that came up this evening were whispering in the superintendent my ear that they had placed in the top 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3626.101s">So</a>  they're very, very proud of that accomplishment.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3628.063s">That's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3628.743s">And</a>  we didn't have certificates tonight because we had honored them in the past, but I certainly want to make sure you had an update on that.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3635.529s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3636.31s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3636.79s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3639.508s">So</a>  the English Language Arts budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3642.409s">The</a>  English Language Arts is dedicated to supporting all our teachers in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3647.492s">Our</a>  curriculum is aligned to the 2011 Massachusetts English Language Arts curriculum framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3654.555s">At</a>  the elementary level, our instructional materials include Journeys 2014 and additional trade books. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3660.838s">At</a>  the middle and high school level, we have Houghton Mifflin anthologies, periodicals, and fictional and non-fictional texts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3669.297s">There</a>  are 29 teachers total in the middle school and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3676.0s">And</a>  seven teachers at the Andrews, seven at the McGlynn, 13 at the high school, and two at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3683.342s">And</a>  one teacher, we have two at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3689.365s">This</a>  year in terms of funding, we were able to purchase some additional Amazon Kindle Fires, which we have identified as <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3697.805s">being</a>  a great investment in terms of keeping the quality of the text compared to using it on the Kindle. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3706.587s">We</a>  purchased some additional Journeys materials due to some rising numbers in the classrooms at the various grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3714.309s">Appropriated</a>  budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school, including periodicals. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3723.053s">and</a>  additional informational and fictional texts were purchased in order to allow for continuity among the grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3731.577s">Accomplishments</a>  for this year included continued implementation of over 100 e-readers at the high school and middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3741.782s">We</a>  continued to do some mock MCAS testing at the elementary and middle school to help comfort students as they prepare for this new format in the exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3752.514s">We</a>  refined some different assessments based on curriculum needs and demands. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3757.576s">We</a>  stayed current with some recent changes that have just occurred to the 2011 ELA framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3765.62s">You</a>  saw many of the authentic learning opportunities tonight that we achieved great success with. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3773.124s">This</a>  year in terms of requesting for funding, I'm asking for an additional funds to purchase Study Island for the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3782.891s">And</a>  that would be supporting for the RTI piece at the middle school level for English. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3789.555s">And</a>  I'm also asking for additional materials to support tier 2 and tier 3 intervention at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3797.6s">Not</a>  sure if anyone has any questions, but thank you for your time for that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3800.902s">Are</a>  there any? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3802.183s">There's</a>  a motion to receive and place on file this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3805.825s">Is</a>  there any? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3806.665s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3807.466s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3807.966s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3809.447s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3810.227s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3811.958s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3812.378s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3814.819s">One</a>  question, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3816.52s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3819.381s">When</a>  we were talking last week with some of the principals, there was a strong request for RTI staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3828.464s">Is</a>  this $17,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3829.344s">What</a>  would that go towards?</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3832.105s">Additional</a>  materials for the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3835.526s">There</a>  are quite a bit of Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3839.908s">We</a>  have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3841.108s">but</a>  a lot of them are consumables. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3843.389s">For</a>  example, there's a write-in reader wherein the paragraph is highlighted for the child and the child can go in and underline. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3851.574s">So</a>  those are the consumables for the Tier 2 and Tier 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3854.135s">I'm</a>  not talking staffing in that request.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3857.397s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3858.057s">So</a>  there was a request for that and there was a lot of talk about the need for that and I'd like your opinion on that.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3867.146s">in</a>  terms of staffing for intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3869.468s">I</a>  think that first we want to look at the logistics of the schedule, and I've already engaged after that meeting, you know, I received some of the feedback from that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3881.195s">I</a>  already spoke with some principals just in terms of organizing the schedule, and I talked briefly with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3888.52s">Caldwell,</a>  Assistant Superintendent Caldwell, about that, which we'll engage more in. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3892.563s">I</a>  think it's logistically in terms of time, if you can <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3896.822s">logistically</a>  put an RTI block in there, but the teachers do have the intervention tools and we have the program in place with the existing interventions. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3908.45s">That's</a>  the need for the additional cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3911.792s">I</a>  don't feel a need for additional staffing at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3915.155s">I'd</a>  like to see how it works with the logistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3918.237s">We</a>  do it at the Andrews a lot in terms of scheduling that RTI block. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3923.2s">To</a>  me, that's step one in terms of getting that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3926.526s">Does</a>  that answer your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3927.648s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3928.31s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3928.69s">But</a>  what was helpful to me is that there were some teachers present and they explained <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3936.468s">that</a>  they do on their own time, early morning, lunch time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3940.031s">And</a>  I know teachers do that in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3942.413s">And</a>  I know that not all teachers can do that because of their home situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3946.176s">They</a>  might not have that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3948.298s">You</a>  know, young children, different reasons that they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3951.441s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that, you know, kids that need Tier 2 and Tier 3, they need more than the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3958.147s">And</a>  some children, you know, you know, we <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3962.054s">what</a>  my goal here is to growth in MCAF scoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3965.597s">And</a>  I really believe that having people, you know, work with those kids that are so close to moving to the next level, that if we do have services in place, that our schools will grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3978.886s">And</a>  that's the community goal, not only the school committee goal or administrative goal or teacher goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3985.151s">You</a>  know, that's a community goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3986.925s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that if that's the need in order to make that growth happen, that we meet that need for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 children. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3997.411s">Sometimes,</a>  I know the superintendent talks a lot about differentiating instruction and I agree with that wholeheartedly, but we're at a point now that we really need to make strides and want to make strides in growth <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4009.574s">with</a>  our scores, and if this is the step necessary, I really would like to look at that before we close this budget, so that way we can appropriate the correct funding for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4019.959s">So</a>  any time that you have to look at this prior to budget, I would like to hear from you and the administrative team. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4028.383s">You</a>  guys are the experts, but I also heard from the front lines already. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4032.485s">So</a>  I'm going to take that very seriously as well.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4035.405s">If</a>  I may mention too, some of the tier two interventions that I'm referencing really give a targeted pre-assessment to figure out where the child is struggling in the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4047.187s">Is</a>  it fluency? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4048.207s">Is</a>  it comprehension? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4050.028s">These</a>  materials can then help hone in on the child's need and the grouping and where they need that help. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4057.469s">But</a>  I have looked at it and I will look at it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4059.909s">Right</a>  now I feel like logistically we need to look at how the schedules align. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4064.275s">and</a>  go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4065.296s">And</a>  I want to say thank you for all your support on that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4069.158s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4069.698s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4071.099s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4071.94s">And</a>  I understand in ELA our scores are a little higher than they are in the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4076.983s">So,</a>  you know, I'm going to ask the same questions about math because district wide our math scores are good, but like there's room for growth in any situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4088.35s">So</a>  I know ELA it might be a little different, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4091.685s">than</a>  it is the situation and the scenario with the mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4095.046s">So</a>  thank you, and I look forward to hearing more from you before the budget about what you really think that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4103.209s">And</a>  I just really want you to speak to some of the people on the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4106.55s">I</a>  know you do on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4107.79s">Yeah,</a>  I followed up with a few after that meeting as well, and I will continue to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4111.912s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4112.552s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4112.852s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4114.07s">Thank</a>  you for the time, Mayor Burke.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4115.972s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4116.652s">We've</a>  already received and placed that on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4118.514s">Now</a>  the Social Studies Pre-Budget Report.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4121.296s">Me</a>  again. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4122.397s">You'll</a>  be done with me soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4125.059s">The</a>  Social Studies Department is committed to providing all students with the academic and problem-solving skills essential for personal development, citizenship, and lifelong learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4136.484s">We</a>  have 27.5 teachers combined in the middle and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4141.485s">That</a>  would be 6 teachers at the Andrews Middle School, 6 teachers at the McGlynn Middle School, 14.5 at the high school, and 1 at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4152.408s">With</a>  the generous support of the school committee, in terms of funding for last year, we were able to purchase some additional 8th grade social studies textbooks, brand new for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4163.032s">We</a>  also purchased some additional online subscriptions for teachers because we find every day with social studies things are changing and the online subscriptions make a lot of sense in terms of keeping us current with what's going on in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4177.399s">Appropriated</a>  budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school level and we had some additional replacement textbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4186.824s">In</a>  addition to that, we purchased managing licenses for the Chromebooks in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4193.954s">ease</a>  any technology issues so we could look at it as a whole through the technology department. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4202.039s">And</a>  we also purchased some additional carts for the security of the Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4205.941s">This</a>  is for the Global Scholars Program, which is offered at the seventh grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4210.924s">Funding</a>  also supported numerous authentic learning opportunities, which is so powerful for these students, including the Model United Nations that you saw tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4221.608s">We</a>  had the Royal House visits coming up for grade five and some other authentic opportunities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4228.89s">And</a>  of course we had some periodicals that were purchased for the middle and high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4234.611s">In</a>  terms of accomplishments for this year, I want to point out that we've had a significant increase in our senior year offerings. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4243.112s">In</a>  the past few years we've had four senior classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4247.418s">that</a>  were either created or reinstated at the high school level that are fully, that are filled, not filled to capacity, they're not bursting at the seams, but they're very popular in choice for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4260.161s">That</a>  includes our honors economics class, we brought back our AP comparative government class, and so it's quite strong showing at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4271.203s">In</a>  addition, we also continued as another accomplishment to really support the Global Scholars Program, including a field trip to the Museum of Science this year, which was wonderful for the 7th grade students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4285.275s">We've</a>  had a significant increase in community partnerships over the last year, including participating in our Veterans Day that you had a report on in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4294.883s">Day</a>  on the Hill, National History Day at the middle and high school level, that model United Nations that we just honored students for, Law Day, Student Government Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4306.253s">It's</a>  a great experience for many different students at many different grade levels, which is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4312.479s">We</a>  continue to do full integration of grades 9 and 10 at the high school and vocational classes, and we continue with our inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4321.04s">full</a>  inclusion at the co-teaching classes for the high school and vocational. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4326.743s">This</a>  year, for additional funding, I am requesting $16,000 in additional funding for our grade 11 U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4335.308s">history</a>  textbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4337.449s">And</a>  the funding would also support an advanced placement human geography class that we are offering at the high school next year.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4349.667s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4351.088s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4351.288s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4352.248s">Does</a>  the human geography course, will it be in place of one of the other AP courses or it's addition to?</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4359.631s">We</a>  don't think it will be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4362.112s">It</a>  might, we have to see where the numbers lie with the course request. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4366.934s">I</a>  can tell you right now we have 45 students that have already requested it and our other senior classes still look quite strong in terms of participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4376.217s">So</a>  we're not pulling away that I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4378.993s">from</a>  anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4379.774s">Of</a>  course, if a child asks for AP Human Geography and honors Econ and for some reason the schedule was the same period, which we try to avoid obviously, that would be the only way it would pull. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4390.639s">But</a>  no, this is just additional interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4392.5s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4393.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4394.681s">It's</a>  fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4395.362s">It's</a>  been great.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4397.268s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4398.088s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4400.69s">Cuno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4400.99s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4401.21s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4401.871s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4402.891s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4404.052s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4404.412s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4405.173s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4405.793s">Thank</a>  you very much tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4406.654s">Thank</a>  you so much for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4407.634s">Great</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4407.934s">Great</a>  job leading this department.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4415.719s">OK,</a>  report on summer programs 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4418.581s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4419.882s">Call</a>  upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4423.364s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4423.604s">Nelson?</a> </p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4426.526s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4427.898s">We've</a>  been busy organizing our summer programs, and we have a full complement of programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4435.34s">Some</a>  of them, as you know, are tuition-based, some of them are supported by grants, and some of them are supported by regular budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4444.923s">We</a>  thank the school committee for those particular programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4449.504s">Again,</a>  many of the programs are academic, some are recreational, and some are a combination <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4456.714s">of</a>  both, and we're really servicing all grades from pre-K through grade 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4463.015s">The</a>  dates and times of the programs vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4466.156s">School</a>  does end on the 22nd, so most of the programs will start that next Monday, which is June 26th, and just about all of them are ended by the end of August, or the third week in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4481.475s">We</a>  are currently in the process of arranging to staff our programs, identifying students who should attend, and arranging outreach to families on the various programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4494.427s">You</a>  have a summary of each of the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4497.189s">The</a>  Summer Fund Program is pretty much as it's been in past years to service elementary students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4503.915s">It</a>  begins on the 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4505.116s">It</a>  ends on August 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4508.155s">and</a>  it's for students in grades K through six. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4510.556s">It's</a>  a full day. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4512.136s">It</a>  begins at 7.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4514.997s">and</a>  ends at 4.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4519.038s">Families</a>  sign up by the week, and the cost is $145 per week, and it includes breakfast every day and pizza on Fridays. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4529.541s">Regular</a>  summer school, this is for students who have failed a subject, grades six through 12, who have to make up <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4536.709s">the</a>  subject in order to advance to the next grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4540.531s">And</a>  this year, we're doing things a little differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4544.312s">The</a>  programs all start on June 26 and end on August 8, which is consistent with the 30-day school committee requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4555.777s">And</a>  all the programs are at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4558.718s">And</a>  again, student tuition supports the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4564.143s">Students</a>  pay $250 a course if they're Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4567.866s">And</a>  we do have a number of outside students who are paying a little bit more, $300 per course. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4574.731s">If</a>  you recall, last year we conducted a pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4577.953s">And</a>  that pilot was to offer online courses for all of the makeup science courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4584.538s">Well,</a>  that proved to be very successful for many reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4588.641s">It</a>  was engaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4589.642s">Students</a>  had kind of a different approach <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4592.102s">to</a>  their learning, which was kind of welcomed after a year of regular instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4598.106s">The</a>  other thing that this did, we were able to offer more science courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4602.189s">So</a>  we actually had students from other communities that didn't have these courses coming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4608.613s">So</a>  that helped to generate a little bit more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4611.667s">And</a>  the other very big plus is that, you know, officially summer school has an ending date, and there are students who sometimes just need a little extra time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4620.79s">This</a>  provided them with the time because we allowed those students, because they could work at their own pace, to have a few more weeks in August to complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4629.472s">And</a>  as the supervisors of summer school were telling me as we were debriefing, this led to several more students actually making it over the bar because they had that extra time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4641.023s">So</a>  given on that experience and given on the fact that the school system has made a commitment to online learning, we've purchased a subscription with Edmentum, which is online courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4653.391s">And</a>  currently we have seniors who are doing credit recovery using this. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4657.974s">We</a>  have other students who are just taking supplemental courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4661.616s">And</a>  we decided that all of summer school will be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4665.498s">Again,</a>  we're going to have facilitators for each subject area. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4670.19s">What</a>  they're doing is they're looking at the course that's the package course and they're making any modifications to make sure it aligns completely with our own courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4680.638s">And</a>  again, we will be running our summer school online for those grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4686.622s">The</a>  only exception is grades six and seven because, again, in debriefing about what happened last year, the summer school coordinators, Jill Sawyer and David Blau, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4698.559s">said</a>  that the 6th and 7th graders taking, you know, all that academic instruction was really very difficult for them, and they really needed a different model. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4707.983s">So</a>  for 6th and 7th graders, they will still be at the high school, but they'll have, be in a kind of a different section of the high school, and they will have regular instruction because we felt that age group maybe couldn't handle complete online instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4721.989s">And</a>  then what we plan to do is to have kind of a break in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4726.103s">and</a>  offer some kind of an activity that is an enrichment activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4730.166s">And</a>  we're kind of making our decisions now on what that will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4733.669s">I</a>  think we might do a little bit of social-emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4737.111s">One</a>  week we'll actually bring them into the vocational setting and let them know more about vocational education. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4743.956s">We'll</a>  probably have some recreational things. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4746.018s">They</a>  can run around and blow off some steam. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4748.42s">And</a>  that will be in the middle part because many of these youngsters have to stay for both the English and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4754.444s">So</a>  that's our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4755.814s">And</a>  we're hoping that, you know, this is a big improvement on what happened last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4759.878s">And</a>  again, that's what we will be doing for regular summer school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4764.242s">Other</a>  programs, and we have several other programs, our English Language Learner Summer Program will service newcomers for the most part, elementary, middle, and high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4775.772s">This</a>  program will be at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4777.994s">We've</a>  contained our programs to the high school, the McGlynn, and the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4783.06s">And</a>  I know that already I've given John McLaughlin the schedule so he can begin the cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4788.003s">So</a>  we're kind of, you know, working that so all the buildings, even though they're being used during the summer, will be properly cleaned when students return in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4798.11s">Again,</a>  you can see the schedule for those EL programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4802.593s">And</a>  again, they are very helpful for these youngsters who really need to have that continuity of language acquisition throughout the summer months. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4813.387s">Last</a>  year and this year we're having our middle school computer science camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4818.35s">It's</a>  really run through the grant that Molly Layden has throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4823.493s">It's</a>  for one week and these are middle school students that have been involved in this project where they're basically learning about apps and actually designing apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4834.96s">It's</a>  very exciting for the students and very engaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4839.092s">The</a>  Medford Vocational Technical School Exploratory Program, again, for middle school students, this was successful last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4845.595s">It's</a>  a two-week program, and students are coming in, they're learning about vocational education, they'll decide, I'm not quite sure exactly which shops are gonna be open for them to use, but they will actually develop a product to take home with them at the end of the experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4862.864s">So</a>  that's another program that's worked out very well, so we wanted to continue that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4869.143s">High</a>  School 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4870.824s">Again,</a>  this program started when we had our academic support grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4876.347s">And</a>  it was so successful that once the grant dried up, the school committee decided to support it through regular budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4883.77s">And</a>  it's been a wonderful program because what we do here is we have our students who are entering grade nine who have been identified as students who maybe need a little bit of an extra push and a little bit of extra help <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4898.847s">you</a>  know, getting into grade nine in terms of finishing their summer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4902.928s">All</a>  eighth grade students have English and mathematics summer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4906.488s">And</a>  we have found that, you know, when they get to school, some of them just haven't done this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4911.889s">So</a>  we want to make sure that they're there, not, you know, kind of getting off to a bad start. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4917.31s">So</a>  what we do is we bring them in three days in August, the last week before school begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4925.452s">They</a>  have teachers there who, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4927.672s">are</a>  helping them to finish this work, and they do academic work for three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4933.035s">They</a>  also have a chance to meet many of the high school administrators because all the administrators are back at this time, and they get tours of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4941.62s">And</a>  then we finish that program with day four, which is the regular ninth grade orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4946.703s">So</a>  these students actually have kind of three extra days where they're getting acclimated to the high school, finishing up their summer work, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4955.71s">And</a>  again, we have a very high attendance rate for the kids that are invited to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4962.915s">So</a>  that is very exciting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4965.796s">A</a>  full complement of special education programs, some of them will be at the high school, some of them will be at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4972.44s">We</a>  have all of our nursing staff in place for the students that need any kind of help with health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4980.365s">And</a>  again, you can see the dates <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4982.576s">Special</a>  education programs are generally developed from the student's IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4986.959s">These</a>  are students who really need summer services to satisfy the requirements of their IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4993.302s">So</a>  that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4994.143s">A</a>  lot of things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4995.684s">Very</a>  busy and we'll be all set to <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4998.145s">begin</a>  right after school gets out. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5000.607s">Questions?</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5001.648s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5001.868s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5002.649s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5003.65s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5004.11s">Nelson,</a>  for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5006.232s">We</a>  do have a lot going on, I guess, this summer, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5009.394s">So</a>  I just want to go over some of the summer school things. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5012.377s">It's</a>  $250 for a Method student, $300 for outside students, but is that for all students even if they're taking the online courses?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5020.844s">These</a>  are students that have to make up courses.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5023.626s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5023.947s">And</a>  so everybody pays the <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5025.831s">tuition</a>  fee.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5026.531s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5026.952s">Whether</a>  they're taking it online or not.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5028.753s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5029.373s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5030.113s">The</a>  other thing is is that do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5038.518s">Like</a>  how many students do we get back for let's say high school 101, the students entering grade nine? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5044.782s">From</a>  what I understand, you don't have to have a particular grade in that.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5048.604s">It's</a>  open to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5049.724s">No,</a>  it's not open to everybody because we couldn't accommodate everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5052.606s">What</a>  it is is the teachers are currently <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5055.045s">Okay,</a>  when we had the grant, under the guidelines of the grant, the students that were invited to come to high school 101, we had to look at their MCAS scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5064.592s">And</a>  they had a certain level, relatively, you know, either warning or needs improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5070.476s">Those</a>  students were invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5071.637s">Now</a>  we no longer are under the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5073.699s">We</a>  don't have the guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5074.739s">So</a>  what we're asking teachers to do is for the teachers to identify students that they think need this extra help. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5082.953s">Okay,</a>  students that they've had in class all year, who maybe don't finish their homework, or maybe haven't gotten a wonderful grade, maybe they're, again, students who just need to have their hands held a little bit and walk through. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5096.477s">Because</a>  it's very, the ninth grade teachers expect the students to have this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5101.099s">And</a>  when the kids arrive day one, and all of a sudden, they don't have that work, it's not a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5106.98s">You</a>  don't want them to start behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5108.921s">So</a>  this has been very successful in making sure those students <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5112.328s">show</a>  up day one, having done the work that's expected of them, and again, teachers are, the eighth grade teachers are identifying who we should invite. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5122.791s">We</a>  usually have about 40 students in the past, and again, the ones that are invited, for the most part, they come. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5131.234s">They</a>  come.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5132.754s">And</a>  you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5139.557s">How</a>  many students did we have?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5141.593s">I'd</a>  have to get you the exact numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5143.394s">Any</a>  student that had to take a science makeup class did it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5146.995s">And</a>  I'd have to get from David or Jill the exact numbers of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5150.697s">But</a>  again, things that happen, you know, when you try something out, you expect certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5156.599s">But</a>  then sometimes there are extra things that are very good things that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5161.161s">And</a>  I think one of the things that David and Jill were very excited about is that the students who would have had to end on that day in August when the last day of school took place, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5170.341s">and</a>  maybe would have failed were allowed to continue on on their own and they were successful by having another two weeks where they could just work on this course. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5180.428s">And</a>  that's something we didn't really count on, but you know what, that's a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5184.071s">So</a>  summer school doesn't have to officially end when the teachers walk away from the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5188.874s">The</a>  students can still continue on and can be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5193.345s">So</a>  we were very happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5194.806s">What</a>  was the feedback from the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5197.647s">From</a>  what I hear, they liked doing it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5201.088s">We</a>  don't just leave them by themselves in a room. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5203.029s">I</a>  mean, there are these teachers, facilitators there that they can ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5207.351s">We</a>  also make sure that somebody in technology is around in case something breaks down. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5212.693s">We're</a>  hoping to keep the classes because when we had just the science, we put them in the labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5218.975s">But</a>  now that we're going to have all the courses online, we're going to use regular classrooms with Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5223.743s">And</a>  again, we're kind of making sure that everything's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5226.824s">We're</a>  working with the technology department to make sure that if we have 100 kids online at one time, it's going to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5234.286s">So</a>  we're trying to flush all that out so there are no problems.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5237.407s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5238.227s">And</a>  as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5244.409s">From</a>  what I understand, they can accelerate at their own pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5248.431s">I</a>  mean, they have to physically <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5250.37s">be</a>  at the high school to satisfy the requirement of being on site for those hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5255.812s">But</a>  my understanding is pretty much self-paced. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5259.434s">Bernadette,</a>  you've worked with this too, and you can correct me if I'm giving misinformation, but they're pretty much self-paced, and they're like in modules. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5267.237s">So</a>  actually, you and I might be taking the same course, sitting side by side, but you could be doing something very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5273.939s">Maybe</a>  you're well ahead of me, and I'm just struggling to do something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5278.203s">My</a>  understanding is that's how it works in Bernadette if you want to add anything.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5283.012s">I</a>  just want to add that a student could log on at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5287.774s">So</a>  if a student wants to do more work, um, but we do need to stay true to the requirement of the number of hours that they need to have in the classroom, um, is what's a balancing act. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5298.397s">We</a>  don't want them to go too far ahead and then come to school with, with nothing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5302.399s">So</a>  at least in the beginning, they will be encouraged to, um, to do the work within the classroom and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5309.365s">You</a>  know, if they need it, certainly they'll be able to log on at home.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5312.587s">Because</a>  my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5313.128s">One</a>  additional thing, too, about the program at Mentum is that there are other things, like Bernadette said, what if we have that student who finishes the second day and is done with the course? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5322.214s">Very</a>  unlikely, but who knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5324.756s">We</a>  also have, there are other courses that are very helpful, like there's a course called Study Skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5331.801s">So</a>  some of these students could benefit from taking an online course on study skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5335.824s">So</a>  if we see that happening, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5338.213s">we</a>  can intervene with some other products, some other programs within this material that we've purchased that can be useful to these kids too. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5347.377s">Because</a>  we just don't want them sitting there obviously.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5349.778s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5350.158s">And</a>  the other, my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse because now if, you know, other people do have that accessibility, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5363.357s">And</a>  I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're feeling because now they're falling behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5368.46s">So</a>  I guess my question is too is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5381.028s">Right</a>  now, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5382.269s">We'd</a>  have to, you know, obviously look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5384.59s">That's</a>  a suggestion I can make to David and Jill if they can get staff to stay a little bit extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5390.034s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5392.015s">Again,</a>  we will monitor, you know, what kids are doing in terms of the expectation is that they're doing this work in the hours that they're supposed to be in summer school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5403.404s">But</a>  there are always kids who just feel, you know, we like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5406.226s">You</a>  don't want to stop somebody from going home and pursuing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5409.509s">So</a>  we don't want to discourage that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5411.411s">So</a>  we'll try to find a way to work around it, maybe offer an extra hour in the library that they can come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5418.056s">I'll</a>  speak to David about that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5419.379s">Okay,</a>  and you, and one last question was that you have, you have introductory physics, chemistry, and biology online. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5426.664s">Are</a>  those the same courses that are going to be provided this year or are you going to add more?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5430.367s">I</a>  think those are the three that were identified by Mrs. Cieri as what the kids needed to make up.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5436.031s">Okay,</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5437.452s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5437.652s">Mustone,</a>  I was just wondering about the English language learner summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5442.774s">So</a>  out of the newcomers at the Roberts and the newcomers at middle school and the newcomers at the high school, what percent would you say take advantage of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5450.143s">Because</a>  I think it's a great program.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5452.957s">I</a>  have to check with Mrs. Trotter on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5457.378s">It</a>  is free. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5458.358s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5458.778s">So</a>  free always encourages people to come.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5460.538s">And</a>  lunch and transportation, I would think you could get a hundred percent.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5463.259s">Yeah,</a>  because she has the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5464.079s">That's</a>  a Title III grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5465.399s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5465.859s">I</a>  mean, it's unfortunate that, you know, some of the programs we can offer transportation, some we can offer food.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5470.88s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5471.14s">But</a>  it really is dependent upon if we have grant funding for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5475.461s">So</a>  I can check with her to see how many kids actually <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5480.388s">come</a>  who are invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5482.409s">Those</a>  students are pretty motivated, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5485.492s">They</a>  tend to go to most things they're invited to.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5489.654s">And</a>  then on the special ed program, the last part is there's approximately 142 students requiring the various services. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5496.679s">Do</a>  all 142 take advantage of these programs?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5501.903s">Well,</a>  again, this is part of what they're supposed to be doing on their IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5506.286s">I</a>  believe they get a pretty good attendance rate on that because <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5509.924s">The</a>  parents want the kids to have the services during the summer.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5513.326s">So</a>  can I make a motion to see if Kathy could tell us what percent comes and if Trotter could tell us what percent comes to the... Sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5522.031s">Just</a>  maybe if they're not 100%, maybe there's a way to outreach more to get more people to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5526.833s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5527.994s">So</a>  I will get the data on that.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5530.555s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5531.516s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5532.656s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5532.736s">Vander</a>  Kloof.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5534.784s">I</a>  just wanted to ask about the summer school program in terms of tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5541.106s">For</a>  students who are on free or reduced lunch, you know, potentially if they fail two subjects, it's $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5548.788s">Do</a>  we have a reduced cost for students who are clearly economically disadvantaged?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5557.791s">We</a>  work with families who have special circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5561.532s">I</a>  know that <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5563.03s">Sometimes</a>  it's a payment plan so they don't have to do all of the tuition up front and I know there are times that we're very forgiving if the circumstances are such, but we take it on an individual case. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5575.517s">To</a>  say that everyone who is free and reduced lunch gets reduction in tuition is not what we're currently doing, but we do obviously take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5584.843s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5585.043s">As</a>  long as I know that there's... We don't turn people away who need it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5588.145s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5588.885s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5590.066s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5591.347s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5592.54s">My</a>  question is actually directed towards the mayor and it's in regard to the summer recreation book. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5599.99s">If</a>  that is went to print today.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5602.331s">Oh,</a>  that's our summer recreation has a litany of programming You know sports camps some of the programs that you have we have similar camps that are going to be had and music camps There's quite a bit that's going to be in the catalog and it went to print today So we're hoping to have it next week.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5617.236s">And</a>  where will they be available be distributing through the schools?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5620.877s">We'll</a>  be doing backpacks and it'll also be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5623.158s">I</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5623.899s">Will</a>  there be any up at the library, just in case people need them? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5627.165s">We</a>  always put them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5628.267s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5629.269s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5630.603s">Yes,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5631.063s">Van</a>  de Kloop.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5631.544s">Just</a>  one last thing.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5632.484s">Whenever</a>  we discuss the summer fund program, I think I ought to give kudos to Anne Marie Cuno, our colleague, who really got it off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5640.789s">So</a>  just want to mention that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5642.67s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5646.252s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5646.512s">Kripps.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5646.772s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5647.153s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5648.493s">I</a>  just wanted to mention we were at the West Medford Community Center the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5651.895s">And</a>  they're having a summer camp as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5655.217s">It's</a>  10 weeks, June 26 to September 1, 8 AM to 6 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5660.802s">middle</a>  school, six to eight, and it's $175 a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5665.627s">And</a>  you only pay for the weeks you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5667.649s">So</a>  I just wanted to mention it, and if anybody's interested, there's still, space is limited, but there's still space available.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5673.435s">Very</a>  good, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5674.136s">And</a>  they have a continuing college program? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5676.678s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5679.437s">very</a>  good is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file miss vandekloot has a question no i just noticed that in our uh... the form it says that the uh... summer fund program runs seven thirty p m to four thirty p m it just needs to be corrected just in the report thanks eagle eyes very good backwards back to the future there's a motion for approval offered by miss vandekloot seconded by miss kunio all those in favor aye all those opposed <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5709.96s">Papers</a>  received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5712.422s">And</a>  our final report on English language learners newcomers program redistribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5717.246s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5719.167s">So</a>  one of the discussions we've had recently is the concentration of students who are ELL in any one elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5728.454s">And</a>  the newcomers program has historically been at the Roberts, but the numbers have become very substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5736.02s">And</a>  one of the discussions that we had was how can we <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5739.791s">spread</a>  them out and redistribute them a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5741.993s">In</a>  earlier discussions, we talked about splitting, let's say, grades 1 and 2 at one school and 3, 4, and 5 at another. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5751.339s">And</a>  so this particular report tells you that next year it's our plan to send grades 1 and 2 to the Brooks School for two reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5762.047s">One,</a>  it will redistribute the newcomers program, not all ELL students, but the newcomers program. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5767.831s">And</a>  also, it will create more <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5769.876s">of</a>  a balance between the two schools, because the population at the Brooks is lower than the population at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5776.319s">Put</a>  the two together, they'll come up with a similar population, and the diversity level at the Brooks will increase substantially, and that will be helpful as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5785.783s">So</a>  that's our goal, that's what we're doing, and we plan to move ahead unless there's an objection.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5793.438s">Do</a>  you have any questions, miss? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5794.598s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5795.418s">You're</a>  good?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5796.779s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5798.099s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5799.559s">I</a>  think this is a great idea, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5806.901s">There</a>  has been significant parent presence at some of our meetings worried about the class size and where space was available at our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5817.643s">And</a>  I really believe that this is a really <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5820.745s">good</a>  way to look at this, and we can watch it closely next year and make any other adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5826.987s">All</a>  that I ask is if it does cause hardships to individual families, that you take that into account and work with those families and make sure that the transition works well for those families. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5841.873s">And</a>  if there's great hardship of separating siblings, you keep that in mind when placement is necessary.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5851.46s">I</a>  think it's very important for us to maybe make a statement at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5855.743s">We</a>  talked about this the other night at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5859.826s">We</a>  can't make everybody happy all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5862.468s">There's</a>  going to be decisions that are going to be made that are going to require people to accept certain kinds of things for distribution purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5869.214s">Now</a>  this year we'll do it with the elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5871.383s">But</a>  as we go into next year, we're going to have to take a very strong look at the middle school and redistribute students. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5877.485s">Because</a>  otherwise, one school will be very heavy with certain types of students who require certain services. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5883.106s">Other</a>  schools will be less populated and have other challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5889.047s">So</a>  people ask for certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5891.728s">We</a>  do our best to accommodate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5893.629s">From</a>  time to time, we have to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5896.289s">And</a>  not everybody's going to be happy with that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5899.588s">the</a>  nature of trying to be fair to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5902.511s">Um,</a>  and sometimes in transition, uh, there are a few people that feel like we didn't consider their particular situation, but we'll try to consider as many situations as we can.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5914.02s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5915.381s">Miss</a>  Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5917.043s">I</a>  think my biggest concern is sometimes older students are in charge of looking after younger siblings and by splitting the families, uh, between two schools, which I certainly understand why we're <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5928.69s">moving</a>  in that direction, that could create some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5933.752s">And</a>  that's the place that I'm most concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5937.693s">And</a>  there may be some interesting and creative solutions to that for families, but I think that we just need to be very, very well aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5947.457s">And</a>  most importantly is the information to the families, so we're aware of any real problems ahead of time.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5955.487s">One</a>  of the things we'll do after tonight is we'll actually reach out to the families that will be affected by school transitions this week and start to let them know what our plans are. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5966.191s">And</a>  then we do have after school programs and other things like that that we can work out some arrangements for people who have particular needs that really are under stress. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5975.485s">We've</a>  got to be very careful that we don't just assume that everybody is going to get everything that they want, because if we do that, we give ourselves an unbearable goal, an unattainable goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5987.017s">So</a>  from time to time, you make a decision, you do it in the vast majority of people involved, and you try to work on the edges with the people that may be affected adversely.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5997.085s">Could</a>  you address what happens in third grade when they've finished, let's say, a second grade newcomer?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6000.806s">In</a>  third grade, if they're, hopefully by third grade, they're no longer a newcomer.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6003.766s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6004.447s">So</a>  they can go back to their school of origin or their geographical school.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6008.207s">And</a>  they'll have a preference in that transfer.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6009.928s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6010.708s">They</a>  would go back to their school of origin. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6012.388s">So</a>  the goal is to get them out of the newcomers program as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6015.749s">A</a>  couple of years should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6017.89s">And</a>  that would hope that they wouldn't have to go to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6021.05s">They</a>  could go back to school of origin.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6023.531s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6023.671s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6029.251s">That</a>  was my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6031.871s">All</a>  righty. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6032.211s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive in place on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6034.592s">Mr.</a>  Skerry made the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6035.752s">Is</a>  there a second by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6036.812s">Van</a>  der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6037.672s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6039.053s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6039.773s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6044.254s">We</a>  have one item of new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6046.194s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Reverend Edward Dowdy, <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6051.358s">Father</a>  Ed was the pastor of the Collaboration of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6053.738s">Francis</a>  and St. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6054.619s">Joseph</a>  Churches in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6056.099s">If</a>  you could all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of Reverend Father Dowding. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6071.021s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, a couple of announcements.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6072.842s">So</a>  on Wednesday evening last, you asked me for some dates, and I gave you the wrong dates a couple of days later.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6078.043s">Yeah,</a>  graduation.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6081.503s">And</a>  what I wanted to see was just how, you know, attentive you are to what I send out. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6087.229s">And</a>  Kathy was the only one who picked it up, so sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6090.312s">The</a>  rest of you just weren't paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6091.913s">No,</a>  I'm just kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6093.294s">So</a>  I've given you corrected dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6096.137s">June</a>  6 is the Curtis Tufts graduation, 1130 at the Irish American. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6102.123s">Now</a>  11 o'clock? <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6102.944s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6105.006s">This</a>  says 1130.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6112.69s">If</a>  you get there half an hour later, you'll be there in time for the food. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6119.676s">The</a>  M-Corp banquet is on June 6th in the evening, and graduation is on the 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6126.854s">A</a>  couple of other things, we have a meeting this Wednesday evening to interview ELL candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6132.096s">I</a>  have at least three candidates, good candidates for you to see, possibly a fourth by tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6137.557s">We'll</a>  make sure we check out a couple of references. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6140.918s">And</a>  that's Wednesday starting at 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6144.599s">We've</a>  reserved the 22nd and the 25th for additional meetings, possibly for community schools or for other situations, and also possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6154.181s">to</a>  interview the candidates for the vocational director's principal's job. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6158.422s">I'm</a>  still going through applications, talking to references. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6161.123s">There's</a>  some things happening out there in that type of community, the vocational director's community, that may portend for us to postpone that and move it a little bit further out to get all the candidates that I want to have in the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6173.847s">But</a>  we'll see that and we'll know that better in the next week or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6179.369s">In</a>  addition to that, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6182.761s">you</a>  should know that the senate is coming out with its ways and means budget tomorrow that gives us a better idea of what the senate is proposing versus what the house is proposing and what we might be looking at for state funding and budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6196.404s">We're</a>  still looking at federal dollars as they get sifted around in reports from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6203.025s">So</a>  all those things have an impact on you and I just want to make sure you're aware of it.</p>
