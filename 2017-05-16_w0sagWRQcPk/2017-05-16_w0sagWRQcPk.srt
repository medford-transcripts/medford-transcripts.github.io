33
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:21,546

[SPEAKER_09]: There are several different categories that students can enter, and I'm very pleased to say that this is the second year we've had middle school students in addition to high school students entering.

41
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:58,944
[SPEAKER_09]: This program is for students for grades seven through 12, and all writing pieces are judged on originality, technical skill,

42
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,249
[SPEAKER_09]: and the emergence of personal voice.

43
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:11,295
[SPEAKER_09]: At the national level, we do have students who won a gold key and a silver key have the opportunity to submit nationally.

44
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:22,142
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very pleased to say that in addition to all of the state recipients that we'll honor tonight, we also have a silver medal for a student that won the national competition.

45
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:23,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So she will be called up as well.

46
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:31,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank, before we call the students, all the teachers who worked tirelessly to help with the students with the written production.

47
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:32,539
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Ms.

48
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,000

53
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:55,314
[SPEAKER_09]: and Miss Sanford, who worked with the students.

54
00:02:55,815 --> 00:03:03,604
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can call the students up, I think you'll begin first with the National Silver Medal, and then they'll go from there.

55
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:04,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

56
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:05,827

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:37,185

00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:44,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It was held at Northeastern University, and it's sponsored by the United Nations Association of Greater Boston.

171
00:15:45,006 --> 00:16:00,709

172
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:06,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Although the high school has participated in the past, this is the second year we've had the middle school come

173
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:08,808
[SPEAKER_09]: to form a team as well.

174
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:16,834

175
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:27,621
[SPEAKER_09]: And the two regional conferences covered topics from maternal health, containment of ISIS, peacekeeping, climate change, free press, and human trafficking.

176
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:34,206
[SPEAKER_09]: All participating students were exemplary in their performance, and I'm very pleased to say that in addition to their participation,

177
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,864
[SPEAKER_09]: We also won awards for best negotiators and best position papers.

178
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,405

00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:46,830

183
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:12,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if he made it back.

184
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:16,368

287
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:55,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Amin only missed one question and he also chose to take the challenge round which meant that he actually answered all of the questions from the final round and he did so correctly.

00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:56,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore in total

290
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:01,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So proud of him.

291

292
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:10,553
[SPEAKER_09]: So congratulations to him.

322
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:11,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Nationally, there are over a half a million students who compete in this historic day.

323
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:13,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Students are provided with a theme.

324
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:15,865
[SPEAKER_09]: The theme this year was take a stand.

[SPEAKER_09]: You'll all receive invitations.

330
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,753

331
00:30:46,831 --> 00:30:51,615
[SPEAKER_09]: all have different products that they completed, so we welcome you to come and you'll get invitations for that.

332
00:30:52,015 --> 00:31:03,804
[SPEAKER_09]: But the students that we're gonna call took the time to get this done early, to do the annotated bibliographies that go with it, quite a lot of work, and we're just so proud of them for competing.

333
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:05,024

00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:50,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for all the students that came up and all the teachers that mentored them throughout this whole process.

[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, Pedro.

377
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:10,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed that it said that the students' work would be posted on our website with their parents' permission.

378
00:35:11,304 --> 00:35:16,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to say, when it was posted last year, I read every one, and it was great.

379
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:21,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really hope that parents should get permission so that we can read your students' work.

380
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:22,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for mentioning that.

381
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:23,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

382
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:23,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,537

00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:26,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

385
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe Mr. Cieri is in the audience.

386
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:31,344
[SPEAKER_06]: There he is.

387
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:36,165
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna do the Medford High School Science Fair Awards next.

388
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:38,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everyone.

389
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:46,128
[SPEAKER_12]: 48 Medford High School students participated in the annual Science Fair at Medford High School this year.

390
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:51,929
[SPEAKER_12]: From our event, a select number of students move on to regional and state events.

391
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,310
[SPEAKER_12]: These events go from March all the way to May.

392
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,151
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, last week,

393
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:01,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was last Saturday, not this past Saturday.

394
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,661
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the very final event, which was the state fair.

395
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:11,087
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are a large number of events that students pass through in order to qualify for each level.

396
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:17,591
[SPEAKER_12]: At the regional fair, there are two students that placed in the top 26.

397
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:23,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Those students moved on to the state fair, and they placed there as well this past week.

398
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:26,097
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're really excited to be able to present our awards tonight.

399
00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:33,496
[SPEAKER_12]: to all the students that won an award at our fair, and to recognize those students that participated in the regional and state fair.

[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, excellent.

401
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:40,000

00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:17,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

426
00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:20,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to mention that the Farrah brothers

427
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:28,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Albert and Joseph both continued on to the regional and the state fair and were placed in both.

428
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,561
[SPEAKER_12]: So, they did a really good job.

429
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:36,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

430
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,249

[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see a theme happen here.

432
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:55,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Miss Joy.

433
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:56,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

434
00:40:57,407 --> 00:41:00,313
[SPEAKER_13]: We're very proud of this group of students that we

435
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:07,602
[SPEAKER_13]: bring before you tonight, and you've seen some familiar faces that tells you a little bit of how well-rounded these students are.

436
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:22,325
[SPEAKER_13]: They competed this year at the 2017 Greater New England Regional Bat Ball Tournament at the University of Massachusetts Lowell on Saturday, April 29.

437
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:27,087
[SPEAKER_13]: The team, under the advisership of mathematics teacher, Ms.

438
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:27,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Barbara Chen,

439
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:38,276
[SPEAKER_13]: With the support from My Day, Technology of Medford proudly brought back four awards to the district.

440
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:44,742
[SPEAKER_13]: First, they scored a second place overall trophy.

441
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:56,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, a Spirit of Botball trophy, a seeding third place certificate, and double elimination third place certificate.

442
00:41:57,438 --> 00:42:03,523
[SPEAKER_13]: The team finished second overall out of 18 teams, and this is

443
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,480
[SPEAKER_13]: over all of New England.

444
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:18,270
[SPEAKER_13]: The overall winners for the bar ball are determined by their double elimination rank, ceiling round scores online, and on-site documentation scores.

445
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:28,234
[SPEAKER_13]: In the seeding, the teams run their robots unopposed in an attempt to score the most points possible.

446
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:44,677
[SPEAKER_13]: In double elimination, the robots from two different teams compete on the game table simultaneously in an effort to score as many points as possible, but also to keep their opponent from scoring.

447
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:54,755
[SPEAKER_13]: In the category of judges' choice trophies, the judges singled out Medford's team for the Spirit of Rockball award.

448
00:42:55,235 --> 00:43:01,137
[SPEAKER_13]: So we would like to congratulate the team members for their hard work, determination, and perseverance.

449
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:03,458
[SPEAKER_13]: They were here many, many long nights.

450
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:04,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And Ms.

451
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:11,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Bower-Chen for her leadership and oversight, and parents, guardians, and community members for their support.

452
00:43:21,823 --> 00:43:23,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Our first recipient is Ms.

453
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:25,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Barbara Chin, advisor.

454
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:34,772
[SPEAKER_06]: How'd you do?

455
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:36,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.

456
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:38,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to say a few words?

457
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:41,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to speak?

458
00:43:41,256 --> 00:43:42,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Either one, you can use either one.

459
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:46,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so proud of the team.

460
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,501
[SPEAKER_01]: The students work very, very hard, okay?

461
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:50,923
[SPEAKER_01]: They take a lot of determination and

462
00:43:51,750 --> 00:44:00,152
[SPEAKER_01]: and also persevere, and also they have to make a lot of decisions on their own because adults are not supposed to be involved in the competition.

463
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:06,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have to decide which strategy to use, whose strategy to use.

464
00:44:06,294 --> 00:44:08,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a lot of time to work as a team.

465
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:17,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is time for them to develop, work together, collaboratively, and they enjoy working together.

466
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:35,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Matthew Avella, Outstanding Performance at the 2017 Spotball Tournament.

467

00:47:12,682 --> 00:47:13,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Mr. Van Schor here?

490
00:47:19,475 --> 00:47:19,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:21,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

493
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:21,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Devanshore?

494
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:22,957
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she's not here.

495
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:30,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, congratulations.

496
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:32,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, Mr. Superintendent.

497
00:47:32,862 --> 00:47:34,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen.

498
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:39,866
[SPEAKER_11]: As you look around, you see the incredible achievements of our young people.

499
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:43,648
[SPEAKER_11]: But also very important, two things that I want to highlight.

500
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:48,791
[SPEAKER_11]: One, the diversity of our student body and the achievements of this diversity.

501
00:47:53,184 --> 00:48:02,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's one of the factors that makes Medford so great and a great place to grow up, because you get to grow up and experience a lot of different cultures and work together.

502
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And the second key thing is that all of these achievements come through collaboration.

503
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:11,772
[SPEAKER_11]: working together with your teachers, working with each other, working as a team.

504
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:14,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the secret to success in almost anything.

505
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:18,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Very few people do anything alone by themselves without good help.

506
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:21,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And so congratulations to all of you, to your parents.

507
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:23,477
[SPEAKER_11]: They've collaborated with you.

508
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:24,678
[SPEAKER_11]: You've collaborated with them.

509
00:48:24,698 --> 00:48:26,079
[SPEAKER_11]: You've collaborated with each other.

510
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:34,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And you make Medford very proud of the way you represent us, both as a diverse community and as a community that cares about its people.

511
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

512
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:46,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to send a thank you to the parents, of course.

513
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:50,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Without their support, some of these things would not come to fruition.

514
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:53,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you parents out there and everyone who has raised a child.

515
00:48:57,577 --> 00:48:59,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we'll revert to the regular order of business.

516
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:00,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion by Ms.

517
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone?

518
00:49:01,581 --> 00:49:02,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's it.

519
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:04,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Is someone seconded?

520
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:05,183
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

521
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:06,665
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

522
00:49:09,775 --> 00:49:12,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Approval of the minutes of May 1st, 2017.

523
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:13,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Approval by Ms.

524
00:49:13,438 --> 00:49:15,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Disceri, seconded by Ms.

525
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:15,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

526
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

527
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:18,181
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

528
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

529
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:21,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats.

530
00:49:23,846 --> 00:49:25,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

531
00:49:25,887 --> 00:49:27,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Ms.

532
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:29,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Disceri, seconded by Ms.

533
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:29,950
[SPEAKER_06]: DiBenedetto.

534
00:49:34,414 --> 00:49:35,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

535
00:49:35,795 --> 00:49:40,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on page 3 of 13, there's an amount of $2,188.17 for Frank D'Alessaro.

536
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, student activities.

537
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:42,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That seemed like a lot for a student.

538
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it page 13?

539
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:44,698
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 of 13.

540
00:49:44,738 --> 00:49:44,918
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 of 13.

541
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:46,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Delosio is in charge of the Mustang Mall.

542
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And so undoubtedly, this is reimbursement for product that he had to buy on behalf of that activity.

543
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:01,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

544
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a couple others, Mr. Bellson, if you don't mind.

545
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:19,567
[SPEAKER_05]: On page 6 of 13, under method high miscellaneous charges, it's woodwind and brass wind, $2,125.

546
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:28,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that for equipment for our high school band, or it just says miscellaneous charges.

547
00:50:29,057 --> 00:50:31,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like directed to a department or anything.

548
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:32,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It said page six.

549
00:50:32,778 --> 00:50:36,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Page six of 13, three quarts, it's about eight.

550
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:39,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Woodwind and brasswing, measure high, miscellaneous charges.

551
00:50:39,279 --> 00:50:43,300
[SPEAKER_11]: That's undoubtedly to support the woodwind orchestra activities.

552
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it just seemed unusual to have a miscellaneous charge of that amount.

553
00:50:49,782 --> 00:50:50,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an odd account.

554
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:51,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

555
00:50:52,004 --> 00:50:53,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Vanden Heuvel, point of information?

556
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:53,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

557
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:58,786
[SPEAKER_08]: As a secretary, when I signed the bills, I remember signing that and looking at it specifically.

558
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to tell you, because it's two weeks ago, I don't remember what it was.

559
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:08,529
[SPEAKER_08]: But I specifically looked at it and checked it, because I, too, was like, the way that it was categorized seemed funny.

560
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:11,990
[SPEAKER_08]: But once I saw what it was, it made perfect sense.

561
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,211
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

562
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:14,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, did we?

563
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:16,872
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'll ask at the end of this.

564
00:51:18,148 --> 00:51:22,191
[SPEAKER_05]: In relation to that, I was just wondering if we sold any of the pieces as well as any of that.

565
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:22,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

566
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:25,513
[SPEAKER_11]: On Saturday, we actually, everything was sold at auction.

567
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:26,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday?

568
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:33,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe that pre-discount, pre, you know, the auctioneer's price, which is 10%, that they brought in about $20,000.

569
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:33,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

570
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:35,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get a report.

571
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,021
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get a report on that.

572
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:37,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

573
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Happened on this Saturday, so we need a little more time.

574
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:44,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my last question is the last two items on the list on page 13 of 13.

575
00:51:44,106 --> 00:51:44,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's,

576
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:55,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Professional tech services, educational, and there's a person's name with the amount of like $2,500 total.

577
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying to, where is this again?

578
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,625
[SPEAKER_05]: The last two items.

579
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:02,046
[SPEAKER_06]: The last two items, last page.

580
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:02,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Zenia?

581
00:52:03,747 --> 00:52:04,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

582
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,030
[SPEAKER_08]: On page what?

583
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,171
[SPEAKER_05]: The last page.

584
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:07,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Page 13 of 13.

585
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:10,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Last two items listed.

586
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:11,875
[SPEAKER_05]: The last two.

587
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:16,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just have to look that up when I get back to the office.

588
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:17,563
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a weird number, 112.

589
00:52:17,703 --> 00:52:19,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a grand capital account.

590
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:19,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

591
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:21,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was just going to look into that.

592
00:52:22,004 --> 00:52:23,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd just like to have more.

593
00:52:23,864 --> 00:52:25,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to look that up when I get back.

594
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:29,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like sometimes a little information and knowledge, that's all.

595
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I understand.

596
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:35,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no problem with approving the bills and hearing back from the superintendent about that item.

597
00:52:35,647 --> 00:52:37,547
[SPEAKER_06]: On the second, motion for approval.

598
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:38,527
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

599
00:52:38,547 --> 00:52:38,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

600
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:39,868
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

601
00:52:39,928 --> 00:52:40,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

603
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:20,134
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone has any particular questions, if there's anything in it, you can certainly respond to it, but I think it's self-explanatory and we'll just enter into the record with your approval.

604
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:22,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

605
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:37,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I know at this meeting we had a very productive meeting and we met with all the principals as well as some teaching staff and it was really good insight as to what's going on at each building and how they use the funds that they were allocated this year.

606
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:42,224
[SPEAKER_05]: and what their needs are for next year, and I appreciate the manner in which it's all presented.

607
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:51,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But at that meeting, we were supposed to have a secondary agenda item, and it's not listed in the minutes, and it wasn't presented at that night, the PTO information.

608
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:59,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like it added to the minutes because we had moved that report to the subcommittee meeting, and then it didn't happen at subcommittee meeting.

609
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want it noted that it didn't happen there.

610
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:08,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you could amend these notes and bring them back to us at our next meeting for approval, I'd be happy with the new report.

611
00:54:08,843 --> 00:54:11,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still under request of report on our agenda.

612
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:21,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but I want it noted that it was discussed this evening, and that it was supposed to be discussed and brought up at that subcommittee meeting, and it wasn't.

613
00:54:21,312 --> 00:54:24,055
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion as amended for the committee of the whole report.

614
00:54:24,315 --> 00:54:25,095
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

615
00:54:25,115 --> 00:54:25,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

616
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:26,717
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

617
00:54:26,757 --> 00:54:27,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

618
00:54:27,757 --> 00:54:28,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

619
00:54:30,153 --> 00:54:30,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry.

620
00:54:31,954 --> 00:54:53,426
[SPEAKER_10]: In reference to our Committee of the Whole meeting and through you to the superintendent, after going through thoroughly these reports for many years, Mr. Superintendent, it seems that this school year there was an under amount of parent involvement and community reps, and I was wondering if we could instill in our principals to kindly build up the

621
00:54:54,598 --> 00:55:08,283
[SPEAKER_10]: parents that advised them during the year and if we could get some more commitment from the community to work on these school plans and hopefully keep up the good work that we're doing.

622
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:18,306
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize it's tough, but I really think there should be a fair amount of parent participation in these meetings during the year when they present their findings to us.

623
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:20,307
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just would comment on that.

624
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:23,968
[SPEAKER_11]: The parents participated in the council

625
00:55:24,665 --> 00:55:32,411
[SPEAKER_11]: development, the attendance at the presentation on Wednesday evening was dependent on the school itself.

626
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:35,173
[SPEAKER_11]: And several parents were there and were introduced.

627
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:41,018
[SPEAKER_11]: One school did not have anyone there specifically, except one member who was actually a member of the school committee.

628
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:44,541
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, each school did introduce people.

629
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:49,765
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are like seven members on a council, so it isn't like there's 50 people on a council.

630
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:52,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear what you're saying and certainly will.

631
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:56,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel that there should be more parent input if we're going to foster transparency.

632
00:55:56,372 --> 00:55:57,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's probably in the report.

633
00:55:57,653 --> 00:55:58,493
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the report.

634
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:07,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope that the councils would actually consult with the parents more completely, but it's a seven-member council, so, you know, theoretically the report reflects them.

635
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:09,903
[SPEAKER_11]: The high school and the voc have students on it, but the other

636
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:27,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as one can remember I'd like to see more parent involvement in kids education Okay, miss miss Cugno Yeah, just points of information on this site councils Some of the schools actually if I'm not mistaking it.

637
00:56:27,506 --> 00:56:32,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was all the elementary schools It's been a while, but I do know that at the beginning of the year.

638
00:56:32,408 --> 00:56:37,649
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some type of almost I don't want to say an election, but they do have

639
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:57,119
[SPEAKER_03]: the letters that go out to the parents, asking if they are interested in joining, and then if they do get too many parents, because I guess the bylaws does say that there's supposed to be a certain amount on the site councils, that that's when it is brought into some type of an election or a voting system in each school.

640
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:03,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the years, I have been involved, and so I know that that's how it's worked.

641
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:05,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that that's how it's worked in the middle schools.

642
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:19,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the high school vocational side, I do want to mention that this year, the last actually couple of years, the high school and the vocational side have had a lot more parent participation than we've ever had from both sides over the years.

643
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:29,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, depending on people's schedules too, everybody's busy, that we have not had as many from the vocational side on the high school side.

644
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was just point of information.

645
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:32,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

646
00:57:32,862 --> 00:57:33,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

647
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:38,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed at the end of the minutes of the meeting that there were various different items that were discussed.

648
00:57:39,229 --> 00:57:44,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And one we had spent considerable time at an earlier meeting, which was broadcast on TV publicly.

649
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,256
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to read it for the record.

650
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:51,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Meeting with Attorney General clarified the B1, B2 enforcement issue.

651
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:56,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Schools are not an agent of the federal government for the enforcement of immigration law.

652
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:00,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Therefore, our schools do not have to remove any existing B1, B2 students.

653
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:08,533
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a concern among many of the members, if all the members of the school committee, so I'm just glad to see that that was resolved.

654
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:21,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, as a question, I see that there was a discussion to allow direct appointment of fine arts director and the technology director by the superintendent, and I want to ask the superintendent if he's made those

655
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:28,009
[SPEAKER_11]: The appointment letters are now in process and probably will go out either this week or the beginning of next.

656
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:28,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

657
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:29,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

658
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:30,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

659
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:31,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

660
00:58:32,152 --> 00:58:33,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Community participation.

661
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:35,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone wishing to speak this evening?

662
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:37,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

663
00:58:39,857 --> 00:58:41,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we make a motion to accept these?

664
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:49,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Reports of the Superintendent, Pre-Budget Report, English Language Arts.

665
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:50,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

666
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:56,086
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll call upon our Director of English Language Arts and Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.

667
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:03,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Chiesa.

668
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:04,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening again.

669
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it possible to give the Ethics School update prior to going into the Pre-Budget Report?

670
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:11,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

671
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:19,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to update you all on the Ethics Bowl competition that occurred in North Carolina during the weekend of April 8th.

672
00:59:20,048 --> 00:59:27,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to the generosity of the Medford School Committee, our Medford High School Ethics Bowl traveled to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

673
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:35,671
[SPEAKER_09]: When they were there, they participated in the 2017 National High School Ethics Bowl competition along with 24 other schools.

674
00:59:37,272 --> 00:59:39,212
[SPEAKER_09]: They won two rounds unanimously.

675
00:59:40,598 --> 00:59:50,085
[SPEAKER_09]: They lost the third round just by one point, and when they tally up the points to make it to the final round, they just fell short just a little bit.

676
00:59:50,906 --> 00:59:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Their poise, their character, and their skill was unprecedented, and I want to thank Mr. Esner, who led that group, and Ms.

677
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Parsons, who chaperoned the group as well.

678
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:09,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very proud to say that the Medford Ethics Bowl team finished in the top 10 in the nation, and that is

679
01:00:10,548 --> 01:00:11,889
[SPEAKER_09]: impressive beyond me.

680
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:15,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And so thank you for your generosity in supporting the students.

681
01:00:15,572 --> 01:00:19,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a wonderful trip, and we all greatly appreciate it.

682
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:26,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And a few of the students that came up this evening were whispering in the superintendent my ear that they had placed in the top 10.

683
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:28,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're very, very proud of that accomplishment.

684
01:00:28,063 --> 01:00:28,723
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful.

685
01:00:28,743 --> 01:00:35,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And we didn't have certificates tonight because we had honored them in the past, but I certainly want to make sure you had an update on that.

686
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:36,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

687
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:36,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

688
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:36,830
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

689
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:41,169
[SPEAKER_09]: So the English Language Arts budget.

690
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:46,772
[SPEAKER_09]: The English Language Arts is dedicated to supporting all our teachers in the district.

691
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:53,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Our curriculum is aligned to the 2011 Massachusetts English Language Arts curriculum framework.

692
01:00:54,555 --> 01:01:00,218
[SPEAKER_09]: At the elementary level, our instructional materials include Journeys 2014 and additional trade books.

693
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:08,402
[SPEAKER_09]: At the middle and high school level, we have Houghton Mifflin anthologies, periodicals, and fictional and non-fictional texts.

694
01:01:09,297 --> 01:01:13,599
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 29 teachers total in the middle school and high school.

695
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And seven teachers at the Andrews, seven at the McGlynn, 13 at the high school, and two at the vocational school.

696
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:28,084
[SPEAKER_09]: And one teacher, we have two at the vocational school.

697
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:37,308
[SPEAKER_09]: This year in terms of funding, we were able to purchase some additional Amazon Kindle Fires, which we have identified as

698
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:45,647
[SPEAKER_09]: being a great investment in terms of keeping the quality of the text compared to using it on the Kindle.

699
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:53,109
[SPEAKER_09]: We purchased some additional Journeys materials due to some rising numbers in the classrooms at the various grade levels.

700
01:01:54,309 --> 01:02:02,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Appropriated budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school, including periodicals.

701
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:09,216
[SPEAKER_09]: and additional informational and fictional texts were purchased in order to allow for continuity among the grade levels.

702
01:02:11,577 --> 01:02:20,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Accomplishments for this year included continued implementation of over 100 e-readers at the high school and middle school level.

703
01:02:21,782 --> 01:02:31,386
[SPEAKER_09]: We continued to do some mock MCAS testing at the elementary and middle school to help comfort students as they prepare for this new format in the exam.

704
01:02:32,514 --> 01:02:36,776
[SPEAKER_09]: We refined some different assessments based on curriculum needs and demands.

705
01:02:37,576 --> 01:02:43,859
[SPEAKER_09]: We stayed current with some recent changes that have just occurred to the 2011 ELA framework.

706
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:51,823
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw many of the authentic learning opportunities tonight that we achieved great success with.

707
01:02:53,124 --> 01:03:01,548
[SPEAKER_09]: This year in terms of requesting for funding, I'm asking for an additional funds to purchase Study Island for the middle school.

708
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:09,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be supporting for the RTI piece at the middle school level for English.

709
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:15,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm also asking for additional materials to support tier 2 and tier 3 intervention at the elementary level.

710
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure if anyone has any questions, but thank you for your time for that.

711
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:21,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any?

712
01:03:22,183 --> 01:03:25,244
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion to receive and place on file this report.

713
01:03:25,825 --> 01:03:26,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any?

714
01:03:26,665 --> 01:03:27,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Ms.

715
01:03:27,466 --> 01:03:27,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz.

716
01:03:27,966 --> 01:03:28,807
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

717
01:03:29,447 --> 01:03:30,147
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

718
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:30,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

719
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:32,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

720
01:03:32,378 --> 01:03:33,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

721
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:36,039
[SPEAKER_06]: One question, Mr. Benedetto.

722
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

723
01:03:39,381 --> 01:03:47,583
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were talking last week with some of the principals, there was a strong request for RTI staff.

724
01:03:48,464 --> 01:03:49,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this $17,000?

725
01:03:49,344 --> 01:03:51,805
[SPEAKER_05]: What would that go towards?

726
01:03:52,105 --> 01:03:55,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Additional materials for the program.

727
01:03:55,526 --> 01:03:59,828
[SPEAKER_09]: There are quite a bit of Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions.

728
01:03:59,908 --> 01:04:00,668
[SPEAKER_09]: We have them.

729
01:04:01,108 --> 01:04:02,929
[SPEAKER_09]: but a lot of them are consumables.

730
01:04:03,389 --> 01:04:11,294
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, there's a write-in reader wherein the paragraph is highlighted for the child and the child can go in and underline.

731
01:04:11,574 --> 01:04:14,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the consumables for the Tier 2 and Tier 3.

732
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:17,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not talking staffing in that request.

733
01:04:17,397 --> 01:04:17,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

734
01:04:18,057 --> 01:04:26,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a request for that and there was a lot of talk about the need for that and I'd like your opinion on that.

735
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:29,327
[SPEAKER_09]: in terms of staffing for intervention.

736
01:04:29,468 --> 01:04:39,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that first we want to look at the logistics of the schedule, and I've already engaged after that meeting, you know, I received some of the feedback from that meeting.

737
01:04:41,195 --> 01:04:48,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I already spoke with some principals just in terms of organizing the schedule, and I talked briefly with Ms.

738
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell, about that, which we'll engage more in.

739
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:56,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's logistically in terms of time, if you can

740
01:04:56,822 --> 01:05:08,130
[SPEAKER_09]: logistically put an RTI block in there, but the teachers do have the intervention tools and we have the program in place with the existing interventions.

741
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:11,212
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the need for the additional cost.

742
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:15,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't feel a need for additional staffing at this time.

743
01:05:15,155 --> 01:05:18,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see how it works with the logistics.

744
01:05:18,237 --> 01:05:22,560
[SPEAKER_09]: We do it at the Andrews a lot in terms of scheduling that RTI block.

745
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,042
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that's step one in terms of getting that in.

746
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:27,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that answer your question?

747
01:05:27,648 --> 01:05:28,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

748
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:28,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

749
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:36,045
[SPEAKER_05]: But what was helpful to me is that there were some teachers present and they explained

750
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:39,951
[SPEAKER_05]: that they do on their own time, early morning, lunch time.

751
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:42,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know teachers do that in general.

752
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:46,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that not all teachers can do that because of their home situations.

753
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,178
[SPEAKER_05]: They might not have that ability.

754
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:51,201
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, young children, different reasons that they can't.

755
01:05:51,441 --> 01:05:58,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to make sure that, you know, kids that need Tier 2 and Tier 3, they need more than the materials.

756
01:05:58,147 --> 01:06:01,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And some children, you know, you know, we

757
01:06:02,054 --> 01:06:05,437
[SPEAKER_05]: what my goal here is to growth in MCAF scoring.

758
01:06:05,597 --> 01:06:18,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really believe that having people, you know, work with those kids that are so close to moving to the next level, that if we do have services in place, that our schools will grow.

759
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:24,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the community goal, not only the school committee goal or administrative goal or teacher goal.

760
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's a community goal.

761
01:06:26,925 --> 01:06:36,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that if that's the need in order to make that growth happen, that we meet that need for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 children.

762
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, I know the superintendent talks a lot about differentiating instruction and I agree with that wholeheartedly, but we're at a point now that we really need to make strides and want to make strides in growth

763
01:06:49,574 --> 01:06:59,579
[SPEAKER_05]: with our scores, and if this is the step necessary, I really would like to look at that before we close this budget, so that way we can appropriate the correct funding for it.

764
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:08,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So any time that you have to look at this prior to budget, I would like to hear from you and the administrative team.

765
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:11,925
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are the experts, but I also heard from the front lines already.

766
01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:14,426
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to take that very seriously as well.

767
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:27,067
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may mention too, some of the tier two interventions that I'm referencing really give a targeted pre-assessment to figure out where the child is struggling in the reading.

768
01:07:27,187 --> 01:07:28,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it fluency?

769
01:07:28,207 --> 01:07:29,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it comprehension?

770
01:07:30,028 --> 01:07:37,129
[SPEAKER_09]: These materials can then help hone in on the child's need and the grouping and where they need that help.

771
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:39,789
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have looked at it and I will look at it again.

772
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:43,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now I feel like logistically we need to look at how the schedules align.

773
01:07:44,275 --> 01:07:45,156
[SPEAKER_09]: and go from there.

774
01:07:45,296 --> 01:07:48,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to say thank you for all your support on that too.

775
01:07:49,158 --> 01:07:49,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

776
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

777
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:51,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

778
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:56,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand in ELA our scores are a little higher than they are in the math.

779
01:07:56,983 --> 01:08:08,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm going to ask the same questions about math because district wide our math scores are good, but like there's room for growth in any situation.

780
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:11,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know ELA it might be a little different,

781
01:08:11,685 --> 01:08:14,546
[SPEAKER_05]: than it is the situation and the scenario with the mail.

782
01:08:15,046 --> 01:08:23,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, and I look forward to hearing more from you before the budget about what you really think that we need to do.

783
01:08:23,209 --> 01:08:26,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just really want you to speak to some of the people on the front.

784
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:27,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you do on a daily basis.

785
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:31,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I followed up with a few after that meeting as well, and I will continue to do so.

786
01:08:31,912 --> 01:08:32,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

787
01:08:32,552 --> 01:08:32,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

788
01:08:32,852 --> 01:08:33,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

789
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the time, Mayor Burke.

790
01:08:35,972 --> 01:08:36,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

791
01:08:36,652 --> 01:08:38,474
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already received and placed that on file.

792
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the Social Studies Pre-Budget Report.

793
01:08:41,296 --> 01:08:41,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Me again.

794
01:08:42,397 --> 01:08:44,018
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be done with me soon.

795
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:55,588
[SPEAKER_09]: The Social Studies Department is committed to providing all students with the academic and problem-solving skills essential for personal development, citizenship, and lifelong learning.

796
01:08:56,484 --> 01:09:00,805
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 27.5 teachers combined in the middle and high school.

797
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:11,148
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be 6 teachers at the Andrews Middle School, 6 teachers at the McGlynn Middle School, 14.5 at the high school, and 1 at the vocational school.

798
01:09:12,408 --> 01:09:22,151
[SPEAKER_09]: With the generous support of the school committee, in terms of funding for last year, we were able to purchase some additional 8th grade social studies textbooks, brand new for them.

799
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:36,579
[SPEAKER_09]: We also purchased some additional online subscriptions for teachers because we find every day with social studies things are changing and the online subscriptions make a lot of sense in terms of keeping us current with what's going on in the world.

800
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:45,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Appropriated budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school level and we had some additional replacement textbooks.

801
01:09:46,824 --> 01:09:52,087
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to that, we purchased managing licenses for the Chromebooks in order to

802
01:09:53,954 --> 01:10:01,879
[SPEAKER_09]: ease any technology issues so we could look at it as a whole through the technology department.

803
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:05,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also purchased some additional carts for the security of the Chromebooks.

804
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:09,743
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for the Global Scholars Program, which is offered at the seventh grade level.

805
01:10:10,924 --> 01:10:20,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Funding also supported numerous authentic learning opportunities, which is so powerful for these students, including the Model United Nations that you saw tonight,

806
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:28,249
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the Royal House visits coming up for grade five and some other authentic opportunities as well.

807
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:32,970
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course we had some periodicals that were purchased for the middle and high school level.

808
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:42,652
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of accomplishments for this year, I want to point out that we've had a significant increase in our senior year offerings.

809
01:10:43,112 --> 01:10:46,553
[SPEAKER_09]: In the past few years we've had four senior classes.

810
01:10:47,418 --> 01:11:00,101
[SPEAKER_09]: that were either created or reinstated at the high school level that are fully, that are filled, not filled to capacity, they're not bursting at the seams, but they're very popular in choice for students.

811
01:11:00,161 --> 01:11:09,803
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes our honors economics class, we brought back our AP comparative government class, and so it's quite strong showing at the high school level.

812
01:11:11,203 --> 01:11:24,335
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, we also continued as another accomplishment to really support the Global Scholars Program, including a field trip to the Museum of Science this year, which was wonderful for the 7th grade students.

813
01:11:25,275 --> 01:11:34,163
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had a significant increase in community partnerships over the last year, including participating in our Veterans Day that you had a report on in the fall.

814
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:45,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Day on the Hill, National History Day at the middle and high school level, that model United Nations that we just honored students for, Law Day, Student Government Day.

815
01:11:46,253 --> 01:11:51,238
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great experience for many different students at many different grade levels, which is important.

816
01:11:52,479 --> 01:12:00,006
[SPEAKER_09]: We continue to do full integration of grades 9 and 10 at the high school and vocational classes, and we continue with our inclusion.

817
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,163
[SPEAKER_09]: full inclusion at the co-teaching classes for the high school and vocational.

818
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:15,288
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, for additional funding, I am requesting $16,000 in additional funding for our grade 11 U.S.

819
01:12:15,308 --> 01:12:16,429
[SPEAKER_09]: history textbooks.

820
01:12:17,449 --> 01:12:25,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And the funding would also support an advanced placement human geography class that we are offering at the high school next year.

821
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:30,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

822
01:12:31,088 --> 01:12:31,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

823
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:31,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

824
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:39,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the human geography course, will it be in place of one of the other AP courses or it's addition to?

825
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:41,712
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't think it will be in place.

826
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:46,874
[SPEAKER_09]: It might, we have to see where the numbers lie with the course request.

827
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:56,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you right now we have 45 students that have already requested it and our other senior classes still look quite strong in terms of participation.

828
01:12:56,217 --> 01:12:58,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not pulling away that I can see.

829
01:12:58,993 --> 01:12:59,613
[SPEAKER_09]: from anything.

830
01:12:59,774 --> 01:13:10,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, if a child asks for AP Human Geography and honors Econ and for some reason the schedule was the same period, which we try to avoid obviously, that would be the only way it would pull.

831
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:12,460
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, this is just additional interest.

832
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,200
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

833
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

834
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,342
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fabulous.

835
01:13:15,362 --> 01:13:15,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been great.

836
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:17,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

837
01:13:18,088 --> 01:13:20,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Ms.

838
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:20,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno?

839
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:21,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

840
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:21,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Ms.

841
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:22,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot.

842
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:23,692
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

843
01:13:24,052 --> 01:13:24,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

844
01:13:24,412 --> 01:13:25,113
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

845
01:13:25,173 --> 01:13:25,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

846
01:13:25,793 --> 01:13:26,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much tonight.

847
01:13:26,654 --> 01:13:27,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for this evening.

848
01:13:27,634 --> 01:13:27,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Great job.

849
01:13:27,934 --> 01:13:29,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Great job leading this department.

850
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:29,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

851
01:13:29,475 --> 01:13:30,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

852
01:13:30,216 --> 01:13:35,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

853
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:37,840
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, report on summer programs 2017.

854
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:39,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent?

855
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.

856
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:43,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

857
01:13:43,604 --> 01:13:43,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Nelson?

858
01:13:45,665 --> 01:13:46,005
Good evening.

859
01:13:46,526 --> 01:13:46,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

860
01:13:47,898 --> 01:13:54,280
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been busy organizing our summer programs, and we have a full complement of programs.

861
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:04,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, as you know, are tuition-based, some of them are supported by grants, and some of them are supported by regular budgets.

862
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:07,764
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank the school committee for those particular programs.

863
01:14:09,504 --> 01:14:16,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, many of the programs are academic, some are recreational, and some are a combination

864
01:14:16,714 --> 01:14:22,135
[SPEAKER_00]: of both, and we're really servicing all grades from pre-K through grade 12.

865
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:25,396
[SPEAKER_00]: The dates and times of the programs vary.

866
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:40,059
[SPEAKER_00]: School does end on the 22nd, so most of the programs will start that next Monday, which is June 26th, and just about all of them are ended by the end of August, or the third week in August.

867
01:14:41,475 --> 01:14:53,606
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently in the process of arranging to staff our programs, identifying students who should attend, and arranging outreach to families on the various programs.

868
01:14:54,427 --> 01:14:56,608
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a summary of each of the programs.

869
01:14:57,189 --> 01:15:03,274
[SPEAKER_00]: The Summer Fund Program is pretty much as it's been in past years to service elementary students.

870
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:04,896
[SPEAKER_00]: It begins on the 26th.

871
01:15:05,116 --> 01:15:06,377
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends on August 18th.

872
01:15:08,155 --> 01:15:10,496
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's for students in grades K through six.

873
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:11,236
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full day.

874
01:15:12,136 --> 01:15:14,717
[SPEAKER_00]: It begins at 7.30 a.m.

875
01:15:14,997 --> 01:15:17,318
[SPEAKER_00]: and ends at 4.30 p.m.

876
01:15:19,038 --> 01:15:27,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Families sign up by the week, and the cost is $145 per week, and it includes breakfast every day and pizza on Fridays.

877
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:35,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular summer school, this is for students who have failed a subject, grades six through 12, who have to make up

878
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:39,530
[SPEAKER_00]: the subject in order to advance to the next grades.

879
01:15:40,531 --> 01:15:43,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, we're doing things a little differently.

880
01:15:44,312 --> 01:15:54,716
[SPEAKER_00]: The programs all start on June 26 and end on August 8, which is consistent with the 30-day school committee requirement.

881
01:15:55,777 --> 01:15:57,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the programs are at Medford High School.

882
01:15:58,718 --> 01:16:03,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, student tuition supports the programs.

883
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:07,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Students pay $250 a course if they're Medford students.

884
01:16:07,866 --> 01:16:14,330
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have a number of outside students who are paying a little bit more, $300 per course.

885
01:16:14,731 --> 01:16:17,413
[SPEAKER_00]: If you recall, last year we conducted a pilot.

886
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:23,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pilot was to offer online courses for all of the makeup science courses.

887
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:28,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that proved to be very successful for many reasons.

888
01:16:28,641 --> 01:16:29,522
[SPEAKER_00]: It was engaging.

889
01:16:29,642 --> 01:16:31,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Students had kind of a different approach

890
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:37,346
[SPEAKER_00]: to their learning, which was kind of welcomed after a year of regular instruction.

891
01:16:38,106 --> 01:16:41,749
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that this did, we were able to offer more science courses.

892
01:16:42,189 --> 01:16:48,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had students from other communities that didn't have these courses coming to Medford.

893
01:16:48,613 --> 01:16:50,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helped to generate a little bit more money.

894
01:16:51,667 --> 01:17:00,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other very big plus is that, you know, officially summer school has an ending date, and there are students who sometimes just need a little extra time.

895
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:08,852
[SPEAKER_00]: This provided them with the time because we allowed those students, because they could work at their own pace, to have a few more weeks in August to complete.

896
01:17:09,472 --> 01:17:20,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the supervisors of summer school were telling me as we were debriefing, this led to several more students actually making it over the bar because they had that extra time.

897
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:33,171
[SPEAKER_00]: So given on that experience and given on the fact that the school system has made a commitment to online learning, we've purchased a subscription with Edmentum, which is online courses.

898
01:17:33,391 --> 01:17:37,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently we have seniors who are doing credit recovery using this.

899
01:17:37,974 --> 01:17:40,775
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other students who are just taking supplemental courses.

900
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:44,578
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided that all of summer school will be online.

901
01:17:45,498 --> 01:17:49,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're going to have facilitators for each subject area.

902
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:59,997
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing is they're looking at the course that's the package course and they're making any modifications to make sure it aligns completely with our own courses.

903
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:06,142
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we will be running our summer school online for those grades.

904
01:18:06,622 --> 01:18:17,911
[SPEAKER_00]: The only exception is grades six and seven because, again, in debriefing about what happened last year, the summer school coordinators, Jill Sawyer and David Blau,

905
01:18:18,559 --> 01:18:27,203
[SPEAKER_00]: said that the 6th and 7th graders taking, you know, all that academic instruction was really very difficult for them, and they really needed a different model.

906
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:41,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 6th and 7th graders, they will still be at the high school, but they'll have, be in a kind of a different section of the high school, and they will have regular instruction because we felt that age group maybe couldn't handle complete online instruction.

907
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:45,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we plan to do is to have kind of a break in the middle.

908
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:50,126
[SPEAKER_00]: and offer some kind of an activity that is an enrichment activity.

909
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:53,589
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of making our decisions now on what that will be.

910
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:55,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might do a little bit of social-emotional.

911
01:18:57,111 --> 01:19:03,056
[SPEAKER_00]: One week we'll actually bring them into the vocational setting and let them know more about vocational education.

912
01:19:03,956 --> 01:19:05,978
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably have some recreational things.

913
01:19:06,018 --> 01:19:08,060
[SPEAKER_00]: They can run around and blow off some steam.

914
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be in the middle part because many of these youngsters have to stay for both the English and math.

915
01:19:14,444 --> 01:19:15,225
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our plan.

916
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:19,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping that, you know, this is a big improvement on what happened last year.

917
01:19:19,878 --> 01:19:23,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's what we will be doing for regular summer school.

918
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:35,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Other programs, and we have several other programs, our English Language Learner Summer Program will service newcomers for the most part, elementary, middle, and high school students.

919
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,353
[SPEAKER_00]: This program will be at the McGlynn.

920
01:19:37,994 --> 01:19:42,358
[SPEAKER_00]: We've contained our programs to the high school, the McGlynn, and the Roberts.

921
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:47,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that already I've given John McLaughlin the schedule so he can begin the cleaning.

922
01:19:48,003 --> 01:19:56,929
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of, you know, working that so all the buildings, even though they're being used during the summer, will be properly cleaned when students return in August.

923
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:02,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can see the schedule for those EL programs.

924
01:20:02,593 --> 01:20:11,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they are very helpful for these youngsters who really need to have that continuity of language acquisition throughout the summer months.

925
01:20:13,387 --> 01:20:17,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year and this year we're having our middle school computer science camp.

926
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:23,433
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really run through the grant that Molly Layden has throughout the school year.

927
01:20:23,493 --> 01:20:34,900
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for one week and these are middle school students that have been involved in this project where they're basically learning about apps and actually designing apps.

928
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,682
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting for the students and very engaging.

929
01:20:39,092 --> 01:20:45,115
[SPEAKER_00]: The Medford Vocational Technical School Exploratory Program, again, for middle school students, this was successful last year.

930
01:20:45,595 --> 01:21:02,444
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-week program, and students are coming in, they're learning about vocational education, they'll decide, I'm not quite sure exactly which shops are gonna be open for them to use, but they will actually develop a product to take home with them at the end of the experience.

931
01:21:02,864 --> 01:21:07,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another program that's worked out very well, so we wanted to continue that.

932
01:21:09,143 --> 01:21:09,903
[SPEAKER_00]: High School 101.

933
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:15,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this program started when we had our academic support grant.

934
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:23,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so successful that once the grant dried up, the school committee decided to support it through regular budget.

935
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:37,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a wonderful program because what we do here is we have our students who are entering grade nine who have been identified as students who maybe need a little bit of an extra push and a little bit of extra help

936
01:21:38,847 --> 01:21:42,368
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, getting into grade nine in terms of finishing their summer work.

937
01:21:42,928 --> 01:21:45,688
[SPEAKER_00]: All eighth grade students have English and mathematics summer work.

938
01:21:46,488 --> 01:21:51,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have found that, you know, when they get to school, some of them just haven't done this work.

939
01:21:51,889 --> 01:21:57,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that they're there, not, you know, kind of getting off to a bad start.

940
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:04,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we bring them in three days in August, the last week before school begins.

941
01:22:05,452 --> 01:22:07,072
[SPEAKER_00]: They have teachers there who,

942
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:12,495
[SPEAKER_00]: are helping them to finish this work, and they do academic work for three days.

943
01:22:13,035 --> 01:22:21,140
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a chance to meet many of the high school administrators because all the administrators are back at this time, and they get tours of the building.

944
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:26,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we finish that program with day four, which is the regular ninth grade orientation.

945
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:34,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So these students actually have kind of three extra days where they're getting acclimated to the high school, finishing up their summer work,

946
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:42,494
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we have a very high attendance rate for the kids that are invited to participate.

947
01:22:42,915 --> 01:22:44,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is very exciting as well.

948
01:22:45,796 --> 01:22:51,880
[SPEAKER_00]: A full complement of special education programs, some of them will be at the high school, some of them will be at the Roberts.

949
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:59,644
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all of our nursing staff in place for the students that need any kind of help with health issues.

950
01:23:00,365 --> 01:23:01,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see the dates

951
01:23:02,576 --> 01:23:06,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Special education programs are generally developed from the student's IEPs.

952
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:12,522
[SPEAKER_00]: These are students who really need summer services to satisfy the requirements of their IEPs.

953
01:23:13,302 --> 01:23:14,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about it.

954
01:23:14,143 --> 01:23:15,584
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things going on.

955
01:23:15,684 --> 01:23:17,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Very busy and we'll be all set to

956
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:19,887
[SPEAKER_00]: begin right after school gets out.

957
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:21,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?

958
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:21,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

959
01:23:21,868 --> 01:23:22,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

960
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:23,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

961
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:24,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

962
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:25,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelson, for the report.

963
01:23:26,232 --> 01:23:28,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a lot going on, I guess, this summer, huh?

964
01:23:29,394 --> 01:23:31,937
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to go over some of the summer school things.

965
01:23:32,377 --> 01:23:40,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $250 for a Method student, $300 for outside students, but is that for all students even if they're taking the online courses?

966
01:23:40,844 --> 01:23:43,126
[SPEAKER_00]: These are students that have to make up courses.

967
01:23:43,626 --> 01:23:43,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

968
01:23:43,947 --> 01:23:45,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody pays the

969
01:23:45,831 --> 01:23:46,451
[SPEAKER_00]: tuition fee.

970
01:23:46,531 --> 01:23:46,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

971
01:23:46,952 --> 01:23:48,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether they're taking it online or not.

972
01:23:48,753 --> 01:23:49,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

973
01:23:49,373 --> 01:23:49,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

974
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:57,998
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is is that do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses?

975
01:23:58,518 --> 01:24:04,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how many students do we get back for let's say high school 101, the students entering grade nine?

976
01:24:04,782 --> 01:24:08,063
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I understand, you don't have to have a particular grade in that.

977
01:24:08,604 --> 01:24:09,444
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open to anyone.

978
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:12,546
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not open to everybody because we couldn't accommodate everybody.

979
01:24:12,606 --> 01:24:14,567
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is is the teachers are currently

980
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:24,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when we had the grant, under the guidelines of the grant, the students that were invited to come to high school 101, we had to look at their MCAS scores.

981
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:29,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a certain level, relatively, you know, either warning or needs improvement.

982
01:24:30,476 --> 01:24:31,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Those students were invited.

983
01:24:31,637 --> 01:24:33,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we no longer are under the grant.

984
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:34,679
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the guidelines.

985
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:42,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're asking teachers to do is for the teachers to identify students that they think need this extra help.

986
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:56,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, students that they've had in class all year, who maybe don't finish their homework, or maybe haven't gotten a wonderful grade, maybe they're, again, students who just need to have their hands held a little bit and walk through.

987
01:24:56,477 --> 01:25:00,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's very, the ninth grade teachers expect the students to have this work done.

988
01:25:01,099 --> 01:25:06,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the kids arrive day one, and all of a sudden, they don't have that work, it's not a great start.

989
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,281
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to start behind.

990
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:11,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been very successful in making sure those students

991
01:25:12,328 --> 01:25:22,331
[SPEAKER_00]: show up day one, having done the work that's expected of them, and again, teachers are, the eighth grade teachers are identifying who we should invite.

992
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:30,534
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have about 40 students in the past, and again, the ones that are invited, for the most part, they come.

993
01:25:31,234 --> 01:25:31,694
[SPEAKER_00]: They come.

994
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:39,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful.

995
01:25:39,557 --> 01:25:40,917
[SPEAKER_03]: How many students did we have?

996
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:43,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to get you the exact numbers.

997
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:46,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Any student that had to take a science makeup class did it online.

998
01:25:46,995 --> 01:25:50,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd have to get from David or Jill the exact numbers of those students.

999
01:25:50,697 --> 01:25:56,439
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, things that happen, you know, when you try something out, you expect certain things.

1000
01:25:56,599 --> 01:26:01,141
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sometimes there are extra things that are very good things that happen.

1001
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:09,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things that David and Jill were very excited about is that the students who would have had to end on that day in August when the last day of school took place,

1002
01:26:10,341 --> 01:26:20,008
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe would have failed were allowed to continue on on their own and they were successful by having another two weeks where they could just work on this course.

1003
01:26:20,428 --> 01:26:23,670
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we didn't really count on, but you know what, that's a great thing.

1004
01:26:24,071 --> 01:26:28,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So summer school doesn't have to officially end when the teachers walk away from the students.

1005
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:32,797
[SPEAKER_00]: The students can still continue on and can be successful.

1006
01:26:33,345 --> 01:26:34,786
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very happy with that.

1007
01:26:34,806 --> 01:26:37,407
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the feedback from the students?

1008
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:40,628
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I hear, they liked doing it online.

1009
01:26:41,088 --> 01:26:43,009
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just leave them by themselves in a room.

1010
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:47,251
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are these teachers, facilitators there that they can ask questions.

1011
01:26:47,351 --> 01:26:52,213
[SPEAKER_00]: We also make sure that somebody in technology is around in case something breaks down.

1012
01:26:52,693 --> 01:26:58,415
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to keep the classes because when we had just the science, we put them in the labs.

1013
01:26:58,975 --> 01:27:02,937
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we're going to have all the courses online, we're going to use regular classrooms with Chromebooks.

1014
01:27:03,743 --> 01:27:06,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're kind of making sure that everything's going to work.

1015
01:27:06,824 --> 01:27:14,146
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the technology department to make sure that if we have 100 kids online at one time, it's going to be successful.

1016
01:27:14,286 --> 01:27:17,047
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to flush all that out so there are no problems.

1017
01:27:17,407 --> 01:27:17,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1018
01:27:18,227 --> 01:27:23,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?

1019
01:27:24,409 --> 01:27:28,351
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I understand, they can accelerate at their own pace.

1020
01:27:28,431 --> 01:27:29,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have to physically

1021
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:35,132
[SPEAKER_00]: be at the high school to satisfy the requirement of being on site for those hours.

1022
01:27:35,812 --> 01:27:38,273
[SPEAKER_00]: But my understanding is pretty much self-paced.

1023
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:46,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernadette, you've worked with this too, and you can correct me if I'm giving misinformation, but they're pretty much self-paced, and they're like in modules.

1024
01:27:47,237 --> 01:27:53,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, you and I might be taking the same course, sitting side by side, but you could be doing something very different.

1025
01:27:53,939 --> 01:27:57,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're well ahead of me, and I'm just struggling to do something else.

1026
01:27:58,203 --> 01:28:01,722
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is that's how it works in Bernadette if you want to add anything.

1027
01:28:03,012 --> 01:28:07,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to add that a student could log on at home.

1028
01:28:07,774 --> 01:28:18,357
[SPEAKER_16]: So if a student wants to do more work, um, but we do need to stay true to the requirement of the number of hours that they need to have in the classroom, um, is what's a balancing act.

1029
01:28:18,397 --> 01:28:22,259
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want them to go too far ahead and then come to school with, with nothing to do.

1030
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:28,861
[SPEAKER_16]: So at least in the beginning, they will be encouraged to, um, to do the work within the classroom and then.

1031
01:28:29,365 --> 01:28:31,847
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, if they need it, certainly they'll be able to log on at home.

1032
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:33,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my concern.

1033
01:28:33,128 --> 01:28:42,174
[SPEAKER_00]: One additional thing, too, about the program at Mentum is that there are other things, like Bernadette said, what if we have that student who finishes the second day and is done with the course?

1034
01:28:42,214 --> 01:28:43,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Very unlikely, but who knows.

1035
01:28:44,756 --> 01:28:51,301
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, there are other courses that are very helpful, like there's a course called Study Skills.

1036
01:28:51,801 --> 01:28:55,804
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these students could benefit from taking an online course on study skills.

1037
01:28:55,824 --> 01:28:57,365
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see that happening,

1038
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:07,037
[SPEAKER_00]: we can intervene with some other products, some other programs within this material that we've purchased that can be useful to these kids too.

1039
01:29:07,377 --> 01:29:09,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we just don't want them sitting there obviously.

1040
01:29:09,778 --> 01:29:10,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1041
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:22,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other, my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse because now if, you know, other people do have that accessibility,

1042
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:28,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're feeling because now they're falling behind.

1043
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess my question is too is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?

1044
01:29:41,028 --> 01:29:41,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, no.

1045
01:29:42,269 --> 01:29:44,550
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to, you know, obviously look into that.

1046
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:50,013
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a suggestion I can make to David and Jill if they can get staff to stay a little bit extra.

1047
01:29:50,034 --> 01:29:50,774
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.

1048
01:29:52,015 --> 01:30:02,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we will monitor, you know, what kids are doing in terms of the expectation is that they're doing this work in the hours that they're supposed to be in summer school.

1049
01:30:03,404 --> 01:30:06,206
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are always kids who just feel, you know, we like that.

1050
01:30:06,226 --> 01:30:09,189
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to stop somebody from going home and pursuing something.

1051
01:30:09,509 --> 01:30:11,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to discourage that.

1052
01:30:11,411 --> 01:30:18,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll try to find a way to work around it, maybe offer an extra hour in the library that they can come to.

1053
01:30:18,056 --> 01:30:19,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll speak to David about that.

1054
01:30:19,379 --> 01:30:26,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and you, and one last question was that you have, you have introductory physics, chemistry, and biology online.

1055
01:30:26,664 --> 01:30:30,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those the same courses that are going to be provided this year or are you going to add more?

1056
01:30:30,367 --> 01:30:34,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the three that were identified by Mrs. Cieri as what the kids needed to make up.

1057
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:37,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you so much.

1058
01:30:37,452 --> 01:30:37,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

1059
01:30:37,652 --> 01:30:42,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Mustone, I was just wondering about the English language learner summer program.

1060
01:30:42,774 --> 01:30:50,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of the newcomers at the Roberts and the newcomers at middle school and the newcomers at the high school, what percent would you say take advantage of it?

1061
01:30:50,143 --> 01:30:51,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it's a great program.

1062
01:30:52,957 --> 01:30:56,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to check with Mrs. Trotter on that.

1063
01:30:57,378 --> 01:30:58,138
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free.

1064
01:30:58,358 --> 01:30:58,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1065
01:30:58,778 --> 01:31:00,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So free always encourages people to come.

1066
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And lunch and transportation, I would think you could get a hundred percent.

1067
01:31:03,259 --> 01:31:04,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because she has the grant.

1068
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:05,359
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Title III grant.

1069
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:05,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1070
01:31:05,859 --> 01:31:10,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's unfortunate that, you know, some of the programs we can offer transportation, some we can offer food.

1071
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1072
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:15,341
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really is dependent upon if we have grant funding for that.

1073
01:31:15,461 --> 01:31:19,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can check with her to see how many kids actually

1074
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:21,609
[SPEAKER_00]: come who are invited.

1075
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:25,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Those students are pretty motivated, though.

1076
01:31:25,492 --> 01:31:28,314
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to go to most things they're invited to.

1077
01:31:29,654 --> 01:31:36,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the special ed program, the last part is there's approximately 142 students requiring the various services.

1078
01:31:36,679 --> 01:31:41,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Do all 142 take advantage of these programs?

1079
01:31:41,903 --> 01:31:45,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, this is part of what they're supposed to be doing on their IEPs.

1080
01:31:46,286 --> 01:31:49,308
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they get a pretty good attendance rate on that because

1081
01:31:49,924 --> 01:31:52,886
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents want the kids to have the services during the summer.

1082
01:31:53,326 --> 01:32:01,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So can I make a motion to see if Kathy could tell us what percent comes and if Trotter could tell us what percent comes to the... Sure.

1083
01:32:02,031 --> 01:32:06,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Just maybe if they're not 100%, maybe there's a way to outreach more to get more people to them.

1084
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:07,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1085
01:32:07,994 --> 01:32:09,635
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will get the data on that.

1086
01:32:10,555 --> 01:32:11,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1087
01:32:11,516 --> 01:32:12,616
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1088
01:32:12,656 --> 01:32:12,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1089
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:13,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Vander Kloof.

1090
01:32:14,784 --> 01:32:19,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to ask about the summer school program in terms of tuition.

1091
01:32:21,106 --> 01:32:28,088
[SPEAKER_08]: For students who are on free or reduced lunch, you know, potentially if they fail two subjects, it's $500.

1092
01:32:28,788 --> 01:32:36,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a reduced cost for students who are clearly economically disadvantaged?

1093
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:41,452
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with families who have special circumstances.

1094
01:32:41,532 --> 01:32:42,052
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that

1095
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:55,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a payment plan so they don't have to do all of the tuition up front and I know there are times that we're very forgiving if the circumstances are such, but we take it on an individual case.

1096
01:32:55,517 --> 01:33:04,823
[SPEAKER_00]: To say that everyone who is free and reduced lunch gets reduction in tuition is not what we're currently doing, but we do obviously take that into consideration.

1097
01:33:04,843 --> 01:33:05,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1098
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:07,744
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I know that there's... We don't turn people away who need it.

1099
01:33:08,145 --> 01:33:08,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1100
01:33:08,885 --> 01:33:09,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1101
01:33:10,066 --> 01:33:10,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1102
01:33:11,347 --> 01:33:11,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1103
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:19,278
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is actually directed towards the mayor and it's in regard to the summer recreation book.

1104
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:22,111
[SPEAKER_05]: If that is went to print today.

1105
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:36,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's our summer recreation has a litany of programming You know sports camps some of the programs that you have we have similar camps that are going to be had and music camps There's quite a bit that's going to be in the catalog and it went to print today So we're hoping to have it next week.

1106
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:40,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And where will they be available be distributing through the schools?

1107
01:33:40,877 --> 01:33:43,138
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be doing backpacks and it'll also be online.

1108
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I

1109
01:33:43,899 --> 01:33:47,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there be any up at the library, just in case people need them?

1110
01:33:47,165 --> 01:33:47,806
[SPEAKER_05]: We always put them there.

1111
01:33:48,267 --> 01:33:49,129
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

1112
01:33:49,269 --> 01:33:49,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1113
01:33:50,603 --> 01:33:51,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Ms.

1114
01:33:51,063 --> 01:33:51,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloop.

1115
01:33:51,544 --> 01:33:52,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one last thing.

1116
01:33:52,484 --> 01:34:00,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever we discuss the summer fund program, I think I ought to give kudos to Anne Marie Cuno, our colleague, who really got it off the ground.

1117
01:34:00,789 --> 01:34:02,050
[SPEAKER_08]: So just want to mention that.

1118
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

1119
01:34:06,252 --> 01:34:06,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1120
01:34:06,512 --> 01:34:06,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Kripps.

1121
01:34:06,772 --> 01:34:07,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1122
01:34:07,153 --> 01:34:07,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the report.

1123
01:34:08,493 --> 01:34:11,875
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to mention we were at the West Medford Community Center the other day.

1124
01:34:11,895 --> 01:34:14,717
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're having a summer camp as well.

1125
01:34:15,217 --> 01:34:17,278
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 10 weeks, June 26 to September 1, 8 AM to 6 PM.

1126
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:25,047
[SPEAKER_15]: middle school, six to eight, and it's $175 a week.

1127
01:34:25,627 --> 01:34:27,229
[SPEAKER_15]: And you only pay for the weeks you need.

1128
01:34:27,649 --> 01:34:32,915
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to mention it, and if anybody's interested, there's still, space is limited, but there's still space available.

1129
01:34:33,435 --> 01:34:34,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, thank you.

1130
01:34:34,136 --> 01:34:36,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have a continuing college program?

1131
01:34:36,678 --> 01:34:36,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1132
01:34:39,437 --> 01:35:09,076
[SPEAKER_06]: very good is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file miss vandekloot has a question no i just noticed that in our uh... the form it says that the uh... summer fund program runs seven thirty p m to four thirty p m it just needs to be corrected just in the report thanks eagle eyes very good backwards back to the future there's a motion for approval offered by miss vandekloot seconded by miss kunio all those in favor aye all those opposed

1133
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Papers received and placed on file.

1134
01:35:12,422 --> 01:35:17,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And our final report on English language learners newcomers program redistribution.

1135
01:35:17,246 --> 01:35:18,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

1136
01:35:19,167 --> 01:35:27,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the discussions we've had recently is the concentration of students who are ELL in any one elementary school.

1137
01:35:28,454 --> 01:35:35,359
[SPEAKER_11]: And the newcomers program has historically been at the Roberts, but the numbers have become very substantial.

1138
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,502
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the discussions that we had was how can we

1139
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:41,953
[SPEAKER_11]: spread them out and redistribute them a little bit more.

1140
01:35:41,993 --> 01:35:50,739
[SPEAKER_11]: In earlier discussions, we talked about splitting, let's say, grades 1 and 2 at one school and 3, 4, and 5 at another.

1141
01:35:51,339 --> 01:36:01,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this particular report tells you that next year it's our plan to send grades 1 and 2 to the Brooks School for two reasons.

1142
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:06,990
[SPEAKER_11]: One, it will redistribute the newcomers program, not all ELL students, but the newcomers program.

1143
01:36:07,831 --> 01:36:09,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, it will create more

1144
01:36:09,876 --> 01:36:15,859
[SPEAKER_11]: of a balance between the two schools, because the population at the Brooks is lower than the population at the Roberts.

1145
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:25,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Put the two together, they'll come up with a similar population, and the diversity level at the Brooks will increase substantially, and that will be helpful as well.

1146
01:36:25,783 --> 01:36:30,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's our goal, that's what we're doing, and we plan to move ahead unless there's an objection.

1147
01:36:33,438 --> 01:36:34,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any questions, miss?

1148
01:36:34,598 --> 01:36:34,778
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1149
01:36:35,418 --> 01:36:35,739
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good?

1150
01:36:36,779 --> 01:36:37,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1151
01:36:38,099 --> 01:36:38,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1152
01:36:39,559 --> 01:36:44,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a great idea, Mr. Superintendent.

1153
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:57,163
[SPEAKER_05]: There has been significant parent presence at some of our meetings worried about the class size and where space was available at our schools.

1154
01:36:57,643 --> 01:37:00,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really believe that this is a really

1155
01:37:00,745 --> 01:37:06,547
[SPEAKER_05]: good way to look at this, and we can watch it closely next year and make any other adjustments.

1156
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:21,733
[SPEAKER_05]: All that I ask is if it does cause hardships to individual families, that you take that into account and work with those families and make sure that the transition works well for those families.

1157
01:37:21,873 --> 01:37:30,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's great hardship of separating siblings, you keep that in mind when placement is necessary.

1158
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very important for us to maybe make a statement at this point in time.

1159
01:37:35,743 --> 01:37:37,425
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about this the other night at the middle schools.

1160
01:37:39,826 --> 01:37:41,768
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't make everybody happy all the time.

1161
01:37:42,468 --> 01:37:48,573
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be decisions that are going to be made that are going to require people to accept certain kinds of things for distribution purposes.

1162
01:37:49,214 --> 01:37:50,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this year we'll do it with the elementary.

1163
01:37:51,383 --> 01:37:56,884
[SPEAKER_11]: But as we go into next year, we're going to have to take a very strong look at the middle school and redistribute students.

1164
01:37:57,485 --> 01:38:02,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Because otherwise, one school will be very heavy with certain types of students who require certain services.

1165
01:38:03,106 --> 01:38:08,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Other schools will be less populated and have other challenges.

1166
01:38:09,047 --> 01:38:11,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So people ask for certain things.

1167
01:38:11,728 --> 01:38:13,269
[SPEAKER_11]: We do our best to accommodate them.

1168
01:38:13,629 --> 01:38:15,609
[SPEAKER_11]: From time to time, we have to make a decision.

1169
01:38:16,289 --> 01:38:18,470
[SPEAKER_11]: And not everybody's going to be happy with that decision.

1170
01:38:19,588 --> 01:38:21,710
[SPEAKER_11]: the nature of trying to be fair to everybody.

1171
01:38:22,511 --> 01:38:32,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and sometimes in transition, uh, there are a few people that feel like we didn't consider their particular situation, but we'll try to consider as many situations as we can.

1172
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:35,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

1173
01:38:35,381 --> 01:38:36,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Miss Van der Kloot.

1174
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:47,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my biggest concern is sometimes older students are in charge of looking after younger siblings and by splitting the families, uh, between two schools, which I certainly understand why we're

1175
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:53,312
[SPEAKER_08]: moving in that direction, that could create some issues.

1176
01:38:53,752 --> 01:38:56,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the place that I'm most concerned about.

1177
01:38:57,693 --> 01:39:06,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And there may be some interesting and creative solutions to that for families, but I think that we just need to be very, very well aware of.

1178
01:39:07,457 --> 01:39:14,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And most importantly is the information to the families, so we're aware of any real problems ahead of time.

1179
01:39:15,487 --> 01:39:25,611
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things we'll do after tonight is we'll actually reach out to the families that will be affected by school transitions this week and start to let them know what our plans are.

1180
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:34,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we do have after school programs and other things like that that we can work out some arrangements for people who have particular needs that really are under stress.

1181
01:39:35,485 --> 01:39:46,477
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to be very careful that we don't just assume that everybody is going to get everything that they want, because if we do that, we give ourselves an unbearable goal, an unattainable goal.

1182
01:39:47,017 --> 01:39:56,307
[SPEAKER_11]: So from time to time, you make a decision, you do it in the vast majority of people involved, and you try to work on the edges with the people that may be affected adversely.

1183
01:39:57,085 --> 01:40:00,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you address what happens in third grade when they've finished, let's say, a second grade newcomer?

1184
01:40:00,806 --> 01:40:03,746
[SPEAKER_11]: In third grade, if they're, hopefully by third grade, they're no longer a newcomer.

1185
01:40:03,766 --> 01:40:04,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1186
01:40:04,447 --> 01:40:08,147
[SPEAKER_11]: So they can go back to their school of origin or their geographical school.

1187
01:40:08,207 --> 01:40:09,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll have a preference in that transfer.

1188
01:40:09,928 --> 01:40:10,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1189
01:40:10,708 --> 01:40:12,348
[SPEAKER_11]: They would go back to their school of origin.

1190
01:40:12,388 --> 01:40:15,729
[SPEAKER_11]: So the goal is to get them out of the newcomers program as soon as possible.

1191
01:40:15,749 --> 01:40:16,709
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of years should do it.

1192
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:21,030
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would hope that they wouldn't have to go to the Roberts.

1193
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:22,370
[SPEAKER_11]: They could go back to school of origin.

1194
01:40:23,531 --> 01:40:23,651
[SPEAKER_07]: OK?

1195
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:24,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1196
01:40:29,251 --> 01:40:30,011
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my question.

1197
01:40:31,871 --> 01:40:32,191
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

1198
01:40:32,211 --> 01:40:34,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to receive in place on file?

1199
01:40:34,592 --> 01:40:35,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry made the motion.

1200
01:40:35,752 --> 01:40:36,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second by Ms.

1201
01:40:36,812 --> 01:40:37,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot?

1202
01:40:37,672 --> 01:40:38,412
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1203
01:40:39,053 --> 01:40:39,713
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1204
01:40:39,773 --> 01:40:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1205
01:40:44,254 --> 01:40:45,794
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one item of new business.

1206
01:40:46,194 --> 01:40:50,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Reverend Edward Dowdy,

1207
01:40:51,358 --> 01:40:53,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Father Ed was the pastor of the Collaboration of St.

1208
01:40:53,738 --> 01:40:54,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Francis and St.

1209
01:40:54,619 --> 01:40:56,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Joseph Churches in Medford.

1210
01:40:56,099 --> 01:41:00,980
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of Reverend Father Dowding.

1211
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:12,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent, a couple of announcements.

1212
01:41:12,842 --> 01:41:18,023
[SPEAKER_11]: So on Wednesday evening last, you asked me for some dates, and I gave you the wrong dates a couple of days later.

1213
01:41:18,043 --> 01:41:18,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, graduation.

1214
01:41:21,503 --> 01:41:26,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I wanted to see was just how, you know, attentive you are to what I send out.

1215
01:41:27,229 --> 01:41:29,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And Kathy was the only one who picked it up, so sorry about that.

1216
01:41:30,312 --> 01:41:31,893
[SPEAKER_11]: The rest of you just weren't paying attention.

1217
01:41:31,913 --> 01:41:33,234
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just kidding.

1218
01:41:33,294 --> 01:41:34,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've given you corrected dates.

1219
01:41:36,137 --> 01:41:40,642
[SPEAKER_11]: June 6 is the Curtis Tufts graduation, 1130 at the Irish American.

1220
01:41:42,123 --> 01:41:42,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Now 11 o'clock?

1221
01:41:42,944 --> 01:41:43,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1222
01:41:45,006 --> 01:41:45,366
[SPEAKER_06]: This says 1130.

1223
01:41:48,207 --> 01:41:50,189
[SPEAKER_11]: It's now 11 o'clock.

1224
01:41:50,209 --> 01:41:52,670
[SPEAKER_06]: 11 o'clock, okay.

1225
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:57,694
[SPEAKER_11]: If you get there half an hour later, you'll be there in time for the food.

1226
01:41:59,676 --> 01:42:04,820
[SPEAKER_11]: The M-Corp banquet is on June 6th in the evening, and graduation is on the 7th.

1227
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:11,275
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of other things, we have a meeting this Wednesday evening to interview ELL candidates.

1228
01:42:12,096 --> 01:42:17,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I have at least three candidates, good candidates for you to see, possibly a fourth by tomorrow.

1229
01:42:17,557 --> 01:42:20,098
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll make sure we check out a couple of references.

1230
01:42:20,918 --> 01:42:23,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's Wednesday starting at 7.

1231
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:33,542
[SPEAKER_11]: We've reserved the 22nd and the 25th for additional meetings, possibly for community schools or for other situations, and also possibly

1232
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:37,662
[SPEAKER_11]: to interview the candidates for the vocational director's principal's job.

1233
01:42:38,422 --> 01:42:41,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still going through applications, talking to references.

1234
01:42:41,123 --> 01:42:53,407
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some things happening out there in that type of community, the vocational director's community, that may portend for us to postpone that and move it a little bit further out to get all the candidates that I want to have in the pool.

1235
01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:56,088
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see that and we'll know that better in the next week or so.

1236
01:42:59,369 --> 01:43:01,510
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition to that, I think that

1237
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:16,364
[SPEAKER_11]: you should know that the senate is coming out with its ways and means budget tomorrow that gives us a better idea of what the senate is proposing versus what the house is proposing and what we might be looking at for state funding and budgets.

1238
01:43:16,404 --> 01:43:23,005
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still looking at federal dollars as they get sifted around in reports from the federal government.

1239
01:43:23,025 --> 01:43:27,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So all those things have an impact on you and I just want to make sure you're aware of it.

1240
01:43:27,186 --> 01:43:30,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto, thank you for those updates, Superintendent Felsen.

1241
01:43:32,555 --> 01:43:59,848
[SPEAKER_05]: made madame neighbor don't say that word against I know I'm picking up your habit and so we haven't discussed as the chairperson of the school committee we haven't discussed the superintendent's review his annual review so I'm requesting that you start that process with through you for the superintendent's annual review so we can have that before the end of

1242
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,539
[SPEAKER_05]: our session before summer break.

1243
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:10,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to move forward on making sure that we do our due diligence as a committee and do his annual review.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1248

[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to know if we have any dates of the budget itself.
