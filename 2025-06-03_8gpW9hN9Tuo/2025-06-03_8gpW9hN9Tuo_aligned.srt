00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,210
Hi, everyone.

2
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:57,237
Dr. Cushing, I was asked for my Google credentials when I signed in, and I'm wondering if there's a problem with the link that we need to fix before we get started.

3
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:09,184
I don't believe Dr. Cushing will be joining momentarily.

4
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:10,585
I don't believe that there's a problem.

5
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,887
I just believe that we have the two step authentication.

6
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:16,058
Process now fully engaged.

7
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,304
So if somebody wants to join the meeting and they don't have a Google account, can they not join?

8
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:27,445
To my knowledge, they can.

9
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:30,307
This is just for people with Medford email addresses.

10
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,370
OK.

11
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,231
Did anybody else have a problem joining?

12
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,333
I just want to make sure people can get in.

13
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,134
Can you hear me?

14
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:43,935
Yes.

15
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:50,109
Why does my screen say Chris Stevens has entered the waiting room?

16
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:50,929
Viewer admit.

17
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:52,510
Because you're a co-host.

18
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,150
That's okay.

19
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,130
See?

20
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,471
I'm never a co-host.

21
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,132
Don't let the power go to your head.

22
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:02,313
Sky is the limit right now.

23
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,134
Looks like Erica's having a bit of a problem.

24
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,835
She just messaged me asking about the passcode to the meeting.

25
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:17,243
I'm sorry, Aaron, I caught I didn't catch the beginning of that.

26
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:20,024
Did you say someone who wants to join?

27
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:25,526
All right.

28
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:27,767
Let me double check.

29
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:37,411
Aaron, if she goes to the agenda and clicks the zoom link, I did not have a problem going that way.

30
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:51,150
There is no authentication on for this to get into the Zoom.

31
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,292
So it is open to the general public.

32
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:02,540
OK, I was asked for my Google credentials on the way in, Dr. Cushing.

33
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,062
That is curious.

34
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:09,625
I know that's happened before, and we've had to restart the meeting.

35
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,688
So I just wanted to check if that had to happen here.

36
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,254
No, we are good.

37
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:25,483
I'm not sure why that happened for you, but the, um, I just checked the zoom page and the only thing that is required is the passcode and waiting room, not authentication.

38
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:29,066
Okay.

39
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,248
So we'll just wait for member Reinfeld.

40
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:36,048
I also just had my husband.

41
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:39,109
I sent him the link and a text and asked that he could get in.

42
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,429
He was able to.

43
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,530
And I'm a fly in front of me.

44
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,491
I'm not just like losing my mind.

45
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,533
Laughing along with excitement.

46
00:06:47,553 --> 00:07:03,179
OK, I see, Erica.

47
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:06,980
Okay.

48
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,540
She is now a co-host as well.

49
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,581
Great.

50
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,402
Well, why don't we go ahead and get started?

51
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:15,143
Remember Graham?

52
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:15,903
Yes.

53
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:21,865
Can I just say, this has to be the first time a public official has been actually biking while in our meetings.

54
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:22,705
This is amazing.

55
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:25,266
Come on, it's gotta be the first.

56
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:27,207
I see you.

57
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:28,428
I am on the side of the road.

58
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:31,289
I am not actually Zooming while biking.

59
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:34,570
Love it.

60
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:36,985
OK, June 3rd.

61
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,391
We're going to make it, folks.

62
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:41,671
We're going to make it to the end of June.

63
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,393
OK, so I'm going to read the meeting notice.

64
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:55,040
Please be advised that on Tuesday, June 3 at 4.30, there will be a special meeting of the school committee held via remote participation only.

65
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:04,966

00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:19,569
The Zoom link is 959, or the meeting ID, sorry, 959-977-13078.

68
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,791

00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:32,312
Those submitting questions or comments must include the following, your first and last name, and your Medford street address.

70
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,989
and your question or comment.

71
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:40,050
So we'll start our agenda with a roll call.

72
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,310
Member Brantley.

73
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,531
Oh, Member Brantley froze.

74
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:48,752
And we just lost her.

75
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:49,472
I'll come back to her.

76
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:50,672
Member Graham.

77
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:52,012
Yes, here.

78
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:53,273
Member Ntapa.

79
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:54,253
Here.

80
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:55,613
Member Olopade.

81
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:56,613
Here.

82
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:58,014
Member Reinfeld.

83
00:08:58,374 --> 00:08:58,714
Present.

84
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,178
Remember, so President and Mayor Lungo Kern is mayor.

85
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,219
The mayor's not here today, right?

86
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,040
Correct.

87
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:10,008
And I'll mark Member Brandley back when she gets in.

88
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:14,733
Okay, so 6 present, 1 absent.

89
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,557
May we all rise to salute the flag.

90
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:29,618
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

91
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,142
Okay, first on our agenda, we have Executive Session.

92
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:58,691
Upon motion to enter into Executive Session pursuant to Master in Law, Chapter 30A, Section 21A, Executive Session of the Medford School Committee pursuant to Master in Law, Chapter 30A, Section 21A, to conduct a strategy session on the basis that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining positions of the Medford School Committee.

93
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:16,682
specifically the medford school committee will be discussing contracts with the teamsters local 25 administrators unit medford paraprofessionals organization association the mps budget analyst contracts and approval of appointment for assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction and the director

94
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:21,843
of the English Learner Department, as well as increases for non-unit personnel.

95
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:27,844
The Medford School Committee will reconvene in public session after the executive session is complete.

96
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,524
Is there a motion to enter executive session?

97
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,125
Motion to enter executive session.

98
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:35,065

Second.

101
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:40,386
Member Antoppa.

102
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,867
Member Rossell, will you call the roll?

103
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:43,867
Certainly.

104
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:44,547
Member Brandley.

105
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:45,367
Yes.

106
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:46,445
Member Graham?

107
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:47,105
Yes.

108
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:48,265
Member Ntukpa?

109
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:49,906
Yes.

110
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:51,126
Member Olopade?

111
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:52,086
Yes.

112
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:53,307
Member Rheinfeld?

113
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:53,887
Yes.

114
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:55,267
Member Rousseau?

115
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:55,567
Yes.

116
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:58,068
And Mayor Septon?

117
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:02,929
So motion to enter Executive Session 6 in the affirmative, one absent.

118
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,369
Motion to enter Executive Session is approved.

119
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,090
And we'll be back as soon as we are done.

120
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:09,970
Thank you.

121
01:59:31,653 --> 01:59:32,534
Good evening, everyone.

122
01:59:32,614 --> 01:59:34,037
Thank you for your patience.

123
01:59:36,761 --> 01:59:41,828
Without further ado, we'll get on to the main session agenda here.

124
01:59:43,190 --> 01:59:45,634
The athletic director update, Dr. Pelosi.

125
01:59:47,704 --> 01:59:48,625
Yes, thank you very much.

126
01:59:48,825 --> 01:59:55,830
I'm actually, so we have some updates on some search committees that we have been conducting through the district.

127
01:59:56,470 --> 02:00:06,157
I will briefly be giving an update around the search committee for the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction, as well as the director of English learners.

128
02:00:07,398 --> 02:00:15,564
I'm going to kick it to Dr. Cushing to give us an update on the posting and the search process for a new athletic director for Medford Public Schools.

129
02:00:19,463 --> 02:00:20,584
Thank you, Dr. Galluzzi.

130
02:00:20,624 --> 02:00:21,885
Thank you, members of the school committee.

131
02:00:22,505 --> 02:00:35,674
So with great sadness, Bobby Maloney has announced his retirement after many years as the well-respected athletic director for the Metropolitan Public Schools and throughout the GBL.

132
02:00:36,955 --> 02:00:41,078
That leaves us with a tremendous opportunity to find the next leader for this department.

133
02:00:41,998 --> 02:00:49,385
And what we did was about two weeks ago, we posted we've already received dozens of applications.

134
02:00:50,346 --> 02:00:55,971
So we will keep that open for probably another week or so and continue our recruitment.

135
02:00:56,952 --> 02:01:01,637
We have emailed out to the district through the Friday memo and other individual

136
02:01:03,198 --> 02:01:12,194
messaging for us to have members of the community, members of the staff, participate in the search process.

137
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:20,217
We actually notified them this evening and will be waiting their response to see if they can participate.

138
02:01:20,997 --> 02:01:37,753
This week, we will have an informational meeting for the team to really go over the expectations related to review of documents, confidentiality, and what they should bring to the table in looking for the next athletic director.

139
02:01:38,886 --> 02:01:40,647
In the survey out to the community.

140
02:01:41,167 --> 02:01:49,450
We also looked for what they are, what the community is looking for, and we will review that with the community with the committee this Thursday.

141
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:50,770
So the week of May 19.

142
02:01:53,648 --> 02:01:55,169
Sorry, that's back, looking forward.

143
02:01:55,649 --> 02:01:59,351
So this week, we'll have the selection of the search committee, which I just talked about.

144
02:01:59,852 --> 02:02:05,655
Our announcement once we're confirmed and an initial meeting of the search committee is this Thursday at 7 p.m.

145
02:02:06,616 --> 02:02:13,680
Then next week, we will do review of applications with a meeting on June 12th at 6 p.m.

146
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,341
in person for members of the committee.

147
02:02:15,801 --> 02:02:18,683
We will create interview questions and schedule interviews.

148
02:02:19,303 --> 02:02:28,186
And then we will give approximately a week and a half to two weeks with the week of June 24th being round one interviews with the committee.

149
02:02:28,586 --> 02:02:38,349
And then we hope to make sure that we have round two interviews and notify people of their next round candidacy by June 30th.

150
02:02:39,549 --> 02:02:43,852
Uh, Mr Maloney's, uh, retirement will happen in early september.

151
02:02:44,292 --> 02:02:58,960
So we hope to onboard this new athletic director in early august and bring them on board so that they can, um, understand and learn the ropes, um, with Mr Maloney still in place and to assist with that transition.

152
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:07,105
And we hope to announce the new athletic director at a, um, point in mid july on or about july 14th.

153
02:03:11,016 --> 02:03:15,659
If any members of the committee have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.

154
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,701
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

155
02:03:17,721 --> 02:03:21,123
Are there any questions from the committee?

156
02:03:21,143 --> 02:03:25,446
Any questions from members of the public?

157
02:03:25,466 --> 02:03:34,673
Okay, seeing none.

158
02:03:35,974 --> 02:03:36,274
Thank you.

159
02:03:36,819 --> 02:03:43,080
We will move on to item B, which is an update to the facilities non-unit positions.

160
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,281
Thank you very much.

161
02:03:45,841 --> 02:03:53,542
So what I would like to just spend some time outlining for you this evening is twofold.

162
02:03:54,042 --> 02:04:03,744
So the first part is in doing a little bit of research around some of our neighboring districts and in looking at like,

163
02:04:04,264 --> 02:04:09,705
the scope of work that is happening, as well as the work that we have coming up.

164
02:04:11,425 --> 02:04:17,747
A lot of work to our existing buildings and the work through the MSBA on the high school.

165
02:04:19,227 --> 02:04:33,910
I would like to reflect a small change in title right now on our website and in name, we refer to buildings and grounds as encompassing all of this work.

166
02:04:34,504 --> 02:04:50,098
And I would just like to make a small change in referring to the department as the facilities department, both in just a formal manner, I think that changing it more accurately encompasses the work that's happening at the physical level of the buildings.

167
02:04:51,059 --> 02:04:55,806
but also the infrastructure that is needed to support the overall functioning of our schools.

168
02:04:57,648 --> 02:04:58,810
That's first and foremost.

169
02:05:00,332 --> 02:05:03,697
And it would also align us to our neighboring districts.

170
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:11,242
I think buildings and grounds is a little bit of an outdated term, and you don't see it reflected.

171
02:05:11,423 --> 02:05:20,687
So right now, districts like Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville, Everett, Lynn, and Wakefield refer to this as the facilities department.

172
02:05:21,367 --> 02:05:29,631
And some of our other neighboring districts, like Malden, Winchester, Revere, and Melrose, actually, it's part of the Department of Public Works.

173
02:05:30,491 --> 02:05:38,725
So I think just making that change in title will be reflective of the work that we're doing and aspire to do.

174
02:05:40,798 --> 02:05:57,203
in that previously this board approved a job description for the facilities director as well as a job description for the assistant facilities director.

175
02:05:58,464 --> 02:06:08,627
I am here because I would like to propose a change in what was previously approved and do something a little different with that assistant

176
02:06:10,228 --> 02:06:11,910
facilities director position.

177
02:06:12,491 --> 02:06:21,302
So, Dr. Cushing, as has been well documented at many of these meetings, has done a lot of work to

178
02:06:23,142 --> 02:06:34,589
begin a lot of projects, not only on our buildings, but well, the infrastructure and the grounds as well.

179
02:06:35,770 --> 02:06:38,452
These projects, there's many projects that are ongoing.

180
02:06:39,052 --> 02:06:44,616
Just first and foremost, as an example, is the HVAC one that is ongoing, but it's happening this summer.

181
02:06:45,076 --> 02:06:49,359
And then there are other capital projects that are about to begin this summer.

182
02:06:51,121 --> 02:06:55,765
specifically like around the FOBs and the security systems.

183
02:06:55,965 --> 02:07:10,500
So what I think would be very important with Dr. Cushing's resignation and headed as a superintendent for Beverly Public Schools is instead to have a project manager position

184
02:07:11,101 --> 02:07:19,498
and someone that would be a key person working under the supervision of the chief operation officer.

185
02:07:21,186 --> 02:07:33,708
but really just keeping an eye on all the projects that we have ongoing and ones that we have slated to begin and ones that we haven't really even envisioned yet.

186
02:07:34,328 --> 02:07:49,931
This, in my opinion, would be someone that would take on compliance of the timeline and the budget and report it directly to the chief operation officer, also in partnership with myself and the finance office.

187
02:07:52,022 --> 02:07:59,072
I'm happy to talk in more specifics or detail or answer any questions that you may have.

188
02:07:59,092 --> 02:08:05,482
I do have in the paperwork that I've given you just a reflection of how this would look in the

189
02:08:07,730 --> 02:08:20,874
the organizational chart just so that you could see that this position would be under the COO, and as well as a proposed job description for the position.

190
02:08:20,894 --> 02:08:27,256
I think I've spoken a little bit about some of the key responsibilities.

191
02:08:27,856 --> 02:08:35,158
We are looking for this job to preferably be someone that

192
02:08:35,578 --> 02:08:51,771
obtains a, that has a bachelor's degree in project management, construction management, engineering, or facilities management with proven experience, someone that has the knowledge and the skills in building systems, in HVAC systems.

193
02:08:54,253 --> 02:08:57,716
And we have a range set for this.

194
02:08:58,297 --> 02:08:59,918
This would be a full-time position at 260 days.

195
02:09:01,899 --> 02:09:05,402
with a pay range anywhere from $80,000 to $110,000.

196
02:09:05,922 --> 02:09:14,908
Thank you for that.

197
02:09:16,088 --> 02:09:28,396
Are there questions from the committee about either the RE-ORG or the job descriptions that were attached for the project manager, the COO, or the facilities director?

198
02:09:32,802 --> 02:09:34,763
Dr. Galuzzi, did you say 260 days?

199
02:09:35,684 --> 02:09:35,904
Yes.

200
02:09:36,544 --> 02:09:36,944
Thank you.

201
02:09:42,087 --> 02:09:44,228
I'm seeing no questions from the committee.

202
02:09:44,288 --> 02:09:46,309
Are there questions from the public?

203
02:09:58,548 --> 02:10:07,296
Seeing no questions, is there a motion to approve the proposal and related job descriptions?

204
02:10:10,459 --> 02:10:10,919
So moved.

205
02:10:12,141 --> 02:10:15,043
By Member Ntapa, seconded by?

206
02:10:22,110 --> 02:10:22,430
Second.

207
02:10:23,491 --> 02:10:24,052
Member Russo?

208
02:10:26,142 --> 02:10:28,544
Any other last questions before we call the roll?

209
02:10:33,367 --> 02:10:34,868
Member Reinfeldt, could you call the roll for us?

210
02:10:35,408 --> 02:10:35,728
Yes.

211
02:10:36,769 --> 02:10:37,410
Member Branley?

212
02:10:37,890 --> 02:10:38,130
Yes.

213
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:39,371
Member Graham?

214
02:10:39,911 --> 02:10:40,211
Yes.

215
02:10:40,712 --> 02:10:41,452
Member Antapa?

216
02:10:42,213 --> 02:10:42,573
Yes.

217
02:10:43,293 --> 02:10:44,094
Member Olopade?

218
02:10:49,618 --> 02:10:50,718
Member Reinfeldt, yes.

219
02:10:51,179 --> 02:10:51,979
Member Rousseau?

220
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:53,000
Yes.

221
02:10:55,342 --> 02:10:56,723
Mayor Lungo Kern, absent.

222
02:10:57,604 --> 02:10:58,745
Member Olopade, are you back?

223
02:10:59,586 --> 02:11:00,287
Member Olopade?

224
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:07,674
Okay, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent.

225
02:11:07,954 --> 02:11:08,795
Motion is approved.

226
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:10,596
Thank you.

227
02:11:12,618 --> 02:11:19,525
Moving right along, we have a recommendation to approve the appointment of an assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction, Dr. Glucy.

228
02:11:21,405 --> 02:11:22,946
Yes, thank you very much.

229
02:11:23,226 --> 02:11:29,768
We're very excited about bringing this to you this evening.

230
02:11:31,209 --> 02:11:41,252
Previously, we informed the community about the search process for this very important position, which is a K-12 position for the district overseeing

231
02:11:42,953 --> 02:11:44,854
curriculum and instruction for the district.

232
02:11:45,634 --> 02:11:53,859
So we had a very healthy pool of about 50 applicants and we had a wonderful search committee.

233
02:11:55,259 --> 02:12:01,403
Member Reinfeld was part of that search committee, Joan Bowen and I facilitated this search committee.

234
02:12:01,423 --> 02:12:09,427
It was comprised of caregivers, teachers, administrators, and it was a

235
02:12:12,171 --> 02:12:14,853
a wonderful representation of the district.

236
02:12:15,193 --> 02:12:18,415
So we had a lot to vet out.

237
02:12:18,695 --> 02:12:24,239
We brought in nine out of the 50 applicants for an interview.

238
02:12:25,179 --> 02:12:27,281
And of that nine, I will say

239
02:12:28,741 --> 02:12:45,932
one candidate was unanimous in all phases of this search process, first and foremost with the search committee and then moving on to phase two, which brought the candidate up to central administration where principals and directors

240
02:12:46,570 --> 02:12:50,033
were part of the interview process as well as a performance task.

241
02:12:51,535 --> 02:12:54,618
One candidate was unanimous in every interview panel.

242
02:12:54,638 --> 02:13:00,003
And there was one candidate in the performance task that really met

243
02:13:03,712 --> 02:13:06,015
the rubric criteria quite well.

244
02:13:06,696 --> 02:13:07,998
References were impeccable.

245
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:12,885
This candidate is Dr. Kimberly Lawless Talbot.

246
02:13:13,706 --> 02:13:18,192
She is the Director of Teaching and Learning for the Salem Public Schools.

247
02:13:19,153 --> 02:13:21,954
She is doing the job currently.

248
02:13:22,594 --> 02:13:30,137
Previous to that, she was a director of teacher development under a professional development realm.

249
02:13:30,637 --> 02:13:31,678
She is an educator.

250
02:13:32,958 --> 02:13:35,259
She was a world language educator.

251
02:13:35,299 --> 02:13:36,739
She was a world language director.

252
02:13:36,839 --> 02:13:39,801
She is an adjunct professor at Salem State.

253
02:13:40,441 --> 02:13:46,123
She comes with a great skill set and a great level of expertise.

254
02:13:46,903 --> 02:14:00,066
A lot of her references spoke about her systems-level thinking, which was music to my ears, because it would be very beneficial for Medford Public Schools, and we're really excited for this partnership.

255
02:14:01,987 --> 02:14:07,848
I think she also has a wonderful way about her, and she would just be a tremendous asset to our team.

256
02:14:10,129 --> 02:14:19,993
I am here because I would like your approval so that we are able to officially bring Dr. Talbot in as a Mustang.

257
02:14:20,634 --> 02:14:22,935
And I do would like to welcome

258
02:14:23,871 --> 02:14:29,352
Member Reinfeld and Joan Bowen for any key pieces that I may have missed.

259
02:14:29,472 --> 02:14:46,136
I also see, at least on the Zoom, I'm sure many people are probably joining via YouTube, but I also see Jessica Parks, who was one of the caregivers on our team as well, if anybody wants to speak about the process or the candidate.

260
02:14:47,142 --> 02:14:47,802
Member Reinfeld?

261
02:14:48,482 --> 02:14:52,824
Yep, I will just say I am incredibly excited about this candidate.

262
02:14:53,864 --> 02:15:09,429
Dr. Scalusi said most of it, but she is incredibly competent and her values are rock solid and well aligned with Medford's instructional vision, strategic plan values, community-based approaches.

263
02:15:09,449 --> 02:15:10,290
So I am

264
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:23,061
very excited to motion that we approve the offer to Dr. Kimberly Lawless-Talbot for the position of Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction.

265
02:15:24,362 --> 02:15:26,605
Is there some motion to approve by Member Reinfeldt?

266
02:15:26,665 --> 02:15:27,325
Is there a second?

267
02:15:29,087 --> 02:15:29,427
Second.

268
02:15:30,188 --> 02:15:31,449
Seconded by Member Branley.

269
02:15:31,469 --> 02:15:35,954
Is there any other members of the public that would like to speak?

270
02:15:36,886 --> 02:15:37,306
Member Graham?

271
02:15:37,827 --> 02:15:38,107
Yes.

272
02:15:38,667 --> 02:15:39,328
Member Russo?

273
02:15:39,808 --> 02:15:41,630
Just want to make sure that the motion is to a point.

274
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:43,331
To a point, sorry.

275
02:15:43,371 --> 02:15:44,792
Thank you.

276
02:15:49,216 --> 02:15:51,458
Okay, hearing and seeing no other questions.

277
02:15:51,778 --> 02:15:52,959
Member Reinfeldt, can you call the roll?

278
02:15:53,559 --> 02:15:53,780
Yes.

279
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:54,480
Member Branley?

280
02:15:54,901 --> 02:15:55,141
Yes.

281
02:15:55,861 --> 02:15:56,402
Member Graham?

282
02:15:56,862 --> 02:15:57,122
Yes.

283
02:15:57,823 --> 02:15:58,543
Member Antapa?

284
02:15:59,244 --> 02:15:59,544
Yes.

285
02:16:00,285 --> 02:16:01,106
Member Olopade?

286
02:16:04,408 --> 02:16:05,189
Member Reinfeldt?

287
02:16:05,249 --> 02:16:05,549
Yes.

288
02:16:05,749 --> 02:16:06,190
Member Russo?

289
02:16:07,075 --> 02:16:10,519
Yes, member of mayor lungo current absent.

290
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:18,207
So, 6 in the affirmative is that memorable party was absent.

291
02:16:18,227 --> 02:16:26,155
5 in the affirmative 0 in the negative 2 absent motion passes and.

292
02:16:27,497 --> 02:16:28,418
Her last name is.

293
02:16:29,217 --> 02:16:30,878
Talbot, thank you.

294
02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:32,239
Ms.

295
02:16:32,259 --> 02:16:34,841
Talbot is here by Mustang.

296
02:16:37,783 --> 02:16:40,585
Sorry, I promise I'm not dying in my chair here.

297
02:16:40,605 --> 02:16:45,749
My allergies are just viciously attacking me while we're meeting.

298
02:16:45,809 --> 02:16:48,191
So sorry to cough in your face.

299
02:16:49,712 --> 02:16:57,417
The last thing on our agenda is a recommendation to approve the appointment of the Director of English Learners.

300
02:16:58,800 --> 02:16:59,327
Dr. Pelosi?

301
02:17:00,983 --> 02:17:02,744
Okay, so we've been very busy.

302
02:17:03,864 --> 02:17:05,344
So when Ms.

303
02:17:05,384 --> 02:17:29,032
Bowen and I, in partnership with member Reinfeld, were leading this search committee for the assistant superintendent, outgoing director of the English Learner Department, Paul Texera, who will be the next superintendent in Provincetown, in partnership with Principal Nancy Sherman-Hudson of the Missituck,

304
02:17:29,573 --> 02:17:35,353
led a search committee for his replacement for the director of the EL department.

305
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:47,204
They went through the same similar process and also member Alipate was the school committee rep on that committee.

306
02:17:49,445 --> 02:17:58,329
They went through the same process and through their initial search round one with the search committee brought up to central.

307
02:18:00,490 --> 02:18:10,373
two candidates for us to review and one candidate definitely throughout the search process kind of rose to the top.

308
02:18:11,734 --> 02:18:16,235
She is currently doing a position quite similar for Everett Public Schools.

309
02:18:17,936 --> 02:18:28,999
She is very aligned with Medford Public Schools core values and instructional vision and she brought with her a great willingness to

310
02:18:30,139 --> 02:18:31,380
learn and grow.

311
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:37,544
And she had some great visionary ideas for the program that would be very helpful for us.

312
02:18:38,164 --> 02:18:40,706
So her name is Chelsea McNiff.

313
02:18:41,747 --> 02:18:46,510
And we are here to do the same thing and ask for approval appointment.

314
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:52,112
for Chelsea McNiff to be the next EL director for Medford Public Schools.

315
02:18:52,972 --> 02:18:56,773
Joan was with me in round two of her interview process.

316
02:18:57,493 --> 02:19:06,456
And I don't know if member Alipati wants to say a few words, but he was an integral part in the first round of the interview process.

317
02:19:12,437 --> 02:19:14,418
Are there any questions or comments from the committee?

318
02:19:22,436 --> 02:19:27,577
Okay, hearing and seeing none, is there a motion to approve the appointment of the Director of the English?

319
02:19:27,597 --> 02:19:30,117
Are there any questions or comments from the public?

320
02:19:32,578 --> 02:19:34,538
Are there any questions or comments from the public?

321
02:19:41,039 --> 02:19:48,640
Seeing none, is there a motion to approve the appointment of the Director of the English?

322
02:19:48,660 --> 02:19:49,881
By Member Branley.

323
02:19:51,061 --> 02:19:51,601
Seconded by?

324
02:19:55,285 --> 02:19:55,605
Second.

325
02:19:56,545 --> 02:19:57,326
Member Russo?

326
02:19:58,326 --> 02:19:59,586
Member Reinfeldt, will you call the roll?

327
02:20:00,067 --> 02:20:00,687
Member Branley?

328
02:20:00,707 --> 02:20:01,487
Yes.

329
02:20:02,387 --> 02:20:02,927
Member Graham?

330
02:20:03,508 --> 02:20:03,788
Yes.

331
02:20:04,408 --> 02:20:05,168
Member Ntapa?

332
02:20:05,908 --> 02:20:06,208
Yes.

333
02:20:06,949 --> 02:20:07,729
Member Olopade?

334
02:20:10,190 --> 02:20:11,270
Member Reinfeldt, yes.

335
02:20:13,151 --> 02:20:13,851
Member Russo?

336
02:20:14,491 --> 02:20:14,771
Yes.

337
02:20:15,651 --> 02:20:17,192
Mayor Lungo Kern, absent.

338
02:20:17,872 --> 02:20:20,713
So five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent.

339
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:23,811
Another Mustang joins our ranks.

340
02:20:24,471 --> 02:20:25,232
Welcome, Ms.

341
02:20:25,272 --> 02:20:25,632
McNiff.

342
02:20:26,233 --> 02:20:34,299
And I think for those of you that are watching, we do plan to introduce them personally in a meeting later this month.

343
02:20:34,579 --> 02:20:44,767
We just urgently needed to make their appointments so that they could provide proper notice to their district and we could move through the contracting process.

344
02:20:46,822 --> 02:21:11,218
The last update for everybody before we adjourn, I know this actually turned out to be a rather long meeting, is that I am happy to report that we have voted in a vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, to ratify the contract with Medford's Administrators Union.

345
02:21:11,279 --> 02:21:12,479
So that's Teamsters Local 25.

346
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:15,141
So that's our assistant principals, our directors,

347
02:21:17,723 --> 02:21:21,565
our special ed coordinators and others who make up that unit.

348
02:21:22,025 --> 02:21:25,967
And we have been hard at work negotiating with them since the beginning of the year.

349
02:21:26,728 --> 02:21:32,511
And we are thrilled to announce that they have ratified the contract and now we have as well.

350
02:21:32,571 --> 02:21:38,474
So that is the only other update for all of you out of executive session.

351
02:21:39,815 --> 02:21:41,876
And with that, is there a motion to approve?

352
02:21:44,617 --> 02:21:45,197
Adjourned.

353
02:21:45,377 --> 02:21:46,038
Motion to adjourn.

354
02:21:47,437 --> 02:21:48,758
I was not approving anything else.

355
02:21:48,798 --> 02:21:49,339
We're adjourning.

356
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:52,101
We've done everything we can do tonight.

357
02:21:52,121 --> 02:21:54,462
I'm out of water, and I'm going to die if I don't get some more.

358
02:21:56,464 --> 02:22:00,687
By Member Branley, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

359
02:22:01,388 --> 02:22:02,229
Roll call, please.

360
02:22:02,729 --> 02:22:03,429
Member Branley.

361
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:04,290
Yes, please.

362
02:22:04,971 --> 02:22:05,691
Member Graham.

363
02:22:06,252 --> 02:22:06,532
Yes.

364
02:22:07,012 --> 02:22:07,733
Member Ntapa.

365
02:22:08,834 --> 02:22:09,074
Yes.

366
02:22:09,774 --> 02:22:10,815
Member Olopade.

367
02:22:12,316 --> 02:22:13,057
Absent.

368
02:22:13,397 --> 02:22:14,258
Already adjourned.

369
02:22:15,379 --> 02:22:16,480
Member Reinfeldt, yes.

370
02:22:17,572 --> 02:22:18,453
Member Russo?

371
02:22:18,993 --> 02:22:19,273
Yes.

372
02:22:20,314 --> 02:22:21,355
And Mayor Lunko-Kern?

373
02:22:21,956 --> 02:22:22,296
Absent.

374
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:28,441
Five in the affirmative.

375
02:22:29,141 --> 02:22:32,744
One doesn't have a microphone, but he agrees.

376
02:22:34,332 --> 02:22:35,593
So should I mark him as yes?

377
02:22:36,114 --> 02:22:37,715
I was going to say, he did come back in.

378
02:22:37,735 --> 02:22:38,716
He did.

379
02:22:38,776 --> 02:22:39,977
But he can't unmute.

380
02:22:40,057 --> 02:22:43,120
So that's OK.

381
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:47,604
He's a registered yes for adjournment and one absent.

382
02:22:47,664 --> 02:22:49,485
So six in the affirmative, one absent.

383
02:22:49,565 --> 02:22:50,346
Meeting is adjourned.

384
02:22:50,586 --> 02:22:51,167
Thank you, everyone.

385
02:22:51,187 --> 02:22:51,667
Thanks, guys.

386
02:22:51,687 --> 02:22:52,228
Have a good night.

387
02:22:52,708 --> 02:22:53,148
Thank you.

388
02:22:53,189 --> 02:22:53,549
Good night.
