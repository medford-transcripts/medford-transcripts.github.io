00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:23,642
[SPEAKER_04]: additional students that come from new developments.

26
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:28,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And we requested our report be given to us in January.

27
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:32,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want more detail about what was requested.

28
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:33,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I said I would like

29
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:46,858
[SPEAKER_04]: units of a hundred and above instead of the hundred and fifty and we would like to try to capture non school-aged children as well as school-aged children so we can pre-plan in our budget.

30
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:54,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like that noted in the minutes as well as on the back of our requested reports.

31
00:01:55,445 --> 00:02:00,549
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for adoption of the minutes as amended by Mr. Benedetto, all those in favor?

32
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:02,794
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

33
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:03,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

34
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:07,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to take note that we have Justin Tang with us tonight.

35
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,396
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the student representative from Medford High School, so welcome Justin.

36
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:18,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

37
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:23,020
[SPEAKER_10]: And Justin, feel free when we're discussing any matters, if you want to interject, just raise your hand and we'll acknowledge it.

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

39
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Approval of bills transfer of funds.

40
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:32,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

41
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:33,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

42
00:02:38,544 --> 00:03:04,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Kirsten Kirsten's not here, but I Okay, so my first question is in tuition reimbursement features I saw a lot of line items for that and I just didn't know what the policy was for tuition reimbursement because just in this bill Approval we have seven thousand six hundred and eighty four dollars in tuition reimbursement for teachers I don't know how teachers apply for that.

43
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how it's allocated

44
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:22,571
[SPEAKER_15]: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two for teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.

45
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:28,918
[SPEAKER_15]: What you're seeing in that line, in those line items, is reimbursement for that purpose.

46
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:35,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And could you just explain how teachers apply for that and how they've been notified that they have that option?

47
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:38,706
[SPEAKER_15]: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.

48
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:39,427
[SPEAKER_15]: He reviews it.

49
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,647
[SPEAKER_15]: It's first come, first serve.

50
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:45,488
[SPEAKER_15]: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.

51
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,349
[SPEAKER_15]: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.

52
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,970
[SPEAKER_15]: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.

53
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:58,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that you say that, I do remember approving that piece of the budget, and I'm glad to see it started.

54
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:13,904
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to mention that as your secretary, when I go in and sign the bills, I see all of the lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed.

55
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:18,528
[SPEAKER_20]: And I get to see what courses they're taking, what grades they've gotten, they're doing great.

56
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:28,952
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I've noticed there were a lot that came in probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent and that's the line item you're seeing but I have looked at every single one.

57
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:29,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

58
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:31,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a few more items.

59
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,534
[SPEAKER_04]: My second item is on page 3 of 16.

60
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:37,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for $3,395 and it says Meffitt High School miscellaneous charges.

61
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:52,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody have a recollection as to what and the payment was the vendor was method high school So I was just curious what that was this is for the hockey clothing, okay?

62
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:55,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Hockey uniforms

63
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:02,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and the next item is number three.

64
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:09,604
[SPEAKER_04]: An athletic official on page 11 of 16, an athletic official bill was paid $10,220.

65
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:16,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That just seems so much higher than most of the other ones, and it just caught my eye.

66
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:21,896
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.

67
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:35,046
[SPEAKER_15]: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference and check is made out to the conference Okay, cuz yeah, it just strictly for her You know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL.

68
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,427
[SPEAKER_15]: We now belongs to the Northeast conference

69
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:42,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I was just curious, because it said an individual for that large amount of money, just seemed worth bringing up.

70
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:46,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And number four is on page 12 of 16.

71
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:56,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It says net sports group $8,998, and it says the reason is unclassified.

72
00:05:56,067 --> 00:06:00,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just wondering why that wasn't classified, and exactly what that was.

73
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,071
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.

74
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,253
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on page... Page 12.

[SPEAKER_15]: That was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.

[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

87
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:44,443

[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

89
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:46,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

90
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:48,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Report of secretary.

91
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:49,668
[SPEAKER_10]: There is none.

92
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:51,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Report of committees.

93
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Committee of the whole.

94
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:53,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent.

95
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:58,053
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.

96
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:01,996
[SPEAKER_15]: You have that in your folder.

97
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,258
[SPEAKER_15]: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.

98
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:08,580
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.

99
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some questions.

100
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,302
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like it read, please.

101
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:11,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

102
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:12,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Fritz has some questions.

103
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:23,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent, I was a little confused about the motion, so I had sent some inquiries over to Dr. Perala and the director of guidance.

104
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:42,132
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I found out through email communication was that's something that's not possible.

105
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:48,559
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, currently there isn't a way in Naviance to add a notation on the transcript

106
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,242
[SPEAKER_07]: or add an additional document, or attach a separate page.

107
00:07:53,723 --> 00:08:13,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they can do is the guidance counselor can write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the student, providing the information about the class rank, what the student was prior to the merger, and the student can complete a brag sheet, and that can help the guidance counselor write the personal accomplishments about the student.

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:34,027
[SPEAKER_07]: but you know this is all through communications so I was wondering if you know we can I'd like to make a motion you know to invite the headmaster and the vocational director back so we can get like the final details about the class ranking because this was just me going back and forth because I was a little confused.

109
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:37,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was gonna be something different than what we motioned for.

110
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:42,483
[SPEAKER_10]: On the minutes of the meeting of the committee of the whole the motion says that

111
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I requested to have separate rankings in quarterly meetings.

112
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not exactly what I had motioned for.

113
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:14,105
[SPEAKER_04]: What I had motioned for is a separate internal ranking, so that way we know which students in the vocational school and their class rank.

114
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:16,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's how I remember it correctly.

115
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:22,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also asked that a notation be presented on the transcript.

116
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's not possible,

117
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:40,611
[SPEAKER_04]: then I strongly agree with my colleague that the heads of both schools as well as the guidance department needs to come to us and tell us that our motion isn't possible and to present us with what options are possible and how we're going to move forward with this.

118
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,073
[SPEAKER_04]: because this is a very important issue for our seniors and our juniors.

119
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:48,297
[SPEAKER_04]: At least with our sophomores, we have time to notify them of this change.

120
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:57,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still gonna be hard for that level, but at some point, we need to merge them in with the high school rankings, because we do have one code now, and that's how we report it.

121
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:07,009
[SPEAKER_04]: but we need to make some adjustment for these two years, I believe, and that's why I made the motion, and that's why it was approved unanimously.

122
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:21,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm agreeing with my colleague's motion, and I hope that happens very quickly, because this is affecting students that are already sent out applications to colleges, so I motion that it be done immediately.

123
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:27,415
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.

124
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:46,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, the only thing is of course the the some of the kids are already beginning to apply to college So there is a timeliness issue and I too have a different recollection than what's here because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the

125
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:56,259
[SPEAKER_20]: kids GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program.

126
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,343
[SPEAKER_20]: It says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it.

127
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:09,327
[SPEAKER_20]: I was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected.

128
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:11,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Superintendent.

129
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we get a clarification out this week.

130
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,752
[SPEAKER_15]: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.

131
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,589
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.

132
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:26,472
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.

133
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:30,644
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would like to lay the paper on the table.

134
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:36,345
[SPEAKER_10]: She asked for a motion to have them appear if they're not able to rectify it in the next week internally.

135
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:44,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we warrant, would this warrant an emergency meeting because of the timeliness with children's transcripts?

136
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:50,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a school committee member, I'm making a motion that if they can't rectify this by the end of this week that we have

137
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,934
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting at the beginning of next week.

138
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:56,018
[SPEAKER_04]: So I need someone to second that motion.

139
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:56,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second it.

140
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,601
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a second by Ms.

141
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:58,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustone.

142
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:58,963
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

143
00:11:58,983 --> 00:11:59,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

144
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,069
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

145
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

146
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:04,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

147
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:06,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Kreatz, did you have another question?

148
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:18,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's not an emergency matter, but I just thought it would be a nice report if we could get a report on the breakdown of how many students are in each co-op shop and where they're working.

149
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:23,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just something really interesting, but it's not an emergency report.

150
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to make a motion for that.

151
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:32,241
[SPEAKER_15]: So you suggest that, what do you call it, you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very

152
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Transitory report this early in the year.

153
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:44,737
[SPEAKER_10]: All in the motion that a report of all the co-ops and internships that are being held by our vocational and high school students be delivered by staff, if need be.

154
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Ms.

155
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:46,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustone.

156
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,421
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

157
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:48,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

158
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:49,183
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

159
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:50,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

160
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:52,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise?

161
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:54,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just had one more.

162
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:59,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to inquire about one shop in particular.

163
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the robotics engineering.

164
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:10,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, the robotics engineering has been the traditional vocational program, and it's going to be switching over with the graduating class of 2018.

165
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:17,321
[SPEAKER_07]: And just recently, there's been a development where there is

166
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:34,774
[SPEAKER_07]: there is a co-op opportunity for the robotics engineering students so I just wanted to bring that up and if it could be revisited for the future students if they were interested in the co-op plan it would be ideal and I was out this weekend

167
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:53,961
[SPEAKER_07]: going out doing the college tours and what we saw was at Wentworth they had the same equipment that we have in our robotics engineering shop and my son, he's been involved in the program, he knew all the names of the machines and in fact we have newer machines than they have

168
00:13:54,321 --> 00:14:18,727
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they have like a five-axis and we have a three-axis, but he knew all the machines and they had the sheet metal shop, and it was just really fascinating to see that our Medford Vocational School has that equipment that's college-ready, and when they shared some information about their co-ops, their students are college students going out and getting co-ops, and they're starting out at $15 an hour, and that's what our vocational students are doing,

169
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:38,632
[SPEAKER_07]: in that particular field, so I really think it's important to have another look at the robotics engineering program because there might be an opportunity for it to remain as the A week B week program and this was a new development that came about recently for an opportunity for students.

170
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to make a motion to have that revisited.

171
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:42,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

172
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:44,695
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion, let that be revisited.

173
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

174
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:47,217
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

175
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:47,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

176
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:48,718
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

177
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:49,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

178
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:50,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

179
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion for approval of the Committee of the Whole with those additions being looked into?

180
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:58,546
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval.

181
00:14:58,586 --> 00:14:59,346
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

182
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:00,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

183
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,028
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

184
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:01,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

185
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:02,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

186
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, community participation.

187
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,095
[SPEAKER_10]: McGlynn Middle School teachers on Medford Public Schools Action Plan.

188
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,113
[SPEAKER_10]: You name and address, please, for our record.

189
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:27,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Brian Villard, 221 Summer Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, 02143.

190
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:32,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Sherry Flint, 35 Fay Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02118.

191
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Patricia Haas, 205 Elm Street, Medford, Mass., 02155.

192
00:15:47,574 --> 00:16:04,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Honorable Mayor Burke, ladies and gentlemen of the school committee, Superintendent Belson, Deputy Superintendent Nelson, we, the teachers of the McGlynn Middle School, are here in response to item number seven under the report of the superintendent, dated September 18th, 2017, entitled McGlynn Action Plan.

193
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:17,899
[SPEAKER_17]: After each of us watched this meeting, we came together as a staff and discussed our disappointment regarding the lack of our voice and input being included in this action plan.

194
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,642
[SPEAKER_17]: We feel that the McGlynn was misrepresented and our achievements overshadowed.

195
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:26,746
[SPEAKER_17]: We are the teachers of the McGlynn and we are here because we care.

196
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:31,389
[SPEAKER_17]: We are proud that the McGlynn Middle School is unique in the city of Medford.

197
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:39,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Our school houses the population of students that is most diverse in background, ability, language, and culture.

198
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:43,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Our school is home to the entire Medford Middle School EL population.

199
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:48,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year, through our inclusion model, we serviced a population of almost 60% high-need students.

200
00:16:51,215 --> 00:17:00,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Each day, our staff rises to and celebrates the challenge of not only educating, but also of meeting the social and emotional needs of the whole child.

201
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:05,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Teachers and staff do this by creating a community of respect and of excellence.

202
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:12,541
[SPEAKER_17]: We value all of our students, and we do all we can to help them excel both academically and socially.

203
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:20,023
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care, and we are dedicated.

204
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:27,691
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers and staff at the McGlynn enthusiastically devote our time and resources to make the building better on a daily basis.

205
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:46,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Students at the McGlynn enjoy a variety of staff-run extracurricular activities, including Drama Club, National Junior Honor Society, Builders Club, Student Council, the interactive morning news program, yearbook, art club, a rock and roll show, talent show,

206
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:56,734
[SPEAKER_01]: chorus program, a school-wide multicultural holiday sing-along, a gold medal winning string ensemble, and numerous other activities based on student interest.

207
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:07,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do we dedicate ourselves to these extracurriculars, we have repeatedly volunteered to advise these clubs and many others, often without response or support.

208
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:11,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we desire even more extracurricular opportunities for our students?

209
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:12,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

210
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:22,926
[SPEAKER_01]: However, permission to move forward, financing, and support continue to limit aspirations of those who wish to bring in additional programming and opportunities for our students.

211
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:29,765
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care, and we want the best for our students.

212
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:35,528
[SPEAKER_01]: We want every student to have the most advantages and educational opportunities possible.

213
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:45,392
[SPEAKER_01]: This requires us to continually collaborate, communicate, and cooperate to ensure the best educational environment possible for our students.

214
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:55,301
[SPEAKER_01]: The more stable, healthy, and professional the relations between the staff are, the more we are able to provide a stable, healthy, and supportive school climate.

215
00:18:56,229 --> 00:19:11,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, it was disappointing to hear that over the summer, staffing decisions were made based on our backgrounds, talents, and relationships, without the knowledge, without the involvement, or without the input of the most valuable resources available, the staff.

216
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:21,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So as expected, the conclusions and actions, which were based on incomplete and erroneous information, do not match the stated needs outlined in the McGlynn Middle School Action Plan.

217
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:26,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go into that in details, not now, but we're prepared to do so in another forum.

218
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:34,517
[SPEAKER_21]: We are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care and we ask to be involved.

219
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,311
[SPEAKER_21]: We are a vibrant and energetic staff and care about each other and our students.

220
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:44,172
[SPEAKER_21]: We maintain pro-student attitude no matter what challenges are presented to us.

221
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:52,875
[SPEAKER_21]: We work together in teams, our work families, and as such, advocate for whatever program, resource, or placement is best for our students.

222
00:19:53,735 --> 00:20:01,201
[SPEAKER_21]: In previous years, we have come together as a staff to address building concerns, which we brought to every level of administration.

223
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:06,285
[SPEAKER_21]: The concerns we have voiced through the years and today are not complaints about our work.

224
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:11,929
[SPEAKER_21]: They are pleased to the administration for help in the hopes that together we can make our school excel.

225
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:22,337
[SPEAKER_21]: When there are concerns about our school, good management practices dictate that we should be involved in the process, both in identifying the issues and determining the solutions.

226
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,637
[SPEAKER_21]: We are a valuable resource in which you invest.

227
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:30,301
[SPEAKER_21]: We ask to be part of the solution, not demonized as part of the problem.

228
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:37,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we care, we ask to work with you and the administration to make the McGlynn the best it can be.

229
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:42,974
[SPEAKER_21]: We are the teachers of the McGlynn and we are here because we care and want our voice to be heard.

230
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:48,457
[SPEAKER_21]: We believe that education is not about competing with other schools or even each other.

231
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:55,941
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about fostering an inclusive community, one that is committed to excellence and meeting the needs of the whole child.

232
00:20:56,901 --> 00:21:00,946
[SPEAKER_21]: School and learning are not a competition with a strict and inflexible finish line.

233
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Education is not a prize to be won.

234
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:08,574
[SPEAKER_21]: To engender this type of competition will only harm the good that our schools are doing.

235
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:14,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Only by coming together can we ensure that all students see what we know to be true.

236
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:16,041
[SPEAKER_21]: They are important.

237
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:26,900
[SPEAKER_21]: planning someone else's success only to denigrate another, what values are we teaching?

238
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,703
[SPEAKER_21]: By dictating rather than communicating, what message are we sending?

239
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:35,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Reform should be made with us, not at us.

240
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:41,688
[SPEAKER_21]: So we are the teachers of the McGlynn.

241
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:46,531
[SPEAKER_21]: We and our students' voices deserve to be heard.

242
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:49,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

243
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, teachers of the McGlynn.

244
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:18,432
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate your comments and your spirit.

245
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:23,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, that means a lot to the children of this community that have chosen to go to that school.

246
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:27,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Several of them, many of them, are delighted to hear you tonight, I'm sure.

247
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:28,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

248
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent.

249
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.

250
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:38,106
[SPEAKER_15]: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.

251
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,547
[SPEAKER_15]: We respect the McGlynn school.

252
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:41,469
[SPEAKER_15]: We have two very fine middle schools.

253
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,130
[SPEAKER_15]: We never said that we didn't.

254
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:52,407
[SPEAKER_15]: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.

255
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Several years ago, it was the other way around.

256
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:58,849
[SPEAKER_15]: One school drew more students than the other school.

257
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:09,734
[SPEAKER_15]: And this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.

258
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong,

259
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:26,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.

260
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,730
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not an indictment.

261
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,932
[SPEAKER_15]: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.

262
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:36,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place.

263
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:45,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.

264
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:52,803
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.

265
00:23:55,231 --> 00:24:01,159
[SPEAKER_15]: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.

266
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,167
[SPEAKER_15]: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.

267
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:11,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.

268
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:24,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.

269
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,379
[SPEAKER_15]: So I welcome your involvement.

270
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:30,080
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.

271
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,141
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.

272
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:36,883
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone would collaborate and work together.

273
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:37,964
[SPEAKER_15]: So I welcome it.

274
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:39,286
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll come down.

275
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:40,707
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have a nice meeting.

276
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,989
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.

277
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:52,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.

278
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.

279
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:58,744
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.

280
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:05,510
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.

281
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:16,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.

282
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:16,991
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

283
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And that we'll work forward to it.

284
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:22,276
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you.

285
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:24,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to you, with you.

286
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:28,041
[SPEAKER_15]: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.

287
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:29,842
[SPEAKER_15]: So I look forward to it.

288
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:31,243
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate you coming down.

289
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:32,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate your courage in speaking.

290
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:34,226
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's really good.

291
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:40,752
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.

292
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:41,753
[SPEAKER_15]: I applaud that.

293
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's great.

294
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:43,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's keep it going.

295
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:44,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do it.

296
00:25:50,240 --> 00:26:09,544
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teachers reaction was that he felt that demonized and less so I would felt very very sad because that was certainly I don't think Our intention school committee members or or maybe even the superintendent.

297
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:14,545
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd the the reality was that we have

298
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:24,836
[SPEAKER_20]: gotten a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were.

299
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:31,568
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed.

300
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:43,995
[SPEAKER_20]: I still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend back.

301
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:55,442
[SPEAKER_20]: And for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we

302
00:26:55,982 --> 00:27:04,434
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to keep class sizes reasonable and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits nor would we want to.

303
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:10,882
[SPEAKER_20]: So this issue of friends and how do we, how do we,

304
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,525
[SPEAKER_20]: tackle this issue so that we don't have an imbalance.

305
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:16,746
[SPEAKER_20]: I have been to the McGlynn School.

306
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,286
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you guys are great.

307
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:24,309
[SPEAKER_20]: I've had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School.

308
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,111
[SPEAKER_20]: I certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School.

309
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:33,474
[SPEAKER_20]: And because I have history, as many of us do here, we know

310
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:42,124
[SPEAKER_20]: that there has been some times where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way.

311
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:49,393
[SPEAKER_20]: From a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel

312
00:27:50,174 --> 00:28:00,001
[SPEAKER_20]: good about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out.

313
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:14,932
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school.

314
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:20,195
[SPEAKER_20]: I know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way.

315
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:23,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Once the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine.

316
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:27,239
[SPEAKER_20]: But the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge.

317
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, thank you so much for coming down, and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.

318
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:38,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

319
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:44,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't hear that the teachers were upset until I saw the large group outside tonight,

320
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:54,306
[SPEAKER_04]: actually happy to see a lot of you because I haven't seen you in a few years because both my children graduated from the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and then Medford High School.

321
00:28:54,666 --> 00:29:06,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really nice to see you all and see you still dedicated and acting in such a group way, such a team building way to represent yourselves in such a

322
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,046
[SPEAKER_04]: A difficult thing.

323
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:13,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sorry to hear that you felt slighted.

324
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:20,610
[SPEAKER_04]: When my children were going into middle school, it was hoping that they would get into the McLean.

325
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:29,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So, when I hear the difference now with the Andrews, you know, it's like we all say, it goes up and down at different sides.

326
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:37,576
[SPEAKER_04]: To hear that you're educating 60% of the high needs students in our district in middle school, that's a lot.

327
00:29:37,596 --> 00:29:40,477
[SPEAKER_04]: 60% of your students in your school being high needs.

328
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:45,039
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a tremendous job that you're doing every day and you're representing

329
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:55,427
[SPEAKER_04]: in servicing children with very, very significant needs, and you're doing it really well, because if you weren't, I would have known that, right?

330
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:59,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have known that and heard that, and that we would have had an issue.

331
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:00,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We never hear of that.

332
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:11,720
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing we do hear is our friends are going to a different school, and you know, the emotional impact that has on people's children, and that breaks my heart,

333
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: the social emotional well-being of a child is so important to their education that we need to listen to how that's affecting people.

334
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:36,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And all our intention was last week is to find ways to make the McGlynn, their marketing, their PR, to let people know about the wonderful things and the wonderful teachers that you are.

335
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: so that parents are aware of it.

336
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:43,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't to say, well, the Andrews is better, how are we gonna make the McGlenn better?

337
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:44,792
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you're better.

338
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:49,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We never even thought for a second that you weren't better.

339
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:52,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just maybe you need a little bit more PR.

340
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:56,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe your clubs need to be published a little bit more.

341
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need to have the paper there to celebrate some of your things.

342
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,785
[SPEAKER_04]: In other ways, that's how I looked at it.

343
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:08,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, if you did need more money for clubs, I did that, I believe, last week.

344
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:14,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I don't have that.

345
00:31:14,846 --> 00:31:17,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we need to do that, and look at those type of things.

346
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:26,596
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was never, never that you were dedicated and wonderful, because that has never come to any of our attention.

347
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:35,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am so grateful that you were comfortable enough to go forward and speak for yourselves in this manner, that you thought that we had that impression.

348
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:37,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's far from what I thought.

349
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:39,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I am grateful to see you all.

350
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:44,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you understand that we are here to help in any way that we can.

351
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:47,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have ideas, we want you to bring them forward.

352
00:31:48,058 --> 00:32:00,283
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the front line and you know better than anyone else in this room what you're doing every day and what needs to be celebrated and what needs to be sent out to the parents and the community as a whole.

353
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:04,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So your input is most valuable.

354
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:06,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm always willing to hear that.

355
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:09,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm willing to make other people hear it.

356
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:12,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have a big mouth.

357
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome and thank you for coming.

358
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:20,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry that if it was an impression that wasn't pleasant for you all.

359
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

360
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:25,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Justin would like to add to this conversation.

361
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:32,676
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to thank the teachers of the Midland, my teachers, for coming here and standing up for yourselves and standing up for your students.

362
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,901
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what we have here is an issue of, you know,

363
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,844
[SPEAKER_16]: the public is more attracted to one school than the other.

364
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:43,145
[SPEAKER_16]: But we need to find out why.

365
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:45,847
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can give you my perspective on why.

366
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:48,850
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not that McGlynn teachers are worse than Andrews teachers.

367
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,010
[SPEAKER_16]: It's definitely not that.

368
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:58,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I've talked to students coming from the Andrews and to parents who have students at the McGlynn, at the Andrews, or even in the elementary schools.

369
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,758
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's not their concern.

370
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:05,162
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not that the staff at the McGlynn is poorly paired or it's

371
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:16,766
[SPEAKER_16]: that it doesn't work well, but rather that the Andrews just, they look at technology, and they look at a component of who's at the school.

372
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:22,127
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a perception that the McGlynn is a step behind the Andrews when it comes to technology.

373
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:33,371
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's also a perception that the McGlynn is a step behind the Andrews when it comes to wealth, and how we use that wealth, and how that's portrayed in our socioeconomic status.

374
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:38,317
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we really have to do is look at, you know, these are the problems.

375
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:39,599
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we solve these problems?

376
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:47,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Not that, you know, oh, you know, the teachers are the problems or, you know, it's about working together.

377
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:53,408
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we shouldn't make random decisions when we don't have to.

378
00:33:54,829 --> 00:34:00,974
[SPEAKER_16]: If we know that teachers aren't the problem, we shouldn't shuffle them around because it doesn't really work that way.

379
00:34:01,454 --> 00:34:04,797
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to identify the problems that we have at hand.

380
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:07,079
[SPEAKER_16]: And that means 60% of McGlynn kids are high need.

381
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,786
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we find out, how do we figure out that balance between the two schools?

382
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:27,002
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sorry to say it, but I don't believe it, but that 60% of students are high needs, and the diversity of school leads some people to prefer the Andrews over the MacLennan.

383
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,005
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a sad reality, it's a sad truth.

384
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:32,508
[SPEAKER_16]: And it doesn't mean that it is the truth.

385
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:34,630
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just what people think.

386
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:38,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And just like Mrs. DiBenedetto said, it's about PR.

387
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:47,263
[SPEAKER_16]: And we need to make sure that people in our community understand that both schools have great teachers and that we even out the playing field for both schools from now on.

388
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,305
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd say clearly you guys did a great job.

389
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:16,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Justin certainly should be a recruit for your PFA.

390
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:21,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And he certainly should be sharing those stories.

391
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:23,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure there's many graduates.

392
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:26,588
[SPEAKER_10]: One of mine went to the, two went to the McGlynn, one went to the Andrews.

393
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:40,223
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what happens every year they kind of pick different schools even though they all came from the Brooks But Justin and other graduates certainly could be great spokespeople for for the school as well as you because you did a fabulous job tonight We're really really proud to have you here.

394
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,005
[SPEAKER_10]: You said said it all

395
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:49,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you all for coming out tonight, and it was just such great spirit It was great hearing from all of you.

396
00:35:49,811 --> 00:36:02,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just wonderful, and you know what great work You're doing at the school, and you know it's coming from my other colleagues is that we were just you know talking about the different the clubs and the students want to go to one school and and

397
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:08,724
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're trying to find an equal balance, but we are very grateful to all the hard work that you do every day at the school.

398
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:19,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been out to the McGlynn when I went first term, and I had the best experience in the fourth grade class going to see the hydroponics project.

399
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I helped organize a field trip between the McGlynn and the vocational school and it was just fantastic.

400
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:29,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the most fun and been to the concerts and everything.

401
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:33,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I just love it there and it's just a great school and thank you all for what you do every day.

402
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:34,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

403
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

404
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:41,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Stone.

405
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for being here.

406
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:44,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I do appreciate it.

407
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:45,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ms.

408
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Haas, am I saying it right?

409
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:53,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So one thing that you said that really stood out for me was just looking for support, fundraising, and opportunities.

410
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there is steps that

411
00:36:56,534 --> 00:37:02,521
[SPEAKER_09]: we can move forward, like this is a great conversation, but it's just the beginning of really getting to what you need.

412
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:15,254
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to, if we could start a regular dialogue, or if you have ideas that you need our support and fundraising and help, we would all be happy to do what you need.

413
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,616
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for being here.

414
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:19,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

415
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:19,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Sperry.

416
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:23,759
[SPEAKER_22]: Just following up on my colleague's sentiments, again, thank you for being here.

417
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:28,201
[SPEAKER_22]: If you could choose one or two things that you really need now, what would it be?

418
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:29,742
I know.

419
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:35,184
[SPEAKER_13]: One or two major things that are in reality that we can do to make your life easier.

420
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:35,404
[SPEAKER_22]: Respect.

421
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:45,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Superintendent so I hear you adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate But I can't let one thing go

422
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,785
[SPEAKER_15]: We did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it.

423
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:58,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.

424
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.

425
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:07,075
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.

426
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:07,975
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not a blame game.

427
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:14,000
[SPEAKER_15]: What this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate.

428
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,964
[SPEAKER_15]: So ownership, good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved.

429
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:20,984
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here to help you.

430
00:39:21,405 --> 00:39:22,245
[SPEAKER_15]: We want you to win.

431
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:25,227
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.

432
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:27,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I only win when everyone's doing well.

433
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,071
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I want you to win.

434
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:31,552
[SPEAKER_15]: The school committee wants you to win.

435
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:33,473
[SPEAKER_15]: We all want to do it together.

436
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:37,376
[SPEAKER_15]: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.

437
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,416
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all it is.

438
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:43,540
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a chance to say, okay, you came out, you showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.

439
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,476
[SPEAKER_15]: You spoke extremely well.

440
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:48,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Justin spoke extremely well.

441
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:57,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.

442
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:58,239
[SPEAKER_15]: And next year, who knows?

443
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,379
[SPEAKER_15]: You might be even over-enrolled.

444
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:06,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to clarify, yes, we did meet over the summer on numerous occasions.

445
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,281
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, the communications did fall apart.

446
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:13,822
[SPEAKER_11]: However, when that report was given up, it would have been nice if our voices were

447
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to go back and forth.

448
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,022
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.

449
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:27,763
[SPEAKER_15]: About many of the items in it.

450
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:33,105
[SPEAKER_15]: But at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.

451
00:40:33,486 --> 00:40:43,269
[SPEAKER_15]: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.

452
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,130
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what you need to take home.

453
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

454
00:40:47,360 --> 00:41:02,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion that the administration meet with the teachers of the McGlynn to go over some of these concerns and come up with an action plan together and present the new action plan to the school committee in one month's time.

455
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:06,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I need someone to second that motion.

456
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

457
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just administration, we should be there too.

458
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:16,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes, but at the very least, a meeting with them to work on a new action plan that needs to be presented.

459
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:17,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

460
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:25,037
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion that a meeting be held in the next month for an action plan to be developed inclusive of the teacher's comments.

461
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:26,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Ms.

462
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:26,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustone.

463
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:28,279
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

464
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:28,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

465
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:29,919
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

466
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

467
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:33,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

468
00:41:33,845 --> 00:41:34,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

469
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:36,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for coming out today.

470
00:41:36,587 --> 00:41:38,249
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

471
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:39,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

472
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, hold on.

473
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:42,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, sorry, that's okay.

474
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

475
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:53,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to speak on this because really basically you folks have to realize that you are the coaches, basically, in a team.

476
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:59,807
[SPEAKER_12]: The morale for the teachers, the morale for the students, and the morale for the parents has to be upheld.

477
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:08,813
[SPEAKER_12]: for the city school committee to sit there and not know that we're at 60% for special needs is unheard of.

478
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,614
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you folks should have this information.

479
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:11,075
[SPEAKER_12]: You should know that.

480
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:11,975
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have that information.

481
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:14,437
[SPEAKER_10]: That wasn't implied that we didn't know about that information.

482
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:14,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It was clarified.

483
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:15,758
[SPEAKER_10]: They put that in there.

484
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:17,539
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, secondly, basically,

485
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:32,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Why not get into the school and work with them and try to educate yourself in the respect of what's happening in the teachers and the classes and getting out there and being able to visit that school and help build the morale.

486
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:37,208
[SPEAKER_12]: You also mentioned the fact that there has to be, maybe you need better marketing.

487
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:38,629
[SPEAKER_12]: You folks are the marketers.

488
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:40,429
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the ones who have to market that school.

489
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,872
[SPEAKER_12]: The comments that were made a couple of weeks ago at the last school committee meeting was not marketing.

490
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:48,293
[SPEAKER_12]: It was derogatory and these folks

491
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:53,719
[SPEAKER_12]: have come together loud and clear and said, hey, we need your help.

492
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,541
[SPEAKER_12]: You folks create the plan.

493
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:58,244
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll execute the plan as best we possibly can.

494
00:42:58,604 --> 00:42:59,786
[SPEAKER_12]: And they need that support.

495
00:43:00,086 --> 00:43:02,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And collectively, yes, this is a great start.

496
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:06,534
[SPEAKER_12]: But you have to take it an extra step and not wait for them to come to you again.

497
00:43:06,594 --> 00:43:09,177
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to get to them and make this happen cohesively.

498
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,720
[SPEAKER_20]: I just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop.

499
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,622
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we need to keep something in perspective.

500
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:26,550
[SPEAKER_20]: Up to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools.

501
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,591
[SPEAKER_20]: The school committee members have been to the McGlynn.

502
00:43:30,032 --> 00:43:32,633
[SPEAKER_20]: We know many, many of the faces that are before us.

503
00:43:32,953 --> 00:43:34,554
[SPEAKER_20]: We've gone to many different events.

504
00:43:35,135 --> 00:43:38,837
[SPEAKER_20]: We celebrate the McGlynn, and we celebrate the Andrews.

505
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:51,364
[SPEAKER_20]: It is wrong to say that we didn't know that 60%, okay, that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight, but we know that, and we may have to look about that.

506
00:43:51,705 --> 00:43:53,686
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a perception because

507
00:43:54,366 --> 00:44:05,854
[SPEAKER_20]: of that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead.

508
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:08,976
[SPEAKER_20]: Those students are great students.

509
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:12,158
[SPEAKER_20]: I know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students.

510
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:16,902
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school.

511
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:23,465
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing.

512
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:25,807
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to keep this into perspective.

513
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:33,525
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district.

514
00:44:34,325 --> 00:44:44,788
[SPEAKER_20]: This year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here?

515
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:50,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Because all of a sudden, we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere.

516
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:51,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

517
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody called me.

518
00:44:53,471 --> 00:45:00,619
[SPEAKER_20]: Not one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good.

519
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,040
[SPEAKER_20]: Not one.

520
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:09,908
[SPEAKER_20]: What I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going.

521
00:45:10,856 --> 00:45:12,817
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's that how do we block up then?

522
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:18,860
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated?

523
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,682
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what is I've heard over and again.

524
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:32,047
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true.

525
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:39,409
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just I need to keep it in perspective Okay, I need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue.

526
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:46,372
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the teachers coming forward I need you to remember where this came from and that's the problem.

527
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:50,433
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to sign just simply clarifying that you know what we were kind of

528
00:45:51,013 --> 00:46:13,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Throwing it out there that you maybe you need better marketing I mean we are the marketers that that before the school and that's really something that needs to be clarified Point taken in the respect of that, but I also listened to the teachers and they were telling me time and time again They tried communicating consecutively with the administration and fallen on deaf ears Those are the things that need to be addressed immediately and those are the things that just that that's what I just bring to light we can we can

529
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate everyone coming together.

530
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:22,900
[SPEAKER_12]: We can appreciate the fact that they came together as a team But I think the reason why they came together as a team is there's been a growing frustration.

531
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:41,290
[SPEAKER_12]: This just doesn't occur overnight There's a growing frustration and that's all I wanted to bring to light and that's what's where the expertise of you folks Can can change that dramatically and getting involved in exactly what it is that they're frustrated with Thank you, thank you Mayberg and thank you, mr. McCullough

532
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:47,076
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I'd like to clarify, 60% of high need students is not special education students.

533
00:46:47,156 --> 00:46:57,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are students, when they take state level exams, they fall into different classifications, either ELL or different subgroups in that way.

534
00:46:57,443 --> 00:47:00,345
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of different combinations that could be.

535
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:04,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just didn't realize that it was at 60% capacity.

536
00:47:04,628 --> 00:47:09,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew our needs levels were different, and I knew that they housed the ELL program.

537
00:47:10,052 --> 00:47:13,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would raise the number, but I just didn't know that it was at that point.

538
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:22,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So just so everybody in the community knows, there's not 60% of the students at the McGlenn Middle School that are special education.

539
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:31,826
[SPEAKER_04]: They just fall into either financial need, or ELL need, or different types of subcategories that are tested on standardized testing.

540
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: The second part about PR is yes, we are all responsible for PR.

541
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:41,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a school committee member, I myself feel that way too.

542
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:44,649
[SPEAKER_04]: In any way I can help and do that, I am more than willing to do that.

543
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:49,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to let the community know all the positives of both our middle schools.

544
00:47:50,991 --> 00:47:52,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as going out and

545
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:54,547
[SPEAKER_04]: participating in the schools.

546
00:47:54,987 --> 00:48:02,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually at the exercise group at the elementary school at the McGlynn last week trying to do hula hoop.

547
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:04,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't work out very well in my favor.

548
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:10,816
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am trying to like pop into different things throughout the community and just see what's going on.

549
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:20,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So like renew my own knowledge of each school too because my children have graduated and moved on and it's good to go back and

550
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:29,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to parent night up at the high school as a freshman parent would and sat in the audience and just heard what questions were being done.

551
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:38,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know myself that my colleagues attend a lot of different things and a lot of them have school age children and are in the buildings at all times.

552
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:42,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me I have to make more of an effort to do that because my children have graduated.

553
00:48:44,384 --> 00:48:48,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as that goes, that's the issue.

554
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:51,289
[SPEAKER_04]: By requesting a meeting.

555
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:59,841
[SPEAKER_04]: to have their input for a new improvement plan or updated plan, not really improvement plan.

556
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:01,621
[SPEAKER_04]: A plan.

557
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:02,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a plan.

558
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:02,962
[SPEAKER_13]: A plan to.

559
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:04,562
[SPEAKER_04]: An action plan.

560
00:49:04,802 --> 00:49:06,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, it went out of my mind for a moment.

561
00:49:08,563 --> 00:49:21,046
[SPEAKER_04]: My motion was to have a meeting on that because I want the teachers at the table and I want to be at the table as well and I want the superintendent to be there because we all need to be heard, not just us up here.

562
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:32,352
[SPEAKER_04]: and you were heard tonight, I hope you feel heard, in a different way, but with concrete items to talk about would be good.

563
00:49:32,832 --> 00:49:41,640
[SPEAKER_04]: And we might come up with the same or similar action plan in the end that's already been before us.

564
00:49:42,597 --> 00:49:47,739
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that you might feel like you were heard and part of the process better, which is just always great.

565
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:56,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping, and I agree with you that that needs to happen more and more often from this membership.

566
00:49:56,923 --> 00:49:59,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for bringing those concerns forward.

567
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:15,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address, please.

568
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:16,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

569
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:22,278
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers want to be partners in progress, and I applaud them for coming here.

570
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,019
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.

571
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,786
[SPEAKER_14]: What I want the teachers to know is that this very school kept a Chapter 74 board.

572
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:30,810
[SPEAKER_14]: in private.

573
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,471
[SPEAKER_14]: There were no open meetings.

574
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:42,316
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Attorney General's Office determined on September 19th that this very school's Chapter 74 board failed to put the open meeting law out there for the public.

575
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:44,077
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is no participation here.

576
00:50:44,097 --> 00:50:45,358
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no transparency.

577
00:50:45,898 --> 00:50:50,441
[SPEAKER_14]: You teachers are to be commended because you put your necks on the line with the people that do the hiring and firing.

578
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,582
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some very fine people on the school committee.

579
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:55,684
[SPEAKER_14]: but there's other people that I think deserve term limits.

580
00:50:56,484 --> 00:50:58,265
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what's wrong with this community.

581
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,506
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no inclusion.

582
00:50:59,846 --> 00:51:02,128
[SPEAKER_14]: They say there's inclusion, there's partners in progress.

583
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:06,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't feel like a partner in progress and the teacher's fantastic speech.

584
00:51:06,671 --> 00:51:13,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I am just very, very in awe that you would come here and do that and they need to be heard.

585
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:19,338
[SPEAKER_14]: This school committee, Mr. Belson, Mayor Burke, they need to be heard and they need to work with you as partners.

586
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:24,756
[SPEAKER_14]: don't shove them away as many in this community feel.

587
00:51:24,836 --> 00:51:26,718
[SPEAKER_14]: It's polarized, and we've all been shut out.

588
00:51:27,238 --> 00:51:30,320
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to open the doors and be a partner in progress, Mrs. Burke.

589
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,862
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is time to be partners with us, because we live here too.

590
00:51:34,322 --> 00:51:43,227
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel that you've shut me out, and Roy Belton shut me out.

591
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:43,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

592
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:43,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

593
00:51:45,492 --> 00:51:51,017
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a motion and we voted on that we will have a meeting within the next month and we'll reach out to you to come to the table.

594
00:51:51,397 --> 00:51:53,940
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll put an agenda together so it'll be a productive meeting.

595
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

596
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:55,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

597
00:52:02,575 --> 00:52:05,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Most impressive person on the interstate.

598
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:22,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you

599
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:44,408
[SPEAKER_06]: You spoke wonderfully.

600
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:45,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

601
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna get to purchase items, housing, transportation.

602
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just amazing.

603
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent.

604
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:14,963
[SPEAKER_10]: First report on credit for life grant.

605
00:53:15,284 --> 00:53:16,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent.

606
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:20,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?

607
00:53:20,988 --> 00:53:22,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes she is.

608
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:33,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Before she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth

609
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:55,464
[SPEAKER_15]: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford

610
00:53:56,449 --> 00:54:25,507
[SPEAKER_15]: to live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way, so this program credit for life is one of the initiatives out of the state Treasurer's Office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so we can have this credit for life there

611
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:37,278
[SPEAKER_15]: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity.

612
00:54:37,338 --> 00:54:39,300
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.

613
00:54:40,353 --> 00:54:41,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

614
00:54:41,814 --> 00:54:44,336
[SPEAKER_02]: So this really is an exciting opportunity for the district.

615
00:54:44,456 --> 00:54:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have to thank Superintendent Belson, because he's the one who brought it to our attention.

616
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was adamant that he wanted the district to participate.

617
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:57,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the course of the summer, I put the application in for the grant.

618
00:54:57,685 --> 00:55:00,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in late August, we were awarded a $5,000 grant.

619
00:55:00,727 --> 00:55:03,249
[SPEAKER_02]: This grant will help us create and operate a credit fair.

620
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:20,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So the funding for this fair, as Superintendent Belson said, comes from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in partnership with the State Treasurer's Office.

621
00:55:20,907 --> 00:55:26,553
[SPEAKER_02]: These grants are funded through the Division of Banks settlement stemming from an alleged unlawful lending practice.

622
00:55:28,482 --> 00:55:34,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year's fair, our first fair, will take place on Friday, January 26, 2018.

623
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:42,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And all grade 11 students at the high school, the vocational school, and the Curtis Tufts School will participate.

624
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:49,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will offer the opportunity to grade 12 students as well who may voluntarily opt into the fair.

625
00:55:50,368 --> 00:55:51,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So we anticipate

626
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:57,570
[SPEAKER_02]: between 350 and about 600 students attending this fair.

627
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It will take place in our gym.

628
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,791
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll use the entire gym for it.

629
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:14,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, it's a half day interactive financial decision making fair that will provide an authentic learning activity in which students engage in basic personal financial management scenarios.

630
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:27,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So each participant will choose a profession in advance of that day, and then will be provided a mock financial profile with an individualized budget sheet in the day of the fair specific to their chosen career.

631
00:56:29,241 --> 00:56:36,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Students will purchase goods and services such as housing, transportation, insurance and food all while living within their monthly salaries.

632
00:56:37,123 --> 00:56:40,124
[SPEAKER_02]: The student's goal for the day is to balance their budget.

633
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:49,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And our goal really is to provide them with a rich learning experience that's going to benefit them as they embark on young adulthood.

634
00:56:50,387 --> 00:57:04,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So members of the planning committee include myself, Lisa Evangelista, who's the district public relations specialist, and Gail Treanor, who is really proving to be an integral part of this planning team as she was a finance teacher in Chelsea.

635
00:57:05,557 --> 00:57:08,639
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, she's the assistant principal here at Medford High School.

636
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:10,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been meeting.

637
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,241
[SPEAKER_02]: We have standing meetings every Thursday at 1 p.m.

638
00:57:13,821 --> 00:57:21,824
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been contacting outside financial institutions, banks, financial planners, housing specialists.

639
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:24,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We're anticipating that we're going to have at least

640
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:31,711
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 to 50 community members coming in who will all be present at the fair.

641
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:34,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So our students again will have an opportunity to go around.

642
00:57:35,192 --> 00:57:36,632
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll actually have a budget sheet.

643
00:57:36,672 --> 00:57:45,074
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all of the materials that actually other districts have shared with us, which makes our job a little bit easier.

644
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:49,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a massive undertaking, but it's something that I think

645
00:57:49,935 --> 00:57:58,921
[SPEAKER_02]: based on feedback we've had from other districts who have done it, it'll be an undertaking that our students will appreciate and is really long overdue.

646
00:57:59,382 --> 00:58:07,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a seed grant, which means that the intent is for $5,000, we are planting the seed for this to continue.

647
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We will apply for the grant next year, I'm assuming, if all goes well, and the maximum grant next year would be $2,500.

648
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:17,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, I think they say you're on your own.

649
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping this is the beginning of a longstanding program.

650
00:58:23,326 --> 00:58:24,387
[SPEAKER_02]: and financial literacy.

651
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:31,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be future updates on this as the planning moves further on into the fall.

652
00:58:32,253 --> 00:58:34,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you can put on your calendars Friday, January 26th.

653
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:40,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be roughly nine to one, although we're still working on those hours.

654
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,102
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you an update further on in the fall.

655
00:58:43,863 --> 00:58:45,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to take any questions.

656
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:46,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Riccadeli.

657
00:58:47,205 --> 00:58:54,190
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, because it's interactive, it seems like it'll be very innovative, and the kids will really, I think, get into this whole process.

658
00:58:54,971 --> 00:59:06,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And secondly, if you'd like to add our names, any one of us, I'm sure, would sign on to any letters of request that you make to the banks and various entities in our city, certainly to try and get as many as possible participating.

659
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I know with our community banks, that's what they do, that's what they're all about, so certainly I'm sure.

660
00:59:11,383 --> 00:59:13,626
[SPEAKER_10]: All the ones that are in Medford will participate as well.

661
00:59:14,186 --> 00:59:24,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And just if we as a school committee could send our thank you out to the Division of Banks as well as the Treasurer's Office for providing this great opportunity on behalf of the students at Medford High.

662
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:25,840
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate it.

663
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for all your hard work, too.

664
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:28,101
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

665
00:59:28,722 --> 00:59:28,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

666
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:29,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Katz.

667
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Dr. Riddell.

668
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:33,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say I really love this idea.

669
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:38,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's absolutely fantastic, and it's just gonna teach the students a very valuable life lesson.

670
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:45,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just so interested, and I really love Monopoly, and it reminds me of the real life Monopoly game, and I just love it.

671
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:52,801
[SPEAKER_07]: It just sounds like so much fun, and some of the articles online that the students were faced with unexpected circumstances where

672
00:59:53,117 --> 00:59:59,161
[SPEAKER_07]: their car breaks down and they have to make a decision on what are they gonna do or their pet has to go to the hospital.

673
00:59:59,501 --> 01:00:00,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, their pet has to go to the vet.

674
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:05,945
[SPEAKER_07]: But it just sounds like so much fun.

675
01:00:06,265 --> 01:00:22,695
[SPEAKER_07]: It really does and it's gonna be a valuable life lesson to learn how to balance a budget and I know a lot of students, my son's just learning how to do a checkbook and it's just so important to learn how to spend your money and manage it and pay bills and know what you have to take priority.

676
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:25,056
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's wonderful, thank you.

677
01:00:25,076 --> 01:00:26,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, you're welcome.

678
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:28,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other questions?

679
01:00:28,497 --> 01:00:30,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent, do we formally have to accept the grant?

680
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:33,559
[SPEAKER_15]: No, just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.

681
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,300
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to receive and place on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

682
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Van der Kloot, all in favor?

683
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:38,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

684
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

685
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes, thank you very much.

686
01:00:42,577 --> 01:00:47,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Report on game change, anti-violence partnership grant from New England Patriots Foundation.

687
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:48,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent.

688
01:00:48,305 --> 01:00:53,512
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through.

689
01:00:53,532 --> 01:00:54,693
[SPEAKER_15]: We have

690
01:00:58,468 --> 01:01:04,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Rachel Perry with us, who is our supervisor of health and physical education, actively involved in this.

691
01:01:04,675 --> 01:01:06,217
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an exciting program.

692
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:13,384
[SPEAKER_15]: As we all know that young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes, despite yesterday's loss.

693
01:01:16,065 --> 01:01:20,846
[SPEAKER_15]: But they like to be associated with that, and I think this is a really important thing, because it not only does two things.

694
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:30,068
[SPEAKER_15]: One, it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.

695
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,089
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've got to move forward on that.

696
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:33,729
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to turn it over to Rachel.

697
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:36,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I've given you some additional material.

698
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:41,012
[SPEAKER_15]: A trainer's guide, some selected portions of the whole thing because it would be like 100 pages.

699
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,733
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.

700
01:01:44,173 --> 01:01:54,618
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got a lot of sports related kind of terminology in it, so like talking trash scenario, the kinds of things like that, or being offside.

701
01:01:55,138 --> 01:01:57,339
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people.

702
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,121
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.

703
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,225
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Superintendent Belson, Mayor Burke, and members of the school committee.

704
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:14,648
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've received $3,000 this year to expand the Game Change Grant, and that's the New England Patriots Anti-Violence.

705
01:02:14,848 --> 01:02:16,249
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a partnership for another year.

706
01:02:16,949 --> 01:02:20,890
[SPEAKER_23]: In the past two years, what we've done is we've trained two of our teachers.

707
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,992
[SPEAKER_23]: They actually went out to a three-day training to learn the curriculum, and they brought it back to the kids at the high school.

708
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:31,114
[SPEAKER_23]: And in turn, we trained the captains and our club leaders in this curriculum.

709
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:37,538
[SPEAKER_23]: And we've also added some of these lessons into our health classes for the freshmen.

710
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:43,762
[SPEAKER_23]: So what we're planning on doing going forward is we're going to be able to train even more kids this year.

711
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:52,888
[SPEAKER_23]: On November 16th and 17th, we're in the process of planning those two days where members of Game Change will come in and train 30 of our students here.

712
01:02:53,749 --> 01:02:58,012
[SPEAKER_23]: In turn, those students will go down to the middle schools and train our middle school students.

713
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:11,003
[SPEAKER_23]: We're also looking to have our two health teachers at the high school and our health teachers at the middle school be trained in the curriculum as well so that we can in turn add some of these lessons to the middle school health curriculum.

714
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:14,146
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll have it from the middle school going all the way up to the high school.

715
01:03:15,868 --> 01:03:32,587
[SPEAKER_23]: To actually continue this program once the funding, you know, has been completed for this year, I plan on starting a captain's council where I will meet with the athletic captains and the leaders in the clubs and we will continue this curriculum along with other things.

716
01:03:33,328 --> 01:03:35,230
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll be able to continue it going forward.

717
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:36,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving it forward, excellent.

718
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:37,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

719
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:39,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Justin, have you had a chance to participate yet?

720
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:44,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well, I mean, I've seen the videos throughout the school for the no more campaign.

721
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:45,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

722
01:03:45,328 --> 01:03:47,870
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've seen people wear the shirts and yeah, there's a presence.

723
01:03:48,251 --> 01:03:49,592
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely, thank you.

724
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

725
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:51,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

726
01:03:51,153 --> 01:03:52,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, I had some questions.

727
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:57,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so once you train everybody and they become a mentor, what do they do with that?

728
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do other children know that they're

729
01:04:00,433 --> 01:04:03,356
[SPEAKER_23]: So our goal is to train as many students as possible.

730
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:06,538
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have part of the MVP club after school.

731
01:04:06,618 --> 01:04:12,243
[SPEAKER_23]: So our trained mentors will be joining the MVP club, and we'll be bringing that back to our athletic teams.

732
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:20,531
[SPEAKER_23]: So our captains that are involved in the MVP club will bring it back to the children that aren't captains, and we'll also be bringing it down to the middle schools.

733
01:04:21,051 --> 01:04:24,354
[SPEAKER_23]: So the goal being we will train as many students as possible.

734
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:30,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so is this for all clubs, or just like sports clubs?

735
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:31,501
[SPEAKER_04]: No, all clubs.

736
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:41,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so and then the students in those clubs know that certain students in the club are trained mentors, so if they have an issue, they go to them?

737
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:50,266
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely, and they bring it back to the kids in their club that haven't been part of the training, and they can share what they've learned with the rest of the children in their club.

738
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:53,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you.

739
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:54,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering how that all works.

740
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:58,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So if two children have an issue, they know that there's a mentor in it.

741
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

742
01:04:59,301 --> 01:05:05,368
[SPEAKER_23]: And everyone in the club, we actually had really cool t-shirts made, MVP, Mentors in Violence Prevention.

743
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:09,473
[SPEAKER_23]: So they do wear their t-shirts so that they can identify, that's someone that I can talk to.

744
01:05:10,353 --> 01:05:11,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thanks.

745
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was just wondering how it actually happened that people knew about it.

746
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:15,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

747
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:16,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

748
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

749
01:05:18,102 --> 01:05:18,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

750
01:05:18,402 --> 01:05:18,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

751
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:18,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Stone.

752
01:05:18,943 --> 01:05:19,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

753
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:24,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Then if a student, if someone comes looking for help from the student, who does the student then go to?

754
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:27,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that'd be a pretty heavy topic for a teenager.

755
01:05:27,512 --> 01:05:27,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

756
01:05:28,093 --> 01:05:41,702
[SPEAKER_23]: So as part of the training, we actually talk about who do you feel comfortable going to and the children that also training get some training, they give them scenarios on how they can help other students through things and who that they can direct them to.

757
01:05:42,062 --> 01:05:42,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

758
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:47,426
[SPEAKER_09]: But if a student says to the mentor, I'm in an unhealthy relationship, I don't know what to do.

759
01:05:48,647 --> 01:05:52,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the mentor deal with it or does the mentor say, go talk to Miss Perry?

760
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:56,672
[SPEAKER_23]: They would direct them to either me or somebody that was in the training.

761
01:05:58,646 --> 01:06:01,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that last year where any students referred to you?

762
01:06:02,348 --> 01:06:03,569
[SPEAKER_23]: None that I've seen so far.

763
01:06:03,629 --> 01:06:04,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well that's good.

764
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:05,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

765
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,331
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion on the floor to place and file.

766
01:06:08,451 --> 01:06:08,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

767
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:09,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Ms.

768
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:09,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Vander Kloot.

769
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:10,792
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

770
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:11,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

771
01:06:11,713 --> 01:06:12,313
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

772
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:12,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

773
01:06:13,174 --> 01:06:13,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

774
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:13,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

775
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:14,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

776
01:06:16,315 --> 01:06:18,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Report on Community Preservation Act.

777
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:20,438
[SPEAKER_10]: We have members.

778
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:23,966
[SPEAKER_10]: of the committee, the CPC committee.

779
01:06:24,766 --> 01:06:40,018
[SPEAKER_10]: As you may realize, a year and a half ago, the citizens of Medford voted to adopt the CPA Act, which allows for monies to be put in a trust fund and spent for certain purposes, affordable housing, open space, and historic preservation.

780
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:46,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have with us two members tonight that would like to explain it so that the public can become more aware of this program.

781
01:06:47,594 --> 01:06:48,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, everybody.

782
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:49,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for inviting us.

783
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:55,562
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor stole some of my thunder, but that's okay.

784
01:06:55,582 --> 01:06:56,903
[SPEAKER_19]: So everything she said is true.

785
01:06:56,943 --> 01:07:04,390
[SPEAKER_19]: The CPA was voted in November of 2015, and it put a 1.5% surcharge on property tax bills with exemptions.

786
01:07:05,331 --> 01:07:09,836
[SPEAKER_19]: The first year, the CPA generated about $1.2 million of local tax revenue.

787
01:07:10,316 --> 01:07:14,578
[SPEAKER_19]: and from that we got about a 15%, or we're gonna get a 15% match from the state.

788
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:21,161
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's some money there to spend in open space, recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation.

789
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:34,227
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically the way it works is 10% has to go to each of the three categories, so open space and recreation, historic preservation and affordable housing, and the other 70% gets to be used for any qualified program.

790
01:07:35,628 --> 01:07:37,629
[SPEAKER_19]: We were formed as a committee this May 2017.

791
01:07:37,869 --> 01:07:44,995
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in the process of standing up our committee, the plan, the application, everything that we need to run as a committee.

792
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:51,420
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're here today and we've been out on sort of a speaking tour to kind of gather information from the community to find out

793
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:52,681
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you know?

794
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,503
[SPEAKER_19]: What do we need to do to support these areas?

795
01:07:56,204 --> 01:08:03,710
[SPEAKER_19]: There's boards and commissions that have been looking at issues related to their board and commission that directly relates to CPA funds.

796
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:08,474
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've been sort of gathering things that they already know, and that's why we're here to talk to you.

797
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:18,122
[SPEAKER_19]: There must be things that you know that we can use money for open space recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation.

798
01:08:18,162 --> 01:08:20,003
[SPEAKER_19]: So, open the floor for questions.

799
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:20,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Roberta, it's...

800
01:08:21,804 --> 01:08:23,885
[SPEAKER_19]: expert so she will answer whatever you have.

801
01:08:23,985 --> 01:08:27,447
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Joan Cyr, a member, and Roberta Cameron is the chairperson of the committee.

802
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:28,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

803
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:29,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

804
01:08:29,508 --> 01:08:29,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

805
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:36,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So could any of these funds be helpful with us since the whole community uses the school parks?

806
01:08:37,472 --> 01:08:42,799
[SPEAKER_04]: like if we need to redo all the rubber in the school yard, you know.

807
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can put that request in right now.

808
01:08:46,424 --> 01:08:52,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We can start at each school each year and just keep rotating throughout.

809
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:53,552
[SPEAKER_04]: forever?

810
01:08:53,953 --> 01:09:01,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, the planning process that we're undertaking right now is to help us to be able to balance how we use these funds.

811
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:16,650
[SPEAKER_18]: As wonderful as it is to have this resource to use for some of the needs like our outdoor recreation, athletic fields, and playgrounds, we've got three, four program areas that we need to balance this funding between all of them.

812
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:22,735
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we're in a planning process right now to help us understand what the priorities are and what

813
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:47,181
[SPEAKER_18]: proportion of that million plus funds each year should go into each of those program areas and in open space and recreation, what proportion toward our sports athletic fields versus improving areas along the Mystic River and walking and biking trails so that kids can walk and bike to school safely where they can't perhaps today.

814
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:48,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant the schoolyards.

815
01:09:48,903 --> 01:09:52,066
[SPEAKER_04]: The schoolyards, where the play structures are.

816
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:54,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is definitely included.

817
01:09:54,108 --> 01:10:01,856
[SPEAKER_04]: They are used all the time, evenings and weekends by the community and it would be really nice if we were first on the list.

818
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:09,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I just really wanted to congratulate you on working so hard.

819
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:12,789
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember so many times seeing you gathering signatures to make sure that this would happen.

820
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:27,645
[SPEAKER_20]: And now to see the amount of money and the possibilities before us is just wonderful.

821
01:10:27,685 --> 01:10:28,165
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

822
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:29,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much.

823
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:31,728
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go along with the playground.

824
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:33,549
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a good start.

825
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:39,854
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd also like to see a playground like those that they have in England, which are open creative playgrounds for kids.

826
01:10:40,614 --> 01:10:44,998
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just think that I've been reading up about them, and I just think that kind of

827
01:10:45,638 --> 01:10:56,093
[SPEAKER_20]: the creative space opportunity, which is decidedly different area than a conventional playground would be a very interesting thing to pursue.

828
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:57,895
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be nice to have in the city.

829
01:10:57,935 --> 01:10:58,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

830
01:10:58,803 --> 01:10:59,183
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

831
01:11:00,244 --> 01:11:01,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, how are you doing?

832
01:11:01,864 --> 01:11:05,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's good seeing you and I'm running into you everywhere with the signature board.

833
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:06,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm so happy.

834
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:21,893
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was, you know, kind of brainstorming and I had some ideas and I just, I'm going to share them, but I was thinking, you know, for beautifying some of the schools, maybe planting some perennials, like the plants that are low maintenance will come back every year.

835
01:11:22,473 --> 01:11:27,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, basically when you kind of go up to the community school entrance, there's like this cement block.

836
01:11:27,976 --> 01:11:35,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like maybe weeds now, but like if we could put some perennials there and maybe dress up some of the greens.

837
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:41,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And just because that's like such an open space and everybody's going in there to access the pool.

838
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:53,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then talk at one point that, you know, doing space, turning it into an outside.

839
01:12:03,015 --> 01:12:20,200
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, peaceful place, you know, for the seniors to go at lunch and, you know, kind of just dressing it up a little bit with some benches and, you know, it would be like senior privilege where they could go out to that open space and, you know, it'd look really pretty when you're walking through to go into the other building and I had that idea.

840
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,201
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the parks, I had the parks right away.

841
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:23,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, the parks?

842
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:24,402
[SPEAKER_07]: We could take care of the parks.

843
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:30,687
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to, actually, your idea of beautifying the schoolyards.

844
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:42,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Recently, Joan and I attended an all-day seminar that was held in a public school in Somerville that was talking about how cities are using CPA funds.

845
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:54,146
[SPEAKER_18]: And in that school, as we walked down the hallway, there's an interior courtyard that used to be just a cement courtyard.

846
01:12:54,806 --> 01:12:58,928
[SPEAKER_18]: And they used CPA funds to create gardens for the students to garden.

847
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:01,470
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was absolutely beautiful.

848
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,351
[SPEAKER_18]: The courtyard was just bursting with flowers.

849
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:07,813
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that was an inspiring example.

850
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would love to see that here.

851
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:17,838
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wouldn't be as hard, but dollars can make a big difference, right?

852
01:13:18,118 --> 01:13:18,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

853
01:13:18,798 --> 01:13:20,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good idea, Kathy.

854
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:20,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

855
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:22,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other recommendations?

856
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,741
[SPEAKER_10]: They have been meeting with a lot of boards and commissions.

857
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:31,365
[SPEAKER_10]: They have met with myself, a lot of the department heads at City Hall, Lauren DiLorenzo with OCD about the open space plan.

858
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:35,447
[SPEAKER_10]: This committee has worked so diligently and put in so many hours.

859
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:48,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So that they really listen to the community It's almost like a participatory budgeting to a degree where this is driven by the citizens as opposed to us up here driving it down So that's what's unique about this.

860
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:49,859
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really coming from Thank you

861
01:13:54,162 --> 01:14:08,873
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually on Wednesday evening, so we're in the process in addition to talking to boards and commissions and community stakeholder partners we're also engaging to listen to the public, and so we have

862
01:14:10,634 --> 01:14:11,595
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of things coming up.

863
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,655
[SPEAKER_18]: We have two forums.

864
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:22,260
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one is taking place this Wednesday, October 4th, here at the high school in the library from 7 to 9 p.m.

865
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:37,008
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to be using this forum to facilitate a conversation about how we balance the needs between the program areas and what are the types of projects that we'd like to see as a community.

866
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:52,874
[SPEAKER_18]: And the second forum is going to be on Saturday morning, October 14th, from 10 to 12 in the morning, well, 10 in the morning until 12 noon, at the Medford Senior Center.

867
01:14:54,095 --> 01:14:55,695
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to have the same format.

868
01:14:55,715 --> 01:14:59,877
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just having two forums to give more people an opportunity to come.

869
01:15:00,277 --> 01:15:00,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

870
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a question.

871
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:04,999
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you decide?

872
01:15:05,019 --> 01:15:06,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you decide that as a committee?

873
01:15:07,526 --> 01:15:11,591
[SPEAKER_04]: based on all the input you've received throughout?

874
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:16,997
[SPEAKER_18]: So as a committee, our job is going to be to determine how the funds are going to be used.

875
01:15:17,738 --> 01:15:23,745
[SPEAKER_18]: And so to help us evaluate, so there will be an application process.

876
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:39,714
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to invite city departments, boards and committees, and community stakeholders to submit applications for funding, and we determine if they're eligible first for Community Preservation Act funding, and then invite them to go ahead and go forward with a full application.

877
01:15:40,294 --> 01:15:48,381
[SPEAKER_18]: So when it's time for us to evaluate these applications, we're going to take into consideration what we've heard from the public through the forums.

878
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:53,044
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also didn't get a chance to mention, we also have an ongoing survey right now.

879
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:56,467
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.

880
01:15:57,107 --> 01:16:02,692
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to take into consideration what we've heard from the public and from the boards and commissions and stakeholders.

881
01:16:03,112 --> 01:16:18,163
[SPEAKER_18]: and weigh all of this together in order to determine what the funding priorities are and how the applications that we have on hand stack up against each other and using our limited funds.

882
01:16:19,304 --> 01:16:21,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they make recommendations to the city council.

883
01:16:23,215 --> 01:16:24,235
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

884
01:16:24,535 --> 01:16:33,617
[SPEAKER_18]: So then when we make recommendations, we determine what are the funding proposals that we would favor going forward.

885
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:36,098
[SPEAKER_18]: We make a recommendation to the City Council.

886
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:43,779
[SPEAKER_18]: All funding by the Community Preservation Act has to be recommended by our committee and approved by the City Council.

887
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:49,321
[SPEAKER_18]: So it goes to a City Council approval before the funds can finally be allocated.

888
01:16:51,141 --> 01:16:57,263
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to mention one more part of our public participation process, and that is the survey that's ongoing right now.

889
01:16:57,443 --> 01:17:04,146
[SPEAKER_18]: It's available online through our website, that is www.preservemedford.org.

890
01:17:05,366 --> 01:17:16,950
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, it is available for people who don't take it online, they can get a paper copy, which is available at the library, City Hall, and the Senior Center.

891
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:19,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

892
01:17:20,606 --> 01:17:21,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent.

893
01:17:21,687 --> 01:17:24,010
[SPEAKER_15]: So, last week was it, Roberta?

894
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:24,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

895
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:26,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Roberta and I met, Diane was there.

896
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:30,679
[SPEAKER_15]: We went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.

897
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:36,686
[SPEAKER_15]: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.

898
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:58,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts sometimes the preservation of small things that are at a school that historic from schools that are no longer there that might Enhance the existing schools or projects of that of that type We got to remember too that this is not just a one-time thing this is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding and

899
01:17:59,523 --> 01:18:08,081
[SPEAKER_15]: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three, because it goes forward into the future.

900
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:26,786
[SPEAKER_15]: and we also should be looking at if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice if we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward at a larger scale?

901
01:18:27,266 --> 01:18:37,513
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools

902
01:18:37,953 --> 01:18:49,162
[SPEAKER_15]: throughout the community, and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.

903
01:18:49,762 --> 01:18:57,529
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled, I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.

904
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:59,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I will, I promise.

905
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:09,241
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.

906
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:16,068
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably don't know that we have two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that

907
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:18,872
[SPEAKER_15]: that are interesting and could be preserved.

908
01:19:18,892 --> 01:19:25,741
[SPEAKER_15]: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.

909
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:29,506
[SPEAKER_15]: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now.

910
01:19:29,926 --> 01:19:33,411
[SPEAKER_15]: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.

911
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:40,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and and it was rebuilt one more time and it's all being rebuilt for the third time.

912
01:19:40,135 --> 01:20:02,681
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only been built three times So, I mean it's kind of interesting to go back and see the Matthew Craddock never ever came to Medford But the bridge is named after Matthew Craddock So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do and on the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office is a very interesting plaque there it talks about Medford history the home of rum and crackers and I like the term crackers.

913
01:20:02,721 --> 01:20:04,122
[SPEAKER_15]: It sort of reminds me of certain things

914
01:20:05,002 --> 01:20:07,703
[SPEAKER_15]: leave it to your imaginations.

915
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:23,710
[SPEAKER_15]: If you know the Medford cracker was particular to Medford but had a split down the middle and the reason it's called the cracker is when you broke it it had a cracking sound so we're the home of crackers and sometimes it shows up at meetings.

916
01:20:26,712 --> 01:20:31,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for the presentation and hopefully we'll participate in the upcoming forums.

917
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

918
01:20:34,325 --> 01:20:34,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

919
01:20:34,785 --> 01:20:36,027
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion, seconded by Ms.

920
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:36,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Vander Kloot.

921
01:20:36,548 --> 01:20:37,290
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

922
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:37,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

923
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,592
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

924
01:20:38,632 --> 01:20:39,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

925
01:20:39,413 --> 01:20:40,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much ladies.

926
01:20:41,721 --> 01:20:44,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Report on second annual health, wellness, and fitness fair.

927
01:20:44,644 --> 01:20:45,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Superintendent.

928
01:20:45,985 --> 01:20:59,237
[SPEAKER_15]: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.

929
01:20:59,317 --> 01:21:00,278
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a second time.

930
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:01,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Last year was held in the lobby.

931
01:21:01,759 --> 01:21:03,181
[SPEAKER_15]: This year was held in the gymnasium.

932
01:21:03,881 --> 01:21:05,203
[SPEAKER_15]: About 200 people attended.

933
01:21:06,023 --> 01:21:12,788
[SPEAKER_15]: It was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of and it's a great opportunity.

934
01:21:12,808 --> 01:21:24,517
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency.

935
01:21:24,878 --> 01:21:26,139
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's really important.

936
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:31,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.

937
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:37,185
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.

938
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:39,166
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is one aspect of it.

939
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:40,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad to host it.

940
01:21:40,487 --> 01:21:46,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.

941
01:21:46,789 --> 01:21:48,270
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was a great opportunity.

942
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,891
[SPEAKER_15]: And Blades of Bruins Bear was there.

943
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,551
[SPEAKER_15]: And Pat the Patriot was there.

944
01:21:51,611 --> 01:21:52,852
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got a picture with both of them.

945
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:56,693
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.

946
01:21:58,354 --> 01:21:59,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a great thing.

947
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:07,822
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.

948
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,325
[SPEAKER_10]: How appropriate at this time that I'm going to take an Advil.

949
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:10,505
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

950
01:22:12,647 --> 01:22:14,789
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I got to go to this event, actually.

951
01:22:14,809 --> 01:22:16,710
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a great turnout.

952
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:17,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

953
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:18,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Great turnout.

954
01:22:18,911 --> 01:22:23,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to Lisa Evangelista for coordinating quite a bit of this forum.

955
01:22:23,632 --> 01:22:24,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And we learned a lot.

956
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:26,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Blood pressures were being taken.

957
01:22:26,753 --> 01:22:28,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Acupuncture was being served.

958
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:30,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a proper way to say it?

959
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:32,314
[SPEAKER_10]: And flu shots were given out.

960
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:34,595
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was really a great event.

961
01:22:34,635 --> 01:22:38,836
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a lot of Medford's doctors, nurses, dental school there.

962
01:22:39,536 --> 01:22:43,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was just a lot of information and a lot of healthy habits to pick up.

963
01:22:43,217 --> 01:22:46,478
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks everybody who put it on and who attended as well.

964
01:22:46,538 --> 01:22:46,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

965
01:22:48,978 --> 01:23:03,102
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to mention also the Girl Scout Troop who is selling 02155 gear and because they're going to plan, they are planning a trip to Europe and I just really want to support their efforts and it's great.

966
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,322
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish I had brought mine, I meant to when I brought it.

967
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:06,282
[SPEAKER_20]: The bracelet?

968
01:23:06,803 --> 01:23:07,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

969
01:23:07,603 --> 01:23:08,343
[SPEAKER_20]: No, the hat.

970
01:23:08,623 --> 01:23:15,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the t-shirt in the car and all the other things that I go out to take home.

971
01:23:17,438 --> 01:23:19,179
[SPEAKER_04]: from many, many people there.

972
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:32,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wanted to comment that Hallmark Health took my blood pressure, and the machine wasn't working well, so the vocational technical high school took it, and they were right on.

973
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:32,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it good?

974
01:23:32,627 --> 01:23:33,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, mine too.

975
01:23:33,048 --> 01:23:33,668
[SPEAKER_04]: You're healthy.

976
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:33,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

977
01:23:34,008 --> 01:23:34,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

978
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:38,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that people at tonight's meeting or afternoon?

979
01:23:38,911 --> 01:23:42,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually low that evening, because I kept missing you in the crowd.

980
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:42,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep it that way.

981
01:23:45,934 --> 01:24:02,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good motion that this report be placed on file All those opposed motion passes report on school brains training so this is just an update on additional training that we're doing on

982
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:07,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.

983
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:21,966
[SPEAKER_15]: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.

984
01:24:22,506 --> 01:24:29,468
[SPEAKER_15]: There's about five or six reports we do, and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross-validate across the various reports.

985
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:36,450
[SPEAKER_15]: And this also plays into the student reporting to Holmes and Holmes reporting back to faculty members and the like.

986
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:38,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So it just gives you an idea that

987
01:24:38,971 --> 01:24:43,617
[SPEAKER_15]: This is things we're doing with school brains and it's a work in progress.

988
01:24:44,438 --> 01:24:46,561
[SPEAKER_15]: People can say that, why isn't it perfect?

989
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:47,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it takes time.

990
01:24:47,822 --> 01:24:55,112
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.

991
01:24:55,692 --> 01:24:57,233
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.

992
01:24:57,253 --> 01:25:17,466
[SPEAKER_15]: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to our progress.

993
01:25:17,507 --> 01:25:19,848
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.

994
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that, you know,

995
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:27,787
[SPEAKER_15]: You won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.

996
01:25:29,787 --> 01:25:54,436
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a point of information To follow up on this back in June I requested a subcommittee meeting there are a few concerned parents that call me on a Bi-weekly basis wanting to know when we're going to meet so they can have their concerns Addressed or hopefully get an answer to and once and for all explain the process of class ranking and how

997
01:25:55,476 --> 01:26:06,224
[SPEAKER_22]: Some underclassmen now that are upperclassmen feel that they might have been slighted and we possibly would like to correct those inequities and This is the fourth request to this meeting

998
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:11,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Committee of the Whole.

999
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,600
[SPEAKER_22]: I prefer Committee of the Whole.

1000
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:16,902
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion that Committee of the Whole be held in the next 30 days as well.

1001
01:26:17,262 --> 01:26:17,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1002
01:26:17,802 --> 01:26:19,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1003
01:26:19,703 --> 01:26:21,104
[SPEAKER_10]: We also, sorry.

1004
01:26:22,184 --> 01:26:23,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I do the roll.

1005
01:26:24,165 --> 01:26:32,708
[SPEAKER_20]: We also had a request to discuss inclusionary field trips and I'm wondering if that could be done in the same evening.

1006
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:34,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, I can do that.

1007
01:26:35,965 --> 01:26:41,849
[SPEAKER_10]: on the motion that a committee of the whole be held in the next 30 days on both school brains as well as inclusionary field trips.

1008
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:43,110
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1009
01:26:43,691 --> 01:26:43,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1010
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:44,491
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1011
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:45,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1012
01:26:45,532 --> 01:26:46,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

1013
01:26:46,613 --> 01:27:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting back to the report at hand, so through this report, it looked like you might have been leading up to maybe staff changes and more people to run the school brains.

1014
01:27:02,862 --> 01:27:03,663
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I read it.

1015
01:27:04,023 --> 01:27:13,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had some questions like who already did our state reporting in the past and are they the point person for school brains at this point?

1016
01:27:13,575 --> 01:27:13,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this

1017
01:27:16,066 --> 01:27:33,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they're up and trained isn't this going to streamline things so that way there'll be less people once the data is entered initially and it's correct and updated by parents through the porthole and portal not porthole portal and Sorry, it's been a long day

1018
01:27:35,649 --> 01:27:46,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Once that initial work is done and then people are trained in it, isn't it going to be much more efficient and accurate and we won't need additional staff because we'll have a good beginning?

1019
01:27:46,821 --> 01:27:48,543
[SPEAKER_15]: The data is one aspect of it.

1020
01:27:50,965 --> 01:28:08,365
[SPEAKER_15]: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to

1021
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:16,771
[SPEAKER_15]: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.

1022
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,913
[SPEAKER_15]: We have over 1,000 people that work for the school system.

1023
01:28:20,493 --> 01:28:29,499
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.

1024
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:31,940
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.

1025
01:28:32,401 --> 01:28:34,482
[SPEAKER_15]: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.

1026
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:37,304
[SPEAKER_15]: It just simply, you're saying a person's got a teaching license, great.

1027
01:28:37,884 --> 01:28:40,625
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, now we need all the kind of data.

1028
01:28:40,645 --> 01:28:41,686
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to look at things.

1029
01:28:42,126 --> 01:28:47,148
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.

1030
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:50,250
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.

1031
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:55,512
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to, you know, more people.

1032
01:28:55,812 --> 01:29:05,897
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.

1033
01:29:07,097 --> 01:29:11,999
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.

1034
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:13,820
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just part of life today.

1035
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Most operations have human resource operations today.

1036
01:29:17,861 --> 01:29:22,163
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, piece there.

1037
01:29:22,183 --> 01:29:28,786
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.

1038
01:29:30,108 --> 01:29:46,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna request that when we do meet and discuss that we have like a layout of the administrative and the staffing yeah like who reports to who what job they do what what their position is what their salary is like

1039
01:29:47,097 --> 01:29:53,721
[SPEAKER_04]: like all of that data and information on like a graph so we see that and that way we can see the needs.

1040
01:29:53,861 --> 01:29:58,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also helps tighten up what they're responsible for and who they directly report to.

1041
01:29:58,944 --> 01:30:03,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you do bring that to our attention, that's what I hope it looks like.

1042
01:30:03,727 --> 01:30:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave it at that at this point.

1043
01:30:05,588 --> 01:30:08,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's been a lot of motions for you tonight.

1044
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:11,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna make any motions, but just an idea.

1045
01:30:12,312 --> 01:30:13,233
[SPEAKER_10]: At this point.

1046
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:26,221
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also think that we should look at what can we do as a whole city so that we're not duplicating services on the city side and the school side, and when it comes to like IT, for example, human resources, another one.

1047
01:30:26,702 --> 01:30:32,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of those things we could parlay and maybe create one department that can manage both sides of the balance sheet, basically.

1048
01:30:33,086 --> 01:30:35,447
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe we could take a look at that, Mr. Superintendent, as well.

1049
01:30:37,301 --> 01:30:37,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1050
01:30:37,662 --> 01:30:39,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we already passed it.

1051
01:30:43,158 --> 01:30:46,439
[SPEAKER_10]: All righty, report on concussion law and Medford experience.

1052
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:54,783
[SPEAKER_15]: So, but Tony is here and you know, I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.

1053
01:30:54,843 --> 01:31:00,965
[SPEAKER_15]: I gave you a handout tonight, it's in the Globe, about concussions and things like this.

1054
01:31:01,005 --> 01:31:05,887
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, we have a trainer, we have a doctor, although the doctor is leaving, we're gonna have a replacement doctor.

1055
01:31:05,907 --> 01:31:07,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on up Tony, you know, we'll do this together.

1056
01:31:08,328 --> 01:31:12,210
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's just a lot of factors about, you see in the notes today about,

1057
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:15,050
[SPEAKER_15]: the trauma caused by brain injuries.

1058
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:19,851
[SPEAKER_15]: The Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.

1059
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:24,312
[SPEAKER_15]: BU has a major department on this topic as well.

1060
01:31:25,092 --> 01:31:30,093
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just important that we understand what our experience is.

1061
01:31:30,593 --> 01:31:35,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force, there's going to be injuries.

1062
01:31:35,674 --> 01:31:39,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Every year there are injuries in all the sports and they range from broken bones to

1063
01:31:41,176 --> 01:31:47,500
[SPEAKER_15]: cuts into other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.

1064
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:53,745
[SPEAKER_15]: But concussion is something that has long-term impact, real long-term impact.

1065
01:31:54,265 --> 01:31:56,126
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get a repaired knee, things like that.

1066
01:31:56,146 --> 01:31:58,027
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.

1067
01:31:58,668 --> 01:32:00,089
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you have brain injury,

1068
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:03,032
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not be something that you can recover from.

1069
01:32:03,733 --> 01:32:05,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.

1070
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:11,383
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, it often isn't just one hit.

1071
01:32:12,184 --> 01:32:17,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.

1072
01:32:17,918 --> 01:32:20,199
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really that's what takes place.

1073
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.

1074
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:27,923
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.

1075
01:32:28,523 --> 01:32:32,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.

1076
01:32:33,306 --> 01:32:34,847
[SPEAKER_15]: And you would think, why is that?

1077
01:32:35,327 --> 01:32:38,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.

1078
01:32:38,548 --> 01:32:44,972
[SPEAKER_15]: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.

1079
01:32:45,672 --> 01:32:49,095
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.

1080
01:32:49,175 --> 01:32:58,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.

1081
01:32:58,462 --> 01:32:59,023
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot here.

1082
01:32:59,063 --> 01:33:01,725
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could interject, sometimes the game is played with less protection.

1083
01:33:01,765 --> 01:33:05,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Like lacrosse, for example, because they're not supposed to hit, they get hit.

1084
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have no protection on their head.

1085
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:11,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you know, might have, hitting the ball,

1086
01:33:12,513 --> 01:33:16,435
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets?

1087
01:33:17,595 --> 01:33:24,838
[SPEAKER_15]: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up, and I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking about.

1088
01:33:24,878 --> 01:33:27,860
[SPEAKER_15]: We track this every year, and I gave you three years of experience.

1089
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:35,243
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.

1090
01:33:38,837 --> 01:33:38,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1091
01:33:38,997 --> 01:33:39,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Bento.

1092
01:33:40,919 --> 01:33:42,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it away.

1093
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,901
[SPEAKER_05]: You summed a lot of it up.

1094
01:33:45,142 --> 01:33:52,567
[SPEAKER_05]: The policy that we've been functioning under at the Medford Public Schools in the last couple of years was updated by the state.

1095
01:33:52,687 --> 01:34:04,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was included in your packet was a recent update that Dr. Goodell and I did along with Rachel Perry and Tanya Kamsit, Cashman Kamsit.

1096
01:34:04,836 --> 01:34:05,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So we looked at

1097
01:34:06,657 --> 01:34:10,178
[SPEAKER_05]: what the changes were and how we could incorporate them into our present policy.

1098
01:34:11,599 --> 01:34:31,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the changes involved around expanding the groups of practitioners, medical practitioners that were allowed to make a diagnosis of concussion and then sign off on the accommodation plans as well as the return to play and return to academic protocols.

1099
01:34:31,827 --> 01:34:35,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did incorporate those into our policy.

1100
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:47,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, what was added was physician assistants, nurse practitioners, licensed certified athletic trainers, as well as neuropsychologists.

1101
01:34:48,390 --> 01:35:01,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just reflected the change in the practice, that more and more of these people are involved in concussion programs at the hospitals, and they're actually seeing the student athletes.

1102
01:35:02,457 --> 01:35:29,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I think another thing that speaks well for our practice as a health service is that the state mandates apply to student athletes and the numbers that are tracked to the state are for student athletes, but the nurses in our schools have adopted these best evidence practices and they apply them to all students who are suspected of having a concussion or who are diagnosed by a physician who have a concussion.

1103
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:42,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will give out the paperwork to parents if we suspect a concussion and say, you know, follow up with your pediatrician and have them write the accommodation plan or work with us to write the accommodation plan.

1104
01:35:42,918 --> 01:35:45,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So that has really extended to all of our students.

1105
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:53,340
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, over the three-year period, there were 58 different identifications of concussion.

1106
01:35:54,924 --> 01:36:03,371
[SPEAKER_15]: all the seasons, and well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.

1107
01:36:03,851 --> 01:36:05,492
[SPEAKER_15]: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.

1108
01:36:06,613 --> 01:36:11,177
[SPEAKER_15]: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.

1109
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:16,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we get the breakdown between female and male students?

1110
01:36:16,474 --> 01:36:18,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to reach out to Tanya.

1111
01:36:18,756 --> 01:36:20,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she would have it.

1112
01:36:20,137 --> 01:36:23,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.

1113
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,281
[SPEAKER_15]: She'd have to go through the records.

1114
01:36:24,301 --> 01:36:26,683
[SPEAKER_15]: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.

1115
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:27,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice.

1116
01:36:28,264 --> 01:36:28,405
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

1117
01:36:28,425 --> 01:36:29,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Vander Kloot.

1118
01:36:29,766 --> 01:36:35,611
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to ask, I totaled the numbers, and I see the first year that we were given data for in 2012,

1119
01:36:40,888 --> 01:36:43,949
[SPEAKER_20]: and then it went to 21, and then it grew to 25.

1120
01:36:44,329 --> 01:36:45,750
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going in the wrong direction.

1121
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:48,270
[SPEAKER_20]: But maybe that's a better identification.

1122
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:48,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

1123
01:36:49,071 --> 01:36:50,231
[SPEAKER_20]: It's better identification.

1124
01:36:50,731 --> 01:37:05,616
[SPEAKER_20]: The second piece of that is what I couldn't tell was whether, let's take fall 2016, there were six football, whether any of those students then were the same ones impacted because the same kids then went and played hockey.

1125
01:37:06,121 --> 01:37:07,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be.

1126
01:37:07,342 --> 01:37:09,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to go through those records with Tanya.

1127
01:37:09,804 --> 01:37:24,114
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess I'd like to trace it too because that's a concern if a kid plays football in the fall and gets a concussion and then plays hockey in the winter and gets a concussion and ends up with lacrosse.

1128
01:37:26,295 --> 01:37:29,558
[SPEAKER_20]: It's also across the board, not just sport by sport.

1129
01:37:30,245 --> 01:37:40,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I can respond about that is each athletic season students are required to register for the sport.

1130
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,664
[SPEAKER_05]: This year we started the online sports registration form.

1131
01:37:46,426 --> 01:37:51,908
[SPEAKER_05]: With every season they fill out a health questionnaire reviewed by the high school nurses.

1132
01:37:53,128 --> 01:38:04,193
[SPEAKER_05]: If the parent has noted there was a previous concussion the nurses will dig through the student's file to make sure that information can be passed on to a coach.

1133
01:38:05,253 --> 01:38:14,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So the coach, when they get their roster of cleared student athletes, there will be a notation on there that says, history of concussion.

1134
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:19,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it may say, last concussion April of 2015.

1135
01:38:19,623 --> 01:38:30,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So that at least they're getting notice that these are students that are of higher risk and they can be pulled out or watched at a more closer eye.

1136
01:38:31,741 --> 01:38:32,762
[SPEAKER_20]: I had one other question.

1137
01:38:33,923 --> 01:38:39,988
[SPEAKER_20]: So I was surprised when I got down to the very last line and found out that one of our students had a concussion as a crew member.

1138
01:38:41,029 --> 01:38:44,492
[SPEAKER_09]: She got hit by a boat, carrying a boat.

1139
01:38:46,113 --> 01:38:48,576
[SPEAKER_05]: It can happen in the oddest of circumstances.

1140
01:38:48,676 --> 01:38:49,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Shell game.

1141
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:53,360
[SPEAKER_10]: This is scary.

1142
01:38:54,048 --> 01:38:54,969
[SPEAKER_22]: Just as a follow-up, Ms.

1143
01:38:55,009 --> 01:39:01,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Vento, after our students leave here, does the health department inquire a year or so later how that student is doing?

1144
01:39:01,593 --> 01:39:01,833
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1145
01:39:02,973 --> 01:39:03,134
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1146
01:39:03,194 --> 01:39:08,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't do follow-up, long-term follow-up on students.

1147
01:39:09,057 --> 01:39:13,420
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we initiate a policy that we follow up with them for at least a year after they leave here?

1148
01:39:16,644 --> 01:39:22,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say that would be really difficult information for us to retrieve.

1149
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:34,546
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of it, the confidentiality requirements, but just in terms of, you know, getting information back on that respect might be difficult.

1150
01:39:36,815 --> 01:39:45,948
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just concerned that as my colleague alluded to, an individual plays two or three sports and he happens, he or she happens to get a concussion in each season.

1151
01:39:46,638 --> 01:39:50,140
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd wanna make sure that they had the proper medical attention.

1152
01:39:50,161 --> 01:39:53,483
[SPEAKER_22]: So there would be no liability to fall back on the city later on.

1153
01:39:53,883 --> 01:40:01,408
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the students to be cleared back into academics and then back into sports have to be seen by a physician.

1154
01:40:01,869 --> 01:40:05,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So we closely monitor the follow-up of these students.

1155
01:40:06,572 --> 01:40:11,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing getting back into sports.

1156
01:40:11,716 --> 01:40:13,097
[SPEAKER_15]: If a youngster has a concussion,

1157
01:40:14,045 --> 01:40:18,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Counseling and the nurse's office talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well.

1158
01:40:18,769 --> 01:40:23,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.

1159
01:40:23,212 --> 01:40:25,734
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's communication on that level as well.

1160
01:40:25,854 --> 01:40:34,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And students have to be cleared into academics and doing well before they're eventually cleared back into athletics.

1161
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:38,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are protective measures within the policy for students.

1162
01:40:38,183 --> 01:40:40,765
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want to make sure that no child is overlooked.

1163
01:40:40,905 --> 01:40:41,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1164
01:40:42,446 --> 01:40:42,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1165
01:40:44,447 --> 01:40:53,173
[SPEAKER_09]: If a parent forgets to write on the slip that my child had a concussion last spring, is there a second set of eyes that will tell the coach?

1166
01:40:54,233 --> 01:40:55,554
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the nurse's review.

1167
01:40:55,914 --> 01:41:01,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what takes so long with sports registration and clearance.

1168
01:41:02,178 --> 01:41:16,301
[SPEAKER_05]: is that a nurse reviews every single health questionnaire to make sure that there are not high risk factors for any type of health issue, not only concussions, but asthma, allergies, cardiac conditions.

1169
01:41:16,321 --> 01:41:23,202
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm saying if the parent forgets to write down the high risk, the nurse will look at the last season of sports?

1170
01:41:23,682 --> 01:41:29,143
[SPEAKER_05]: They will review the health questionnaire and they will go through and review the health record that is at the high school.

1171
01:41:29,163 --> 01:41:29,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, great.

1172
01:41:30,307 --> 01:41:32,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And also a physical, because a physical is required.

1173
01:41:32,488 --> 01:41:33,888
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be reviewed as well.

1174
01:41:33,928 --> 01:41:38,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really many different pieces of information that the nurses are reviewing.

1175
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:40,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1176
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:41,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

1177
01:41:41,911 --> 01:41:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1178
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:45,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any data on non-athletic concussions?

1179
01:41:45,752 --> 01:41:53,774
[SPEAKER_04]: An example is today at my school, at 745, we had an eighth grader trip and fall and fall into the wall.

1180
01:41:54,655 --> 01:41:55,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was out.

1181
01:41:56,679 --> 01:42:02,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I called the, you know, the nurse wasn't available, so I had to call 911.

1182
01:42:02,886 --> 01:42:07,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, that was a non-athletic concussion, possible concussion.

1183
01:42:08,191 --> 01:42:10,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not required to report those to the state.

1184
01:42:11,655 --> 01:42:17,141
[SPEAKER_05]: We would have to call through our school brains documentation to be able to pull out that data.

1185
01:42:18,459 --> 01:42:25,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we want to make sure that even our clumsy students, no, no.

1186
01:42:26,823 --> 01:42:37,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Any student that the nurse referred a parent to be evaluated by a physician, we would follow up with the same protocol.

1187
01:42:37,549 --> 01:42:44,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So all students are receiving the same set of eyes and the same standard of practice as our student athletes.

1188
01:42:44,793 --> 01:42:50,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, especially because those students also go back into classrooms as well and have to be cleared in that way.

1189
01:42:50,315 --> 01:42:53,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole process has to be the same for those.

1190
01:42:53,256 --> 01:43:02,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that might be something we need to keep data on in the future, so when it's presented we have all students' data, not just athletic students.

1191
01:43:02,979 --> 01:43:03,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1192
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1193
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:06,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1194
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1195
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to receive and place this report on file.

1196
01:43:10,061 --> 01:43:10,801
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1197
01:43:10,881 --> 01:43:11,482
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1198
01:43:11,502 --> 01:43:11,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1199
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:18,500
[SPEAKER_10]: negotiations and legal matters.

1200
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:21,341
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.

1201
01:43:22,261 --> 01:43:31,403
[SPEAKER_15]: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court and you know there are subpoenas out there for people we have sent evidence over and we'll let you know what's going on with that.

1202
01:43:31,983 --> 01:43:35,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Despite the fact that some people think you know we don't prosecute things we do.

1203
01:43:36,344 --> 01:43:39,685
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't, it's done by the DA's office not by us.

1204
01:43:39,925 --> 01:43:40,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1205
01:43:40,785 --> 01:43:44,646
[SPEAKER_15]: The second thing is early this evening a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to

1206
01:43:45,066 --> 01:43:45,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Use that term.

1207
01:43:45,926 --> 01:43:46,867
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, be kind.

1208
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:47,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm kind.

1209
01:43:48,368 --> 01:43:53,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Referred to the open meeting law, I'm gonna tell you about that, because you'll hear about it.

1210
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:59,653
[SPEAKER_15]: The chapter 74 vocational advisory committee on multimedia met.

1211
01:44:00,733 --> 01:44:06,015
[SPEAKER_15]: In the past, there were never postings for those kinds of meetings, it's just one of those things.

1212
01:44:07,536 --> 01:44:13,819
[SPEAKER_15]: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it.

1213
01:44:14,962 --> 01:44:19,769
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was done very innocently by Heidi and her team.

1214
01:44:20,538 --> 01:44:24,759
[SPEAKER_15]: and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it.

1215
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:29,441
[SPEAKER_15]: But he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.

1216
01:44:29,461 --> 01:44:30,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was for other programs as well.

1217
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:32,161
[SPEAKER_10]: It was for other programs as well.

1218
01:44:32,601 --> 01:44:38,343
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings.

1219
01:44:38,683 --> 01:44:43,605
[SPEAKER_15]: We've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.

1220
01:44:43,685 --> 01:44:45,265
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's what was being referred to.

1221
01:44:45,865 --> 01:44:48,086
[SPEAKER_15]: It's also in the agenda of the city council last night.

1222
01:44:49,126 --> 01:44:51,108
[SPEAKER_15]: and tomorrow night.

1223
01:44:51,548 --> 01:44:53,710
[SPEAKER_15]: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.

1224
01:44:54,611 --> 01:45:02,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city or the schools for that particular activity.

1225
01:45:02,878 --> 01:45:05,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.

1226
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:08,202
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're on from there.

1227
01:45:08,242 --> 01:45:09,003
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are the two items.

1228
01:45:09,043 --> 01:45:10,063
[SPEAKER_20]: May I ask a question?

1229
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:10,444
[SPEAKER_20]: Very good, Ms.

1230
01:45:10,504 --> 01:45:11,545
[SPEAKER_20]: VanderKloof.

1231
01:45:12,185 --> 01:45:12,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Did that happen,

1232
01:45:14,648 --> 01:45:17,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Once, was it a one time incident?

1233
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:19,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Or was it, it was when?

1234
01:45:20,571 --> 01:45:21,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Multiple.

1235
01:45:21,132 --> 01:45:21,592
[SPEAKER_20]: Multiple times.

1236
01:45:21,652 --> 01:45:24,574
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just the way that they operated, the advisory boards operated.

1237
01:45:24,594 --> 01:45:25,274
[SPEAKER_20]: They did not realize.

1238
01:45:25,294 --> 01:45:26,034
[SPEAKER_20]: They didn't realize.

1239
01:45:26,114 --> 01:45:28,636
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't something that they ever did.

1240
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:30,757
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.

1241
01:45:30,937 --> 01:45:41,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that

1242
01:45:41,903 --> 01:45:43,786
[SPEAKER_20]: But we should be posting it, and now we know.

1243
01:45:43,946 --> 01:45:45,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, now we know.

1244
01:45:45,228 --> 01:45:50,056
[SPEAKER_15]: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived in public bodies.

1245
01:45:50,096 --> 01:45:52,500
[SPEAKER_15]: They sometimes are interpretations.

1246
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:52,821
[SPEAKER_10]: PTOs?

1247
01:45:53,221 --> 01:45:53,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Pardon me?

1248
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:53,862
[SPEAKER_10]: PTOs.

1249
01:45:55,089 --> 01:45:55,529
[SPEAKER_15]: PTOs.

1250
01:45:55,589 --> 01:45:57,610
[SPEAKER_10]: PTOs, did they make a determination on PTOs?

1251
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:59,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.

1252
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:02,112
[SPEAKER_15]: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?

1253
01:46:02,572 --> 01:46:04,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean that's really the thing that has to be determined.

1254
01:46:04,633 --> 01:46:12,956
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on

1255
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:17,979
[SPEAKER_15]: on these things as well, so we'll see what that is.

1256
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:28,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are of significance to them, but obviously that's one that's slipped by the boards, and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.

1257
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:32,257
[SPEAKER_15]: has been played into a different stratosphere.

1258
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:33,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1259
01:46:33,718 --> 01:46:34,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Bustow?

1260
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:45,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Just on the idea of meetings, Joan, who was here earlier with the CPA, she just had mentioned when we were in the lobby, she was just saying it was unfortunate that Wednesday night is the CPA meeting,

1261
01:46:45,666 --> 01:46:48,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's also the Medford Community Coalition meeting.

1262
01:46:48,649 --> 01:46:52,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And she said, I almost wish there was a giant Google calendar for all city events.

1263
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:56,776
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if that's something that this media center could put.

1264
01:46:56,836 --> 01:46:58,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's one place.

1265
01:46:58,117 --> 01:47:00,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she said, it's a lot of the same people.

1266
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:01,801
[SPEAKER_09]: She wouldn't have double booked it.

1267
01:47:02,141 --> 01:47:03,002
[SPEAKER_09]: But is that something this?

1268
01:47:04,778 --> 01:47:07,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Media center could do us community calendar.

1269
01:47:07,479 --> 01:47:26,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to

1270
01:47:27,401 --> 01:47:32,182
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times, one's at six, one's at eight.

1271
01:47:32,262 --> 01:47:41,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the Robert's Ice Cream Social is 6.30, the Andrew's Curriculum Night is 6.30, so someone doesn't get ice cream at my house.

1272
01:47:41,704 --> 01:47:44,245
[SPEAKER_15]: It's hard, we're posted, but it's hard.

1273
01:47:44,445 --> 01:47:54,227
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do, and there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.

1274
01:47:55,111 --> 01:48:00,334
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.

1275
01:48:00,435 --> 01:48:07,559
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know, obviously it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.

1276
01:48:07,899 --> 01:48:17,866
[SPEAKER_10]: They're actually using some of the community coalition to facilitate their meetings, so they have a group that is working together, so it's kind of ironic that they both scheduled meetings.

1277
01:48:17,886 --> 01:48:18,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so two nights.

1278
01:48:18,927 --> 01:48:19,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, collaborating.

1279
01:48:20,688 --> 01:48:21,348
[SPEAKER_10]: But very good.

1280
01:48:21,748 --> 01:48:23,430
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have one item.

1281
01:48:24,252 --> 01:48:29,713
[SPEAKER_10]: of new business, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of D.L.

1282
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:30,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Velie.

1283
01:48:30,473 --> 01:48:34,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Velie was the father-in-law of former Director of Finance and Administration, Patricia Vail.

1284
01:48:36,575 --> 01:48:38,215
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1285
01:48:46,217 --> 01:48:46,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1286
01:48:46,597 --> 01:48:52,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion that we, do you have anything else that you, is there a motion that we adjourn?

1287
01:48:54,116 --> 01:48:59,323
[SPEAKER_22]: Suspension of the rules.

1288
01:48:59,464 --> 01:49:01,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval of suspension of the rules.

1289
01:49:01,206 --> 01:49:01,887
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1290
01:49:02,127 --> 01:49:02,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1291
01:49:02,268 --> 01:49:02,868
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1292
01:49:02,888 --> 01:49:03,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Suspension is granted.

1293
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:07,996
[SPEAKER_22]: The school committee convention is coming up and I think we have to send a delegate.

1294
01:49:09,714 --> 01:49:10,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do it.

1295
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:15,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I have training at my work, and then I'm on the advisory committee, so I can't go that week either.

1296
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:18,280
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll send a surrogate.

1297
01:49:19,201 --> 01:49:22,464
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can designate.

1298
01:49:22,484 --> 01:49:27,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody review their schedules for the next meeting, and we'll decide who can go to who can go.

1299
01:49:27,768 --> 01:49:28,128
[SPEAKER_22]: October 14.

1300
01:49:30,169 --> 01:49:34,933
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you very much, Justin, for being part of our conversation and to add to the conversation.

1301
01:49:34,993 --> 01:49:36,214
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

1302
01:49:38,409 --> 01:49:39,212
[SPEAKER_22]: When's the next meeting?

1303
01:49:39,272 --> 01:49:40,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to adjourn.
