    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=63.969s">I</a>  had a question on... So, we were talking about... <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=77.699s">additional</a>  students that come from new developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=84.383s">And</a>  we requested our report be given to us in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=88.385s">I</a>  just want more detail about what was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=92.207s">I</a>  think I said I would like <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=95.189s">units</a>  of a hundred and above instead of the hundred and fifty and we would like to try to capture non school-aged children as well as school-aged children so we can pre-plan in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=106.938s">So</a>  I would like that noted in the minutes as well as on the back of our requested reports.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=115.445s">On</a>  the motion for adoption of the minutes as amended by Mr. Benedetto, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=122.154s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=123.014s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=124.715s">I</a>  also want to take note that we have Justin Tang with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=127.375s">He's</a>  the student representative from Medford High School, so welcome Justin. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=130.416s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=138.198s">And</a>  Justin, feel free when we're discussing any matters, if you want to interject, just raise your hand and we'll acknowledge it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=143.54s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=147.901s">Approval</a>  of bills transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=150.924s">Motion</a>  for approval by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=153.106s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=158.544s">Kirsten</a>  Kirsten's not here, but I Okay, so my first question is in tuition reimbursement features I saw a lot of line items for that and I just didn't know what the policy was for tuition reimbursement because just in this bill Approval we have seven thousand six hundred and eighty four dollars in tuition reimbursement for teachers I don't know how teachers apply for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=184.784s">I</a>  don't know how it's allocated</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=187.714s">So</a>  in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two for teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=202.611s">What</a>  you're seeing in that line, in those line items, is reimbursement for that purpose.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=210.244s">And</a>  could you just explain how teachers apply for that and how they've been notified that they have that option?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=215.746s">They</a>  apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=218.746s">He</a>  reviews it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=219.467s">It's</a>  first come, first serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=221.087s">We</a>  obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=226.048s">We</a>  approve it on a first come, first serve basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=228.669s">When</a>  they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=232.21s">And</a>  now that you say that, I do remember approving that piece of the budget, and I'm glad to see it started.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=240.954s">I</a>  just wanted to mention that as your secretary, when I go in and sign the bills, I see all of the lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=253.984s">And</a>  I get to see what courses they're taking, what grades they've gotten, they're doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=259.568s">And</a>  so I've noticed there were a lot that came in probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent and that's the line item you're seeing but I have looked at every single one.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=269.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=270.653s">I</a>  have a few more items. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=272.633s">My</a>  second item is on page 3 of 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=274.614s">It's</a>  for $3,395 and it says Medford High School miscellaneous charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=282.277s">Does</a>  anybody have a recollection as to what and the payment was the vendor was method high school So I was just curious what that was this is for the hockey clothing, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=295.065s">Hockey</a>  uniforms <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=298.453s">Okay,</a>  and the next item is number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=303.358s">An</a>  athletic official on page 11 of 16, an athletic official bill was paid $10,220. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=309.724s">That</a>  just seems so much higher than most of the other ones, and it just caught my eye.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=317.151s">So</a>  that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=322.862s">The</a>  individual named is the coordinator for that conference and check is made out to the conference Okay, cuz yeah, it just strictly for her You know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=335.066s">We</a>  now belongs to the Northeast conference</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=336.693s">Okay,</a>  I was just curious, because it said an individual for that large amount of money, just seemed worth bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=342.757s">And</a>  number four is on page 12 of 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=346.92s">It</a>  says net sports group $8,998, and it says the reason is unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=356.067s">So</a>  I was just wondering why that wasn't classified, and exactly what that was.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=360.51s">If</a>  you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=363.212s">It's</a>  on page... Page 12.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=370.135s">That</a>  was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=382.398s">Good</a>  thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=385.179s">Thank</a>  you for clarifying those questions.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=388.22s">On</a>  the motion that the bills and transfer of funds be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=392.261s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=393.201s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=393.622s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=394.242s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=398.097s">approval</a>  of payrolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=400.079s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=402.481s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=403.722s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=404.383s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=404.643s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=405.884s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=407.526s">Report</a>  of secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=408.947s">There</a>  is none. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=411.069s">Report</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=412.05s">Committee</a>  of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=413.051s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=415.091s">So</a>  we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=418.633s">You</a>  have that in your folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=422.556s">If</a>  you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=425.398s">If</a>  not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=429.32s">I</a>  have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=430.221s">We'd</a>  like it read, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=431.322s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=431.482s">Fritz</a>  has some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=434.924s">Superintendent,</a>  I was a little confused about the motion, so I had sent some inquiries over to Dr. Perala and the director of guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=457.108s">But</a>  what I found out through email communication was that's something that's not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=462.893s">You</a>  know, currently there isn't a way in Naviance to add a notation on the transcript <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=469.099s">or</a>  add an additional document, or attach a separate page. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=473.723s">So</a>  what they can do is the guidance Councilor can write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the student, providing the information about the class rank, what the student was prior to the merger, and the student can complete a brag sheet, and that can help the guidance Councilor write the personal accomplishments about the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=495.24s">but</a>  you know this is all through communications so I was wondering if you know we can I'd like to make a motion you know to invite the headmaster and the vocational director back so we can get like the final details about the class ranking because this was just me going back and forth because I was a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=514.387s">I</a>  thought it was gonna be something different than what we motioned for.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=519.401s">On</a>  the minutes of the meeting of the committee of the whole the motion says that</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=537.855s">I</a>  requested to have separate rankings in quarterly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=541.858s">That's</a>  not exactly what I had motioned for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=544.86s">What</a>  I had motioned for is a separate internal ranking, so that way we know which students in the vocational school and their class rank. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=554.645s">I</a>  believe that's how I remember it correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=557.087s">And</a>  I also asked that a notation be presented on the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=562.19s">And</a>  if that's not possible, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=564.091s">then</a>  I strongly agree with my colleague that the heads of both schools as well as the guidance department needs to come to us and tell us that our motion isn't possible and to present us with what options are possible and how we're going to move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=580.95s">because</a>  this is a very important issue for our seniors and our juniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=584.533s">At</a>  least with our sophomores, we have time to notify them of this change. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=588.698s">It's</a>  still gonna be hard for that level, but at some point, we need to merge them in with the high school rankings, because we do have one code now, and that's how we report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=598.807s">but</a>  we need to make some adjustment for these two years, I believe, and that's why I made the motion, and that's why it was approved unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=607.369s">So</a>  I'm agreeing with my colleague's motion, and I hope that happens very quickly, because this is affecting students that are already sent out applications to colleges, so I motion that it be done immediately.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=622.293s">So</a>  we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=628.936s">Yes,</a>  the only thing is of course the the some of the kids are already beginning to apply to college So there is a timeliness issue and I too have a different recollection than what's here because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=649.375s">kids</a>  GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=657.78s">It</a>  says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=663.864s">I</a>  was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=669.347s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=671.208s">Why</a>  don't we get a clarification out this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=673.529s">When</a>  I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=678.567s">And</a>  if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=682.229s">And</a>  if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=687.703s">So</a>  I would like to lay the paper on the table.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=691.344s">She</a>  asked for a motion to have them appear if they're not able to rectify it in the next week internally.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=697.006s">Could</a>  we warrant, would this warrant an emergency meeting because of the timeliness with children's transcripts? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=705.068s">So</a>  as a school committee member, I'm making a motion that if they can't rectify this by the end of this week that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=711.57s">meeting</a>  at the beginning of next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=714.115s">So</a>  I need someone to second that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=716.058s">I'll</a>  second it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=716.9s">It's</a>  a second by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=717.621s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=718.242s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=718.983s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=720.947s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=722.69s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=724.707s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=724.907s">Kreatz,</a>  did you have another question?</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=726.528s">I</a>  know it's not an emergency matter, but I just thought it would be a nice report if we could get a report on the breakdown of how many students are in each co-op shop and where they're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=739.074s">It</a>  was just something really interesting, but it's not an emergency report. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=743.376s">So</a>  I'd like to make a motion for that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=745.537s">So</a>  you suggest that, what do you call it, you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=753.141s">Transitory</a>  report this early in the year.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=755.865s">All</a>  in the motion that a report of all the co-ops and internships that are being held by our vocational and high school students be delivered by staff, if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=765.298s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=766.119s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=766.72s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=767.902s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=768.523s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=769.464s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=772.168s">Otherwise?</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=773.329s">And</a>  I just had one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=774.549s">I</a>  wanted to inquire about one shop in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=779.852s">It</a>  was the robotics engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=781.753s">Originally,</a>  the robotics engineering has been the traditional vocational program, and it's going to be switching over with the graduating class of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=791.218s">And</a>  just recently, there's been a development where there is <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=798.462s">there</a>  is a co-op opportunity for the robotics engineering students so I just wanted to bring that up and if it could be revisited for the future students if they were interested in the co-op plan it would be ideal and I was out this weekend <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=815.774s">going</a>  out doing the college tours and what we saw was at Wentworth they had the same equipment that we have in our robotics engineering shop and my son, he's been involved in the program, he knew all the names of the machines and in fact we have newer machines than they have <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=834.321s">You</a>  know, they have like a five-axis and we have a three-axis, but he knew all the machines and they had the sheet metal shop, and it was just really fascinating to see that our Medford Vocational School has that equipment that's college-ready, and when they shared some information about their co-ops, their students are college students going out and getting co-ops, and they're starting out at $15 an hour, and that's what our vocational students are doing, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=859.267s">in</a>  that particular field, so I really think it's important to have another look at the robotics engineering program because there might be an opportunity for it to remain as the A week B week program and this was a new development that came about recently for an opportunity for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=878.672s">I</a>  would like to make a motion to have that revisited.</p>

    <p>[Villard]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=947.574s">Good</a>  evening, Honorable Mayor Burke, ladies and gentlemen of the school committee, Superintendent Belson, Deputy Superintendent Nelson, we, the teachers of the McGlynn Middle School, are here in response to item number seven under the report of the superintendent, dated September 18th, 2017, entitled McGlynn Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=968.351s">After</a>  each of us watched this meeting, we came together as a staff and discussed our disappointment regarding the lack of our voice and input being included in this action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=978.94s">We</a>  feel that the McGlynn was misrepresented and our achievements overshadowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=983.763s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn and we are here because we care. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=987.646s">We</a>  are proud that the McGlynn Middle School is unique in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=992.341s">Our</a>  school houses the population of students that is most diverse in background, ability, language, and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=999.989s">Our</a>  school is home to the entire Medford Middle School EL population. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1004.133s">Last</a>  year, through our inclusion model, we serviced a population of almost 60% high-need students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1011.215s">Each</a>  day, our staff rises to and celebrates the challenge of not only educating, but also of meeting the social and emotional needs of the whole child. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1020.878s">Teachers</a>  and staff do this by creating a community of respect and of excellence. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1026.639s">We</a>  value all of our students, and we do all we can to help them excel both academically and socially.</p>

    <p>[Flint]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1036.042s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care, and we are dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1041.087s">The</a>  teachers and staff at the McGlynn enthusiastically devote our time and resources to make the building better on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1048.572s">Students</a>  at the McGlynn enjoy a variety of staff-run extracurricular activities, including Drama Club, National Junior Honor Society, Builders Club, Student Council, the interactive morning news program, yearbook, art club, a rock and roll show, talent show, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1066.943s">chorus</a>  program, a school-wide multicultural holiday sing-along, a gold medal winning string ensemble, and numerous other activities based on student interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1077.938s">Not</a>  only do we dedicate ourselves to these extracurriculars, we have repeatedly volunteered to advise these clubs and many others, often without response or support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1088.001s">Do</a>  we desire even more extracurricular opportunities for our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1092.062s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1093.383s">However,</a>  permission to move forward, financing, and support continue to limit aspirations of those who wish to bring in additional programming and opportunities for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1104.383s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care, and we want the best for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1110.586s">We</a>  want every student to have the most advantages and educational opportunities possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1117.128s">This</a>  requires us to continually collaborate, communicate, and cooperate to ensure the best educational environment possible for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1126.499s">The</a>  more stable, healthy, and professional the relations between the staff are, the more we are able to provide a stable, healthy, and supportive school climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1136.229s">Therefore,</a>  it was disappointing to hear that over the summer, staffing decisions were made based on our backgrounds, talents, and relationships, without the knowledge, without the involvement, or without the input of the most valuable resources available, the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1152.258s">So</a>  as expected, the conclusions and actions, which were based on incomplete and erroneous information, do not match the stated needs outlined in the McGlynn Middle School Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1162.349s">We'll</a>  go into that in details, not now, but we're prepared to do so in another forum.</p>

    <p>[Haas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1170.174s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care and we ask to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1175.41s">We</a>  are a vibrant and energetic staff and care about each other and our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1180.191s">We</a>  maintain pro-student attitude no matter what challenges are presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1184.853s">We</a>  work together in teams, our work families, and as such, advocate for whatever program, resource, or placement is best for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1193.735s">In</a>  previous years, we have come together as a staff to address building concerns, which we brought to every level of administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1201.941s">The</a>  concerns we have voiced through the years and today are not complaints about our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1206.725s">They</a>  are pleased to the administration for help in the hopes that together we can make our school excel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1213.05s">When</a>  there are concerns about our school, good management practices dictate that we should be involved in the process, both in identifying the issues and determining the solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1223.015s">We</a>  are a valuable resource in which you invest. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1226.678s">We</a>  ask to be part of the solution, not demonized as part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1231.021s">Because</a>  we care, we ask to work with you and the administration to make the McGlynn the best it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1238.331s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn and we are here because we care and want our voice to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1243.774s">We</a>  believe that education is not about competing with other schools or even each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1249.057s">It's</a>  about fostering an inclusive community, one that is committed to excellence and meeting the needs of the whole child. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1256.901s">School</a>  and learning are not a competition with a strict and inflexible finish line. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1261.666s">Education</a>  is not a prize to be won. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1264.009s">To</a>  engender this type of competition will only harm the good that our schools are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1269.855s">Only</a>  by coming together can we ensure that all students see what we know to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1275.261s">They</a>  are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1281.837s">planning</a>  someone else's success only to denigrate another, what values are we teaching? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1287.78s">By</a>  dictating rather than communicating, what message are we sending? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1292.863s">Reform</a>  should be made with us, not at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1295.865s">So</a>  we are the teachers of the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1303.529s">We</a>  and our students' voices deserve to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1306.551s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1333.649s">Thank</a>  you very much, teachers of the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1336.351s">We</a>  appreciate your comments and your spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1338.492s">Certainly,</a>  that means a lot to the children of this community that have chosen to go to that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1343.496s">Several</a>  of them, many of them, are delighted to hear you tonight, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1347.819s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1348.8s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1350.641s">Mayor</a>  and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1355.925s">We</a>  respect the teachers of the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1358.226s">We</a>  respect the McGlynn school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1359.647s">We</a>  have two very fine middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1362.089s">We</a>  never said that we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1364.343s">But</a>  we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1373.567s">Several</a>  years ago, it was the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1376.368s">One</a>  school drew more students than the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1379.51s">And</a>  this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1390.555s">Now,</a>  whether they're right or they're wrong, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1393.743s">Our</a>  goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1406.69s">That's</a>  not an indictment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1408.39s">That's</a>  an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1412.533s">Now,</a>  the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1417.435s">Yes,</a>  there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1425.759s">We</a>  have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1435.231s">My</a>  point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1441.68s">And</a>  I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1447.975s">Right</a>  now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1452.576s">Our</a>  goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1465.079s">So</a>  I welcome your involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1466.419s">That's</a>  all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1470.78s">One</a>  of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1475.021s">everyone</a>  would collaborate and work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1477.163s">So</a>  I welcome it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1478.605s">We'll</a>  come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1479.466s">We'll</a>  have a nice meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1480.747s">We'll</a>  talk about what we can do, what we can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1483.45s">Some</a>  of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1493.24s">Certainly,</a>  every budget has its limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1495.622s">You</a>  can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1499.325s">But</a>  there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1506.482s">And</a>  all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1516.531s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1517.351s">And</a>  that we'll work forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1518.572s">And</a>  if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1522.836s">Not</a>  to you, with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1524.818s">But</a>  we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1528.721s">So</a>  I look forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1529.982s">I</a>  appreciate you coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1531.323s">I</a>  appreciate your courage in speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1533.405s">I</a>  think it's really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1534.866s">It's</a>  really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.152s">I</a>  applaud that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.833s">I</a>  think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1543.234s">Let's</a>  keep it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1544.155s">Let's</a>  do it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1550.24s">I</a>  just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teachers reaction was that he felt that demonized and less so I would felt very very sad because that was certainly I don't think Our intention school committee members or or maybe even the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1569.584s">I'd</a>  the the reality was that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1575.868s">gotten</a>  a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1586.365s">And</a>  this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1591.968s">I</a>  still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1604.095s">And</a>  for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1615.982s">We</a>  want to keep class sizes reasonable and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits nor would we want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1625.155s">So</a>  this issue of friends and how do we, how do we, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1631.563s">tackle</a>  this issue so that we don't have an imbalance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1635.165s">I</a>  have been to the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1636.846s">I</a>  think you guys are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1638.426s">I've</a>  had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1644.67s">I</a>  certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1648.591s">And</a>  because I have history, as many of us do here, we know <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1653.894s">that</a>  there has been some times where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1663.246s">From</a>  a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1670.174s">good</a>  about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1680.441s">That's</a>  why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1695.772s">I</a>  know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1700.495s">Once</a>  the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1703.757s">But</a>  the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1707.679s">Anyway,</a>  thank you so much for coming down, and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1717.365s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1718.326s">So</a>  I didn't hear that the teachers were upset until I saw the large group outside tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1725.003s">actually</a>  happy to see a lot of you because I haven't seen you in a few years because both my children graduated from the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and then Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1734.666s">So</a>  it was really nice to see you all and see you still dedicated and acting in such a group way, such a team building way to represent yourselves in such a <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1748.166s">A</a>  difficult thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1749.066s">I'm</a>  very sorry to hear that you felt slighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1753.668s">When</a>  my children were going into middle school, it was hoping that they would get into the McLean. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1761.29s">So,</a>  when I hear the difference now with the Andrews, you know, it's like we all say, it goes up and down at different sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1769.392s">To</a>  hear that you're educating 60% of the high needs students in our district in middle school, that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1777.596s">60%</a>  of your students in your school being high needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1781.737s">That's</a>  a tremendous job that you're doing every day and you're representing <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1785.519s">in</a>  servicing children with very, very significant needs, and you're doing it really well, because if you weren't, I would have known that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1795.587s">I</a>  would have known that and heard that, and that we would have had an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1799.871s">We</a>  never hear of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1801.212s">The</a>  only thing we do hear is our friends are going to a different school, and you know, the emotional impact that has on people's children, and that breaks my heart, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1812.762s">the</a>  social emotional well-being of a child is so important to their education that we need to listen to how that's affecting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1821.669s">And</a>  all our intention was last week is to find ways to make the McGlynn, their marketing, their PR, to let people know about the wonderful things and the wonderful teachers that you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1836.587s">so</a>  that parents are aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1838.588s">It</a>  wasn't to say, well, the Andrews is better, how are we gonna make the McGlenn better? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1843.932s">We</a>  know you're better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1845.473s">We</a>  never even thought for a second that you weren't better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1849.496s">It's</a>  just maybe you need a little bit more PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1852.998s">Maybe</a>  your clubs need to be published a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1856.7s">Maybe</a>  we need to have the paper there to celebrate some of your things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1861.824s">In</a>  other ways, that's how I looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1864.318s">Or,</a>  if you did need more money for clubs, I did that, I believe, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1872.485s">I</a>  don't know why I don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1874.846s">Maybe</a>  we need to do that, and look at those type of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1878.289s">But</a>  it was never, never that you were dedicated and wonderful, because that has never come to any of our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1887.389s">And</a>  I am so grateful that you were comfortable enough to go forward and speak for yourselves in this manner, that you thought that we had that impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1895.212s">And</a>  that's far from what I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1897.774s">So,</a>  I am grateful to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1900.055s">I</a>  hope you understand that we are here to help in any way that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1904.977s">And</a>  if you have ideas, we want you to bring them forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1908.058s">You're</a>  in the front line and you know better than anyone else in this room what you're doing every day and what needs to be celebrated and what needs to be sent out to the parents and the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1920.723s">So</a>  your input is most valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1924.945s">And</a>  I'm always willing to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1927.267s">And</a>  I'm willing to make other people hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1930.008s">Because</a>  I have a big mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1932.61s">So</a>  welcome and thank you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1935.191s">And</a>  I'm sorry that if it was an impression that wasn't pleasant for you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1942.065s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1943.406s">Justin</a>  would like to add to this conversation.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1945.829s">I'd</a>  like to thank the teachers of the Midland, my teachers, for coming here and standing up for yourselves and standing up for your students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1954.578s">I</a>  think what we have here is an issue of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1958.662s">the</a>  public is more attracted to one school than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1961.284s">But</a>  we need to find out why. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1963.706s">And</a>  I can give you my perspective on why. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1966.128s">It's</a>  not that McGlynn teachers are worse than Andrews teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1968.95s">It's</a>  definitely not that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1970.511s">Because</a>  I've talked to students coming from the Andrews and to parents who have students at the McGlynn, at the Andrews, or even in the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1978.677s">And</a>  that's not their concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1980.818s">It's</a>  not that the staff at the McGlynn is poorly paired or it's <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1985.862s">that</a>  it doesn't work well, but rather that the Andrews just, they look at technology, and they look at a component of who's at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1997.146s">And</a>  there's a perception that the McGlynn is a step behind the Andrews when it comes to technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2002.807s">And</a>  there's also a perception that the McGlynn is a step behind the Andrews when it comes to wealth, and how we use that wealth, and how that's portrayed in our socioeconomic status. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2014.271s">And</a>  what we really have to do is look at, you know, these are the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2018.357s">How</a>  do we solve these problems? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2019.679s">Not</a>  that, you know, oh, you know, the teachers are the problems or, you know, it's about working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2028.925s">You</a>  know, we shouldn't make random decisions when we don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2034.829s">If</a>  we know that teachers aren't the problem, we shouldn't shuffle them around because it doesn't really work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2041.454s">We</a>  need to identify the problems that we have at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2045.057s">And</a>  that means 60% of McGlynn kids are high need. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2051.182s">How</a>  do we find out, how do we figure out that balance between the two schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2055.347s">And</a>  I'm sorry to say it, but I don't believe it, but that 60% of students are high needs, and the diversity of school leads some people to prefer the Andrews over the MacLennan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2068.283s">It's</a>  a sad reality, it's a sad truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2070.065s">And</a>  it doesn't mean that it is the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2072.728s">It's</a>  just what people think. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2075.391s">And</a>  just like Mrs. DiBenedetto said, it's about PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2079.255s">And</a>  we need to make sure that people in our community understand that both schools have great teachers and that we even out the playing field for both schools from now on.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2110.384s">I'd</a>  say clearly you guys did a great job.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2113.965s">Justin</a>  certainly should be a recruit for your PFA. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2117.586s">And</a>  he certainly should be sharing those stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2121.547s">And</a>  I'm sure there's many graduates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2123.107s">One</a>  of mine went to the, two went to the McGlynn, one went to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2127.408s">You</a>  know what happens every year they kind of pick different schools even though they all came from the Brooks But Justin and other graduates certainly could be great spokespeople for for the school as well as you because you did a fabulous job tonight We're really really proud to have you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2140.603s">You</a>  said said it all</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2142.746s">I</a>  want to thank you all for coming out tonight, and it was just such great spirit It was great hearing from all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2149.811s">It</a>  was just wonderful, and you know what great work You're doing at the school, and you know it's coming from my other colleagues is that we were just you know talking about the different the clubs and the students want to go to one school and and <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2162.381s">You</a>  know, we're trying to find an equal balance, but we are very grateful to all the hard work that you do every day at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2169.825s">I've</a>  been out to the McGlynn when I went first term, and I had the best experience in the fourth grade class going to see the hydroponics project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2180.51s">I</a>  helped organize a field trip between the McGlynn and the vocational school and it was just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2185.576s">I</a>  had the most fun and been to the concerts and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2189.481s">I</a>  just love it there and it's just a great school and thank you all for what you do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2194.026s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2315.729s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent so I hear you adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate But I can't let one thing go <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2326.24s">We</a>  did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2333.305s">Now,</a>  it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2339.369s">Now,</a>  we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2344.993s">So,</a>  you know, I'm not blaming anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2347.095s">This</a>  is not a blame game. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2348.436s">What</a>  this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2354.62s">So</a>  ownership, good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2360.024s">We're</a>  here to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2361.405s">We</a>  want you to win. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2362.405s">I</a>  don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2366.008s">I</a>  only win when everyone's doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2368.85s">And</a>  so I want you to win. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2370.111s">The</a>  school committee wants you to win. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2372.232s">We</a>  all want to do it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2373.833s">And</a>  if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2377.776s">That's</a>  all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2379.037s">It's</a>  a chance to say, okay, you came out, you showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2384.616s">You</a>  spoke extremely well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2387.397s">Justin</a>  spoke extremely well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2389.617s">Next</a>  step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2397.299s">And</a>  next year, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2399.039s">You</a>  might be even over-enrolled.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2401.419s">Just</a>  to clarify, yes, we did meet over the summer on numerous occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2406.56s">And</a>  yes, the communications did fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2408.841s">However,</a>  when that report was given up, it would have been nice if our voices were</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2418.86s">I</a>  don't want to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2419.92s">I</a>  know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2425.002s">About</a>  many of the items in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2428.444s">But</a>  at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2433.486s">The</a>  issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2444.17s">That's</a>  what you need to take home.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2469.151s">Well,</a>  yes, but at the very least, a meeting with them to work on a new action plan that needs to be presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2477.354s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2531.095s">We</a>  do have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2531.995s">That</a>  wasn't implied that we didn't know about that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2534.497s">It</a>  was clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2534.978s">They</a>  put that in there.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2535.838s">OK,</a>  secondly, basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2540.001s">Why</a>  not get into the school and work with them and try to educate yourself in the respect of what's happening in the teachers and the classes and getting out there and being able to visit that school and help build the morale. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2552.606s">You</a>  also mentioned the fact that there has to be, maybe you need better marketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2557.328s">You</a>  folks are the marketers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2558.869s">You're</a>  the ones who have to market that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2560.95s">The</a>  comments that were made a couple of weeks ago at the last school committee meeting was not marketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2566.492s">It</a>  was derogatory and these folks <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2569.273s">have</a>  come together loud and clear and said, hey, we need your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2574.239s">You</a>  folks create the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2575.961s">We'll</a>  execute the plan as best we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2578.604s">And</a>  they need that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2580.086s">And</a>  collectively, yes, this is a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2582.769s">But</a>  you have to take it an extra step and not wait for them to come to you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2586.594s">You</a>  have to get to them and make this happen cohesively.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2591.719s">I</a>  just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2594.361s">I</a>  think we need to keep something in perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2597.683s">Up</a>  to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2607.21s">The</a>  school committee members have been to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2610.032s">We</a>  know many, many of the faces that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2612.953s">We've</a>  gone to many different events. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2615.135s">We</a>  celebrate the McGlynn, and we celebrate the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2619.417s">It</a>  is wrong to say that we didn't know that 60%, okay, that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight, but we know that, and we may have to look about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2631.705s">Is</a>  there a perception because <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2634.366s">of</a>  that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2647.135s">Those</a>  students are great students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2649.296s">I</a>  know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2652.478s">But</a>  you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2657.862s">So</a>  I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2663.766s">We</a>  need to keep this into perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2667.304s">We've</a>  had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2674.325s">This</a>  year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2684.848s">Because</a>  all of a sudden, we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2691.149s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2691.91s">Nobody</a>  called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2693.471s">Not</a>  one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2701.079s">Not</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2702.801s">What</a>  I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2710.856s">And</a>  it's that how do we block up then? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2712.937s">How</a>  do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2719.44s">That's</a>  what is I've heard over and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2722.902s">That's</a>  why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2732.467s">So</a>  I just I need to keep it in perspective Okay, I need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2739.689s">I</a>  appreciate the teachers coming forward I need you to remember where this came from and that's the problem.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2746.392s">We're</a>  trying to sign just simply clarifying that you know what we were kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2751.013s">Throwing</a>  it out there that you maybe you need better marketing I mean we are the marketers that that before the school and that's really something that needs to be clarified Point taken in the respect of that, but I also listened to the teachers and they were telling me time and time again They tried communicating consecutively with the administration and fallen on deaf ears Those are the things that need to be addressed immediately and those are the things that just that that's what I just bring to light we can we can <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2774.275s">Appreciate</a>  everyone coming together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2775.756s">We</a>  can appreciate the fact that they came together as a team But I think the reason why they came together as a team is there's been a growing frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2782.92s">This</a>  just doesn't occur overnight There's a growing frustration and that's all I wanted to bring to light and that's what's where the expertise of you folks Can can change that dramatically and getting involved in exactly what it is that they're frustrated with Thank you, thank you Mayberg and thank you, mr. McCullough</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2801.772s">First</a>  of all, I'd like to clarify, 60% of high need students is not special education students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2807.156s">Those</a>  are students, when they take state level exams, they fall into different classifications, either ELL or different subgroups in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2817.443s">So</a>  there's a lot of different combinations that could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2820.725s">So</a>  I just didn't realize that it was at 60% capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2824.628s">I</a>  knew our needs levels were different, and I knew that they housed the ELL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2830.052s">So</a>  that would raise the number, but I just didn't know that it was at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2834.015s">So</a>  just so everybody in the community knows, there's not 60% of the students at the McGlenn Middle School that are special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2842.36s">They</a>  just fall into either financial need, or ELL need, or different types of subcategories that are tested on standardized testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2852.366s">The</a>  second part about PR is yes, we are all responsible for PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2858.367s">And</a>  as a school committee member, I myself feel that way too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2861.528s">In</a>  any way I can help and do that, I am more than willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2865.109s">And</a>  just to let the community know all the positives of both our middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2870.991s">And</a>  as far as going out and <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2873.186s">participating</a>  in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2874.987s">I</a>  was actually at the exercise group at the elementary school at the McGlynn last week trying to do hula hoop. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2882.131s">It</a>  didn't work out very well in my favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2884.573s">But</a>  I am trying to like pop into different things throughout the community and just see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2890.896s">So</a>  like renew my own knowledge of each school too because my children have graduated and moved on and it's good to go back and <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2901.277s">I</a>  went to parent night up at the high school as a freshman parent would and sat in the audience and just heard what questions were being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2910.14s">So</a>  I know myself that my colleagues attend a lot of different things and a lot of them have school age children and are in the buildings at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2918.502s">And</a>  for me I have to make more of an effort to do that because my children have graduated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2924.384s">So</a>  as far as that goes, that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2929.685s">By</a>  requesting a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2932.679s">to</a>  have their input for a new improvement plan or updated plan, not really improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2941.101s">A</a>  plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2941.661s">Just</a>  a plan.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2942.341s">A</a>  plan to.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2943.382s">An</a>  action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2944.802s">Sorry,</a>  it went out of my mind for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2948.563s">My</a>  motion was to have a meeting on that because I want the teachers at the table and I want to be at the table as well and I want the superintendent to be there because we all need to be heard, not just us up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2961.502s">and</a>  you were heard tonight, I hope you feel heard, in a different way, but with concrete items to talk about would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2972.832s">And</a>  we might come up with the same or similar action plan in the end that's already been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2982.597s">It's</a>  just that you might feel like you were heard and part of the process better, which is just always great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2988.199s">So</a>  I'm hoping, and I agree with you that that needs to happen more and more often from this membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2996.923s">So</a>  thank you for bringing those concerns forward.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3012.867s">Name</a>  and address, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3015.751s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3018.574s">The</a>  teachers want to be partners in progress, and I applaud them for coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3022.619s">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3023.86s">What</a>  I want the teachers to know is that this very school kept a Chapter 74 board. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3030.29s">in</a>  private. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3031.331s">There</a>  were no open meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3032.551s">So</a>  the Attorney General's Office determined on September 19th that this very school's Chapter 74 board failed to put the open meeting law out there for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3042.557s">So</a>  there is no participation here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3044.097s">There</a>  is no transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3045.898s">You</a>  teachers are to be commended because you put your necks on the line with the people that do the hiring and firing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3050.681s">There's</a>  some very fine people on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3052.882s">but</a>  there's other people that I think deserve term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3056.484s">This</a>  is what's wrong with this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3058.305s">There</a>  is no inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3059.846s">They</a>  say there's inclusion, there's partners in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3062.248s">I</a>  don't feel like a partner in progress and the teacher's fantastic speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3066.671s">I</a>  am just very, very in awe that you would come here and do that and they need to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3073.875s">This</a>  school committee, Mr. Belson, Mayor Burke, they need to be heard and they need to work with you as partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3080.834s">don't</a>  shove them away as many in this community feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3084.836s">It's</a>  polarized, and we've all been shut out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3087.238s">It's</a>  time to open the doors and be a partner in progress, Mrs. Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3090.72s">It</a>  really is time to be partners with us, because we live here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3094.322s">And</a>  I feel that you've shut me out, and Roy Belton shut me out.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3103.267s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3103.768s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3105.492s">We</a>  had a motion and we voted on that we will have a meeting within the next month and we'll reach out to you to come to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3111.397s">We'll</a>  put an agenda together so it'll be a productive meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3114.28s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3115.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3122.575s">Most</a>  impressive person on the interstate.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3142.733s">Thank</a>  you</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3163.507s">You</a>  spoke wonderfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3164.528s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3165.548s">They're</a>  gonna get to purchase items, housing, transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3168.01s">It's</a>  just amazing.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3191.14s">Superintendent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3192.121s">First</a>  report on credit for life grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3195.284s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3197.765s">Mayor</a>  and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3200.988s">Yes</a>  she is.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3202.109s">Before</a>  she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3214.398s">going</a>  over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3236.449s">to</a>  live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way, so this program credit for life is one of the initiatives out of the state Treasurer's Office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so we can have this credit for life there <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3266.247s">this</a>  January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3277.338s">So</a>  I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3280.353s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3281.814s">So</a>  this really is an exciting opportunity for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3284.456s">And</a>  I do have to thank Superintendent Belson, because he's the one who brought it to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3290.56s">And</a>  he was adamant that he wanted the district to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3294.543s">So</a>  over the course of the summer, I put the application in for the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3297.685s">And</a>  then in late August, we were awarded a $5,000 grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3300.727s">This</a>  grant will help us create and operate a credit fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3311.676s">So</a>  the funding for this fair, as Superintendent Belson said, comes from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in partnership with the State Treasurer's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3320.907s">These</a>  grants are funded through the Division of Banks settlement stemming from an alleged unlawful lending practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3328.482s">So</a>  this year's fair, our first fair, will take place on Friday, January 26, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3336.764s">And</a>  all grade 11 students at the high school, the vocational school, and the Curtis Tufts School will participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3343.006s">And</a>  we will offer the opportunity to grade 12 students as well who may voluntarily opt into the fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3350.368s">So</a>  we anticipate <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3352.248s">between</a>  350 and about 600 students attending this fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3357.67s">It</a>  will take place in our gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3359.87s">We'll</a>  use the entire gym for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3363.631s">Let's</a>  see, it's a half day interactive financial decision making fair that will provide an authentic learning activity in which students engage in basic personal financial management scenarios. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3375.635s">So</a>  each participant will choose a profession in advance of that day, and then will be provided a mock financial profile with an individualized budget sheet in the day of the fair specific to their chosen career. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3389.241s">Students</a>  will purchase goods and services such as housing, transportation, insurance and food all while living within their monthly salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3397.123s">The</a>  student's goal for the day is to balance their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3401.044s">And</a>  our goal really is to provide them with a rich learning experience that's going to benefit them as they embark on young adulthood. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3410.387s">So</a>  members of the planning committee include myself, Lisa Evangelista, who's the district public relations specialist, and Gail Treanor, who is really proving to be an integral part of this planning team as she was a finance teacher in Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3425.557s">As</a>  you know, she's the assistant principal here at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3429.339s">So</a>  we've been meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3430.58s">We</a>  have standing meetings every Thursday at 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3433.821s">We've</a>  been contacting outside financial institutions, banks, financial planners, housing specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3442.425s">We're</a>  anticipating that we're going to have at least <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3447.03s">40</a>  to 50 community members coming in who will all be present at the fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3452.151s">So</a>  our students again will have an opportunity to go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3455.192s">They'll</a>  actually have a budget sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3456.672s">We</a>  have all of the materials that actually other districts have shared with us, which makes our job a little bit easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3465.434s">It</a>  really is a massive undertaking, but it's something that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3469.935s">based</a>  on feedback we've had from other districts who have done it, it'll be an undertaking that our students will appreciate and is really long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3479.382s">So</a>  this is a seed grant, which means that the intent is for $5,000, we are planting the seed for this to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3488.368s">We</a>  will apply for the grant next year, I'm assuming, if all goes well, and the maximum grant next year would be $2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3493.955s">And</a>  then after that, I think they say you're on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3497.76s">So</a>  I'm hoping this is the beginning of a longstanding program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3503.326s">and</a>  financial literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3505.368s">So</a>  there will be future updates on this as the planning moves further on into the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3512.253s">So</a>  again, you can put on your calendars Friday, January 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3515.116s">It</a>  will be roughly nine to one, although we're still working on those hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3520.92s">We'll</a>  give you an update further on in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3523.863s">I'd</a>  be happy to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3525.484s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3527.205s">First</a>  off, because it's interactive, it seems like it'll be very innovative, and the kids will really, I think, get into this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3534.971s">And</a>  secondly, if you'd like to add our names, any one of us, I'm sure, would sign on to any letters of request that you make to the banks and various entities in our city, certainly to try and get as many as possible participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3546.64s">I</a>  know with our community banks, that's what they do, that's what they're all about, so certainly I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3551.383s">All</a>  the ones that are in Medford will participate as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3554.186s">And</a>  just if we as a school committee could send our thank you out to the Division of Banks as well as the Treasurer's Office for providing this great opportunity on behalf of the students at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3564.959s">We</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3566.3s">Thank</a>  you for all your hard work, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3567.601s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3568.722s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3568.902s">Katz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3569.483s">Hi,</a>  Dr. Riddell. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3570.543s">I</a>  just wanted to say I really love this idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3573.125s">I</a>  think it's absolutely fantastic, and it's just gonna teach the students a very valuable life lesson. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3578.35s">I</a>  was just so interested, and I really love Monopoly, and it reminds me of the real life Monopoly game, and I just love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3585.295s">It</a>  just sounds like so much fun, and some of the articles online that the students were faced with unexpected circumstances where <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3593.117s">their</a>  car breaks down and they have to make a decision on what are they gonna do or their pet has to go to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3599.501s">I'm</a>  sorry, their pet has to go to the vet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3602.303s">But</a>  it just sounds like so much fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3606.265s">It</a>  really does and it's gonna be a valuable life lesson to learn how to balance a budget and I know a lot of students, my son's just learning how to do a checkbook and it's just so important to learn how to spend your money and manage it and pay bills and know what you have to take priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3623.155s">But</a>  it's wonderful, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3625.076s">Great,</a>  you're welcome.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3626.996s">Are</a>  there any other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3628.497s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, do we formally have to accept the grant?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3630.958s">No,</a>  just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3633.679s">On</a>  the motion to receive and place on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3637.32s">Van</a>  der Kloot, all in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3638.38s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3639.0s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3639.54s">Motion</a>  passes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3642.577s">Report</a>  on game change, anti-violence partnership grant from New England Patriots Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3647.424s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3648.305s">So</a>  this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3653.532s">We</a>  have <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3658.468s">Rachel</a>  Perry with us, who is our supervisor of health and physical education, actively involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3664.675s">It's</a>  an exciting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3666.697s">As</a>  we all know that young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes, despite yesterday's loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3676.065s">But</a>  they like to be associated with that, and I think this is a really important thing, because it not only does two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3680.967s">One,</a>  it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3690.469s">And</a>  we've got to move forward on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3692.209s">So</a>  I'm going to turn it over to Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3694.349s">I've</a>  given you some additional material. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3697.13s">A</a>  trainer's guide, some selected portions of the whole thing because it would be like 100 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3701.572s">But</a>  you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3704.173s">It's</a>  got a lot of sports related kind of terminology in it, so like talking trash scenario, the kinds of things like that, or being offside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3715.138s">So</a>  it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3717.839s">And</a>  we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3722.844s">Thank</a>  you, Superintendent Belson, Mayor Burke, and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3727.266s">So</a>  we've received $3,000 this year to expand the Game Change Grant, and that's the New England Patriots Anti-Violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3734.848s">It's</a>  a partnership for another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3736.949s">In</a>  the past two years, what we've done is we've trained two of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3740.93s">They</a>  actually went out to a three-day training to learn the curriculum, and they brought it back to the kids at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3746.592s">And</a>  in turn, we trained the captains and our club leaders in this curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3752.114s">And</a>  we've also added some of these lessons into our health classes for the freshmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3758.639s">So</a>  what we're planning on doing going forward is we're going to be able to train even more kids this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3764.302s">On</a>  November 16th and 17th, we're in the process of planning those two days where members of Game Change will come in and train 30 of our students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3773.749s">In</a>  turn, those students will go down to the middle schools and train our middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3778.792s">We're</a>  also looking to have our two health teachers at the high school and our health teachers at the middle school be trained in the curriculum as well so that we can in turn add some of these lessons to the middle school health curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3791.023s">So</a>  we'll have it from the middle school going all the way up to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3795.868s">To</a>  actually continue this program once the funding, you know, has been completed for this year, I plan on starting a captain's council where I will meet with the athletic captains and the leaders in the clubs and we will continue this curriculum along with other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3813.328s">So</a>  we'll be able to continue it going forward.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3815.799s">Moving</a>  it forward, excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3817.02s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3817.501s">Justin,</a>  have you had a chance to participate yet?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3820.864s">Oh,</a>  well, I mean, I've seen the videos throughout the school for the no more campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3824.767s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3825.328s">And</a>  I've seen people wear the shirts and yeah, there's a presence.</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3828.251s">Absolutely,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3829.692s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3830.233s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3831.153s">Thanks,</a>  I had some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3832.715s">Okay,</a>  so once you train everybody and they become a mentor, what do they do with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3837.84s">And</a>  how do other children know that they're</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3840.433s">So</a>  our goal is to train as many students as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3843.876s">So</a>  we have part of the MVP club after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3846.618s">So</a>  our trained mentors will be joining the MVP club, and we'll be bringing that back to our athletic teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3852.684s">So</a>  our captains that are involved in the MVP club will bring it back to the children that aren't captains, and we'll also be bringing it down to the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3861.051s">So</a>  the goal being we will train as many students as possible.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3865.239s">Okay,</a>  so is this for all clubs, or just like sports clubs? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3870.881s">No,</a>  all clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3871.901s">Okay,</a>  so and then the students in those clubs know that certain students in the club are trained mentors, so if they have an issue, they go to them?</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3882.384s">Absolutely,</a>  and they bring it back to the kids in their club that haven't been part of the training, and they can share what they've learned with the rest of the children in their club.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3891.571s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3893.193s">I</a>  was just wondering how that all works. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3894.995s">So</a>  if two children have an issue, they know that there's a mentor in it.</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3899.04s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3899.301s">And</a>  everyone in the club, we actually had really cool t-shirts made, MVP, Mentors in Violence Prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3905.708s">So</a>  they do wear their t-shirts so that they can identify, that's someone that I can talk to.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3910.353s">Great,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3911.174s">That's</a>  why I was just wondering how it actually happened that people knew about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3915.559s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3916.22s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3916.82s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.102s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.402s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.502s">Stone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.943s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3920.124s">Then</a>  if a student, if someone comes looking for help from the student, who does the student then go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3924.789s">Because</a>  that'd be a pretty heavy topic for a teenager. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3927.512s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3928.093s">So</a>  as part of the training, we actually talk about who do you feel comfortable going to and the children that also training get some training, they give them scenarios on how they can help other students through things and who that they can direct them to.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3942.062s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3942.202s">But</a>  if a student says to the mentor, I'm in an unhealthy relationship, I don't know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3948.647s">Does</a>  the mentor deal with it or does the mentor say, go talk to Miss Perry?</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3952.849s">They</a>  would direct them to either me or somebody that was in the training.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3958.646s">Was</a>  that last year where any students referred to you?</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3962.348s">None</a>  that I've seen so far.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3963.629s">Okay,</a>  well that's good.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3965.57s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3966.33s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor to place and file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3968.451s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3968.811s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3969.452s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3969.932s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3970.813s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3971.713s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3972.333s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3973.174s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3973.594s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3973.974s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3976.315s">Report</a>  on Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3979.657s">We</a>  have members. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3981.664s">of</a>  the committee, the CPC committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3984.766s">As</a>  you may realize, a year and a half ago, the citizens of Medford voted to adopt the CPA Act, which allows for monies to be put in a trust fund and spent for certain purposes, affordable housing, open space, and historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4000.538s">And</a>  we have with us two members tonight that would like to explain it so that the public can become more aware of this program.</p>

    <p>[Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4007.594s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4008.755s">Thanks</a>  for inviting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4009.756s">The</a>  mayor stole some of my thunder, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4015.582s">So</a>  everything she said is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4016.943s">The</a>  CPA was voted in November of 2015, and it put a 1.5% surcharge on property tax bills with exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4025.331s">The</a>  first year, the CPA generated about $1.2 million of local tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4030.316s">and</a>  from that we got about a 15%, or we're gonna get a 15% match from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4035.138s">So</a>  there's some money there to spend in open space, recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4041.221s">So</a>  basically the way it works is 10% has to go to each of the three categories, so open space and recreation, historic preservation and affordable housing, and the other 70% gets to be used for any qualified program. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4055.628s">We</a>  were formed as a committee this May 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4057.869s">We're</a>  in the process of standing up our committee, the plan, the application, everything that we need to run as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4066.076s">So</a>  we're here today and we've been out on sort of a speaking tour to kind of gather information from the community to find out <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4072.14s">What</a>  do you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4072.861s">What</a>  do we need to do to support these areas? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4076.204s">There's</a>  boards and commissions that have been looking at issues related to their board and commission that directly relates to CPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4084.19s">So</a>  we've been sort of gathering things that they already know, and that's why we're here to talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4088.794s">There</a>  must be things that you know that we can use money for open space recreation, affordable housing, and historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4098.162s">So,</a>  open the floor for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4100.103s">Roberta,</a>  it's... <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4101.804s">expert</a>  so she will answer whatever you have.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4103.985s">We</a>  have Joan Cyr, a member, and Roberta Cameron is the chairperson of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4107.467s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4108.688s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4109.508s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4110.689s">So</a>  could any of these funds be helpful with us since the whole community uses the school parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4117.472s">like</a>  if we need to redo all the rubber in the school yard, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4123.66s">So</a>  we can put that request in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4126.424s">We</a>  can start at each school each year and just keep rotating throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4133.172s">forever?</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4133.953s">Well,</a>  you know, the planning process that we're undertaking right now is to help us to be able to balance how we use these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4141.278s">As</a>  wonderful as it is to have this resource to use for some of the needs like our outdoor recreation, athletic fields, and playgrounds, we've got three, four program areas that we need to balance this funding between all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4156.85s">And</a>  so we're in a planning process right now to help us understand what the priorities are and what <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4163.115s">proportion</a>  of that million plus funds each year should go into each of those program areas and in open space and recreation, what proportion toward our sports athletic fields versus improving areas along the Mystic River and walking and biking trails so that kids can walk and bike to school safely where they can't perhaps today.</p>
