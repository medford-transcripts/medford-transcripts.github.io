00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:05,142

[SPEAKER_12]: Take your time.

[SPEAKER_06]: President, all please rise and salute our flag.

6
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:27,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,

7
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:32,979
[SPEAKER_06]: One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Item one, approval of the minutes of February 1st, 2016.

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:42,402
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion for approval, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

10
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:43,082
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

11
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:44,583

[SPEAKER_06]: Minutes are carried.

13
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:49,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

14
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:56,107
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a few things in the minutes that I had questions on at our last meeting.

15
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see it in the speech packet, but I know we're planning on doing a subcommittee meeting regarding the academic test score.

16
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:11,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to just make sure that we put that on the agenda, so I'll make plans for that meeting.

17
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:12,128
That's number one.

18
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:23,813
And I was wondering if you were able to get missing subgroups who have brought it to the accountability report, if Mr. Connell and many of them

19
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:36,874
[SPEAKER_05]: if it went out just to Robert's school parents or if it went out to the whole Title I district as a whole.

20
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:40,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

21
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:54,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you know, the mayor appointed subcommittees at the last time and there's a curriculum subcommittee and this was reported to the subcommittee so that shortly in the future we'll have a curriculum subcommittee on the issue of the academics.

22
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:56,205
[SPEAKER_10]: The information,

23
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:01,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Administration met with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, got a lot more data.

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a result, we'll bring that to the subcommittee.

25
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:06,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And thirdly, Diane's here to talk about the letter.

26
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:09,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how that specifically was issued.

27
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:14,577
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't sure if it was just going to the Roberts or if it was to go to all Title I students in the whole district.

28
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:20,020
[SPEAKER_02]: The letter of the accountability letter went out to the Title I schools.

29
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be the Roberts, the Columbus, and the McGlynn elementary schools.

30
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So all schools needed to receive that letter?

31
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:25,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

32
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:27,459
[SPEAKER_05]: just the Robert school.

33
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:27,899
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

34
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was given to parents would in, um, we're taking next steps necessary.

36
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:34,685
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

37
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:40,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went out through an email from my office to the principals and the principals disseminated that to the parents.

38
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

39
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:49,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so we'll follow up further at the, um, I know I'm not on that subcommittee, but I probably attend this meeting.

40
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:50,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

41
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:58,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we'll follow up soon at that meeting and just brainstorm for next steps to make sure our scores rise above.

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Love to have you there.

43
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,611
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

44
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_01]: So their entries are sent directly to New York, and they're entered in a national competition where they have the opportunity to compete for scholarships.

92
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,620

[SPEAKER_06]: Malika Limone.

160
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:19,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Samantha Liu.

161
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Kyle McGinley.

162
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:37,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve Inspires.

163
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:40,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Brianna Saunders Correa.

164
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:55,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Charles Todd Hunter.

165
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:01,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin Thang.

166
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:34,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Julia Shanahan Hannah Rogers That was a gold key for Hannah.

167
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to congratulate everybody who was here tonight and all of our winners.

168
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:59,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a big thank you and maybe a round of applause for our teachers who really supported the students.

169
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:15,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

170
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,101
Thank you.

171
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:19,768
Thank you.

172
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:31,737
[SPEAKER_06]: on the floor to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

173
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:32,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot.

174
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,278
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

175
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:34,699
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

176
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now under community participation.

177
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:36,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

178
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot, you wanted to make a commentary?

179
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there was a parent in the audience who had written us, Ms.

180
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:43,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Valdez.

181
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:46,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a Ms.

182
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:46,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Valdez?

183
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Your name and address for our record, please.

184
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Bielke Valdez, 113 Fellsway West.

185
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:57,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

186
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

187
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:12,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to take a quick minute to address the school committee just to have a voice to some concerns on some slight miscommunications, especially regarding financial decisions.

188
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:21,452
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a school trip sponsored by the GSA and Amnesty International Club in November that was canceled for safety reasons.

189
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:25,215
[SPEAKER_14]: As a parent, I greatly appreciate the

190
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:33,121
[SPEAKER_14]: the sense of putting children's safety first, and I did not disagree with the decision to cancel the trip.

191
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:39,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Upon canceling the trip, there was a lot of miscommunication as to refunds.

192
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:54,315
[SPEAKER_14]: There was some communication about a percentage being reimbursed from the insurance company, and then talks as to what will happen with the remainder of the funds, and or what other activities

193
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,829
[SPEAKER_14]: to replace what the activity was canceled.

194
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:03,112
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers have done a great job doing their best to try to communicate with the parents.

195
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:13,098
[SPEAKER_14]: But since November, there has not been a meeting, a memo, or general email with next steps follow up.

196
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:22,744
[SPEAKER_14]: My major concern as a parent is that 25% that was not reimbursed from the insurance

197
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,603
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers have informed me that financial decisions are with you guys.

198
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:38,388
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically, I'm trying to find out if there is any follow-up next steps and what has been planned or discussed.

199
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:43,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke with Mr. Belson on the phone in December.

200
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:47,514
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a problem with the insurance identifying me.

201
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,075
[SPEAKER_14]: They did not know who I was.

202
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I was asking for the check to be canceled then.

203
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:56,142
[SPEAKER_14]: sent to me instead of my child's father.

204
00:19:57,003 --> 00:20:06,207
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was more concern in more identifying who I was and proving that I proved for the trip instead of trying to work with me.

205
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:14,572
[SPEAKER_14]: And unfortunately, Mr. Belson, when I asked what about the remainder, your words to me were, I don't care about that right now.

206
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:21,095
[SPEAKER_14]: And that concerns me because I would love for these opportunities

207
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:22,583
[SPEAKER_14]: to continue.

208
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:36,435
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to see something like this happen in the future, but just with more of a strategic plan on how to communicate with the parents of any what ifs, because those what ifs were not fully communicated.

209
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:38,277
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for your time.

210
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, miss Valdez.

211
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:43,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Belson, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

212
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:47,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, the trip had to be canceled or

213
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:52,886
[SPEAKER_10]: We agree that it should be canceled because of the circumstances in the world at that particular time.

214
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,368
[SPEAKER_10]: We worry about security.

215
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:59,171
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had several other discussions about security and safety in recent times.

216
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:08,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, a decision was made at that time based on what we knew and what might be a threat, because there were threats on Washington at that time.

217
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,746
[SPEAKER_10]: When people signed up for the trip, and I have the material, and I believe it was put in your packet, information was part of the sign up.

218
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:23,878
[SPEAKER_10]: that talked about a cancel for any reason insurance program.

219
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And that program guaranteed 75% back.

220
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting a company to agree initially to pay it back, if you ever deal with an insurance company, you know that it isn't just a phone call.

221
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:41,003
[SPEAKER_10]: That we had to follow up, and we were able to get the 75% back, albeit.

222
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:45,205
[SPEAKER_10]: It took several phone calls and work on staff.

223
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:49,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Bernadette Rigodelli did a lot of work to follow up on that as well.

224
00:21:52,429 --> 00:22:06,897
[SPEAKER_10]: At the time, we said we would try to convince the company that this was an unusual circumstance and that it should be 100% back because it wasn't something that was canceled because we just decided not to go.

225
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:10,820
[SPEAKER_10]: This was a world situation that came out of nowhere.

226
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:12,827
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was a lot of planning into it.

227
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:17,308
[SPEAKER_10]: We also discussed what else could we do going forward.

228
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:33,112
[SPEAKER_10]: And we referred that back to the trip planners, the people that had sponsored the activity, and said, we would work with you to come up possibly with an alternative activity that might provide some kind of experience for our young people who wanted to go on that trip.

229
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:36,393
[SPEAKER_10]: When Ms.

230
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:38,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Valdez contacted my office,

231
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:42,945
[SPEAKER_10]: She indicated to me that the refund was going to the wrong person.

232
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:52,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, we don't know who the wrong person is because the refund goes to the person whose name is on the form that the insurance company has.

233
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:59,378
[SPEAKER_10]: In this instance, it was someone who she disagreed with should be getting the return.

234
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:05,463
[SPEAKER_10]: It's necessary on our part and due diligence to make sure that she was entitled to the refund.

235
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:07,692
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to talk to the company.

236
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:12,154
[SPEAKER_10]: We just couldn't just simply say, okay, we'll give it to you because you say you're the person who's going to get the refund.

237
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:14,175
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that simple.

238
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:27,019
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people will claim ownership of a refund, but it has to be done officially and professionally with an outside company because they're not writing a check to someone if they're not sure it's going to the right source.

239
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,081
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as I don't care about that right now, I would never say that.

240
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:34,762
[SPEAKER_10]: If you interpret it that way, I don't believe I said it,

241
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:39,555
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I did, I apologize for that, but quite frankly, I would never say that to anybody.

242
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:45,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course we care about people and getting their refunds back and getting their materials.

243
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:53,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the question then boils down to, there were 32 youngsters who lost approximately $230 each.

244
00:23:55,602 --> 00:24:02,525
[SPEAKER_10]: If the committee wants to make whole, the committee just simply has to direct the administration to make it whole, or their portion thereof.

245
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:05,425
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't make that decision for you.

246
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:11,530
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something you can request of us and approve for us.

247
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,374
[SPEAKER_10]: However, anytime something like this happens, you are setting a precedent.

248
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:24,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you do it this time, it's conceivable that in the future you will be asked to do it again and again and again.

249
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:28,565
[SPEAKER_10]: You can vote that this is a one-time situation.

250
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,307
[SPEAKER_10]: You can take all kinds of options if you decide to do it.

251
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:37,035
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had two or three inquiries on this subject out of 32 people.

252
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:42,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure everybody would be interested in getting all of their money back if it were possible.

253
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:50,141
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's a decision that this body has to make and direct the administration as to whether you want to do that.

254
00:24:51,421 --> 00:25:01,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, you may be setting a precedent, or if you want to frame it in such a way so that this is a one-time only situation,

255
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:05,264
[SPEAKER_10]: and the buyer beware in the future, that's possible too.

256
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:09,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's up to you.

257
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:09,987
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what you want to do.

258
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:18,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly don't want to tell you what the right thing to do is because you may have some feeling that this was something that was an extraordinary event.

259
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:27,295
[SPEAKER_10]: You may have some feeling that because we canceled it, it was an extraordinary event.

260
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:31,397
[SPEAKER_10]: $200, $230 is not a small sum for some families.

261
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:32,378
[SPEAKER_10]: For other families, it's

262
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:34,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not as much.

263
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,511
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a decision that we make together.

264
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you make a decision, we'll act on it.

265
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:41,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

266
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz, your light.

267
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:45,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to speak?

268
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think my light went off.

269
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Your light was on.

270
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:49,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

271
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:52,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

272
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

273
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:57,767
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I just want to make sure that we have it all.

274
00:25:58,328 --> 00:26:06,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that when we spoke and we made the decision of canceling, at that point in time, I know that we had discussed and I know that after our meeting,

275
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:16,031
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe Paulette and myself had discussed with a lot of the parents that we were going to try to do something, and with the superintendent too, that we were going to try to do something.

276
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:21,452
[SPEAKER_15]: If we weren't going to be able to get all the money back, we were going to try to do something in its place.

277
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:24,173
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess at this point in time, through

278
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:30,277
[SPEAKER_15]: through you to the superintendent, is there anything that we've come up with to do for the students?

279
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:34,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, we were going to do something in its place because we couldn't bring the students to Washington.

280
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,762
[SPEAKER_15]: We were going to try to do something for the students here.

281
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:44,827
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the last we had spoken about it, and we were talking about maybe trying to get representatives and some of our state legislators and, you know,

282
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:50,891
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe even some of our congressmen to come and have a breakfast or something with our students.

283
00:26:51,331 --> 00:27:02,378
[SPEAKER_15]: And I knew that at that point in time when we were speaking to some of the parents that were here, they felt, and please, you know, I apologize if I'm speaking for you,

284
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:12,872
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think at that point in time, you were okay in place of the $230 if we couldn't get everything, because the parents felt that they were getting something in its place.

285
00:27:12,992 --> 00:27:16,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Because unfortunately, it is something that is beyond our control.

286
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:24,020
[SPEAKER_15]: And to be honest with you, that's where I thought we were at this point in time, because we were going to try to do something later on.

287
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you respond?

288
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:30,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so at this point in time, there is no specific that's in place.

289
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:38,379
[SPEAKER_10]: There have been some prior discussions about it, but most of our Washington types and the like have been busy.

290
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,982
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an election season underway, and some of the early phone calls have clearly not resulted in much activity yet.

291
00:27:46,662 --> 00:28:00,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It may be that after tomorrow, the March 1 activity, the election, that some people will then have a little bit more time from the Massachusetts delegation, and maybe we'll be able to round up some kind of meeting that would go forward.

292
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:04,568
[SPEAKER_10]: At this point in time, there's nothing really new to report on that.

293
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any at this point in time?

294
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:08,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean,

295
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:11,817
[SPEAKER_15]: As you said, $230 for some people might not be.

296
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:12,577
[SPEAKER_15]: 32 students at $230 is $7,360 for us.

297
00:28:12,597 --> 00:28:16,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this is out of our control, is there anything else the insurance company or the agency will do to work with us to try to pick up on that 25%?

298
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:17,522
[SPEAKER_15]: So we pursued them.

299
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:40,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And quite frankly, they stood their ground, because they have a plan, they have a policy, and they stood with it.

300
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:53,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And I imagine they might have had other requests from other places, and while we think we're the only trip that got canceled, there are probably a lot of trips that got canceled, and there are probably a lot of investment dollars that they may have had to make at this point in time.

301
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,371
[SPEAKER_10]: So their answer to us at this point is no.

302
00:28:58,044 --> 00:29:02,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Honestly, speaking to the students that were here that evening, I think they were so excited.

303
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:10,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, it was about the money, but it was also the point of they were really looking forward to meeting and sitting down with their legislators.

304
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,008
[SPEAKER_15]: And really, they had concerns.

305
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:13,908
[SPEAKER_15]: They had questions.

306
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:16,249
[SPEAKER_15]: They were very motivated in doing something.

307
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:27,352
[SPEAKER_15]: And honestly, I think that if we could really try more diligently in trying to really work something out in working out some type of a meet and greet or a breakfast or something for this group,

308
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:32,717
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, honestly, that would really rectify this whole situation.

309
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:50,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, another option could be that, you know, we see what the next month brings, and if we come up with something, we bring it back to you, and you tell us whether or not it's sufficient, or you feel it's something you want to support in lieu of returning pure dollars or doing nothing.

310
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,675
[SPEAKER_15]: But more importantly is that even though you come back to us and you have that

311
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:57,436
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, that communication with us.

312
00:29:57,956 --> 00:30:02,099
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more important that we have the communication with the parents and the students that are involved.

313
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think we can do that.

314
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:10,484
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have to do that because I mean, this has been going on since November and it's not fair to them if we don't have that communication.

315
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:11,345
[SPEAKER_10]: We can certainly do that.

316
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:19,850
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now we haven't had any traction on additional dollars from the insurance company, nor have we had much movement on alternative activity.

317
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:21,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

318
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Van de Vliet.

319
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:23,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

320
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:30,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So when a student goes on a trip like that, there is a risk, and the risk is that it's canceled.

321
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:35,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is fairly clear in the policy that 75% would be refunded from the company.

322
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:47,822
[SPEAKER_11]: However, on the evening that this happened, I remember distinctly that the tone was definitely that we would try and work something out.

323
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:58,190
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, part of it, as my colleague alludes to, was definitely something for the kids because of their excitement and interest in wanting to undertake this activity.

324
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,751
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is the other piece of the money.

325
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:05,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, I don't think that we can refund the whole thing from the school department.

326
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually don't think it would be appropriate.

327
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:20,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think that if I were looking at it in addition to whatever we do, I would be inclined to at least refund $100 to each parent, possibly $115, which would be half of the money.

328
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it needs to be clear.

329
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason I would do that is because it's never happened before.

330
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:33,830
[SPEAKER_11]: It's never happened since I've sat on this school committee that I remember that we had a similar case, certainly which involved as many students.

331
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:39,079
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I think it's one of those things where

332
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:44,578
[SPEAKER_11]: the parent knows that they're taking somewhat of a risk, and so we're sharing the risk, if you would.

333
00:31:44,998 --> 00:32:04,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Gives people back a little bit of money, certainly shows good faith on our part, but then becomes a very clear precedent of saying, you know, in the future, if trips are canceled, the only money which is, I mean, refunded will be the 75 percent from the company, because now we have such a clear indication.

334
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:25,810
[SPEAKER_11]: My thinking would be, and I'm not going to make it a motion yet because I know other people might have other thinking, but my thinking right now is that I would recommend to refund 100 or 115, I don't know which, whatever my colleagues think, and split the difference between us and the parents.

335
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:33,175
[SPEAKER_11]: And in addition, we would like to see, I'm just sure that if there was an event locally,

336
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:37,377
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's not like we're saying that money covers the cost of the event.

337
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:45,180
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to put together an event with other people just to, so the kids have an opportunity to talk to other people in government.

338
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:47,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Any thoughts?

339
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:51,863
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion on the floor to reimburse, is it 100 or 115?

340
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.

341
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:54,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, let's say half, 115.

342
00:32:55,485 --> 00:32:58,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion on the floor to reimburse 115 per family.

343
00:32:58,186 --> 00:32:59,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry.

344
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:02,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, through to the parent at the podium.

345
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:09,356
[SPEAKER_12]: When your child signed up for this trip, were you aware that if any cancellations came about, there would be a penalty?

346
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:11,317
[SPEAKER_14]: I was aware.

347
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:19,521
[SPEAKER_14]: My more concern over the actual money was the communication was what's next.

348
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:22,423
[SPEAKER_14]: It was more of an emergency situation.

349
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:26,565
[SPEAKER_14]: The vote was made, the trip was canceled, and that was that.

350
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:31,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would like to also just take a quick brief moment to

351
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:41,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Also reiterate in my email that I sent, I also mentioned that the forms that the insurance had asked for were not filled out by the parents.

352
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:52,081
[SPEAKER_14]: The students filled out those forms, which concerns me because when it comes to finances, a child under the age of 18 should not be filling out financial documentation.

353
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:56,963
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, Madam Mayor, I concur with my colleagues and their opinion.

354
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:12,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would ask that in the future, before we approve any trips for any student groups going anywhere, that this issue is brought up again and made to light so the parents know and fully understand before they sign their life away for their children.

355
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:18,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And if in any event, given the situation in the world affairs today, if there's a cancellation, there is a penalty.

356
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can't always make the parents good for what happens.

357
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,345
[SPEAKER_12]: They signed the contract, we just approved the contract.

358
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:27,659
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the trip.

359
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:41,402
[SPEAKER_12]: And I too was also under the impression, Mr. Superintendent, that we were going to try to rectify the situation some way in house by bringing in somebody to chat with the kids and hear the children's views on what they had to express at the time.

360
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:43,243
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope we can follow through with that.

361
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:51,145
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there's only a few months of school left, but I hope we could really get together, put our heads together and come up with something meaningful for the students.

362
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:56,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know that the advisors on the trip would very much like to do something, but again,

363
00:34:56,885 --> 00:35:00,548
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, I'll re-approach them this week and ask them if they've got any ideas.

364
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:13,979
[SPEAKER_10]: We've talked to the young people and if they've got something they would like to do and we can help them facilitate it, but perhaps incorrectly, but I left it in their hands to, you know, decide whether there was an alternative they felt they wanted to do.

365
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And if not,

366
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,379
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe we would come up with something independent of them.

367
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:32,410
[SPEAKER_12]: If possible, could the students, the chaperones and whatever meet with the support services subcommittee so we could get further testimony and come up with a concrete plan for the future?

368
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:44,679
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have whatever subcommittee meeting you want, but I think maybe you might be better off initially allowing some of this to germinate outside so that when they come to you, there's actually concrete statements rather than just simply

369
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just want to reiterate that we don't want to be in this situation again.

370
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:56,178
[SPEAKER_12]: It's misfortunate and this poor parent and probably other parents have gone through, they're probably at their wits end.

371
00:35:56,198 --> 00:36:01,760
[SPEAKER_12]: When you lose 25% of a trip, it kind of hits hard in the family pocketbook.

372
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:03,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Understood.

373
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:05,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

374
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:06,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

375
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:07,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

376
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:11,660
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, the children were extremely excited about the trip.

377
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,624
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm hearing from you isn't so much the financial piece, which I will get to.

378
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:20,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the communication piece that's a priority for you.

379
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:32,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember the parents were very, very motivated to have each parent call either individually about the cancellation or not

380
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:39,930
[SPEAKER_05]: to make sure that everybody knew the trip was canceled because it was only like, what, 48 hours?

381
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Barely 48 hours before the trip that we had canceled this.

382
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a parent, you expect weather cancellations.

383
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:50,432
[SPEAKER_05]: You expect things.

384
00:36:50,732 --> 00:37:00,194
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not expect there to be terrorist attacks on our capital and the school community to hear this and to cancel the trip.

385
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:02,815
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an extremely unusual situation.

386
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:12,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, we want to make sure that our communication, whenever we do a trip, is a little bit more involved with the parents and less through the children.

387
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's an important piece.

388
00:37:15,797 --> 00:37:23,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we need to require that all parents attend a meeting prior to children going, not just get the paperwork home.

389
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for future reference, so parents get it.

390
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:35,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they do meet, but I want them to really understand all of the things.

391
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:36,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you go to a prior meeting?

392
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I did go to a prior meeting.

393
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,191
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

394
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:40,692
[SPEAKER_13]: There have always been.

395
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:55,756
It was more of packing and being prepared.

396
00:37:55,796 --> 00:38:02,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have more staff separately as parents to ensure that they have an option to take up their own insurance on this trip.

397
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:14,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's something that you can work out on your own, especially because 100% of the funds came from the parents who were several fundraisers.

398
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:17,168
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was a lot of finances involved.

399
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:27,741
[SPEAKER_13]: but the teachers and the students did all of that, all the hard work.

400
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:31,342
[SPEAKER_13]: The parents did the dipping into their pockets.

401
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:43,826
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the day, it was so much excitement for such a great opportunity for these kids, something that MedFed hasn't had before, especially in high school.

402
00:38:43,846 --> 00:38:48,427
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of universities have taken trips like this, but not high school, so this would have been the day first.

403
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we talked about on that evening,

404
00:38:51,518 --> 00:38:57,659
[SPEAKER_05]: about the possibility of the children Skyping in to some of the things that were happening at the event.

405
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Did any of that take place?

406
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know?

407
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:18,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

408
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:21,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at least glad that they got that opportunity.

409
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:25,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe there is some more local opportunities that we can provide for them.

410
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:34,937
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm at least glad that they got that, because it would have been very disappointing to me if they didn't get anything that week when they were so excited about this trip.

411
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:40,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So the students themselves were very active about stating the pledge to do something.

412
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:48,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I want to see, children advocating for what they need and what they were hoping to get, because that's what we raised them to do.

413
00:39:49,216 --> 00:39:50,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really happy.

414
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:51,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with my colleague.

415
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:56,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that, I think this was an extenuating situation.

416
00:39:56,524 --> 00:40:00,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe us helping out in this one time,

417
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,758
[SPEAKER_05]: is appropriate at 50%.

418
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I also believe that we need to tell future parents about this situation that came about, and that the school committee will not be in the same position to help parents out financially.

419
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:29,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So I second the motion that's on the floor to have us pay for 50% at this time, and just to make sure that after a trip is canceled, maybe they have a follow up meeting.

420
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:34,526
[SPEAKER_05]: just to go over with the parents, OK, we're sorry this didn't happen.

421
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:36,186
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what's happening now.

422
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:39,088
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to contact the insurance company.

423
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:40,048
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how you do it.

424
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,809
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the contact information.

425
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:48,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe a follow-up meeting would have been helpful, rather than just a call about the cancellation.

426
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:49,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my suggestions.

427
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:50,673
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I'm at.

428
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:58,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry it was canceled for the students, but I hope that the little that they did get brought them some joy and happiness.

429
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:58,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

430
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:00,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

431
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:04,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno, just a couple of clarifications I'd like to ask you.

432
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:09,899
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you said that the students were the ones that filled out the insurance forms, but didn't you have to sign them?

433
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:11,500
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

434
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,600
[SPEAKER_13]: They were submitted to the insurance agency without a parent's signature.

435
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:15,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Without a parent's signature?

436
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:22,464
[SPEAKER_13]: I sent a digital copy of what the insurance form looked like, and it was only my daughter's name there.

437
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,545
[SPEAKER_13]: My signature was not on it.

438
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:29,367
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason I ask is because, actually, two of my sons just went on a school trip.

439
00:41:30,102 --> 00:41:37,446
[SPEAKER_15]: And we went through everything, and they filled out a lot of the forms, but everything came back to us because everything had to be signed by us.

440
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:43,670
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's very unusual that an insurance is bought and paid for without a signature on the form.

441
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,191
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I was asking that question.

442
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:46,351
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was one.

443
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:49,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Two, this isn't a solution.

444
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:50,414
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just only a suggestion.

445
00:41:56,117 --> 00:42:02,278
[SPEAKER_15]: a past president of what's called the Massachusetts Association of School Committee members, we do have the Day on the Hill.

446
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:12,060
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the past, the Day on the Hill down at the Statehouse in Boston, and in the past, we have been able to bring students with us from the high school to the Statehouse.

447
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,741
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a day that we go and we advocate.

448
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:18,461
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost like a miniature day of the day in Washington.

449
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:21,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a day that we go and we advocate with our legislators.

450
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:25,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could work something out maybe with our students,

451
00:42:26,624 --> 00:42:51,446
[SPEAKER_15]: And bring the students that were supposed to go on that trip and bring them down to the statehouse that day I could help facilitate and bringing them to the legislators that day and have them represent the school while we're there and also work something out with them ASC and We could work something out in that way and not to discourage or try to cover anything up I have gone to DC probably for the last

452
00:42:51,996 --> 00:42:53,237
[SPEAKER_15]: eight years to advocate.

453
00:42:54,117 --> 00:43:01,160
[SPEAKER_15]: And even though we are supposed to be sitting down with our congressmen and women, there's a lot of times that we sit down with their staff.

454
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:08,824
[SPEAKER_15]: So please let the students know that just because they Skyped with their staff member, it didn't necessarily mean it was because they Skyped.

455
00:43:09,224 --> 00:43:13,006
[SPEAKER_15]: It could have been that they could have sat down with that person, too, if they had gone in person.

456
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:14,907
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's just a suggestion.

457
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I was throwing it out there.

458
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:19,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we could do that in compensating

459
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:25,350
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe for the money, again, only a suggestion.

460
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:29,433
[SPEAKER_15]: To bring 32 students down to Boston, we're gonna need a bus.

461
00:43:29,993 --> 00:43:35,697
[SPEAKER_15]: So instead of maybe reimbursing the money for the trip, maybe we could cover the bus.

462
00:43:36,378 --> 00:43:37,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Only a suggestion to throw out there.

463
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:46,365
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think it would be something that maybe we shouldn't go ahead and vote on tonight, but maybe have Ms.

464
00:43:46,385 --> 00:43:51,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Valdez bring that back to the students and to the parents and see if that's what they wanna do.

465
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:56,606
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion on the floor by Ms.

466
00:43:56,646 --> 00:44:02,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot to reimburse 50%, approximately $115, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

467
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:04,534
[SPEAKER_06]: The money paper.

468
00:44:08,057 --> 00:44:08,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

469
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:08,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

470
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:18,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it makes sense to go ahead and vote on this tonight and not hold it, because I think it would be a wonderful thing for the kids to go down to the day on the hill.

471
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:22,974
[SPEAKER_11]: it's certainly not going to cost that much for a bus.

472
00:44:23,614 --> 00:44:28,656
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it is there a bus, I think that's something that, you know, the school department can cover.

473
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:39,160
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that we go ahead and vote for the refund to the parents and while at the same time trying to ensure the kids have that opportunity.

474
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote.

475
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:42,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry, please call the roll.

476
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:43,181
[SPEAKER_12]: $115 each.

477
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:00,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can have that.

478
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

479
00:45:13,448 --> 00:45:20,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we could just enter into the record that this is a one time agreement on the motion that was approved.

480
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Good work.

481
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:28,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any other community participation before us this evening?

482
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:28,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

483
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:32,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Villanduclut, did you want to make an announcement on an upcoming event?

484
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:46,400
[SPEAKER_11]: In a past event, I had the opportunity, as did the mayor, to attend on Friday morning the high school candidates forum, where our students portrayed the different candidates.

485
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,261
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so exceptional.

486
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:50,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I really wish all of you had been able to make it.

487
00:45:50,503 --> 00:45:51,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it was just one of those.

488
00:45:51,904 --> 00:45:53,405
[SPEAKER_11]: The kids did such a great job.

489
00:45:55,228 --> 00:46:01,451
[SPEAKER_11]: members from the League of Women Voters there, and I kept on glancing over at them as they were historically falling off their seats.

490
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:08,795
[SPEAKER_11]: The kids did such a great job impersonating, knowing the candidates' positions, and going back and forth.

491
00:46:08,815 --> 00:46:19,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, it's been such a highly unusual year in some ways that it certainly lent itself to a fabulous presentation, and our students just did us really proud.

492
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:20,802
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a lot of fun.

493
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:21,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

494
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:27,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only did they know the facts and where each candidate stood, but they took on their persona and it was amazing.

495
00:46:27,592 --> 00:46:28,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it could have been theater.

496
00:46:28,832 --> 00:46:29,933
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really good.

497
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:30,814
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a great job.

498
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,715
[SPEAKER_06]: So kudos to the kids and Ms.

499
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:33,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Queza had a role in that.

500
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:38,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe Mr. Milne.

501
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Milne as well.

502
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations to all that participated.

503
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:48,790
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam Mayor, we'll provide the committee with a disc so you can play it over and over again.

504
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Who won?

505
00:46:50,552 --> 00:46:51,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

506
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:53,575
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a vote taken at the very end.

507
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:53,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we know?

508
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:57,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Bernie won.

509
00:46:57,699 --> 00:46:58,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Bernie won.

510
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,400
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

511
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,204
[SPEAKER_10]: See how he does tomorrow.

512
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:04,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any other community participation before us this evening?

513
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:05,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none.

514
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:09,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Report of the superintendent.

515
00:47:09,414 --> 00:47:12,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Recommendation to accept gifts to McGlynn Elementary School.

516
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:13,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

517
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:19,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, the principal of the McGlynn Elementary is here and Diane Caldwell is here as well.

518
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:20,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us this report.

519
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to call Diane Garino, the principal of the McGlynn Elementary up.

520
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:39,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And before she speaks, I just want to say what a collaborative effort it is on the part of our parents to provide the McGlynn Elementary and other elementary schools with donations and gifts and want it to remain anonymous.

521
00:47:40,063 --> 00:47:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to that, the McGlynn Elementary School also won a Medford Arts Council Award.

522
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like Diane to do some explaining.

523
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:50,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Ms.

524
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:50,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Green.

525
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:51,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, and good evening.

526
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:58,952
[SPEAKER_00]: The McGlynn Elementary School has been given a $600 donation from one of our families who wish to remain anonymous.

527
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:04,380
[SPEAKER_00]: This money is to be used for McGlynn events, assemblies, guest speakers, and performances.

528
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,006
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used to pay for buses for field trips that are planned throughout the year.

529
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:19,817
[SPEAKER_00]: The Medford Arts Council has awarded our school a $300 grant for the performance of Dance Caliente, a performance by Eileen Herman Hess and Raul Neves.

530
00:48:20,437 --> 00:48:27,166
[SPEAKER_00]: This performance will consist of several Latin dancers, followed by a brief talk of the geographical background of each dance.

531
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,922
[SPEAKER_00]: and a participatory lesson of the music, rhythms, and movements of the dances.

532
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:39,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Second grade students and teachers will be able to practice these dance moves on the stage at the end of the presentation.

533
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:45,209
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fine example of how students can increase cultural awareness and diversity.

534
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:51,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And on behalf of the McGlynn staff and students, I would like to thank these people for their generosity.

535
00:48:53,145 --> 00:48:53,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

536
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:58,326
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion for approval on the floor by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

537
00:48:58,346 --> 00:48:58,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot.

538
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:03,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Skerry, roll call vote.

539
00:49:08,848 --> 00:49:10,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

540
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The donation is accepted.

541
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:15,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we could send a letter to this anonymous person thanking them.

542
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at Mr. Superintendent.

543
00:49:19,176 --> 00:49:23,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Report on professional development day, March 1st, 2016.

544
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:23,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow.

545
00:49:24,057 --> 00:49:28,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, as you know, tomorrow is a professional development day.

546
00:49:28,558 --> 00:49:31,639
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no school for students at the schools tomorrow.

547
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:36,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So turn it over to our deputy and assistant superintendents to provide this report.

548
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

549
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:45,921
[SPEAKER_09]: As the superintendent said, tomorrow is our second full day of mandated professional development for teachers.

550
00:49:46,922 --> 00:49:48,622
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot planned.

551
00:49:49,173 --> 00:49:58,195
[SPEAKER_09]: We've enclosed a sheet that kind of gives you a snapshot of all of the various programs that are going on throughout the district.

552
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:09,238
[SPEAKER_09]: These programs were developed based on teacher input, administrative input, and some of the initiatives that we are currently undertaking in the district.

553
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:14,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, Diane and I worked collaboratively with this, a lot of details to work out.

554
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:19,000
[SPEAKER_09]: We're very excited to welcome our teachers tomorrow.

555
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:22,522
[SPEAKER_09]: to what we feel will be a very exciting and productive day.

556
00:50:23,343 --> 00:50:33,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, Diane, if you want to say anything else, but basically I think you have everything in front of you in terms of the programs, so you may have some questions on specific programs that we'd be more than glad to answer.

557
00:50:34,368 --> 00:50:35,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Diane, if you wanted to add anything.

558
00:50:36,749 --> 00:50:42,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can tell by our report, the elementary teachers and paraprofessionals will be

559
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:50,741
[SPEAKER_02]: going to the Brooks and the McGlynn Elementary Schools, they are aware of the parking situation because it is a primary day.

560
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:56,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a round-robin fast day ready for our elementary staff.

561
00:50:57,406 --> 00:51:09,075
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be workshops on energizers, on inclusion and differentiated instruction, managing behaviors, a lot of special education, and I know the Midland High School will be doing that as well.

562
00:51:09,715 --> 00:51:11,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're happy to answer any questions this evening.

563
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:22,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to add, the theme for the high school vocational school and McGlynn Middle School is on inclusive teaching.

564
00:51:22,722 --> 00:51:27,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just about special education students or ELL students, but all of our students.

565
00:51:27,743 --> 00:51:40,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have some wonderful consultants coming in, Seaside Consultants, who have arranged for round-robin workshops that are dealing with different inclusive practices so that we can make sure that all of our students

566
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:48,160
[SPEAKER_09]: are well served with some of these new ideas and practices that they can add to their toolkits.

567
00:51:48,681 --> 00:52:07,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, the only, the Andrews decided to have its own professional development workshop at the Andrews because they are the one school that will be administering the PARCC exam with the computerized version, and they felt the teachers needed the time to work on that to get the kids ready for that version.

568
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,851
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why the Andrews is not in the mix with the whole group.

569
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:21,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd just like to take a moment to, and I know Beverly would too, to thank all of the principals because at the elementary level, Diane Guarino and Kathy Kay will be doing a workshop and

570
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin Andrews will be doing a workshop with Suzanne Galussi.

571
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:31,225
[SPEAKER_02]: So our principals are really stepping up to help us out.

572
00:52:31,825 --> 00:52:41,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to that, my administrative assistant, Michelle Bissell, has just gone above and beyond to get everybody prepared for this day.

573
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:43,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that Jeannie Gliona has as well.

574
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:45,277
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll be at it six with me tomorrow.

575
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:46,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

576
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:48,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

577
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there parking set aside at each of the elementary schools for voters?

578
00:52:52,892 --> 00:52:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only two elementary schools we'll be using is the McGlynn and the Brooks Elementary School.

579
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:07,802
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked our staff to park at Hormel Stadium or in the back of the McGlynn Elementary School so that voters can have that front area.

580
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:15,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also told Brooks to do on-street parking or in the back parking lot.

581
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:19,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So where will voters park?

582
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:21,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually people vote park

583
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,952
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a stretch along the side.

584
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:28,194
[SPEAKER_11]: That will be open?

585
00:53:28,894 --> 00:53:29,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

586
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:29,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

587
00:53:29,795 --> 00:53:29,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

588
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:30,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

589
00:53:32,237 --> 00:53:32,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

590
00:53:32,878 --> 00:53:35,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to accept the report in place on file?

591
00:53:36,441 --> 00:53:37,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved by Ms.

592
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:39,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Ms.

593
00:53:39,163 --> 00:53:39,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz.

594
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:40,084
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

595
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:41,285
[SPEAKER_06]: All opposed?

596
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:42,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper is accepted.

597
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:46,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Report on Parent-Child Home Program.

598
00:53:47,108 --> 00:54:00,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, the Parent Child Home Program has been with us for several years, but it's one of those programs that sometimes is not as well advertised or known among our early childhood initiatives.

599
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:02,791
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a very important program.

600
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:12,473
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a program that sends home visitors, trained home visitors, into the homes of some of our least economically well-off individuals.

601
00:54:13,098 --> 00:54:22,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And it works with parents and children, building opportunities for those parents to learn how to use materials, toys, to educate their children.

602
00:54:23,505 --> 00:54:35,053
[SPEAKER_10]: We sometimes forget that when we have our own children, we're able to provide them with things and show them how to use educational materials or do an activity with them, that not all people have been trained to be parents.

603
00:54:35,634 --> 00:54:41,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And not all people know how to use educational materials or how to actually grow a youngster and grow together.

604
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And this program is a very successful program.

605
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:47,492
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a nationally researched model, evidence-based.

606
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:52,893
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a program at the State House the other day, which I was fortunate to speak on a national level.

607
00:54:53,973 --> 00:55:00,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Each family that's involved receives 92 hours of home visiting over a two-year period.

608
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:05,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have 28 families right now who are participating with us.

609
00:55:05,257 --> 00:55:06,397
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have a lot of information.

610
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:10,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to go over it right now, but I'll be happy to answer any questions that you have.

611
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:25,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a terrific program, people are really good and we've seen a lot of progress in youngsters who have come from this program moving along to the family network and then all the way up into the elementary schools and along the way.

612
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:32,122
[SPEAKER_10]: We sometimes take it for granted that when a youngster comes to us, they all have the same background, that's not true.

613
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:37,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Some youngsters come to us in kindergarten with 1,500 words, and some come to us with 500 words.

614
00:55:37,706 --> 00:55:38,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a real difference.

615
00:55:39,307 --> 00:55:41,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't know how to play, and they don't know how to use materials.

616
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:43,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

617
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Mestone, how are the parents identified?

618
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:49,173
[SPEAKER_10]: We generally work with schools.

619
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:53,435
[SPEAKER_10]: We work with the transitional assistance bureaus.

620
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:59,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And we try to find people through our various voucher programs and the like to identify those people.

621
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:01,400
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're always looking for people.

622
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:02,688
[SPEAKER_10]: who want to participate.

623
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:05,971
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you've got some good people, we're interested.

624
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:06,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

625
00:56:07,232 --> 00:56:07,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

626
00:56:07,693 --> 00:56:10,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to Ms.

627
00:56:10,556 --> 00:56:10,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz?

628
00:56:11,797 --> 00:56:23,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually went online to, there was a video that you could watch online and it was really, it was a great video and it showed, you know, one of the representatives going into a home and teaching the parent how to read to their student.

629
00:56:24,472 --> 00:56:27,714
[SPEAKER_08]: and going back again and putting a puzzle together.

630
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:30,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really sweet.

631
00:56:30,235 --> 00:56:33,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm really proud that Nedra is part of this program.

632
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:42,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's any way that, because I know they're very low-income families, with their incomes are so low, like $20,000, some are $10,000.

633
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:46,084
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's any way that we could donate

634
00:56:48,362 --> 00:56:50,864
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, jackets or hats or clothing.

635
00:56:50,904 --> 00:57:01,571
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'd be interested in that, you know, just from things that I have left over from my son and even some toys, you know, because, you know, it was, you know, I was really surprised at how low the incomes were, you know.

636
00:57:02,412 --> 00:57:06,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you could let us know, you know, even like adult clothing, you know, for the parents.

637
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:12,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Every year around the holidays, we conduct a drive.

638
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:17,703
[SPEAKER_10]: We took care of about 30 families with all kinds of materials and the like every year.

639
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:22,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the VOC does a food drive, and some of the other places do food drives, and the like.

640
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,953
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's always in season to find a way to help families.

641
00:57:27,593 --> 00:57:31,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe the schools do a pretty good job doing that, because they know the youngsters very well.

642
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:34,757
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll tell you a story that goes back a long way.

643
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:40,300
[SPEAKER_10]: But there was a teacher who saw that a little girl in her classroom didn't have any gloves.

644
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So the little girl was very proud.

645
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:45,802
[SPEAKER_10]: She didn't want to just give her gloves.

646
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,071
[SPEAKER_10]: because I thought I was taking charity.

647
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:52,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So she planted some gloves in the closet.

648
00:57:53,193 --> 00:57:57,054
[SPEAKER_10]: And when the kids were putting their clothes on, she says, whose gloves are these?

649
00:57:57,535 --> 00:57:58,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And no one put their hands up.

650
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:04,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And a little girl who didn't have the gloves kind of looked at him and said, well, if no one wants them, maybe you could use them.

651
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:07,359
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she'll show you what our teachers do.

652
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:14,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really quite remarkable how they find ways to not embarrass a youngster, but at the same time, find ways to help them.

653
00:58:14,723 --> 00:58:17,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that there's a lot of private giving

654
00:58:17,988 --> 00:58:20,929
[SPEAKER_10]: that goes on outside of our regular official channels.

655
00:58:21,389 --> 00:58:23,130
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is a great program.

656
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,010
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a program that makes a difference.

657
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,851
[SPEAKER_10]: It also is a very important part of child abuse prevention.

658
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:33,893
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are several other programs like it, but this is a particular type of program.

659
00:58:34,653 --> 00:58:41,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're going to see some things coming from the Children's Trust in the next little while as well that will reemphasize this area.

660
00:58:42,112 --> 00:58:42,532
[SPEAKER_10]: as well.

661
00:58:42,572 --> 00:58:46,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a great program and it's important that you know about it.

662
00:58:46,373 --> 00:58:52,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you know of families that are in need, we certainly are looking, uh, and we keep looking for money.

663
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:59,278
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a woman in the audience at the state house the other day who, uh, had just given $150,000 to the program.

664
00:58:59,878 --> 00:59:01,198
[SPEAKER_10]: She heard about it.

665
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,579
[SPEAKER_10]: She came and she just, she and her husband wrote a check for $150,000.

666
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:04,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Incredible.

667
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:11,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Ms.

668
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:12,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz, seconded by Ms.

669
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:12,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Vandekloot.

670
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:13,632
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

671
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:14,873
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

672
00:59:15,854 --> 00:59:16,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper is received.

673
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:19,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Report on proposed closing of St.

674
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:21,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Clements Elementary School.

675
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

676
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,783
[SPEAKER_10]: So the pastor of St.

677
00:59:23,803 --> 00:59:28,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Clements Elementary School has indicated that it's not sustainable going forward beyond this year.

678
00:59:30,098 --> 00:59:33,160
[SPEAKER_10]: We have about 21 students there that would be there next year.

679
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,782
[SPEAKER_10]: We think they would be there if they were to continue.

680
00:59:36,382 --> 00:59:37,963
[SPEAKER_10]: But class size there is very low.

681
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:43,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And while there are parents who would like to keep it open, I'm not sure it's economically sustainable.

682
00:59:44,107 --> 00:59:47,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to pass judgment on whether it is or it isn't or what's going to happen there.

683
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:54,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is important for us to anticipate the possibility of some of these youngsters wanting to come to our schools.

684
00:59:54,154 --> 00:59:55,595
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to outreach to them.

685
00:59:56,895 --> 01:00:02,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them may want to go to the other parochial schools that are in our area, some in Somerville, some here or in Arlington.

686
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:05,718
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of them may also want to go to charter schools.

687
01:00:06,378 --> 01:00:12,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And while I'm not going to rail against charters in any way, shape, or form, I'm just going to say that if they go there, it costs us money.

688
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:23,243
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just as soon like to be in a situation where we offer people a chance to view our schools, to see the Columbus in that area, and potentially

689
01:00:24,794 --> 01:00:27,676
[SPEAKER_10]: come to our schools if that's a choice they would like to make.

690
01:00:28,156 --> 01:00:31,138
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want you to be aware that we will outreach to St.

691
01:00:31,158 --> 01:00:36,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Clement's and we will do our best to sensitively ask people if we can be of help.

692
01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:38,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

693
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:38,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

694
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:44,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Through you to the superintendent, in which way, in what ways are we going to try to outreach to them?

695
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:49,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to try to find out in which district they go to?

696
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:53,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we going to ask them to come and visit our school system?

697
01:00:53,758 --> 01:00:57,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Diane is working on that.

698
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually had this discussion today.

699
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:04,943
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would like to do is find out the names of the families.

700
01:01:05,523 --> 01:01:06,903
[SPEAKER_02]: who are currently at St.

701
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Clements and will be looking for another place to go.

702
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:22,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And arrange to have a meeting at the high school and then maybe over at our elementary schools so that they can take a tour of the buildings, meet the different principals, learn about our curriculum and the specific programs that we have.

703
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:29,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to do that as soon as possible because I don't want families to be looking at other schools.

704
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:31,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be looking into that for the month of March.

705
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:33,768
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's a great idea.

706
01:01:33,788 --> 01:01:38,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the personal touch is the best that possibly could be done.

707
01:01:38,409 --> 01:01:50,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And just giving them that opportunity of being welcomed to the school and showing them the school that their children would be going at, rather than just a letter stating, this is where you'd be going.

708
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:51,652
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's great.

709
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:52,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

710
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:52,633
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

711
01:01:53,273 --> 01:01:53,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

712
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

713
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:57,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to comment.

714
01:01:57,962 --> 01:01:58,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I graduated from St.

715
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Clemens, so I know a lot of the alumni.

716
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:06,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there is a push to try to raise funds to keep the school open.

717
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:10,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they're doing fundraising and other things.

718
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:17,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how successful it will be, but I just wanted you to at least have that information.

719
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:25,925
[SPEAKER_05]: They are keeping their preschool open, and they are keeping their high school open at this point.

720
01:02:26,645 --> 01:02:31,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that it's going to be hard for them not to have those schools.

721
01:02:31,588 --> 01:02:39,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think part of it is because we're doing such a wonderful job in here, in Medford, that a lot of those children have already come back to the school district.

722
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:50,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to welcome them as well as we can, but I also want to be sensitive that we don't want to rush them out if there is a play for them to stay open.

723
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:54,551
[SPEAKER_10]: And we want to appreciate their wishes and their sensitivities.

724
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:58,575
[SPEAKER_10]: On the other hand, we also want to make sure that they know they have an option if they want it.

725
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:00,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

726
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:04,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to receive and place on file?

727
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:04,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Ms.

728
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

729
01:03:07,552 --> 01:03:08,313
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

730
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

731
01:03:09,314 --> 01:03:09,954
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

732
01:03:10,014 --> 01:03:10,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

733
01:03:11,415 --> 01:03:13,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Report on Chamber of Commerce meeting.

734
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:22,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam members of the committee, several of you were able to attend the Chamber of Commerce luncheon with the vocational school and the high school the other day.

735
01:03:22,483 --> 01:03:25,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was a very successful event, there were over 25 people from

736
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,893
[SPEAKER_10]: various businesses and entities in the city.

737
01:03:29,993 --> 01:03:35,054
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to many of our own staff, over 40 people, uh, the report is in front of you.

738
01:03:35,114 --> 01:03:55,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to read every word because I think, you know, uh, what was there, except to say that we think it's a win win situation, opportunity for us to showcase, uh, the kinds of programs and activities that we have and, and our, and make that strong offer that we want to partner more and more with, uh, the community, uh, to ensure that, uh,

739
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:03,795
[SPEAKER_10]: The community has access to our youngsters who are trained to do certain things, and our youngsters have access to jobs that might be within the community.

740
01:04:04,336 --> 01:04:07,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I know in talking to several of the individuals who were there, they were very excited about it.

741
01:04:08,359 --> 01:04:11,221
[SPEAKER_10]: It gave us an opportunity to showcase some things at the vocational school.

742
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:17,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It allowed us to talk a little bit about our program to work with youngsters who are disabled and who are looking for an opportunity to do.

743
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:22,043
[SPEAKER_10]: something, even if it's only part-time, to help them build their confidence as well.

744
01:04:22,784 --> 01:04:25,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it was a great meeting.

745
01:04:25,064 --> 01:04:26,165
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good time.

746
01:04:26,225 --> 01:04:32,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those people that went there really got a kick out of the good food that was put out by the Culinary Arts Department.

747
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:36,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd be happy to take any questions you have, rather than try to go through it.

748
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:37,509
[SPEAKER_10]: But several of you were there.

749
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:39,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I could.

750
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:40,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

751
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:40,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

752
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:41,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

753
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And if elected, I want to make mental training.

754
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:45,872
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could, from the chair.

755
01:04:48,223 --> 01:04:49,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, really.

756
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:50,884
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all doing these Freudian slips.

757
01:04:50,924 --> 01:04:53,345
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with that?

758
01:04:53,425 --> 01:04:57,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say what a great afternoon it was.

759
01:04:57,886 --> 01:05:03,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got to see Miss Kreatz, who was featured in the video for the vocational school, and her son Noah.

760
01:05:04,328 --> 01:05:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: But the school department did a fabulous job.

761
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:07,949
[SPEAKER_06]: That video is wonderful.

762
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just very eye-opening.

763
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully the community feels

764
01:05:13,487 --> 01:05:16,149
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the great programming that is offered up there.

765
01:05:16,189 --> 01:05:17,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that, I know Ms.

766
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Riccio is doing a fabulous job, but we need to really get the word out.

767
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:27,436
[SPEAKER_06]: On that end, Mr. Klein's program for internships and co-ops, and also lots of other things that the school department is doing.

768
01:05:27,536 --> 01:05:30,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Great stories are happening within those walls.

769
01:05:30,738 --> 01:05:31,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

770
01:05:31,939 --> 01:05:34,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

771
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:34,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Cugno.

772
01:05:36,817 --> 01:05:42,762
[SPEAKER_15]: I unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to go to the school, but I am thrilled.

773
01:05:44,283 --> 01:05:50,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Because for the last year and a half, actually, I've been speaking to Janet Donnelly, who is the director of the chamber.

774
01:05:50,408 --> 01:05:57,454
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was something that I really felt needed to be done for our community, and I'm really happy that it's finally being done.

775
01:05:57,974 --> 01:06:00,056
[SPEAKER_15]: As the superintendent, as the mayor said,

776
01:06:00,576 --> 01:06:02,137
[SPEAKER_15]: it's definitely a win-win situation.

777
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:21,870
[SPEAKER_15]: It gives the opportunity for our students to go out there and work in our community, but give them the opportunity to work in the fields that they're thinking of maybe going into, but also giving the community, the business community, the sense of what type of students we have and, you know, making, giving them pride of what we have.

778
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:27,754
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I was concerned about, and I know that I've spoken to Amelia Westmark about this, and I have spoken to

779
01:06:28,244 --> 01:06:28,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

780
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:41,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Donnelly about this is that I'd like for our students to work in the businesses, but I also want to make sure that we don't take advantage of students, that everything isn't always done just in internship.

781
01:06:42,015 --> 01:06:52,143
[SPEAKER_15]: If we see that our students are really working in these businesses and they're thriving, is that the businesses will stop paying our students too.

782
01:06:52,203 --> 01:06:55,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Years ago, we had work-study at the high school.

783
01:06:56,006 --> 01:06:57,967
[SPEAKER_15]: We had open campus, which I'm not going for.

784
01:06:57,987 --> 01:06:59,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want open campus.

785
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:02,288
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do know that we did a new work study.

786
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:06,210
[SPEAKER_15]: And our work study was that we did get jobs, and then we got paid for them.

787
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:13,572
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just absolutely thrilled that we're giving our students this opportunity and that our businesses are seeing what our students are all about.

788
01:07:13,652 --> 01:07:15,333
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm really happy about this.

789
01:07:15,753 --> 01:07:18,476
[SPEAKER_06]: both the food and the students served us as well.

790
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:19,697
[SPEAKER_06]: They were excellent.

791
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:22,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Very well-mannered and polite and did a good job.

792
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval to receive and place on file?

793
01:07:25,983 --> 01:07:26,724
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

794
01:07:26,984 --> 01:07:27,585
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

795
01:07:27,605 --> 01:07:28,406
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

796
01:07:29,126 --> 01:07:30,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Financial report.

797
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:32,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, can I jump in first?

798
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:32,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

799
01:07:33,702 --> 01:07:35,363
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a great announcement to make.

800
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:36,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

801
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:43,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Bailey, our finance director, has been awarded a certified administrator of school finance and operations.

802
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:45,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations, Pat.

803
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So Pat really worked hard on this.

804
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:54,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Not everybody has this.

805
01:07:54,391 --> 01:07:57,353
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just a license to be a school business administrator.

806
01:07:57,813 --> 01:07:58,873
[SPEAKER_10]: It's above and beyond.

807
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:02,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're very fortunate to have Pat doing a great job

808
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to tell you just how well we're doing financially.

809
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:07,341
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very lucky to have you.

810
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:08,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

811
01:08:08,341 --> 01:08:09,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Vanderclue, did you want to jump in?

812
01:08:09,741 --> 01:08:13,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I did because, you know, it doesn't surprise us because Pat goes above and beyond for everything she does.

813
01:08:13,942 --> 01:08:14,922
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very, very lucky.

814
01:08:15,402 --> 01:08:16,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we are.

815
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I'm embarrassed.

816
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:29,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're about 65% expended, which is right on target for this time of year.

817
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:30,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we have,

818
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:34,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, payrolls are right on time, where we should be.

819
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:38,016
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one teacher on maternity leave and with five others pending.

820
01:08:38,797 --> 01:08:41,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We're slowing down just a little bit this year, so it's kind of nice to see.

821
01:08:43,522 --> 01:08:49,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The Governor's budget update, the budget doesn't appear to project much change for us.

822
01:08:49,784 --> 01:09:04,629
[SPEAKER_03]: A big change is coming in the kindergarten grant and we just heard the first of the news today and that they are going to gear a portion of that grant towards schools that do not ask for tuition for kindergartens and they're going to use that money for other purposes.

823
01:09:04,649 --> 01:09:06,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a first come first serve basis.

824
01:09:07,328 --> 01:09:11,050
[SPEAKER_03]: So the superintendent is aware, as is the assistant superintendent.

825
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:13,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be acting on that.

826
01:09:14,272 --> 01:09:17,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the information is not real clear at this time.

827
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:20,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Heating of buildings, it's been warm.

828
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:23,538
[SPEAKER_03]: We're 13% below and less therms than we were a year ago.

829
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:26,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And overall, about 20% for the year.

830
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:27,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

831
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time I look at it, I'm nervous.

832
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:35,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like, so our February, we did run the heat through a couple weekends.

833
01:09:35,975 --> 01:09:48,302
[SPEAKER_03]: that were exceptionally cold to try and minimize any maintenance damage, and we were able to do that, except for one thing that happened, and that was the very expensive water heater that went at the McGlynn, and that was $52,000.

834
01:09:51,138 --> 01:09:54,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Unemployment is at 55,671.

835
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:55,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Our projection is still 75,000.

836
01:09:55,943 --> 01:10:01,428
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no new prior employees, and the current list really should start to diminish.

837
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:04,411
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had two snow days, February 5th and 8th.

838
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Projected last day is now June 20th.

839
01:10:09,516 --> 01:10:14,600
[SPEAKER_03]: The snowless February allowed for a lot of painting, ceiling replacement in the A wing.

840
01:10:14,621 --> 01:10:15,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks lovely.

841
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:16,102
[SPEAKER_03]: You should take a look.

842
01:10:16,865 --> 01:10:18,927
[SPEAKER_03]: and some deep cleaning in other building areas.

843
01:10:19,187 --> 01:10:24,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps when the guys and ladies are in the buildings and not outside shoveling.

844
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:26,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Professional development.

845
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not include this in there, but I know that will be of some concern.

846
01:10:29,656 --> 01:10:32,878
[SPEAKER_03]: The secretaries have kind of a different professional development this time.

847
01:10:33,959 --> 01:10:38,443
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first came on board a year and a half ago, I asked them to start working on procedure manuals.

848
01:10:39,212 --> 01:10:48,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that every one of their jobs has a, oh my gosh, what should happen if I can't come to work for four to six weeks and someone has to step up to my desk?

849
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:55,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So tomorrow I'm going to be out reviewing their manuals and they have a special little treat coming to them from WB Mason.

850
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:59,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I will provide food because you can't show up without food if you're from Michigan.

851
01:11:00,408 --> 01:11:05,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the budget year is progressing pretty much as planned and the expectation is the NPS

852
01:11:06,408 --> 01:11:09,349
[SPEAKER_03]: will complete the year as per the FY16 budget plan.

853
01:11:10,249 --> 01:11:10,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

854
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:10,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Gale.

855
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:11,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions?

856
01:11:14,811 --> 01:11:14,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

857
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,591
[SPEAKER_05]: DiBenedetto.

858
01:11:15,611 --> 01:11:16,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

859
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:18,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for a great report, Pat.

860
01:11:18,533 --> 01:11:26,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I just noticed, though, the building grounds in the athletic department, their totals are rising a little quicker than the rest of the district.

861
01:11:26,095 --> 01:11:28,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're at like 85% rather than 65%.

862
01:11:28,857 --> 01:11:32,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure we're on track and that, you know,

863
01:11:34,718 --> 01:11:38,402
[SPEAKER_05]: that they won't be over towards the end of the school year?

864
01:11:38,643 --> 01:11:41,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, as the superintendent will attest, it does tend to rise.

865
01:11:42,608 --> 01:11:49,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a lot of work in the summertime, so we actually start out a little bit behind as school starts, but those are our heavy work months.

866
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but the heating should assist in covering that.

867
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:53,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

868
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:54,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Just checking.

869
01:11:55,002 --> 01:12:02,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, um, just want to keep an eye on those, those line items and make sure that we don't have to pull funds from other areas for those.

870
01:12:02,604 --> 01:12:03,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

871
01:12:05,005 --> 01:12:08,886
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion to receive in place on file, authored by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

872
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:09,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

873
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:10,086
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

874
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

875
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:11,407
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

876
01:12:11,687 --> 01:12:12,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

877
01:12:13,436 --> 01:12:15,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two papers under suspension.

878
01:12:16,197 --> 01:12:20,738
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Mr. Skerry that the committee express its condolences to the family of Robert Drennan.

879
01:12:21,058 --> 01:12:24,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Drennan was a member of the Mefford High School football and baseball teams.

880
01:12:24,919 --> 01:12:31,780
[SPEAKER_06]: After Mefford High, Mr. Drennan continued his football career at Harvard and left to become a member of the Army's prestigious 10th Mountain Division.

881
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:40,242
[SPEAKER_06]: He was fluent in German and served as an interpreter when Patton's Army liberated Buchwald and Dachau, Concentra.

882
01:12:43,215 --> 01:12:45,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what they said.

883
01:12:45,838 --> 01:12:47,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Ten camps in World War II.

884
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,382
[SPEAKER_06]: He returned to Hobb and received a master's degree in engineering.

885
01:12:52,043 --> 01:12:56,727
[SPEAKER_06]: He leaves his sister, Anne, a former teacher at the Hobbs Junior High School and former member of the Medford School Committee.

886
01:12:58,048 --> 01:12:59,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Could all please rise for a moment of silence.

887
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,307
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Ms.

888
01:13:13,327 --> 01:13:33,074
[SPEAKER_06]: DiBenedetto, that all rental agreements and contracts for use of our high school batting cage gym fields be placed on hold until the school committee sets time, pricing, insurance, and other issues related to the use of these facilities can be determined.

889
01:13:33,772 --> 01:13:44,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to make a motion that the revenue received for all facilities be presented to the school committee on a quarterly basis in the same format the approval of bills, transfers of funds is presented.

890
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

891
01:13:46,182 --> 01:13:47,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

892
01:13:47,983 --> 01:13:51,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke to the superintendent about this this morning as well as the mayor.

893
01:13:51,466 --> 01:14:03,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It came to my attention through many phone calls in the last 24 hours that the company called the Middlesex Reds baseball organization

894
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:08,466
[SPEAKER_05]: were advertising on their website, and I want to read to you what they have.

895
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:11,588
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a quote from their website.

896
01:14:11,628 --> 01:14:22,614
[SPEAKER_05]: This past Sunday, February 21, the 13U and 17U junior reds held part of their practices inside the new batting cage facility located inside Medford High School.

897
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:32,980
[SPEAKER_05]: The teams had part of their practice take place in the inside the new facility while also taking advantage of the warm weather and using the turf fields behind Medford High School.

898
01:14:33,546 --> 01:14:44,350
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire program is excited about the new facility to go along with all the other amenities that is offered in and around Memphit High School that the Reds use as their home.

899
01:14:45,771 --> 01:15:03,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Facilities such as a large gymnasium that can hold 90 foot and 70 foot infield and two batting cages, two turf fields with lights, and now a brand new batting cage facility with three full-size tunnels and two smaller tunnels for short, soft toss drills.

900
01:15:03,654 --> 01:15:08,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Red staff will be looking to add programs for all ages in the new facility.

901
01:15:08,997 --> 01:15:12,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned to this site and on our Facebook page for updates.

902
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:22,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So not only did they use our facility without prior approval, they are calling it the home of the Middlesex Reds baseball organization.

903
01:15:23,003 --> 01:15:30,307
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to that, they did make some notification that they used some of our parks.

904
01:15:31,087 --> 01:15:32,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, um,

905
01:15:32,935 --> 01:15:35,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember exactly which park it might have been.

906
01:15:36,056 --> 01:15:37,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Morrissey Park?

907
01:15:38,017 --> 01:15:41,838
[SPEAKER_05]: They made comment of using that park as well.

908
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:51,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And then later, right before I left for school committee, I got another call that this company has been using our facility for the last four years.

909
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally don't know anything about it.

910
01:15:54,542 --> 01:15:57,283
[SPEAKER_05]: If this is a new contract, it hasn't been brought forward.

911
01:15:58,518 --> 01:16:00,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let the superintendent speak for himself.

912
01:16:00,878 --> 01:16:07,160
[SPEAKER_05]: When I saw this, I was really upset, because we haven't even let our own students use this facility yet.

913
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:12,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we want to look at maybe community teams using it prior to going out to companies.

914
01:16:12,921 --> 01:16:19,562
[SPEAKER_05]: This company advertises here a fee of $950, and I don't believe that's the whole fee for their season.

915
01:16:19,902 --> 01:16:22,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's just like a small fee for a small pot.

916
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:23,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure of that.

917
01:16:24,683 --> 01:16:25,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what.

918
01:16:26,183 --> 01:16:36,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't call them and ask them their pricing, but this is a for-profit company that's already been in our batting cages, according to them, prior to us even using them or cutting a ribbon to open them.

919
01:16:37,268 --> 01:16:40,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna pass the floor to the superintendent.

920
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:46,233
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what warranted those two motions that I just put onto the floor.

921
01:16:47,113 --> 01:16:47,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

922
01:16:48,234 --> 01:16:50,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so let me say that

923
01:16:51,751 --> 01:16:55,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I was as surprised as anyone else to find this out today.

924
01:16:57,833 --> 01:17:04,055
[SPEAKER_10]: This is totally unauthorized, and it's not something that I'm aware of or have been aware of.

925
01:17:05,076 --> 01:17:19,821
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I'm learning is I'm learning that sometimes our coaches make deals through their booster clubs and through their own activities that sometimes give preferential treatment to certain vendors as part of their own fundraising.

926
01:17:20,797 --> 01:17:31,560
[SPEAKER_10]: When someone uses our facilities, when someone uses our name, it needs to come through the appropriate channels of the public schools.

927
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:43,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Procurement regulations and the like mean that no one gets an advantage over anyone else when something like this is available.

928
01:17:44,304 --> 01:17:49,926
[SPEAKER_10]: So there may be multiple groups that would like to utilize our facilities.

929
01:17:50,858 --> 01:18:04,874
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, just the other day, when I toured the facility, I mentioned to the mayor that we need to sit down and discuss how the facility could be used.

930
01:18:05,702 --> 01:18:08,903
[SPEAKER_10]: by different groups that I was sure would be interested in using it.

931
01:18:09,624 --> 01:18:15,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew that our softball team and our baseball team would be definitively interested, and they needed to be given preference.

932
01:18:16,106 --> 01:18:31,012
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also knew there'd be other groups that would like to use it, and that we needed to set up a process, and we needed to set up a structure for fees and other considerations, maintenance and supervision, in order to go forward with that.

933
01:18:31,672 --> 01:18:33,233
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I learned of this this afternoon,

934
01:18:34,993 --> 01:18:44,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I was as angry as anybody, because I clearly felt that this was bypassing our normal, appropriate process.

935
01:18:46,502 --> 01:19:04,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I spoke to the director of athletics, and I let him know that I'm going to be meeting with the coaches, and no one is going to make any deal over any facility, over any program, under our control, unless we have an appropriate structure

936
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:07,116
[SPEAKER_10]: and is an appropriate process of procurement.

937
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:11,077
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I agree with you, it shouldn't have happened.

938
01:19:11,818 --> 01:19:23,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I've instructed Mr. Maloney to inform the individual has it up to take it down, and if it's not down, that individual will be barred by me from future activity.

939
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very upset about it.

940
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:32,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm upset about it because we need to ensure that we have proper liability,

941
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,938
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to ensure that we have proper coverage.

942
01:19:35,498 --> 01:19:49,911
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to make sure that the maintenance of that facility is well thought through, and that any revenue generated in that facility is properly placed and reutilized to maintain it and to further the programs that are under our direction.

943
01:19:51,052 --> 01:20:00,079
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't disagree, and I can assure you that we're going to go forward very quickly tomorrow to ensure that that's down.

944
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:04,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And the information is out there that an appropriate process will follow quickly.

945
01:20:05,521 --> 01:20:07,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, this thing's only been in place for a couple weeks.

946
01:20:08,322 --> 01:20:10,042
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only been set up recently.

947
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:15,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And I only had a chance to tour it the other day to make sure that I understood what was up there as well.

948
01:20:16,365 --> 01:20:17,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't disagree.

949
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:18,825
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll handle it.

950
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:22,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will bring it back to you so we can have an appropriate discussion.

951
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:24,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

952
01:20:25,426 --> 01:20:28,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like a report to the school committee about that meeting.

953
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:37,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also like an audit of all facilities, what we're renting them for, how much we're renting for, who's renting for them, how's the money getting brought to us.

954
01:20:37,676 --> 01:20:39,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I want an overview of all of it.

955
01:20:39,758 --> 01:20:50,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I also believe, and I'm sorry, but I know a lot of people aren't going to like this, but I really think that there needs to be a separation between our athletics and our community schools.

956
01:20:50,736 --> 01:20:55,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the athletic department should have to schedule things so that they're guaranteed their time.

957
01:20:55,899 --> 01:20:58,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the rental piece has to be handled separately.

958
01:20:59,441 --> 01:21:04,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that merging the two is not in the best interest.

959
01:21:04,963 --> 01:21:09,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are funds that are potential income that aren't

960
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,082
[SPEAKER_05]: being brought into the community, into the schools.

961
01:21:13,543 --> 01:21:17,025
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really want to look at that this year at our budget.

962
01:21:17,146 --> 01:21:24,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a cost to add a different person to take on, but it's two jobs, and it's two almost full-time jobs now.

963
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:27,574
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot more facilities than we used to throughout.

964
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:29,936
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the fields, we have the pool.

965
01:21:30,513 --> 01:21:32,555
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the new batting cages now.

966
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:42,523
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a lot to run and schedule and bring in those funds, as well as run the whole athletic department for the whole district, really.

967
01:21:44,277 --> 01:21:46,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's time for us to look at it.

968
01:21:47,578 --> 01:21:52,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about community schools, I've been asking about money coming in, how we're utilizing them.

969
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they could be utilized more, they could be open to the public more, more classes could be used.

970
01:21:57,402 --> 01:22:02,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can't have one person doing all of this work and expect it to be done.

971
01:22:02,762 --> 01:22:04,963
[SPEAKER_05]: to things not slip through.

972
01:22:05,323 --> 01:22:13,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's done an incredible job for our community, especially in all the years that we could not have running what we had.

973
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:23,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the men out in the fields chasing geese away to make sure that the kids didn't have a safe place to play at 6 in the morning when I used to walk the track.

974
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:26,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is a lot of work.

975
01:22:26,632 --> 01:22:28,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to look at this.

976
01:22:28,373 --> 01:22:32,615
[SPEAKER_05]: As a school committee, we need to look at this and make sure it's fair for everybody throughout the community.

977
01:22:32,954 --> 01:22:35,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And the use is for our students.

978
01:22:35,836 --> 01:22:39,719
[SPEAKER_05]: This place is called the Waltham Reds before.

979
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:41,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's the Middlesex Reds.

980
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,242
[SPEAKER_05]: They're based out of Waltham, but they're calling Method their home.

981
01:22:44,642 --> 01:22:47,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what else is going on that we don't know about?

982
01:22:47,564 --> 01:22:48,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to look at it.

983
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to have these answers.

984
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:51,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want them brought here.

985
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,449
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm requesting that audit to be completed.

986
01:22:55,349 --> 01:23:00,653
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously, we need a discussion about the organization of community schools and athletics.

987
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:03,137
[SPEAKER_10]: there's pros and cons to what you're suggesting.

988
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:06,718
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll have that discussion and we'll provide you with a full report.

989
01:23:07,098 --> 01:23:12,399
[SPEAKER_10]: We were planning to have a meeting on this anyway, but you know, with a changeover and everything else like that, we haven't gotten to it.

990
01:23:12,419 --> 01:23:17,960
[SPEAKER_10]: There've been other things that have taken our time, but we will have that meeting and we will move forward.

991
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,141
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want you to see it because I think it's massive.

992
01:23:21,681 --> 01:23:23,021
[SPEAKER_10]: There are other things that are coming up.

993
01:23:23,461 --> 01:23:27,682
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a discussion about the rink that's going to have to be discussed very soon because the,

994
01:23:28,924 --> 01:23:34,688
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, Department of Conservation and Recreation wants to turn it over to the city and there's some implications for that.

995
01:23:35,068 --> 01:23:40,371
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already do have it right now, but if we take full control, there's new expenses associated with that.

996
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:44,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, all these things need to come together as a full discussion.

997
01:23:44,574 --> 01:23:55,681
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, it's timely, but I think we should reserve judgment as to the best organizational arrangement, but that's a discussion that we can have and you have the right to make a decision.

998
01:23:56,061 --> 01:23:56,922
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go over.

999
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:05,451
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll move to set up something in the very near future that will allow us to have a productive and comprehensive discussion.

1000
01:24:06,612 --> 01:24:06,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1001
01:24:06,812 --> 01:24:07,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Conyo.

1002
01:24:08,713 --> 01:24:10,815
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to go back to what Erin said.

1003
01:24:10,895 --> 01:24:14,298
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, she mentioned something about this company using our fields.

1004
01:24:14,558 --> 01:24:22,804
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I understand that the baseball, the batting cages are new, but I mean, you read something about them using our fields for the last four years.

1005
01:24:23,685 --> 01:24:23,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Now,

1006
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:29,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Does Mr. Maloney know anything about them using our fields for the last four years?

1007
01:24:31,062 --> 01:24:32,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea that they were doing that.

1008
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:33,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know.

1009
01:24:33,983 --> 01:24:38,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, I mean, not for anything, but I remember distinctly sitting down.

1010
01:24:39,186 --> 01:24:46,129
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had numerous committees of the whole discussing the process, the structure, the fees of the structure.

1011
01:24:46,189 --> 01:24:47,550
[SPEAKER_15]: We sat down with Mr. Maloney.

1012
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:54,553
[SPEAKER_15]: We made sure that I remember this full discussion of making sure everything was going to be across the board.

1013
01:24:54,934 --> 01:24:57,455
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't want to give one organization

1014
01:24:58,375 --> 01:25:07,779
[SPEAKER_15]: One fee and another organization a different fee because we didn't want to start that game and now You know, we're sitting here saying four years later now.

1015
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:12,581
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know and I'm not blaming anybody I think I'm sorry.

1016
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:14,362
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know if that's the case on the field.

1017
01:25:14,382 --> 01:25:19,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's why I wanted to make sure I want to ask mr. Maloney or Let me say it this way.

1018
01:25:19,885 --> 01:25:25,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we have a number of organizations that support our athletic teams We certainly don't want to discourage them from supporting themselves

1019
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,682
[SPEAKER_10]: these various booster clubs, support groups, and the like.

1020
01:25:29,363 --> 01:25:39,232
[SPEAKER_10]: But they can't be making arrangements using our name and our facilities because they think that they have a privilege for a role to play.

1021
01:25:39,652 --> 01:25:42,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And coaches cannot make decisions for the school system.

1022
01:25:43,616 --> 01:25:48,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are too many situations like this that I'm becoming aware of that I don't like.

1023
01:25:49,401 --> 01:25:50,582
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's going to stop.

1024
01:25:51,343 --> 01:25:52,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And this just brings it to a head.

1025
01:25:53,598 --> 01:25:55,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll deal with it, and we'll deal with it effectively.

1026
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:05,487
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some discussions that were overreaching discussions about how we might be able to raise more money and do some things, but we left it strictly to the coaches and the athletic department to sort of pull it together.

1027
01:26:06,107 --> 01:26:08,108
[SPEAKER_10]: We never really finished off that discussion.

1028
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:09,630
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's time.

1029
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,571
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to make it happen.

1030
01:26:12,191 --> 01:26:17,515
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want to ever be in a situation like this where I have to stand here and tell you I don't know.

1031
01:26:17,535 --> 01:26:19,517
[SPEAKER_10]: That's embarrassing to me.

1032
01:26:20,898 --> 01:26:21,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like it.

1033
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:23,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very upset this afternoon.

1034
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:28,043
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I was yelling on the telephone, and that's not like me.

1035
01:26:30,413 --> 01:26:42,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I concur with Darren as far as, you know, when Mr. Maloney got this position, it was the athletic department and it was at that point in time our pool was closed.

1036
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:44,058
[SPEAKER_15]: The fields had just opened.

1037
01:26:44,178 --> 01:26:45,739
[SPEAKER_15]: We really didn't have the batting cages.

1038
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:46,839
[SPEAKER_15]: The rink wasn't around.

1039
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Now things are really setting up.

1040
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is definitely time that, like you said, we were going to have this discussion anyway.

1041
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:57,143
[SPEAKER_15]: It's definitely a time that we're trying to make more money for our schools.

1042
01:26:57,223 --> 01:27:00,303
[SPEAKER_15]: We know in the last few years, we've talked about our community schools.

1043
01:27:00,343 --> 01:27:04,304
[SPEAKER_15]: We've talked about bringing in more courses and classes that we've done.

1044
01:27:04,884 --> 01:27:10,885
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's impossible for one person to take care of it all and then not have something fall.

1045
01:27:11,045 --> 01:27:14,266
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, it's due time that we look at this again.

1046
01:27:14,286 --> 01:27:20,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely agree that it's definitely something that we have to look at quicker rather than, you know, sooner rather than later.

1047
01:27:21,367 --> 01:27:21,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1048
01:27:22,427 --> 01:27:22,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1049
01:27:22,607 --> 01:27:23,007
[SPEAKER_15]: van de Kloot.

1050
01:27:23,844 --> 01:27:37,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so the superintendent alluded to the fact that in fact, in the fall, there were other concerns, a concern about a group using the McGlynn on weekends and also posting pictures of the McGlynn auditorium.

1051
01:27:37,112 --> 01:27:46,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that point we raised this issue and it was simply because of the timing of the election and whatever that it was put off, but it's definitely time that we take it off.

1052
01:27:46,377 --> 01:27:47,718
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just about the fields.

1053
01:27:47,778 --> 01:27:52,181
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about the entire, uh, uh, process of, uh,

1054
01:27:52,905 --> 01:27:55,587
[SPEAKER_11]: school facilities being used by outside groups.

1055
01:27:56,909 --> 01:28:08,699
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's just to be clear, we have had in the past contracts and rates and everything else set up in the past very clearly demarcated.

1056
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:16,365
[SPEAKER_11]: I sat on those committees for years, but clearly something is not now being utilized.

1057
01:28:16,445 --> 01:28:19,728
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this needs to be a committee of the whole, the discussion.

1058
01:28:20,371 --> 01:28:35,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would ask, I certainly would support Erin's amendments, if you might repeat them, but I think that we're all on the same page that this is something we absolutely need to look at sooner rather than later.

1059
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:37,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't disagree.

1060
01:28:39,617 --> 01:28:39,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1061
01:28:39,877 --> 01:28:40,517
[SPEAKER_05]: DiBenedetto.

1062
01:28:40,757 --> 01:28:41,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1063
01:28:41,977 --> 01:28:47,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also request at this time that the school committee tour the new facility.

1064
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:53,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I would appreciate some time to do that.

1065
01:28:54,518 --> 01:28:56,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I believe that we should kind of ribbon.

1066
01:28:56,982 --> 01:28:59,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way the community is already we're working on that.

1067
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:00,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

1068
01:29:01,609 --> 01:29:01,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1069
01:29:02,507 --> 01:29:06,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you read motions again so that my colleagues can take a vote?

1070
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:07,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion of Ms.

1071
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:20,251
[SPEAKER_06]: DiBenedetto, that all rental agreements and contracts for use of our high school batting cage gym fields be placed on hold until the school committee sets time, pricing, insurance, and other issues related to the use of these facilities can be determined.

1072
01:29:20,551 --> 01:29:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, I would like to make a motion that the revenue received for all facilities be presented to the school committee on a quarterly basis in the same format the approval of bills transfers of funds is presented.

1073
01:29:33,252 --> 01:29:36,333
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion as offered by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1074
01:29:36,353 --> 01:29:38,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot, all those in favor?

1075
01:29:39,835 --> 01:29:40,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

1076
01:29:40,155 --> 01:29:41,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1077
01:29:41,535 --> 01:29:41,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1078
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:43,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno, did you want to speak prior to the roll call?

1079
01:29:43,756 --> 01:29:48,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I did, actually, only because I know that you said to put it, to place everything on hold.

1080
01:29:48,698 --> 01:29:58,182
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just concerned with the people that actually, or organizations that actually have contracts to utilize our gym or whatever.

1081
01:29:58,222 --> 01:30:00,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to see them not utilize it.

1082
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:07,288
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is for use of, not for additional use of.

1083
01:30:07,308 --> 01:30:09,711
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no additional on there, so could we amend that?

1084
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:13,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to amend to pull out gym and fields?

1085
01:30:13,434 --> 01:30:13,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1086
01:30:13,554 --> 01:30:15,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just the batting cage that we're suspending.

1087
01:30:16,017 --> 01:30:21,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't want to interfere with that there are programs right now that are in the middle and I don't want to send them away.

1088
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:36,022
[SPEAKER_06]: They're planning the field's usage now, so the pricing has been set, so they need to go forward to book the added time.

1089
01:30:36,963 --> 01:30:39,684
[SPEAKER_06]: But high school sports always comes first, no matter what, so.

1090
01:30:39,924 --> 01:30:53,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and can we also add, if you don't mind, how much we pay the employees that are in the security of the fields and whoever else we have up there, so we know how much we're spending?

1091
01:30:53,349 --> 01:30:54,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So revenue and expenses.

1092
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:56,593
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1093
01:30:57,013 --> 01:30:57,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1094
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:05,455
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, as amended on both papers one and two, that the words Jim and Fields be deleted.

1095
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:09,016
[SPEAKER_06]: In the first one, all those in favor?

1096
01:31:09,956 --> 01:31:10,716
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1097
01:31:10,816 --> 01:31:11,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries as amended.

1098
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:18,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the second one, the report for the revenues and expenses be received, adding expenses to that document.

1099
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:19,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote, Ms.

1100
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:20,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Disceri, on this one.

1101
01:31:20,798 --> 01:31:20,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1102
01:31:21,558 --> 01:31:21,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Kugel?

1103
01:31:22,378 --> 01:31:22,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1104
01:31:22,598 --> 01:31:22,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1105
01:31:23,499 --> 01:31:23,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Hunter-Bell?

1106
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:23,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1107
01:31:23,999 --> 01:31:24,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

1108
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:25,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Branskett?

1109
01:31:25,519 --> 01:31:25,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1110
01:31:30,036 --> 01:31:31,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

1111
01:31:31,857 --> 01:31:33,038
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

1112
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:41,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, while we're under suspension, we have an additional paper that the school committee resolution, is it for both of them?

1113
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:48,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express sincere condolences to the family of Gladys Maseka.

1114
01:31:49,042 --> 01:31:52,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Maseka was a retired custodian for the Medford Public Schools.

1115
01:31:52,723 --> 01:32:01,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Maseka was the mother of Medford Security Guard Lieutenant William Maseka, custodian Steven Maseka, and the grandmother of elementary I teacher Michelle Maseka.

1116
01:32:02,727 --> 01:32:06,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we'd like to offer our condolences on the passing of Nina Rexford.

1117
01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:07,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's at the kid's corner.

1118
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:09,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's at the kid's corner.

1119
01:32:09,995 --> 01:32:11,476
[SPEAKER_06]: She was a teacher at this kid's corner.

1120
01:32:11,876 --> 01:32:27,827
[SPEAKER_06]: All please rise for a moment of silence, please.

1121
01:32:27,847 --> 01:32:30,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1122
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:33,711
