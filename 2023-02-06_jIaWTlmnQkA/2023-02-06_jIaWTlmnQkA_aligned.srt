1
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:19,025
I see superintendent evaluation rubric regarding standard one to make instruction indicator and data informed decision making indicator.

2
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:36,314
The standard one measures motion to from the mass dusty superintendent evaluation rubric regarding standard to management and operations to make the environment indicator and the standard to measure motion three from the mass dusty superintendent evaluation rubric regarding standard three family and community engagement

3
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:46,261
to make the engagement indicator, 3A, sharing responsibility indicator, 3B, and communication indicator, 3C, the standard three measures.

4

Motion five, the committee will use the words exemplary, proficient, needs improvement and unsatisfactory in the superintendent's evaluation for each measure being evaluated.

6
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:20,801
Motion six, the superintendent's evaluation will include the raw data from all members in addition to the summary evaluation of the subcommittee.

7
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:29,109
Motion seven, the school committee will create a new standing subcommittee, the evaluation subcommittee with three members for compilation

8
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:35,751
of the notes and evaluations of individual members and provide a recommendation to the full committee at evaluation time.

9
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:44,896
Motion eight, members Graham, Hayes, and McLaughlin will be assigned to the evaluation subcommittee with member Hayes as the chairperson.

10
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:48,438
Motion for approval of the consent agenda.

11
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,438
Motion approved.

12
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,080
Seconded by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

13
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,001
All those in favor?

14
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:54,881
Aye.

15
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,862
All those opposed?

16
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,483
Consent agenda is approved.

17
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:06,481
We have number four report of subcommittee rules and policy subcommittee minutes, December 6, 2022 table from previous meeting.

18
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:10,545
Member Russo.

19
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:11,874
Yes, thank you.

20
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:14,695
I can finally summarize this meeting.

21
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:28,678
So we met on December 6th to discuss the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan, which is a policy, even though it's called a plan, the name of the policy is specified in the law itself.

22
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:32,339
So that's why we have to have this rather unusual name for a policy.

23
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:38,900
There were, Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, and myself were present, and we had a host of

24
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:44,027
additional folks from the, from the public as well as the administration.

25
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,554
We were sort of, we went through the current document that's on our website and discussed.

26
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,558
Well, what we thought we needed to change.

27
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:59,107
You know, there was a lot of conversation.

28
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,068
I won't make us sit through it all right now.

29
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:08,251
But there was a couple of really important points made during the meeting.

30
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:14,273
The most important point by far was that the actual policy wasn't bad.

31
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,854
It was that it just hadn't been followed.

32
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:20,355
So that makes it a bit of a challenge.

33
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:21,896
If the policy isn't a problem,

34
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,898
reviewing the policy for changes can be a very strange conversation, but we had it anyways.

35
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:36,161
So we did, we, we agreed that much or most of the actual content of the policy looked pretty good.

36
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:40,823
We also all agreed that the format of the document was

37
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,328
needed some work is the nice way to put it.

38
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,551
We talked about ways to actually do that.

39
00:04:48,431 --> 00:05:00,922
And, you know, writing policy in a meeting is, is the expectation, but typically a policy is could be a paragraph, it could be a page, sometimes two pages.

40
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:04,385
But this one I believe is 38 pages if I remember correctly.

41
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:05,246
And

42
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:14,638
going line by line through a 38 page document and meetings would mean years of documents, probably at least months of meetings.

43
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:22,368
So we did discuss if we could create a shared Google Doc and we could work on it offline.

44
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,030
I did wonder whether

45
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:29,104
that was acceptable or not from the open meeting law perspective.

46
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:34,308
And I did ask the AG's open government office about it.

47
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:39,872
And they said that we could each have our own documents and then bring our suggested changes together.

48
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:46,837
But then again, we're back to the working line by line or paragraph by paragraph through the whole document.

49
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,241
And it was interesting, the email didn't quite apologize, but did

50
00:05:53,027 --> 00:06:01,191
acknowledge the fact that the open meeting law is really a problem when it comes to things such as what we're trying to do.

51
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:06,853
But anyway, so that's the bottom line is that we will have to go line by line.

52
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:12,996
Hopefully everybody that is interested in providing changes or feedback on the document can bring their own copy to the meeting.

53
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:14,416
We're having another meeting.

54
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:23,883
this month, hopefully February 14th, but I'm waiting to confirm that, where we will start working through this document.

55
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:35,392
And of course, at any time anybody has suggestions for actual change to the policy, we should definitely be talking about that as well.

56
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:40,116
Aside from the how to deal with the document, there was another takeaway that was really

57
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:55,016
well supported in that we should have a visual flowchart of how to deal with bullying and the whole process, as well as the document should be translated, and I don't believe it is right now.

58
00:06:55,836 --> 00:07:03,600
So those were the minutes, and I look forward to the next meeting, which is a little later than planned, but that's all.

59
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,561
Thank you, Member Rousseau.

60
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:09,043
Is there a motion for approval of the minutes?

61
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,163
Motion to approve.

62
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:13,888
McLaughlin, seconded by member Graham.

63
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:14,788
All those in favor?

64
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:15,349
Aye.

65
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:16,309
All those opposed?

66
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,330
Minutes are approved.

67
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:21,512
We have reports of superintendent, number five.

68
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:26,435
First up is superintendent updates and comments, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

69
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,256
Good evening.

70
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,739
Good evening.

71
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:46,370
If we could, please let us begin with a moment of silence for all those affected by the horrible earthquake in Turkey and Syria.

72
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:55,393
The earthquake was a powerful magnitude of 7.8 and was one of the strongest to hit the region in more than 100 years.

73
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:01,595
As a Haitian American, I know firsthand the devastation of an awful earthquake.

74
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:12,247
As many members of friends and families are still recovering from the deadly earthquake that took place in 2010, which registered a magnitude of 7.0.

75
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:18,030
Can you please rise for a moment of silence for our friends and neighbors.

76
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:18,990
Thank you.

77
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:35,470
Thank you again.

78
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:43,412
I have a lot of good news to share and wonderful things are happening in Metro Public Schools.

79
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,716
And I want us just to be able to focus on some wonderful things.

80
00:08:48,336 --> 00:09:05,309
First off, Saturday, which I believe was the coldest day in 57 years or so, our winter color guard placed first in their division, taking home the New England Scholastic Band Association Trophy.

81
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,954
So congratulations to the Winter Color Guard for a job phenomenally done.

82
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:12,375
Very proud of you.

83
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:26,206
Additionally, I want to recognize our Mustang Gymnastics Team, the Mustang Girls Indoor Track Team, and the Mustang Boys Hockey Team.

84
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:31,631
They have all won the Winter GBL Championship.

85
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,833
So congratulations to all of them as well.

86
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:54,601
Also on a kindergarten note, our first building bridges to kindergarten event took place on January 18 and assistant superintendent Lucy, Megan for the carrier director of family and community engagement and kindergarten teacher.

87
00:09:56,622 --> 00:10:00,707
They hosted a packed library, it was a packed house.

88
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:11,681
It was the most that I've ever seen in my five years they just kept coming and coming, and we had to keep pulling out more chairs, and I believe we ended up with over 60.

89
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:20,945
Members of parents and caregivers who came and attended that first kindergarten open house which is absolutely wonderful.

90
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:35,128
I do want people to know that we have another building bridges to kindergarten open house, which is going to take place on Tuesday, February 28, that open house will be taking place by zoom from 630 to 730pm.

91
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:42,272
and the Zoom link will be posted to the school website.

92
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:53,055

93
00:10:53,876 --> 00:11:04,439

94
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:12,045
I would like to recognize our Project 351 ambassadors, the class of 2023.

95
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:17,267
These students were selected to represent their middle schools.

96
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:28,953
And on Saturday, January 14th, Project 351's 13th annual lunch and service day in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

97
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:32,635

98
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,757

They represented Medford at the statewide service day.

101
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:57,262
They worked on a project that benefits cradles to crayons.

102
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:07,506
The project 351 seeks to build knowledge, skills, and confidence to lead the change they wish to see in our world.

103
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:13,228
It was the first time in three years the program got to meet in person.

104
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:20,431
The students began the day with our new governor, Mary Healy, who expressed her support for this program.

105
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:33,796
We are proud of Hannah and Aviva for their exemplary service and for their values of kindness, compassion, gratitude, and gratitude as they serve as ambassadors for the school year.

106
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:44,558

There is a collection box inside the doors of Medford High School's main entrance for any donations.

123
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:28,031
Also, to all of our parents and caregivers, I want to let you know that the extra COVID Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, created during the pandemic to help families buy food, will end on March 2nd per the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

124

00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:33,311
For the Ice Cream Social, the early part of that event is sensory friendly.

152
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:42,037
So families who have children who are adverse to large crowds or lots of noise can come early on the early end of that.

153
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:42,437
Three to four?

154
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:45,359
I think it was 3.15 they were doing the early end.

155
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,380
Okay.

156
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,061
Thank you.

157
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:48,481
Thank you.

158
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:49,902
Thank you.

159
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:55,134
Next up, we have presentation of draft parent caregiver incident notice form.

160
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,296
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

161
00:18:58,817 --> 00:18:59,498
So good evening.

162
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:16,230
Based on our January 9th meeting, where there was a recommendation from the committee to create a form where incidents could be documented.

163
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,513
I shared with you a draft document

164
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,120
It's in your packets.

165
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,503
I wanted to just share some key pieces of information.

166
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:44,794
During the time that we created this forum, senior leadership met, we met also with principals, and I had the opportunity to meet with principals at all levels, and the assistant principals as well at the high school.

167
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,556
I had the opportunity to meet with them.

168
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:53,180
And through the rich discourse, it was really discussed at that point in time,

169
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:04,870
that the recommendation for the incident form would really be used with grades nine through 12, that that's where it would be most appropriate.

170
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:15,380
And so we created the draft form, but from the time of this original report being created back in January and now,

171
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:26,252
we have been able to access or increase access to our school brains portal.

172
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:33,219
And so on this incident form, where it had a limited number of areas,

173
00:20:34,600 --> 00:21:00,819
Now on School Brains at the high school level, if a referral is written for a student and the parents are notified by the teacher or the staff person of record, parents and students now have access to the referral portal that is a part of School Brains.

174
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:11,926
So there are multiple categories, you know, over 50 categories.

175
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:27,417
I mean, the mayor is next to me, so she's able to see, but I'm gonna just, what is available online as the referrals are being generated, it's,

176
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:45,024
It's extensive, whether it's challenges on the bus, attendance, inappropriate language, truancy, lack of cooperation.

177
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:58,290
There are cutting class, which is documented in this referral process, disruptive behavior, distribution of substances,

178
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:09,363
or illegal drugs, failure to identify self, failure to report to Saturday detention,

179
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:30,210
if there were to be the sale of tobacco, if there were any kind of smoking materials, it's very expansive what's actually available in the actual portal.

180
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:36,596
And so the staff person of record who is creating the referral goes in

181
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:40,559
and clicks on the boxes, the respective boxes.

182
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:48,124
And then once they click on the boxes, they're able to add comments.

183
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:57,772
So when they reach out to the family, both the student and the parent are able to go in and say, there was a referral created.

184
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:04,236
And it clearly shows once the staff person clicks on the indicator,

185
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:10,904
It has a blue checkmark, and it identifies exactly what took place.

186
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:21,575
So, we were able to get access to this portion which before we did not have access to that so this is a new.

187
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:31,258
It's new and the students report cards, the students that were in the portal, they are now seeing their referrals.

188
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,778
And so it's clearly spelled out.

189
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:43,720
And so both the student can see what was documented as a referral and the parent can see it as well, because the parent view is the same as the student view.

190
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:51,261
Mayor?

191
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:54,845
Russo, then member McLaughlin.

192
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:55,845
Thank you.

193
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:58,707
I'm in there right now.

194
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:03,029
I want to one of my children and I do see a new section says referrals.

195
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:04,650
Thankfully, there's nothing listed.

196
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,450
Yes.

197
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:12,974
But I guess my question is, you know, as a parent who uses school brains, I don't use it.

198
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:18,209
Often I use it when it's report card time.

199
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:22,831
And I don't think I get notices from Schoolbrains when new stuff is in there at all.

200
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:30,694
So, you know, if a student is getting referrals that Schoolbrains has it, it's great, but

201
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:33,877
will the parents still be getting a notice to go look?

202
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:40,358
So the talking points activity has increased significantly.

203
00:24:40,958 --> 00:25:01,003
So the staff person of record is sending a communication to the parent stating that your child did not show up for mathematics today, or your child missed Johnny missed science period two.

204
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:10,185
And we know that Johnny's in school and then he attends the rest of the day so they will see the talking points message, and the parents are now back on talking points.

205
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:28,668
But now that we were able to not only will they get the talking points notification but when they go to the portal, they can actually see exactly what the infractions were that are checked off, and the staff person who is reporting the student.

206
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:35,652
they get to see a referral was entered in what it was that took place.

207
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:41,196
Member McLaughlin.

208
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:42,657
Thank you.

209
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:47,620
Thank you for the work on this, Dr. Robinson.

210
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,223
I have a couple of questions.

211
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:52,403
I know that you said this is

212
00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:05,423
proposed for nine to 12 to encourage communication via phone or in person for important dialogue from the key eight community.

213
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:15,606
And I think that the real reason for wanting this incident report in the first place was really about encouraging communication across the board.

214
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:19,788
While I understand that the form that is being proposed may not be

215
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:35,913
appropriate or applicable necessarily for K-8 although I have to say we certainly have heard of K-8 suspensions among other things so I wonder about that.

216
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:39,496
I'm wondering if there's a proposal for a K-8 form.

217
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:47,983
My concern primarily is that families are not finding out about these incidents

218
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:56,088
after the fact or worse after several facts, which has historically been the case.

219
00:26:56,208 --> 00:27:08,654
And so that's one issue or question I have is so how are we addressing the K-8 issue and making sure that families are made aware of any incidents?

220
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:12,676
I would also just like to add that I think one of the most memorable phone calls

221
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:18,895
home I ever received as a parent was for my child doing really well.

222
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:39,644
And I think it's really important while I know that we're creating structure around incidents that there are opportunities to let families know when children are doing really well as well so that we are building relationships because I think that's the real concern is that sort of deterioration in relationships.

223
00:27:39,884 --> 00:27:42,686
So to the school brains point, so the first question is what are we doing

224
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:44,244
for K through eight.

225
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:47,766
And then another question is for the school brains piece.

226
00:27:47,806 --> 00:27:51,148
So honestly, I was never a fan of school brains.

227
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:56,732
It was something that you had to, as member Rousseau was mentioning, you had to drive there yourself.

228
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:58,953
We weren't getting notification on.

229
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:02,334
and we were just sort of told to go to school brains.

230
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:07,715
There was no training on school brains, and I wonder if there's training for families on school brains at all.

231
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:09,956
Does anyone orient families to school brains?

232
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:24,680
If so, how, and how is that information shared to our families who are non-English speaking families and or to people who enter the district after the beginning of the school year so that they understand that?

233
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:30,663
Thirdly, I guess I would ask how much participation exists with school brains.

234
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:43,526
So, you know, we know how many students we have enrolled, how many families do we actually have actively enrolled and or engaging with school brains to see if this is an effective means of communication.

235
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:53,569
And then, you know, it begs the question in terms of training for families on school brains, it also begs the question for me on our economically disadvantaged

236
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:57,119
families about access to technology.

237
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:05,366
So I don't know that all of those questions could be answered in this particular meeting, but if we could answer some of them, that would be great.

238
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:13,334
And, you know, if you have to go back to the drawing board for answers to others, I'd be okay with that too, but I'd love to just get some response.

239
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:13,714
Thank you.

240
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:27,896
So with School Brains, again, at the secondary level, at the high school level grades, there was definitely active participation from parents at the high school level.

241
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:35,202
Midterms and other key communications happened through the School Brains portal.

242
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:38,364
And now seeing

243
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:48,332
When I actually was able to see the actual list of, you know, it's probably about 90 different indicators.

244
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:55,617
The fact that it's already housed in one place so you could see.

245
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:02,405
One of the reasons with adding separate documentation like this.

246
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:10,835
First, it's, it's not going to be able to capture like 90, almost 90 different indicators that I'm looking at.

247
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:12,537
But secondly,

248
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:25,147
In School Brains, not only does it let you know, okay, this happened on February 6th, but if there's more than one referral made, it keeps track of all of that.

249
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:34,113
So you actually have in one spot from the start of the school year throughout, you can go and click and count and say, oh,

250
00:30:35,114 --> 00:30:42,996
There were 15 referrals for, you know, inappropriate behavior or cutting class.

251
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:44,617
It's all in one place.

252
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,138
And you can see who the different staff people are.

253
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:58,301
So having it within the portal, you're able to keep the data in one place and parents are now able to see

254
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:15,672
who's sending it, you know, they would have received a talking points or a phone call depending on what, you know, what transpired from a staff person, a guidance counselor, an assistant principal, a principal, reaching out to them to say this, you know, this is what ended up taking place.

255
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:25,979
And they can also now go into the portal and see what the actual referral was about and what was, you know, the time of day, who was the instructor who sent it.

256
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,780
So this is now,

257
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:35,406
a new ability that we did not have before.

258
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:50,674
And so I actually, now that it's working, and the students are realizing, like, this is being documented, they can actually see what the referral is for, it's also great with accountability.

259
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:59,978
When you're working with the students and saying, well, this happened on this particular day, and now this is the third event or the fourth event, you're able to just

260
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:15,689
Yes, you're able to better monitor you're able to keep parents up to speed, and parents are able to see, oh, you know, there was a computer violation, or, you know,

261
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:31,652
you know, you were smoking today, or you were attempting to do something that you shouldn't have done and parents are now able to see what the infraction was and support the school in meeting out discipline.

262
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,257
So, Mayor.

263
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:37,499
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

264
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:38,802
Thank you.

265
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:40,103
So I, thank you.

266
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:40,884
I appreciate that.

267
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,065
Those are in school brains.

268
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:50,591
I guess what I'm asking is, are parents trained on how to use school brains and do they know how to access this material?

269
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:57,395
Is there, you know, what are we doing for translation around that so that we're being equitable in what the access is?

270
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,738
And what are we proposing for K through eight?

271
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:04,540
I can speak to, K through eight has a similar form

272
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:09,053
So a little bit more of just an explanation section and the date.

273
00:33:09,515 --> 00:33:14,448
I received one recently on misbehaving at gym class and parent has to sign and send it back.

274
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:19,118
So if we can have an example of a sample of that for the next meeting, that would be really great.

275
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:23,341
And so that families understand that those are coming home as well.

276
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:25,703
For the K through eight, that would be great.

277
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:29,986
That's not for K through, was it middle school or was that elementary school?

278
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:37,112
Elementary school, Robert, does something very similar to this, but it's written and sent home with the parent, parent has to sign and send back.

279
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:38,193
That was Roberts.

280
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:46,278
So I do know at the when I met with the principals, especially at the elementary level, they were all together.

281
00:33:47,639 --> 00:34:00,787
Some of the schools use a slightly different form, but they definitely focus on communicating with parents at the elementary level, because it really should be what's appropriate if it's, you know,

282
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:06,770
a younger child, letting the parent know immediately this is what happened.

283
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:13,354
This is, you know how we're handling it and trying to handle it at an appropriate level in this situation.

284
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,236
Yes, there are suspensions that do take place.

285
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:29,028
Not often at the elementary level, but sometimes there are some extreme behaviors that, you know, there needs to be a serious consequence.

286
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,431
But that is like the exception and not the norm.

287
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:36,375
Usually, if it's something at that level.

288
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:50,229
You know the parents would receive a phone call the parents may come in for a meeting to speak with the administrator or speak with the teacher to say like this is what the appropriate the inappropriate behavior was and this is our expectation.

289
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:51,470
Next go around.

290
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:57,596
So, you know, you said you received a form about you know.

291
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:07,427
Maybe, you know, excited behavior in phys ed, and then as a mom you were able just to support the district and say like I expect perfect behavior.

292
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:12,113
When you, you know, travel to special specialists or wherever it is.

293
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:16,778
And so that's the hope of definitely trying to have.

294
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:22,302
communication and collaboration, supporting one another in this process.

295
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:32,589
I think at the high school level, where we're dealing with young adults, and in dealing with young adults who are going to be going out into the real world, that

296
00:35:34,617 --> 00:36:00,848
what's happening right now, reaching out to the parents through talking points, completing the referral, and the administrators following up on, if it's a staff person, the administrator following up with the parent as well to say this is being addressed, but it's clearly being documented, that it's what is developmentally appropriate.

297
00:36:01,168 --> 00:36:02,188
At the middle school level,

298
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:09,553
Again, I do feel that communication with the parents is critically important.

299
00:36:10,414 --> 00:36:18,160
And again, if the behavior is truly a behavior that's unacceptable, then there will be consequences for that behavior.

300
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:29,149
But a lot of the behaviors that are being addressed, the administrators and or teachers or staff work in collaboration with the parents.

301
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:32,692
Mayor?

302
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:34,997
Thank you, Dr. Wilbertson.

303
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:41,059
I guess I'm just, I'm not feeling like I'm really getting any answer about what is gonna happen for K through eight.

304
00:36:41,139 --> 00:37:03,065
Are they getting, are families getting a form sent home if there's a disciplinary action or if there's something put, more importantly, if there's something put in the student's file regarding the student's behavior or discipline that the parents are formally notified and made aware of it so that they're not finding out five,

305
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:05,216
disciplinary infractions in.

306
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,117
So my question is, what about K through eight?

307
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:14,580
And then the other is, what training and access do we have for families for school brains?

308
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:25,986
So training, meaning how to use school brains, how school brains works, what school brains is, access meaning for families that don't have English as their primary language.

309
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:38,925
So, with the training I would actually I'm going to ask for assistance with tenant Susan glues and Dr Christian if they would wouldn't mind coming up to speak specifically to.

310
00:37:42,078 --> 00:37:44,179
how things look differently at the elementary level.

311
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:55,085
In terms of training, I would even ask maybe member Rousseau or member McStone, do you recall having a special training with school brains?

312
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:57,646
I think some of it's intuitive.

313
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:03,689
I know we have the translators available and Talking Points does translate.

314
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:12,653
But I'm not sure if there's a formalized training so I'm deferring to you guys to also chime in.

315
00:38:13,193 --> 00:38:14,754
So I think I'm sorry.

316
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:38,448
I think one of the things that we do need to do is to create a formal parent training for our parents as they come into the district and then as best we can, and, you know, really look to the committee to help out to encourage parents to come to the training we can record them on YouTube have them up there as I know.

317
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,030
Assistant Superintendent Galussi and Ms.

318
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:52,337
Riccadeli recently did a training that while there wasn't great attendance, it is codified for, it is there on YouTube for people to return to and we'll be able to share it out.

319
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:55,399
So we can work, myself and Ms.

320
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,500
Galussi, we can work

321
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:04,267
with Kim Miles, who really is an amazing data representative working with School Brains to put together a training.

322
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:10,873
It is, in large regards, there's not much that is there to confuse parents.

323
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:20,782
On the school district side, it's a very comprehensive system, but on the forward-facing side, not so much for parents and caregivers.

324
00:39:21,203 --> 00:39:22,724
But we can definitely put that together.

325
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:35,775
And also, I think that through some conversation, we can also consider rolling this out for six through eight as the system is used comprehensively starting when students enter the sixth grade.

326
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:39,158
So that's another conversation that we can have internally and move forward with.

327
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:45,029
I'll also speak with the necessary people to look into translation and to make sure that's there.

328
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:51,535
But as the superintendent said, the translation is really started through talking points.

329
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:59,601
And then if parents need further translation or want to call them, we can set up using our translation services to have that available for them.

330
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:07,728
And then any other questions you have, we're happy to take them back, work on them and bring them forward again to the committee.

331
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:11,519
Thank you.

332
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,220
I appreciate that.

333
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:21,429
I would just recommend that if videos are being made that yeah, an interpretation service would be great for the videos or the closed captioning with another language or something.

334
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:28,115
So there's an opportunity for interpretation services for that.

335
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:31,038
If there's written material, translation service would be great.

336
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,560
if the spoken interpretation services would be really great.

337
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:43,363
And then for the K-8 system, I do have questions about how are the incidents being handled for K-8.

338
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:49,205
And so I think what I'm hearing is they're going to be on a case-by-case basis.

339
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:51,706
And I guess, is that what I'm hearing or no?

340
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,186
No, okay.

341
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:55,307
No, what I said was specifically around grades six through eight.

342
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,926
I think that we can make sure that those are done using school brains.

343
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:03,667
And then what we can do is we can make sure that, well, I'll let Ms.

344
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:07,528
Galussi speak further for elementary, because I don't wanna misspeak.

345
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:17,990
Well, as many of you know, from your children for the elementary years, at the elementary level, school brains is really just used for attendance and report card grading.

346
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,611
So in terms of this particular conversation around incidents, there's nothing that's

347
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:25,753
uploaded to Schoolbrains.

348
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:32,016
Schoolbrains at the elementary level is not used for teachers to record anything other than attendance and report card grading.

349
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:38,859
I don't think this conversation is shifting that or opening that up, but that's the way it stands right now.

350
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:51,786
So I guess that's what I'm asking is, so then when there is an elementary level incident, how are families being made aware of an incident that's being filed in the student's school record?

351
00:41:53,638 --> 00:42:00,601
it should be parent conversations with the staff that was directly involved in whatever the situation was.

352
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:04,903
So that may mean the school principal or the assistant principal.

353
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:09,485
It also may mean support staff in terms of school adjustment counselors.

354
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:12,446
And it also may mean the teacher,

355
00:42:17,914 --> 00:42:24,001
But if there's something that's put on paper for the student's record, that is not being sent home.

356
00:42:24,462 --> 00:42:25,824
It could be a conversation.

357
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,306
That absolutely should be sent home.

358
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:28,327
Uh-huh, okay.

359
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:45,081
Yes, if there's something, at the elementary level, it's very, it's more conversational and because of responsive classroom, any consequences should be logical and tied to whatever that learning is for the students.

360
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:50,402
If there is something beyond what is typical for that age and grade,

361
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:58,699
and results in some sort of documentation, that parents should absolutely be receiving a copy of that.

362
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,281
And if they're not, what do they do?

363
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:03,982
They should have that conversation with the principal.

364
00:43:04,703 --> 00:43:11,787
If the conversation needs to go beyond the principal, they can absolutely reach out to superintendent.

365
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:15,669
Okay, but so there'll be no form that sort of standard for this.

366
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:17,030
It's that if there's a

367
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:47,029
I just, I think, I understand the process for this, and I understand the need for consistency and some alignment, but I also just, I do strongly believe in the developmental piece of things, which is why we brought in responsive classroom, which is why we're really trying to have consequences be logical.

368
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:50,692
I also think as students grow and mature,

369
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:57,165
I still think the first piece should be a lot of that conversation.

370
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:19,192
But when we have an incident in where, like I said, it elevates to a point that's either repeated, and we're getting to be somewhat of like a pattern, and or it's atypical for the grade and age, then parents absolutely have to be part of that conversation.

371
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:42,932
in terms of like documenting this in a district-wide incident form, there's something about that at the elementary level that I don't wanna see situations that should be between school and home for the betterment of the student be relegated to an incident form.

372
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:50,875
I really would like the priority to still be that conversation between school and home at really developmental ages.

373
00:44:55,779 --> 00:45:10,475
That's a whole separate there are there are legal forms and template letters that should be completed in instances that involve any sort of removal, we have comprehensive checklist for our principles comprehend sorry.

374
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:14,005
We have comprehensive checklists for our principals to use.

375
00:45:14,085 --> 00:45:25,621
We have notifications, letters, hearing notices, and a real comprehensive established process for all of our principals and assistant principals to use.

376
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:31,544
when the last effort suspension is utilized and utilized rarely.

377
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:47,253
The other thing, too, that I will say is while the elementary level is using responsive classroom, secondary is really leaning into and embracing restorative justice, circle chats, opportunities for students to really grow.

378
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:50,955
And as they are maturing, as Miss Pelosi said, as they are maturing and growing,

379
00:45:51,345 --> 00:46:09,422
to have those conversations as young adults and growing adults through their high school years to have conversations and better understood how that made other people feel, to build that empathy and to build that true understanding of the consequences of their actions beyond just being consequence.

380
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:13,746
Like just consequencing a student doesn't lead to a change in behavior.

381
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,749
Hopefully through structured conversations

382
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:23,550
with adults and peers will be able to move students to fully understand the change that's necessary.

383
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:29,576
Remember Graham.

384
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:38,123
I think I'm just trying to understand that like all the parts because I I think one of our biggest problems is consistency and follow through.

385
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:50,297
And if we're adding parts and pieces to already things that are not happening with consistency, like I don't, I don't see how that's going to benefit students or families, frankly.

386
00:46:52,098 --> 00:47:03,063
But I think what I'm hearing is that all along school brains had the capability to be alerting parents if things are happening and we just didn't use it.

387
00:47:03,983 --> 00:47:05,024
And now we are using it.

388
00:47:05,384 --> 00:47:05,904
Is that right?

389
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:08,182
I'm not sure.

390
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:14,765
I just know that they were able to get access on the referral portion to get it opened.

391
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:23,068
I wasn't on that back end piece to say, how could you let families see referrals that were in the system?

392
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:27,550
And that aspect got opened or unlocked.

393
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,012
I'm not sure of the specifics of how it happened.

394
00:47:31,472 --> 00:47:31,712
OK.

395
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:36,434
So if that's the case, then School Brains now has the capability to

396
00:47:38,935 --> 00:47:42,417
like display for parents what's happening with their student day to day.

397
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:45,818
That's great news because that didn't exist like a month ago.

398
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:58,164
And then we're also gonna use taught, we're asking teachers to record it in one system and then use talking points to like communicate about it in another system.

399
00:47:59,284 --> 00:48:00,385
And then also a form.

400
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:03,046
So I think that just sounds like

401
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:11,903
exactly something where nothing is ever going to happen the way parents are, I think, really asking the district to communicate about.

402
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:21,127
I think it would be my very strong preference that we use our student information system for the capabilities that it must have.

403
00:48:22,327 --> 00:48:31,591
I can't imagine that this system that is used across the state, across the country, cannot send emails proactively to parents when a referral is flagged in the system.

404
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,887
beyond my comprehension that a system in this day and age would not be able to do that.

405
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:48,023
That is so widely deployed like we're not using something we built, you know, in a, in a lab somewhere, you know, in the back office like we're using a purchased

406
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,691
off the shelf software platform.

407
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:53,852
It has to be able to do that.

408
00:48:53,932 --> 00:49:04,596
And if it can do that, I don't know why we would create a form that is outside of that, because that is just like another place for the process to fall apart, frankly.

409
00:49:06,348 --> 00:49:18,977
And I think like if we're using talking points to have a conversation that makes sense, but I don't want it to be expected that as a teacher, I'm going to put information in a whole bunch of different places.

410
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:27,303
And I'm going to communicate with parents because something is going to give that's going to bring us right back to where we are, which is wildly inconsistent.

411
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:30,865
So I would rather see there be a standard way for

412
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:40,699
Once information goes into school brains, it can be communicated to parents and then teachers can use talking points to have the conversations that they should be having.

413
00:49:41,399 --> 00:49:43,500
I don't love this extra form.

414
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,521
I think it's adding a lot of weird complexity about like, when do I put it in school brains?

415
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:49,662
And when do I use the form?

416
00:49:49,702 --> 00:49:56,304
And I don't think any, I don't think parents wanna make this harder for school to communicate with them.

417
00:49:56,484 --> 00:50:00,185
I think we just like are really looking for basic like,

418
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:13,884
flow of information between what is happening in the building that we cannot see when we're at home or at work or wherever, and what you all know to be true and happening in the building.

419
00:50:13,984 --> 00:50:20,228
I think we all would love for our kids to come home and tell us all these things, but they're not going to.

420
00:50:20,248 --> 00:50:22,829
And we need you to tell us these things

421
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:27,166
So I am not like I am not in love with this form.

422
00:50:27,306 --> 00:50:31,969
I think it's basically one of those things that is going to completely fall by the wayside in three months.

423
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:41,154
I would much rather see us invest some energy into actually learning what school brains does and doesn't do and can and cannot do.

424
00:50:41,294 --> 00:50:44,536
Because if we didn't know about this, what else don't we know about?

425
00:50:44,556 --> 00:50:50,259
I do think it's appropriate if those things are being tracked or could be tracked for six to eight that

426
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:56,421
Again, that could absolutely happen in school brains that doesn't seem like it would be too big of a stretch.

427
00:50:56,842 --> 00:51:05,507
And I think I have always had the question about if we are putting student data in school brains about elementary students, why can parents not see that data?

428
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:15,693
Like whatever it may be, and there may be great reasons to not put this kind of disciplinary data in there, but if you're keeping data about my kid in a system, I want access to it.

429
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:17,772
because it's my kid.

430
00:51:18,052 --> 00:51:29,336
So I thought during the pandemic, we might have opened that up and that didn't happen, but I think parents are capable of understanding that there are differences between levels.

431
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:37,519
So I would also ask that the district like end that practice of storing data in a system about kids that is not visible to parents.

432
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:43,981
Like I think, and to member McLaughlin's point, like a quick video on a website and more importantly,

433
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:47,540
principles talking about, like, this is how we do this.

434
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,941
This is what our community does.

435
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:54,303
This is what our culture and our school operation is all about.

436
00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:55,724
That's what is missing.

437
00:51:55,824 --> 00:52:05,489
So, like, if we're trying to get at that consistency and that community climate expectations, like, I don't think the form actually gets us there.

438
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,451
I'm not tied to the form at all.

439
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:13,354
And if we throw the form out and we do something better, all the better if it is easier and more likely to

440
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:27,969
A, succeed, and B, be around next year at this time, and D, actually make things easier for the people who are having to do this work, because I'm really concerned about that too.

441
00:52:33,474 --> 00:52:37,697
Dr. Cushing, and then Member Hayes, and then Member McLaughlin.

442
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:39,339
Do you want me to defer to you, Member Hayes?

443
00:52:41,144 --> 00:52:43,265
So you bring up all very good points.

444
00:52:44,265 --> 00:53:10,558
We will look into, so student information management systems provide a great amount of resources and also simultaneously a tremendous amount of challenges with the multi-level databases that they are and what you think, as all of you here might, and believe it or not, school administrators and leaders, you think might be easy to just push an email when something's submitted

445
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:17,338
has never been that easy through multiple systems I've been a part of.

446
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:27,783
But we can make the call tomorrow to our representatives both within the Medford schools, Kim, and representatives at School Brains to figure it out.

447
00:53:27,863 --> 00:53:36,027
The other thing though too is I would actually pause on just like a person submits it and then an email is simultaneously sent

448
00:53:36,351 --> 00:53:48,519
to a parent that there's been an incident, because I think then that takes away maybe necessary context that a conversation with an assistant principal or a teacher or someone along the line might have.

449
00:53:49,459 --> 00:54:03,128
And so having done those roles, the importance of picking up the phone and having a conversation that goes beyond sending an email home or something like that to make that voice-to-voice contact

450
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:12,195
is so critical in relationship building and then really supporting students through whatever troubles they might be in for the moment, all right, for the moment.

451
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:18,781
So that's one of the thing that I'd like to be able to see, like, when does that email actually get sent?

452
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:21,763
Yeah, and I think that's a great question.

453
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:26,207
And I think immediate is not always the right answer.

454
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:29,970
Like, you know, maybe it's like a weekly thing or daily thing, I don't know.

455
00:54:31,326 --> 00:54:36,148
But I just want to make s consistent that we can sa do this thing in our dist you can expect.

456
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:39,369
I definit that to take the place of any level because I think

457
00:54:47,148 --> 00:54:53,971
and hear from humans what's happening with their tiny humans, however tiny or giant they might be like they need to know.

458
00:54:54,951 --> 00:55:05,955
So I don't I think you're right like that has to be a priority and if we push too much paper around like that's going to that's the thing that will get lost and and no one will be better for it.

459
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:13,969
And I think to the point of like these information management systems being really complicated, I get it.

460
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:19,011
Like every time you kind of peel back a layer, right, there's something else there about how the system operates.

461
00:55:20,411 --> 00:55:28,714
And if we, you know, feel like this is just one of those situations where we need to be in better contact with those experts so that we can do the things we want to do, great.

462
00:55:29,354 --> 00:55:35,096
If we feel like this system cannot meet our needs, like there are other ones out there and we should use our

463
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:38,644
our money to buy a new system.

464
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:45,809
Like we just, we shouldn't keep being satisfied with systems that can't meet our needs that create like a huge administrative burden.

465
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,931
So I'm open to that.

466
00:55:47,951 --> 00:56:05,223
I don't think necessarily that has to be the answer, but I think, you know, we have a platform and we probably in all fairness and through no criticism, like never learned how it ticked or how to use it in a really

467
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:12,063
Deepway, and we lost a registrar a few years back to budget cuts.

468
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:14,224
So there's 100 reasons why we're here.

469
00:56:14,244 --> 00:56:20,785
I just want to make sure that if we're saying the system can't do something, somebody needs to ask, are we sure?

470
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:26,166
Because I think we just found out that we're not sure.

471
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:27,906
And those are important things.

472
00:56:28,086 --> 00:56:32,387
These systems evolve, and they change, and they're constantly getting features added.

473
00:56:32,507 --> 00:56:35,808
So I think that kind of conversation and dialogue is always really important.

474
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:40,903
Member Hayes and Member McLaughlin.

475
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:44,465
I just wanted to come back to the K to five level.

476
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:58,135
I wholeheartedly agree with you that both developmentally and philosophically, we don't want to get into some level with a K to five, the same level that we want to get in the six to eight or nine to 12.

477
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:00,956
I do think there's a little bit of

478
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:08,055
that it feels so open ended that parents don't know what to expect.

479
00:57:08,115 --> 00:57:12,960
And correct me if I'm wrong, maybe it's written down somewhere and I'm the parent who hasn't found, hasn't looked at it.

480
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:19,647
I think even being at the same school as the mayor's children, I've had different

481
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,527
experiences with different teachers.

482
00:57:21,587 --> 00:57:34,557
I had a teacher who sent home little notes if there were misbehaviors that weren't, I don't think were put in a folder anywhere, but it was more the communication to me just to let me know your child is, you know, doing somersaults during circle time.

483
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:44,225
And now I have a teacher who's very good at letting me know verbally, either calling me, sending an email, catching me after school.

484
00:57:46,061 --> 00:58:08,514
I think the concern though, I think that the genesis of this original question about parent notification, at least at the K to five level was, you know, I don't know how often this happens, but there were situations that we've been aware of where parents had been brought in after a number of incidents at school.

485
00:58:08,774 --> 00:58:10,835
And again, they're, you know, they're, they're small children.

486
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,617
They're not huge incidents, some of these, but you know,

487
00:58:14,232 --> 00:58:18,754
And in the process of saying, we need to talk about your child, they say, well, all these things happened.

488
00:58:19,154 --> 00:58:20,415
You know, these things have been happening.

489
00:58:20,435 --> 00:58:23,496
And the parent is like, well, I had no idea.

490
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:42,445
So where in between can we have somewhat of a standardization or some kind of a process that parents will know and the teachers will know that across all schools, it's expected that at this point you contact a parent or you call the parent every time.

491
00:58:43,297 --> 00:58:59,040
any, whatever the process would be, but I think it feels, the way we talked about it tonight, it feels very open-ended to an extent where as a parent, I don't really know what I should expect if my child is misbehaving or having any kind of an issue.

492
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,321
I think that's valid.

493
00:59:01,821 --> 00:59:02,781
I think that's very valid.

494
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:05,862
And I hear, you know, where you're coming from.

495
00:59:05,902 --> 00:59:13,023
And I think there are definitely situations that are unfortunate, like the one you just mentioned,

496
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:20,645
that I'd hope to say are not typical, but I do think that there's definitely some work still.

497
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:31,030
I mean, there's always work, but I do think there's some work around coming up with those aligned processes with all of the elementary school leaders.

498
00:59:31,951 --> 00:59:41,015
But I would probably also bring in maybe some other people for that conversation, but I do think that there is definitely room to work on that.

499
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:45,072
and come up with some more aligned, like a, yeah?

500
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:49,695
Is that, so I guess the question then, is that something you are working on at this point?

501
00:59:51,136 --> 00:59:53,058
So I mean, the superintendent can speak.

502
00:59:53,098 --> 01:00:08,648
I know she's been having regular meetings with principals, but I think having that subgroup of just the elementary school leaders to create that process, I think would be helpful.

503
01:00:08,668 --> 01:00:09,929
Okay, thank you.

504
01:00:11,618 --> 01:00:12,499
Member McLaughlin.

505
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:13,179
Thank you.

506
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:14,741
Thank you.

507
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:26,871
And I guess I want to thank my colleagues for their input and particularly around the data being entered about students, particularly families and caregivers are not made aware.

508
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,592
I think that is really the crux of it.

509
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:31,775
And I think that is relationship building.

510
01:00:31,915 --> 01:00:39,761
And so I think sharing that information is relationship building, not sharing that information causes distrust and then a deterioration of relationship.

511
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:40,842
And so that's the thing that I think

512
01:00:41,323 --> 01:00:53,834
is really the whole genesis of this conversation is about how are we building relationships to ensure that families know what's going on in school and can help support their child and their teacher and the school and vice versa.

513
01:00:53,934 --> 01:00:54,735
So there's that.

514
01:00:55,175 --> 01:01:03,082
And so to the point of our goals, when we were talking earlier about school committee goals, I think this is a really good example of ways in which we improve communication,

515
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:11,085
when we're talking about communications across the district, also about systems and processes, and also about family and community engagement.

516
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:21,458
I think this is all a really good example of that and something, you know, as I'm moving forward and we're talking about things, I'm really trying to put in, you know, parenthetical notes about, well, what goal does this actually attach to?

517
01:01:21,997 --> 01:01:24,838
in terms of our district and really, you know, trying to think backwards around that.

518
01:01:24,899 --> 01:01:32,702
And I think that that is the goal, um, in terms of improving communication, family community engagement and creating systems that are in price.

519
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:45,329
And so to that end, I really, I don't think that we need to make a motion, but if you think we need to make a motion, I'd like to know that particularly around training of families and school brains, because my experience was

520
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:52,389
I think probably partially in the system, you know, in middle school, that there was this, you know, school branches being used.

521
01:01:52,429 --> 01:01:57,113
And it was being used at that time, which I'm dating myself, it was probably, you know, six or seven years ago at this point.

522
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,495
But at that time, it was being used by one school and not the other.

523
01:02:00,515 --> 01:02:08,822
And, you know, so now I think there's more uniformity around it, but really ensuring that there's, you know, maybe a, you know, beginning of the year and a big year training.

524
01:02:09,232 --> 01:02:15,137
around what this is for families and that it's multilingual training so that is really helpful for families.

525
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:26,586
And then I would ask, do students who are in out-of-district placements and or in the 18 to 22 transition program have school brains?

526
01:02:36,826 --> 01:02:40,868
Okay, so those parents and families obviously need training as well, that they do.

527
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,969
Okay, thank you.

528
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:43,310
Thank you.

529
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:45,972
Member Russo, would you like to comment?

530
01:02:46,932 --> 01:02:47,132
Yes.

531
01:02:47,152 --> 01:02:50,855
Then we'll move on to number three.

532
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:59,520
I have, there's a very, I'm having this very dystopian feeling about this.

533
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:07,773
You know, we talk about being an adolescent, it's supposed to be something meaningful.

534
01:03:09,194 --> 01:03:21,420
And if every single thing that all of us did between the ages of zero and 18 was available right now on a webpage, I can assure you that very few of us would be sitting here.

535
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,122
And so I'm very concerned about the data retention policies for this.

536
01:03:27,423 --> 01:03:28,403
I know that, for instance,

537
01:03:30,544 --> 01:03:36,392
discipline related to a diagnosed disability is not supposed to end up in the student record, right?

538
01:03:38,555 --> 01:03:41,899
Isn't that the new law that just passed or just went into effect?

539
01:03:44,723 --> 01:03:46,986
So that was a determination.

540
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:48,781
Sorry, John.

541
01:03:49,962 --> 01:03:50,822
Yes, that's correct.

542
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:51,263
Thank you.

543
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:57,268
So, I see your head, but not everybody on on screen.

544
01:03:57,828 --> 01:04:06,736
So, my question is when is this data entered in by who because data just doesn't you know if after the fact is determined it shouldn't be part of the permanent record.

545
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:11,737
we should all be fully aware by now that there's no such thing as deleting data.

546
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:34,027
So, you know, I think about this stuff, I think about do teachers have access to their new students when they are starting the new school year, they can look at their students and look at their referral records for the previous year and two years and say, oh, I gotta watch out for that Johnny, setting up a dynamic that is already ensuring that Johnny has a problem before Johnny has met his new teacher.

547
01:04:35,307 --> 01:04:37,428
So that's something that's deeply concerning to me

548
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:46,505
And I'm not actually expecting you all to have answers to these questions right now I just think it's important to not be so excited that we're doing this.

549
01:04:47,326 --> 01:04:49,067
And this last point I was going to make.

550
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:58,013
I really come back and forth on whether to make it but we all grew up knowing kids who were abused by their parents, that's just a fact of life in America, and most countries.

551
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:06,793
Does this have a way to flag that this student's referrals should not automatically be sent to parents on the portal?

552
01:05:07,313 --> 01:05:15,017
Because you know what, if my kid comes home and got a referral because they talked back to a teacher once, I'm not going to be happy about it.

553
01:05:15,517 --> 01:05:17,458
I'm also not going to harm my child.

554
01:05:18,308 --> 01:05:22,709
And we can pretend that there are not families in this town that harm their children, but that's just not true.

555
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:32,632
And I'm worried about the children, but I'm also worried about putting the teachers, because when I was growing up, all the teachers knew which kids were being abused at home.

556
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:37,054
Teachers know that, especially in the earlier grades where you're with the kid all day, every day.

557
01:05:38,954 --> 01:05:46,637
And so are we setting up a situation where teachers have to choose between compliance and putting it in school brains, knowing that the kid

558
01:05:47,898 --> 01:05:57,406
may not come to school tomorrow, because they need a way to not be seen to probably do what the teachers will do and not put it in.

559
01:05:57,426 --> 01:06:02,870
I mean, I would expect teachers to err on the side of kids safety and we all would.

560
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:04,851
So I just wrote this this.

561
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:24,711
There's a goal here, and why we're doing it is an important goal, I just think it feels a bit blunt force and leaves an awful lot of opportunity for student records that become their permanent life story violations of that law that we just had.

562
01:06:26,132 --> 01:06:27,273
that just went into effect.

563
01:06:27,573 --> 01:06:47,858
And then also putting teachers in frankly, really uncomfortable situations around, I don't want to not report this, but I also know that Johnny's dad's not gonna react in a way that is necessarily in bounds for modern parenting at least.

564
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,619
So those are my concerns.

565
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,220
And this just seems like a very global,

566
01:06:54,824 --> 01:07:06,473
bit celebratory experience I'm having here with the rest of the conversations we're having, and I'm worried about kids like myself whose parents would not have responded in a way that would have let me come to school the next day.

567
01:07:08,014 --> 01:07:08,314
Thank you.

568
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:11,457
Thank you.

569
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:22,345
I guess I'll offer one final comment that I think if you give us time to bring our principals and the assistant principals to form a working group around this,

570
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:31,573
I think that we'll be able to come up with some solutions that address all the concerns, especially the last ones that you just brought up.

571
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:44,904
Because if we have an automatic system that's just going to broadcast messages home, I don't have confidence in honestly any student management system necessarily discerning away from an automatic send.

572
01:07:45,405 --> 01:07:45,645
All right.

573
01:07:46,115 --> 01:07:47,295
So those are some things.

574
01:07:47,355 --> 01:08:00,839
But if you give us some time to maybe work with a working group to really thought map this and to come up with some solutions, I think that may be the best way to go without a resolution.

575
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:02,940
Member McLaughlin.

576
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,560
I think that's a great idea.

577
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:11,242
And I think through the chair to my colleague member Rousseau, I think that's a really important

578
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,783
resonating point in point in point.

579
01:08:16,244 --> 01:08:29,936
So I think that's great and in the working group I would ask that you consider including families as part of the stakeholders of that working group so that you can have some feedback from community members and diverse community members that can share

580
01:08:30,656 --> 01:08:34,358
their experience both around what could work and what might not work.

581
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:41,223
And I'm happy, I'm not trying to give people more work, I'm happy to volunteer in any way that I can to help move that along.

582
01:08:41,263 --> 01:08:42,964
But I think that would be really important.

583
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:51,469
And ultimately, the goal is really about building relationships with families and making sure that there are the most positive outcomes for our kids.

584
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:53,090
Thank you.

585
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:53,790
Thank you.

586
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,071
Ms.

587
01:08:55,091 --> 01:08:55,231
Bradley.

588
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:56,492
Thank you.

589
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,321
Hi, Nicole Bramley.

590
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:01,963
I need to admit my address.

591
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:04,285
I think these are really good points.

592
01:09:05,486 --> 01:09:06,748
Even the last point, obviously.

593
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:16,658
I just don't know how a whole system is going to say, yes, it should go to this family, but no, we need to worry about this family, especially if it's an email.

594
01:09:16,718 --> 01:09:19,221
That seems like a monster.

595
01:09:21,837 --> 01:09:27,561
you know, size situation that seems impossible, right?

596
01:09:27,721 --> 01:09:43,011
I mean, but I do think in elementary, there are, you know, forms that are used that are age appropriate, you know, consequences that are age appropriate, discussions, you know, all of that stuff.

597
01:09:43,051 --> 01:09:44,572
I think Mrs. Glizny had a great point.

598
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:50,356
I think Memogram had a great point too, saying that it's great that we're,

599
01:09:51,707 --> 01:10:01,554
rolling things out, but if we're rolling so many things out that are especially falling on teachers' shoulders, that really concerns me because I feel like how much more can they do?

600
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:04,796
And I had asked Ms.

601
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:10,120
Bowen too, is the incident report, this draft, replacing the current incident report?

602
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,122
Because there are incident reports.

603
01:10:12,882 --> 01:10:16,785
So the incident report, if you come to your assistant principal,

604
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:22,742
and say there's a problem, would that be the new draft form of it?

605
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:25,003
Would that be a separate one altogether?

606
01:10:26,784 --> 01:10:27,404
Just curious.

607
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:33,768
I can never figure out how to turn it on either, so I get it.

608
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:37,538
That was in addition to what was already there.

609
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:40,119
That was an additional form that was created.

610
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:48,223
So the other forms that are already at the high school, those ones would continue to be in use, and that was in addition to it.

611
01:10:50,124 --> 01:10:53,566
So I think that that sort of falls to Jenny's point too.

612
01:10:54,267 --> 01:11:01,811
So if we have an incident report that we're using, who's deciphering what incident report we're using at what point?

613
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,972
If the incident report that I got said,

614
01:11:04,448 --> 01:11:12,852
you know, there was this incident and explains it, why that form and not this form, just out of curiosity.

615
01:11:12,872 --> 01:11:22,177
This was just a draft based on what had been said and trying to bring the administrators together to see what else could be created.

616
01:11:22,717 --> 01:11:28,660
But then, again, now that we gained the additional access, it was like,

617
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,842
This actually gives more information than what the form could ever give.

618
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:44,007
So, I am fully in support of not using that additional time at all and continuing with the talking points.

619
01:11:44,728 --> 01:11:50,931
Now that the referral portal is open and parents can actually see, oh, you know,

620
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:57,892
This happened, I received a message, I looked in, I saw it, and the student can actually see it.

621
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:00,674
So they could never see it before.

622
01:12:01,174 --> 01:12:04,957
So I actually feel like this is eye-opening for them as well.

623
01:12:05,297 --> 01:12:07,879
Can the students see the same things that the parents see?

624
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:11,381
I know when I look on, I can see their pictures, their grades.

625
01:12:12,449 --> 01:12:13,130
absences.

626
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:14,291
They're seeing the same thing.

627
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:15,431
I never looked on it with them.

628
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:16,852
I've only looked on it as a parent.

629
01:12:16,892 --> 01:12:17,573
So I'm just curious.

630
01:12:17,893 --> 01:12:18,934
So they can see the referrals too.

631
01:12:19,314 --> 01:12:21,576
When did that referral go on?

632
01:12:21,756 --> 01:12:26,060
It just, I want to say, is it a week, Dr. Cushing or Ms.

633
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:26,540
Galusi?

634
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,501
I don't know.

635
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,601
I think it's been about a week.

636
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:29,682
It's fairly recent.

637
01:12:33,905 --> 01:12:36,226
I go on School Brains pretty regularly.

638
01:12:36,266 --> 01:12:42,929
I actually have a reminder on my phone to check it pretty regularly just to see missing assignments, anything that maybe I didn't know about.

639
01:12:44,049 --> 01:12:46,130
And I did not notice the referral.

640
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:50,832
So I only look on my phone, but I just noticed it's way at the bottom.

641
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:53,433
So I don't know if it's something that.

642
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:57,096
have all these little tiny boxes.

643
01:12:57,316 --> 01:13:02,280
So, Miss Bowen just showed me that on the laptop but on the phone it looks completely different.

644
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,524
So I don't, I just saying that when I look on my phone which is the only place I access school brains.

645
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:09,005
It's done at the bottom.

646
01:13:10,091 --> 01:13:13,333
I've probably looked at school brains three times this week, just knowing report cards were coming out.

647
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:18,617
And I didn't even know that that was there or notice it in my scrolling.

648
01:13:19,098 --> 01:13:20,519
So just to make a point of that.

649
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:30,386
And then I think when it comes down to really the bottom line, and I think Jenny or Melanie might've said it, it's really just the communication at the end of the day.

650
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:36,871
So the incident report that we got was great if we were told about it too.

651
01:13:37,856 --> 01:13:50,341
So we had had some incidents that happened that we were just not even told about at the end of the day, that even had our child's signature on them, which I found very concerning that no email or phone call had happened.

652
01:13:50,881 --> 01:14:04,347
So I think you can have a new form, an old form, but at the end of the day, if no one reaches out to you, even though our child made us aware of it, she didn't come home with the form either.

653
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:13,954
So I just think at the end of the day, however we're communicating, as long as the communication is a real time, I think that that probably helps.

654
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:15,435
I think someone mentioned the word trust.

655
01:14:16,895 --> 01:14:25,458
And I think that that would have been helpful even in some of the situations that I've heard of, that it does make you feel very insecure.

656
01:14:26,019 --> 01:14:28,439
So I just wanted to throw that out there.

657
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,540
So thank you.

658
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:29,980
Thank you.

659
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:30,560
Thank you, Ms.

660
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:30,920
Brantley.

661
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,741
Member McLaughlin.

662
01:14:33,274 --> 01:14:33,854
Yeah, thank you.

663
01:14:33,934 --> 01:14:40,896
I just in final, um, yeah, if there's forms that are being signed by our students, then obviously I think those should go home.

664
01:14:41,556 --> 01:14:58,219
Um, but, uh, in addition, I would love to know if we can have some sort of a timeline on, um, when a training can occur, um, on school brains for families and, um, when we might hear back, um, in terms of feedback from a working group.

665
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,440
So I'd love to know what the superintendent

666
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:08,049
and or Dr. Cushing and others would think would be a reasonable timeline for that so we can know when to expect more information.

667
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:15,915
I would say the training for families to learn how to use the talking points.

668
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:19,097
Thank you, school brains.

669
01:15:25,462 --> 01:15:26,222
30 to 45 days.

670
01:15:27,303 --> 01:15:52,649
Yeah, I was thinking definitely by March in order to get the training created, whether it's gonna be a video, I'm not sure if it would be, could it be on Zoom and then have it on video or do it like a webinar and then send it out so that everyone knows this is what it looks like with the screenshots and so that they know where to click and again,

671
01:15:54,429 --> 01:16:04,492
If you're using a telephone, it's gonna look differently than if you're on a computer, but to at least highlight those key areas for families to be able to look at.

672
01:16:04,952 --> 01:16:18,236
So I'm thinking like March, we should be able to have families, the training completed, get families trained, and in March as well, have a working group going.

673
01:16:19,257 --> 01:16:23,218
So by the end of March, to be able to report out some information.

674
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:26,452
Thank you very much.

675
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:33,504
We have number three, report on continued integrated mathematics pathways pilot, Ms.

676
01:16:33,524 --> 01:16:35,727
Faiza Khan, Director of Mathematics.

677
01:16:36,328 --> 01:16:36,629
Welcome.

678
01:16:43,462 --> 01:16:44,262
Yep, there you go.

679
01:16:44,322 --> 01:16:44,803
Okay, great.

680
01:16:44,883 --> 01:16:46,183
Thank you.

681
01:16:46,784 --> 01:16:48,325
Thanks for having me here.

682
01:16:48,345 --> 01:17:05,253
I was here almost around the same time last year, and I was here informing the community about our pilot year, the first pilot year, which is going on right now for Integrated Math Pathways 1.

683
01:17:08,891 --> 01:17:10,852
integrated math pathways course one.

684
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:19,476
So I would like to start out today by going over the workings of the equity committee.

685
01:17:21,477 --> 01:17:24,319
On the high school side, we have about eight teachers.

686
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,841
We have gotten together very often.

687
01:17:27,961 --> 01:17:31,863
We have read through the sections of a book from NCTM.

688
01:17:33,184 --> 01:17:40,913
We have looked at the existing course offerings and discussed the pros and cons of continuing on with this pathway.

689
01:17:42,374 --> 01:17:47,440
We have also continued to work and refine on the course descriptions of this pathway.

690
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,502
which will be course one, course two, course three.

691
01:17:51,943 --> 01:18:05,272
We have looked at different programs that through which we can use, we can teach integrated math pathways to our students on the vocational side and on the high school side.

692
01:18:05,812 --> 01:18:09,815
We have reached out to the districts that offer the pathway.

693
01:18:09,835 --> 01:18:17,220
They're about to offer it or they have been offering it to pick their brains on what's working and what's not working for them.

694
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:26,804
So currently we are teaching only select lessons from course two and course three, but this was our first pilot year.

695
01:18:26,884 --> 01:18:37,689
So we did three sections of English learner math in using the integrated pathways instead of algebra one.

696
01:18:37,889 --> 01:18:41,891
And we had in our three general ed classrooms,

697
01:18:43,413 --> 01:18:50,356
which are inclusion, we did the integrated math pathways in those general ed classrooms as well.

698
01:18:51,216 --> 01:19:02,561
And while I do want to thank the entire eight members of the high school for their hard work, I do want to highlight the work done by Ms.

699
01:19:02,581 --> 01:19:03,261
Megan Coyne.

700
01:19:04,321 --> 01:19:05,742
She had stayed right

701
01:19:06,222 --> 01:19:10,183
Beside me, she continued to take the lead in discussing it.

702
01:19:10,903 --> 01:19:21,026
She organized the materials, and she gave me excellent ideas about representing it in multiple formats.

703
01:19:21,066 --> 01:19:22,026
So thank you, Ms.

704
01:19:22,046 --> 01:19:25,087
Coyne, and thank you so much to the entire equity committee.

705
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:38,527
Next slide is where we look at how mathematics education across the globe takes place versus what we do here in general.

706
01:19:39,028 --> 01:19:44,252
On the left-hand side, we see the Algebra I geometry and Algebra II course offerings.

707
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:50,357
This had been happening a lot up until like six or seven years ago.

708
01:19:51,799 --> 01:20:01,693
And now we see the shift going towards what we see done universally, which is Math 1, Math 2, and Math 3.

709
01:20:03,316 --> 01:20:04,898
When we go to the next slide,

710
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:15,465
It shows us the two pathways, the traditional pathway versus the integrated math pathways.

711
01:20:16,065 --> 01:20:19,487
I took this slide right off of my presentation last year.

712
01:20:21,028 --> 01:20:24,190
What I do want to highlight on this slide is basically

713
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:26,512
two points.

714
01:20:26,612 --> 01:20:38,501
Number one is that algebra one, geometry, algebra two, whether you take that pathway or you take the math one, math two, math three pathway, the end result is going to be the same.

715
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:40,802
And we'll see it in subsequent slides.

716
01:20:42,263 --> 01:20:44,125
There is a difference of philosophy.

717
01:20:45,686 --> 01:20:56,389
The schools who have done integrated math pathways one, two, and three, they believe that in real life problems do not come in boxes of algebras and geometries.

718
01:20:56,829 --> 01:20:58,989
They come in real life situations.

719
01:20:59,069 --> 01:21:11,833
So a spiraling math approach is better to teach the students about the skills, and then they can take it and transfer it in real life.

720
01:21:13,913 --> 01:21:41,489
And the other thing about the integrated pathway versus the traditional mathematics pathways is that it allows multiple entry points for our EL students and anybody actually that comes to us because now we are globalizing our mathematics education versus just keeping it entirely to the way we learn here in US.

721
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:47,488
Next slide shows us why we should do it.

722
01:21:48,508 --> 01:21:53,450
The first one I mentioned, spiraling and interwoven mathematical concepts.

723
01:21:53,530 --> 01:22:01,574
So we are not calling it exclusively algebra one, geometry and algebra two, but basically concepts build on each other.

724
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:06,356
And that's how studies have shown that the long-term memory works.

725
01:22:07,837 --> 01:22:21,447
We will be through this pathway we continue to push students to continue their practice of math skills, not that you know you learn this in geometry and you took MCAS and now let's put it on the side.

726
01:22:23,228 --> 01:22:34,072
We also see the difference in approach of mathematical tasks versus mastering the algorithm, which we are currently doing in Algebra 1 geometry.

727
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:39,154
And Algebra 2 is that you just remember the procedure, and this is how you solve it.

728
01:22:39,495 --> 01:22:46,277
Whereas I have learned these skills, and how do I combine them to solve a problem in math and in real life?

729
01:22:48,138 --> 01:22:58,666
We also see, and that covers my fifth point here, and the fourth point, we want to shoot for strong problem solving and reasoning skills.

730
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:09,894
Note that, again, I gave you this procedure to solve linear equations, and you shall get to it if you follow step one, step two, and step three.

731
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:21,268
We are hoping to see positive impact on mathematical achievement and better results on the assessments in the longer run.

732
01:23:22,869 --> 01:23:28,293
So when we go to the next slide, we see how DESE has proposed it.

733
01:23:28,413 --> 01:23:29,594
This is right out of their 2017

734
01:23:31,878 --> 01:23:34,239
frameworks and a presentation that they did.

735
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:40,763
Math 1, Math 2, Math 3 versus Algebra 1, Geometry and Algebra 2.

736
01:23:41,323 --> 01:23:46,966
Fourth year is open to taking many different courses.

737
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:59,812
And of course, one big advantage will be able to take the calculus as a fourth year course in your senior year.

738
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:06,418
And we'll see that in subsequent slides if we move on to the next one.

739
01:24:07,659 --> 01:24:10,702
This is a very comprehensive chart.

740
01:24:10,722 --> 01:24:13,285
I have tried to color code it as much as I could.

741
01:24:13,905 --> 01:24:17,849
But one important thing to keep in mind is that this

742
01:24:21,031 --> 01:24:29,453
One thing I would like to propose that everybody notices is that there is no more algebra one at the ninth grade level.

743
01:24:30,033 --> 01:24:39,155
If students have taken eighth grade algebra at the middle schools, they will be going either to geometry or geometry honors.

744
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:46,536
And all the students from our illustrative mathematics group will be going on to integrated math one.

745
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:53,867
When we move on to the next slide, and I will toggle back to this one shortly.

746
01:24:54,287 --> 01:25:03,753
So if we move on to the next slide, this highlights the course pathway for our incoming ninth grade students only.

747
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:09,517
For a more detailed path, I have put a link at the bottom that says course sequence.

748
01:25:10,057 --> 01:25:12,398
for MHS math department courses.

749
01:25:13,658 --> 01:25:25,462
But over here, if you look at the blue box, you will be able to see that if students enter from their standard eighth grade math class into integrated math one.

750
01:25:26,082 --> 01:25:44,429
honors that they will, if they follow that path, that will take them to calculus because what we have done is that pushed and pushed some standards from the year four course and year three course down to

751
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:53,341
our ninth grade and 10th grade level into that honors track, if I may call that.

752
01:25:53,982 --> 01:26:02,093
And if we just continue on with the integrated math 1CP, then we have a whole slew of electives that can open up.

753
01:26:03,677 --> 01:26:12,121
I do want to address one question that might come to me later on right here, because we are here.

754
01:26:13,162 --> 01:26:24,268
The equity committee members have been very cognizant of the fact that our CP students in ninth grade might want to

755
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:34,335
switch the track and get into honors in the 10th grade or in the 11th grade so that they make it to the calculus path.

756
01:26:34,915 --> 01:26:48,785
If they want to do that, we are creating a mini work packet, something that we can offer to the students over the summer that they can take catch up with that work

757
01:26:49,381 --> 01:26:52,462
and be on the honors track at any point in time.

758
01:26:52,822 --> 01:27:06,367
So that gives students a segue because we wanted to be sure that we are meeting the student where they're at and not just compartmentalizing them into a particular track right from the beginning.

759
01:27:06,407 --> 01:27:14,971
And that's why I'm hesitant to call it tracking and hesitant to use the word track because tracking is traditionally used for

760
01:27:15,811 --> 01:27:22,316
just boxing a student into or labeling them as a CP student or as an honor student.

761
01:27:22,676 --> 01:27:39,108
This will take that pressure off of the student and the families and the students will be allowed to go to the honors track any point in time, just as far as they make sure that work is done, the summer work is done.

762
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:46,163
Moving on, our next slide is what the teachers are teaching right now.

763
01:27:47,864 --> 01:27:58,731
And again, we'll continue to call it pilot for year two and year three, but we'll take year, first year, which is ninth grade off of that label of pilot.

764
01:28:00,712 --> 01:28:04,314
Seems like everybody's in a good comfortable position with that.

765
01:28:04,474 --> 01:28:08,417
We are only running CP currently, but we are,

766
01:28:09,018 --> 01:28:13,138
um offering cp and honors both this coming school year because

767
01:28:13,939 --> 01:28:16,240
we feel like we are in a good position to do that.

768
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:21,041
We have looked at our standards and seen what can be done.

769
01:28:21,841 --> 01:28:30,343
Next slide gives you a synopsis of what we are teaching in that integrated math one CP course.

770
01:28:30,883 --> 01:28:34,224
There are algebra and geometry sections in that.

771
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:40,445
And then when we move on to the next slide, we go to the integrated math pathway two,

772
01:28:41,045 --> 01:28:42,746
which will be piloted this year.

773
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:59,154
We will have at least five to six sections of it because our integrated math CP students from our EL group and our general education group, inclusion group, will move on to this course.

774
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:05,457
So it'll be a pilot for this particular year because this is the first time we are teaching it.

775
01:29:07,031 --> 01:29:15,388
If we go on to the slide after this one, you see again that there are some algebra and some geometry concepts here, all mixed up.

776
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:29,466
And one thing is that this integrated math two course will be for sophomore students and they take MCAS towards the end of it.

777
01:29:29,506 --> 01:29:42,772
So I'm hoping, we are hopeful as a committee that the spiraling will help students review rather than, you know, again, putting it on the side after ninth grade algebra one.

778
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:47,928
Next slide is the integrated mathematics three.

779
01:29:49,490 --> 01:30:03,981
And I plan to be here next year and give you an update on how integrated math one is going and how integrated math two will be going at that point in time.

780
01:30:04,541 --> 01:30:07,464
But we'll be getting ready to offer this course next year.

781
01:30:09,345 --> 01:30:18,332
And then when we go on to the next slide, here are the topics that are covered in this particular course.

782
01:30:19,492 --> 01:30:27,758
Again, one thing to note is that the data analysis and statistics here is much heavier than it used to be.

783
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:31,861
And it used to be mostly in our geometry course.

784
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:36,585
And having it here will keep it fresh in our students' minds for

785
01:30:37,505 --> 01:30:41,086
any statistics course or an AP statistics course.

786
01:30:42,606 --> 01:30:44,627
And that was the last slide.

787
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:54,709
I just want to say thank you again for having me here and many thanks again to the work of the equity committee, especially the high school group at this point.

788
01:30:55,749 --> 01:30:56,129
Thank you.

789
01:30:57,269 --> 01:30:59,550
Thank you very much for the presentation.

790
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:00,310
Thank you.

791
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:01,090
Appreciate it.

792
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,090
No problem.

793
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:03,550
Any questions, please let me know.

794
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:05,171
No, I think we're good.

795
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:06,051
Thank you.

796
01:31:08,015 --> 01:31:08,295
Thanks.

797
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:09,056
Very informative.

798
01:31:09,816 --> 01:31:12,879
Number four, we have dyslexia screening and intervention update.

799
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:13,399
Ms.

800
01:31:13,599 --> 01:31:16,802
Suzanne Galluzzi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instructions.

801
01:31:16,962 --> 01:31:17,082
Ms.

802
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:17,422
Galluzzi.

803
01:31:17,563 --> 01:31:18,363
Hi, good evening.

804
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:19,204
Good evening.

805
01:31:20,465 --> 01:31:21,045
Okay, so

806
01:31:22,884 --> 01:31:29,973
This, I have a report that was requested by the committee by committee members, Paul Rousseau, Sharon Hayes, and Jenny Graham.

807
01:31:30,774 --> 01:31:42,207
And so in typical format to the previous report that I presented to this body, I am going to read the questions that were a part of this report and answer them.

808
01:31:43,658 --> 01:31:52,164
So the first one was NWA MAP does not include assessments for nonsense word decoding or rapid automatic naming of letters.

809
01:31:53,165 --> 01:31:55,046
Both recommended in the DESE guidelines.

810
01:31:55,086 --> 01:31:56,667
How are we assessing those areas?

811
01:31:56,747 --> 01:31:59,549
How were we screening prior to MAP?

812
01:32:00,907 --> 01:32:01,807
So that is correct.

813
01:32:03,468 --> 01:32:16,671
MAP currently, they have just in December of this year rolled out, of course, a new part of their program that includes both of those components if districts so wish to add those on.

814
01:32:17,891 --> 01:32:25,533
But in lieu of that, what we've done is, and I've presented to this body before, the elementary reading department teachers,

815
01:32:26,193 --> 01:32:36,423
have been trained and received ongoing professional development in DIBLS, which is Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills program.

816
01:32:37,023 --> 01:32:43,710
That fully checks all of DESE's boxes for the dyslexia screening guidelines.

817
01:32:44,531 --> 01:32:49,755
And so what those teachers have done is they're assessing all students

818
01:32:50,804 --> 01:32:52,766
K to two using the dibbles.

819
01:32:52,986 --> 01:33:08,299
So students that do not receive reading services, the reading teachers in every respective building have taken those students and given them the dibbles portions for rapid automatic naming, as well as nonsense word decoding.

820
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,742
They're finishing up those assessments actually as we speak.

821
01:33:13,323 --> 01:33:16,886
And then as we do with all data, it will be,

822
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:21,280
analyzed, I'll get to that in some subsequent answers.

823
01:33:23,262 --> 01:33:33,813
Prior to this, the district, when they piloted Lexia and MAP at the time, the Columbus School,

824
01:33:35,072 --> 01:33:53,387
What we did was we created, because we knew that this was a gap then as well, they were created district-wide wind block benchmarks, as well as we used a RAN assessment that used color coding that students received and teachers administered that one-on-one.

825
01:33:54,669 --> 01:33:58,632
We made the shift now because we have trained teachers in the DIBLS system.

826
01:34:01,148 --> 01:34:02,168
and its best practice.

827
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:11,793
So number two, what number of students have been identified as at risk for dyslexia, lacking specific foundational skills each year in grade levels K through two?

828
01:34:12,994 --> 01:34:20,818
So we have our universal screeners, as I've spoken about before, to assess students in the district three times a year.

829
01:34:21,939 --> 01:34:27,682
At each cycle, data is analyzed to inform instruction and determine student needs.

830
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,662
excuse me, to determine student supports based on the need.

831
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:37,829
And then the level of tiered instruction is decided based on those data sets.

832
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:45,918
So that's consistent with the MTSS model through the Department of Education.

833
01:34:46,536 --> 01:35:00,380
And so if students, so the tiered system, tier one whole group, when you move through the tiers, tier two is typically where you see interventions start to be administered to students.

834
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:06,802
Those can happen both in the general education classroom as well as outside of the general education classroom.

835
01:35:07,142 --> 01:35:15,665
So I just wanna be really clear that when we see that students need tier two support, it does not automatically result in them receiving

836
01:35:16,147 --> 01:35:17,047
reading support.

837
01:35:18,328 --> 01:35:28,971
Teachers during that wind block, that targeted intervention time, teachers are also administering tier two supports during that time as well.

838
01:35:30,912 --> 01:35:40,875
They're also administering it throughout the day, but I'm just specifically speaking to the wind block, which is when most of the reading services through the elementary reading department are happening.

839
01:35:45,162 --> 01:35:46,482
Okay, question three.

840
01:35:47,563 --> 01:35:51,064
How many K through two students are receiving targeted intervention?

841
01:35:52,344 --> 01:36:06,568
So as I mentioned just a minute ago about the tier two interventions, if I just look at the elementary reading department, which I've explained before, but just for anybody at home, I'll just explain one more time.

842
01:36:07,008 --> 01:36:10,349
The elementary reading department is comprised of reading specialists.

843
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,090
Those are teachers that

844
01:36:12,765 --> 01:36:15,668
typically fall with what people might know as title one.

845
01:36:16,288 --> 01:36:34,184
So schools within the district that qualify for title one, some of those teachers may be paid out of that bucket, but we also have like remedial reading or reading specialists that quite honestly, all of them are doing the same job, just that their salaries may be paid out of different buckets.

846
01:36:34,524 --> 01:36:40,269
So we're all together in the elementary reading department and we're all aligned because the work is the same.

847
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:58,691
If I look at just that department, because I think this report was really trying to target that, this chart here refers to the number of students for the past five years at each grade level, K to two, within each building that have received reading services.

848
01:36:59,252 --> 01:37:08,898
I also put in here to note the number of reading teachers within the elementary reading department that are at each building.

849
01:37:09,631 --> 01:37:15,633
So for example, the Brooks has two teachers, the McGlynn has four, the Misituk has three, the Roberts has three.

850
01:37:16,033 --> 01:37:29,677
It's important to note that those are not, those are reflective just of the elementary reading department, not of special education or EL, which also take on some reading instruction responsibilities.

851
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:52,916
In appendix B, I also did include the total number of students at each building and within each grade level, because I think it's important to note, because this is gonna come up at a different question, the number of reading staff is based on student need.

852
01:37:53,937 --> 01:37:57,139
And so you will see that reflected in that, you know,

853
01:38:00,376 --> 01:38:04,197
Population numbers are completely different for some of these buildings.

854
01:38:04,217 --> 01:38:16,320
When you're talking about the Mississippi with only 391 students and the Roberts with 552, but one of those buildings qualifies for title one, one does not.

855
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:23,602
And so the reading staff numbers look the same, but because the population is so large at the Roberts,

856
01:38:25,196 --> 01:38:34,884
they're able to service the students that they need to, and the MISITUC numbers are quite lower, so they're able to service more students, if I'm making myself clear, based on population.

857
01:38:34,944 --> 01:38:40,588
So we do make sure that staffing is equipped for the grade, excuse me, for the school.

858
01:38:42,009 --> 01:38:45,352
So question four had several different components.

859
01:38:45,392 --> 01:38:53,499
So the first one says, what criteria is used to determine intervention for a student who is identified as at risk by the dyslexia screener?

860
01:38:54,884 --> 01:39:00,948
So dyslexia screeners screen a broad area of abilities.

861
01:39:01,528 --> 01:39:12,536
And so I just wanted to take what we're now using in the Medford Public Schools, which is the DIBLS assessment platform, just to show you the areas that they're assessing.

862
01:39:12,956 --> 01:39:20,101
And so those components are phonological awareness, the ability to recognize and manipulate the sound structure of language,

863
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:26,874
rapid automatic naming, which is the ability to quickly retrieve information from phonological memory.

864
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:39,228
Under the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines, they state that rapid automatic naming refers to students' ability to rapidly name a limited set of repeatedly presented known objects or letters.

865
01:39:39,848 --> 01:39:42,892
This is testing the automaticity for students because

866
01:39:43,621 --> 01:40:03,406
If students can't retrieve well-known objects or letters, it could flag a reading disability, mostly because what we've learned by brain, how brain interprets and learns how to read, is that orthographic mapping piece.

867
01:40:03,446 --> 01:40:07,788
So what are students putting into their memories and able to retrieve?

868
01:40:07,988 --> 01:40:08,968
If that's difficulty,

869
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:28,369
that's a flag, but I do wanna put a little like footnote kind of caveat on this one particular area because in kindergarten, some students may show up as a flag because the way this works is the ran part of the assessment is by letters.

870
01:40:29,966 --> 01:40:37,153
Okay, so we don't expect students to necessarily know all their letters when this portion is given.

871
01:40:38,294 --> 01:40:47,783
By the end of the year, we see a difference in that data, but it's important to note that all the educators are mindful of that, not flagging.

872
01:40:49,413 --> 01:40:50,814
kindergarten students at the very beginning.

873
01:40:51,635 --> 01:40:54,316
And that's where the multiple measures come in.

874
01:40:54,897 --> 01:40:56,558
And we look at other assessment data.

875
01:40:57,238 --> 01:41:02,822
So alphabetic principle is another one, the ability to associate letters with sounds to read words.

876
01:41:03,702 --> 01:41:11,948
And then word reading, the ability to fluently and accurately read words using sound symbol correspondence and sight word recognition.

877
01:41:13,177 --> 01:41:16,039
So those are the pieces that the DIBLs will assess for.

878
01:41:16,059 --> 01:41:18,380
Those are the pieces that are flagged.

879
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:39,054
So on the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines, I included the grade levels K, one, and two for what they want to see the dyslexia screeners assess for at all three times of the year, beginning of the year, middle of the year, and end of the year.

880
01:41:40,342 --> 01:41:44,765
DIBELS meets all of this criteria that's here in these charts for your reference.

881
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:59,736
What the elementary reading department educators have been trained in and the way that DIBELS is set up is there is a color-coded system when analyzing the data, very similar to MAP.

882
01:42:00,397 --> 01:42:06,501
So when I presented on the MAP data with my team, we could see those colors and where

883
01:42:07,014 --> 01:42:10,215
The concern, right, is the red and the yellow.

884
01:42:11,115 --> 01:42:14,356
We're not concerned with blue and green, and DIBLS is the same.

885
01:42:14,956 --> 01:42:19,578
So when teachers are inputting the data, they can see where the flags are.

886
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:28,000
And so when the red colors come up, we're looking at the areas, those four areas I just referred to.

887
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,801
Where is it that the students are having difficulty with?

888
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:33,922
Because that is going to target the instruction.

889
01:42:34,747 --> 01:42:47,637
So any students that qualify for reading support, we are no longer having teachers assigned to a classroom and you're working with, it used to be like the lowest six students in that group.

890
01:42:48,377 --> 01:42:52,020
We are looking at data across the grade level at every school.

891
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:59,525
And we're looking at what the data is showing us about the students that are struggling, those students that are in red that are struggling.

892
01:43:00,066 --> 01:43:02,708
We're looking to identify those students

893
01:43:03,388 --> 01:43:16,131
and then support them where they are, which is why I take the reading staff and within that, the reading teachers are tiered within what they're providing during that wind block.

894
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:23,973
So that the students that are read, they're going to be with a specific teacher because they're all needing that same content.

895
01:43:24,753 --> 01:43:28,094
Another teacher might be taking the students, maybe there's two groups of red,

896
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:34,260
maybe there's another group that's working with the students that are flagged in yellow or in that one area.

897
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:47,926
And so students are never, I'm kind of getting ahead of myself, so this is one of the other questions, but that way students are getting what they need for supports, but they're also not just released back into a classroom.

898
01:43:48,246 --> 01:43:55,889
There's a tier, like a step down approach to the reading services that they are getting and that they are receiving.

899
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:58,070
I hope that makes sense.

900
01:44:01,189 --> 01:44:13,060
And that way, at each data cycle, we're able to review how we're grouping students, how many days they're receiving, and what the instruction is that they're receiving.

901
01:44:14,141 --> 01:44:17,043
And those teachers, when they have the students, they're doing progress monitoring.

902
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:23,509
So they're doing assessments within the three benchmarks that we're doing, beginning, middle, and end.

903
01:44:26,485 --> 01:44:27,746
Who provides the support?

904
01:44:27,766 --> 01:44:37,593
I think I've referenced that in terms of elementary reading, but I've also mentioned that depending on student needs, it may come from special education department, the EL department.

905
01:44:38,154 --> 01:44:48,221
I think it's important to note though that there are several EL students receiving both EL services as well as elementary reading department services.

906
01:44:49,642 --> 01:44:55,807
And it's very important to just clarify again that students all should be receiving

907
01:44:56,621 --> 01:44:59,583
tiered instruction from their classroom teachers as well.

908
01:45:00,604 --> 01:45:08,090
So any student that is going out to the elementary reading department also should be working with their classroom teacher on the same targeted needs.

909
01:45:09,552 --> 01:45:12,714
C, does the amount of support at each building differ?

910
01:45:13,235 --> 01:45:14,816
I think I covered that one, hopefully.

911
01:45:15,436 --> 01:45:19,260
What is the exit criteria, which I've spoke to a little bit.

912
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,402
I can just drill that down a little bit.

913
01:45:22,642 --> 01:45:22,923
We use,

914
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:37,125
the multiple measures of data, but when we're looking at the dibbles and the map, we are making those decisions, as I just said, based on the tiered needs that the students have.

915
01:45:37,765 --> 01:45:43,108
I'm in the middle of those conversations right now with some of the schools, there is some shifting.

916
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:53,654
So there are some students that may not require all five days because they're approaching like that next color coding.

917
01:45:53,734 --> 01:45:54,354
And so they're,

918
01:45:55,751 --> 01:46:03,936
going to be working on the skills they need to have them ready to transition back into the general education classroom.

919
01:46:04,837 --> 01:46:07,719
All of those decisions are made at the school level.

920
01:46:08,179 --> 01:46:17,105
There are conversations based on data with the reading team, the principals, and myself.

921
01:46:19,549 --> 01:46:37,585
And I do think, I don't, there was a question here on communication, but I do wanna just say all decisions that are made about students being selected, not selected, excuse me, qualifying for reading services, that was a poor choice of words.

922
01:46:38,918 --> 01:46:44,581
as well as when the data has shown that they're ready or no longer need those services.

923
01:46:45,962 --> 01:46:47,983
All of that is communicated with families.

924
01:46:48,583 --> 01:47:00,209
There is a letter and purposely that letter includes all reading staff names on it because their services are fluid depending on the tier of instruction they need with the reading staff.

925
01:47:02,426 --> 01:47:07,251
How is progress monitored of at-risk students who are not receiving interventions?

926
01:47:09,814 --> 01:47:13,859
It's the expectation of Memphis Public Schools that all students are receiving interventions if needed.

927
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:20,125
If you want to drill down on that or ask me more specific questions, I would be happy to answer that.

928
01:47:20,926 --> 01:47:22,047
How are parents notified?

929
01:47:23,132 --> 01:47:26,335
So we've already highlighted about talking points.

930
01:47:27,496 --> 01:47:31,399
Parents receive their child's MAP assessment data.

931
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:35,783
Every time it's administered, it will go home at elementary.

932
01:47:36,284 --> 01:47:40,027
For the first one, it's the report card conferences.

933
01:47:40,768 --> 01:47:44,231
And then for each one, the middle of the year, it will be sent home.

934
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:51,245
And then at the end of the year, it goes home with the report card on the last day.

935
01:47:51,866 --> 01:47:56,750
In addition to that, I just mentioned the communication if students are receiving services.

936
01:47:59,387 --> 01:48:16,712
And if students are really struggling, there are sometimes students that, you know, they're a little slower to making progress, or you're having these level of interventions, and they're still not the level of progress you want to see.

937
01:48:17,392 --> 01:48:26,175
And so oftentimes, that's when the student support system should be used, and teachers will put the student through the SST.

938
01:48:27,651 --> 01:48:30,554
One of the first steps of the SST is notifying the parent.

939
01:48:31,414 --> 01:48:36,679
So they should be notified that there's some additional concerns that they would like to look at with their child.

940
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:41,243
And that should happen first.

941
01:48:41,703 --> 01:48:46,888
And then they go through the team process to see if there are other interventions.

942
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:49,049
or other needs.

943
01:48:50,409 --> 01:48:54,512
What does a typical tier two intervention look like from a staffing perspective?

944
01:48:55,892 --> 01:48:59,374
It's based on the specific need of each individual student.

945
01:48:59,875 --> 01:49:14,703
So I think the piece I would just reiterate again with this, to not sound too redundant, is that some tier two interventions are done by classroom teachers in small group settings.

946
01:49:16,229 --> 01:49:23,237
Some tier two interventions may be outside of the classroom by the elementary reading department or an EL teacher.

947
01:49:25,099 --> 01:49:28,223
And so it depends really on the student need.

948
01:49:28,243 --> 01:49:34,450
And it's fluid based on data cycles.

949
01:49:35,871 --> 01:49:49,561
So in the future, can updated data regarding students identified at risk and receiving intervention and students exiting from intervention be provided at each MAP update?

950
01:49:49,941 --> 01:49:50,482
Yes, it can.

951
01:49:50,502 --> 01:49:53,804
I can absolutely do that.

952
01:49:55,345 --> 01:50:00,649
But I do wanna just caution again that MAP is one form of data.

953
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,992
We're now also using the DIBLS

954
01:50:05,344 --> 01:50:10,228
data, which I'm still in conversations about.

955
01:50:10,848 --> 01:50:16,452
There's a lot of movement to be made and not a lot of time.

956
01:50:17,013 --> 01:50:24,338
And so I'm really cognizant of the fact that we need a new elementary core literacy program.

957
01:50:25,298 --> 01:50:33,364
And that's what we're working on right now is that process so that next year there'll be a new literacy program

958
01:50:33,871 --> 01:50:48,436
which will be providing elementary teachers with a much more aligned program to the science of reading and to their tier one instruction, which is crucial.

959
01:50:49,516 --> 01:50:55,779
Because the materials they have right now are outdated and teachers need more because students need more.

960
01:50:56,619 --> 01:51:02,801
And so I'm really excited for that and for the professional development that is going to be crucially needed next year.

961
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:11,377
And so, but we also have the DIBLS piece, which is why it's brought in with the elementary reading department.

962
01:51:12,038 --> 01:51:17,141
But I think for right now, that's where it's living.

963
01:51:17,681 --> 01:51:21,383
And so we're going to be having conversations about what that will look like next year.

964
01:51:23,845 --> 01:51:30,149
Because there are many districts that have their reading staff assess all the students.

965
01:51:31,815 --> 01:51:40,938
And that might make sense for us for next year because we cannot, we just can't put so much on classroom teachers.

966
01:51:42,959 --> 01:51:53,483
But I also have to say that the process is important, but the conversations are equally important because sometimes the students

967
01:51:54,076 --> 01:52:01,159
that may flag in one component of the test, but not in the other or may flag on map, but not on dibbles.

968
01:52:01,219 --> 01:52:06,461
Like those conversations are important so that we can really target what the student needs.

969
01:52:07,362 --> 01:52:17,586
And I don't want to, I just want to be mindful of like, we really try to have those conversations about the whole child and how to best meet their needs.

970
01:52:19,367 --> 01:52:20,408
I hope that was helpful, but

971
01:52:27,017 --> 01:52:29,418
in like more detail, please let me know.

972
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:31,619
Thank you very much, Ms.

973
01:52:31,659 --> 01:52:32,019
Colucci.

974
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:33,340
Member Hayes.

975
01:52:35,121 --> 01:52:39,142
I feel like we're all getting very tired, but if I could just a couple of quick questions, and thank you.

976
01:52:39,202 --> 01:52:43,024
I met with you for quite a while to go over some of this, and I really appreciate that.

977
01:52:43,104 --> 01:52:46,665
And just a couple of quick clarification.

978
01:52:46,726 --> 01:52:52,008
I think these were things we already talked about privately, but good to talk about them here.

979
01:52:54,091 --> 01:53:01,516
So that question number five about how is progress monitored of at-risk students who are not receiving intervention.

980
01:53:01,876 --> 01:53:10,042
So the gist of that question was an assumption on my part that I think is true in every district that every district has limited resources.

981
01:53:10,182 --> 01:53:20,408
And so to the extent that I guess the question being when students have that red or in that red zone or whatever they want to call it, red flagged,

982
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:27,168
Are we able to service, do we automatically service every child who's in that red zone?

983
01:53:30,471 --> 01:53:38,279
Yes, but I also want to say that it's also looked at, if there's like one, there are multiple components to it.

984
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:42,744
If there's like one area that's, let's just say like indicating red,

985
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:56,872
but there's no other data to support that, then that might be an anomaly in where that student may be monitored by elementary reading staff.

986
01:53:58,054 --> 01:54:01,477
And there may be another opportunity to do progress monitoring.

987
01:54:02,864 --> 01:54:06,686
before you get to the three benchmarks of middle of the year and end of the year.

988
01:54:08,707 --> 01:54:15,271
That might be the only anomaly, but otherwise, those are the students that we're looking at first in being serviced, yes.

989
01:54:15,931 --> 01:54:27,938
I think a lot of this, too, kind of harkens back to something we were talking about earlier, that idea of what can parents hold onto to understand that if my child, if it gets to report home, I don't know if the report shows

990
01:54:29,249 --> 01:54:34,593
red, you know, for, I don't remember what the dibbles, I did it a while ago, but I don't remember anymore.

991
01:54:34,633 --> 01:54:35,494
And I think it's changed.

992
01:54:36,154 --> 01:54:41,378
Does a parent report go home that show where parents would see, oh, my child's in the red zone for this, this and this.

993
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:52,827
And so I guess that question being, and there was a flow chart that you, you linked to, and I know we talked a little bit about, is there a way to maybe,

994
01:54:54,241 --> 01:55:04,370
flesh that out a little bit for parents to the extent that you can with the understanding that teachers use their professional judgment in terms of looking at multiple pieces of information.

995
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:15,820
But again, something that parents can hold on to if they see, they feel their child is struggling and also see that they're getting this report that says, yeah, your child did struggle on this assessment in this area.

996
01:55:16,861 --> 01:55:19,243
How are we communicating to parents that

997
01:55:19,758 --> 01:55:28,332
you should expect or you can expect that we will be intervening or that we will be contacting you to talk about whether we need to intervene and what we're doing.

998
01:55:29,874 --> 01:55:31,497
I think that's probably a process that

999
01:55:33,070 --> 01:55:38,774
I think probably needs a little bit more look at, a little bit more like vetting.

1000
01:55:39,155 --> 01:56:02,732
I think right now the conversation, if the student is not already identified as needing reading services, but because of this assessment will now require reading services, there's a conversation with the teachers, with the classroom teacher and then with the reading staff that's going to pick up the child and a formal letter

1001
01:56:03,246 --> 01:56:24,064
is sent home, just as a form of documentation, but because the Dibbles piece is new to the district, this is the first year, so I mean, I guess it's somewhat like of a pilot year, that formalized piece is not, hasn't been set yet.

1002
01:56:26,606 --> 01:56:30,670
The other question I had, and again, we've talked about this, for parents whose

1003
01:56:31,553 --> 01:56:40,476
who have a child who is either receiving the tier two level support or receiving special education support in reading.

1004
01:56:40,856 --> 01:56:58,503
Is it fair to say that at this point, if they, if their child is being sent home with, or that they are somehow getting information that their child is using leveled readers or is being told to use queuing strategies, such as use the picture to help you.

1005
01:56:59,308 --> 01:57:28,606
use the context, what would make sense, those three cueing strategies, that it is very appropriate for that parent to question why that's being used, whether they first, they should, obviously I think we talked about first go to the teacher and talk about it, but that, it is fair for a parent at that point to question, given that my child has already been identified as having areas of weakness that would make,

1006
01:57:29,113 --> 01:57:31,936
those queuing strategies actually be detrimental to their progress?

1007
01:57:31,956 --> 01:57:33,998
They should question that.

1008
01:57:34,779 --> 01:57:36,461
Yes, that's fine.

1009
01:57:36,661 --> 01:57:37,702
Yes and yes and yes.

1010
01:57:39,024 --> 01:57:46,812
But yes to starting the conversation with the teacher, because I really firmly believe in the chain of communication.

1011
01:57:47,472 --> 01:57:49,695
And so it doesn't make sense to jump

1012
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:54,584
one or maybe two chairs when we have to start with the teacher.

1013
01:57:56,606 --> 01:58:10,279
I have been communicating via the elementary updates that I send to staff about this pedagogical shift from like balanced literacy to structured literacy to the science of reading and so

1014
01:58:11,704 --> 01:58:18,607
They've received that sort of expectation from me on an ongoing basis.

1015
01:58:19,567 --> 01:58:26,591
K to two teachers have received training and sustained professional development around that.

1016
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:31,353
So that is the expectation.

1017
01:58:32,273 --> 01:58:40,277
Of course, I would be surprised if we didn't have a few of those anomalies,

1018
01:58:42,034 --> 01:58:55,157
it would sadden me just a bit, but I think start with the teacher and definitely, and if they're not, if they're not happy with the teacher's response, then I would encourage them to have a conversation with the principal.

1019
01:58:55,857 --> 01:58:56,778
They could reach out to me.

1020
01:58:58,738 --> 01:59:08,160
In terms of leveled readers, full disclosure, I think the tricky part about that is that this is another reason why we need a new program.

1021
01:59:09,521 --> 01:59:09,961
And so,

1022
01:59:11,019 --> 01:59:15,222
We don't have teachers that have enough materials right now.

1023
01:59:16,123 --> 01:59:35,135
And so to me, if I were a parent, my conversation would want to be around what is happening in school and how, depending on the level of the child, not every child needs a decodable.

1024
01:59:35,235 --> 01:59:37,437
So a decodable is the piece that

1025
01:59:38,348 --> 01:59:46,997
It's that practice for reading that some students need because those phonetic skills they're learning are embedded within that decodable.

1026
01:59:47,377 --> 01:59:58,227
So the decodables aren't necessarily full of great, you know, plot and it doesn't necessarily always tell this great story because that's not the intent, right?

1027
01:59:58,247 --> 02:00:00,710
The intent is to practice those skills that they're learning.

1028
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:02,712
Not every student needs that.

1029
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:15,506
But my question around the materials that are coming home, they have every right to ask the question of the teacher, but I also would encourage them to ask the question about what's the instruction look like in school.

1030
02:00:17,247 --> 02:00:28,997
If their teacher references not having enough materials, I've been trying through the title monies to build up the decodable libraries of my elementary reading staff.

1031
02:00:29,897 --> 02:00:31,819
And so I'm hoping there would be enough

1032
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:34,261
I'm just offering this.

1033
02:00:34,982 --> 02:00:39,485
I would hope there would maybe be some resource that people could be collaborative within buildings.

1034
02:00:40,226 --> 02:00:49,194
But if there's a, if you know of through a parent or someone that there's like a dire need, then I would have them reach out to me.

1035
02:00:50,975 --> 02:00:56,680
But it definitely speaks to the crucial need for a new literacy program.

1036
02:00:58,134 --> 02:00:59,235
I would just want to clarify.

1037
02:00:59,295 --> 02:01:07,240
So my question pertained to kids who have already been identified as having weaknesses through the screener or otherwise in phonics.

1038
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:27,954
So I would suggest they should be taking home decodable readers at that point, that if they're taking home level readers, or maybe that's a conversation, but you know, there certainly are in any classroom, a percentage of kids who don't need decodables, but we're talking about kids who've already been flagged by a screener.

1039
02:01:28,379 --> 02:01:33,983
And those students should be taking home practice books that.

1040
02:01:34,284 --> 02:01:37,626
I think it's appropriate to have a conversation with the teacher first.

1041
02:01:38,187 --> 02:01:38,307
Okay.

1042
02:01:38,327 --> 02:01:39,288
All right.

1043
02:01:39,488 --> 02:01:39,788
Thank you.

1044
02:01:39,828 --> 02:01:43,111
And if it's a matter of need and supply, then reach out to me.

1045
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:43,591
Yes.

1046
02:01:43,631 --> 02:01:47,294
And with budget time coming, we should be thinking.

1047
02:01:47,314 --> 02:01:48,154
Thank you, miss.

1048
02:01:48,695 --> 02:01:48,995
Thank you.

1049
02:01:49,155 --> 02:01:49,816
Thank you so much.

1050
02:01:49,836 --> 02:01:53,619
I don't believe we don't have any presentations to the public.

1051
02:01:56,311 --> 02:01:58,312
do not have any continued business.

1052
02:01:58,432 --> 02:02:16,560
We have new business number 8-20-23-02 offered by member Hayes, resolution for new safety and discipline procedures at Medford High School, whereas the Medford Public Schools is committed to understanding and supporting the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs of our diverse student population.

1053
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:23,643
Be it resolved that the subcommittee on diversity, equity, and inclusion will meet to review the new safety and discipline procedures at the high school,

1054
02:02:24,312 --> 02:02:27,835
Data relevant to the implementation of the new procedures will also be reviewed.

1055
02:02:29,036 --> 02:02:29,616
Member Hayes.

1056
02:02:31,438 --> 02:02:33,580
Yeah, I don't think, I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory.

1057
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:51,254
I think that anytime we start looking at increased adult presence or increased supervision, just that look at it from that particular subcommittee is important to have looking at.

1058
02:02:51,929 --> 02:03:05,216
And again, looking at the data that I know is already being collected to look at how students are responding to this intervention, or this intervention, these changes in procedures and additional staffing.

1059
02:03:06,076 --> 02:03:18,342
While we know that some students have already expressed that they're really feeling much safer and feeling more comfortable at school, we also know that there can be populations of students who may not be responding the same way.

1060
02:03:19,103 --> 02:03:27,534
And we want to look at some of those issues just to make sure that everyone feels they have a voice in this, and that sense of belonging is there for all students.

1061
02:03:28,615 --> 02:03:28,955
Thank you.

1062
02:03:29,196 --> 02:03:29,937
Member McLaughlin?

1063
02:03:31,458 --> 02:03:31,819
Thank you.

1064
02:03:31,919 --> 02:03:35,323
I just also wanted to mention, especially as you're thinking about

1065
02:03:37,868 --> 02:03:55,762
the subcommittee meeting that the Universal Safety Committee, which is, and does look at the safety regarding students of various populations, be included, explicitly included or invited to that subcommittee meeting.

1066
02:03:56,883 --> 02:03:57,263
Thank you.

1067
02:03:58,464 --> 02:03:59,004
So second.

1068
02:03:59,505 --> 02:04:03,308

1078
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:46,922
Yeah, just a quick note to let folks know that we obviously talked about this last week in our committee of the whole.

1079
02:04:47,862 --> 02:04:56,825
We just wanted to make sure that this motion formally came on the floor, which is part of our rules and procedures around sending things to subcommittee.

1080
02:04:57,505 --> 02:05:02,846
And we have a tentative meeting date in mid-February that we're already working on.

1081
02:05:02,926 --> 02:05:04,547
So hoping we will

1082
02:05:05,776 --> 02:05:07,457
pass this and we can get to work.
