1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:01,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

3
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:06,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll go into effect for this season's market.

4
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:09,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,281
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

6
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:14,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Next I want to dive into a little bit something new.

7
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:16,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that new.

8
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:17,108
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been on the

9
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:34,992
[SPEAKER_05]: rising for a while, and it's something that we've been talking about as a region with some of the other health directors, about the increasing amount of products we're seeing out there.

10
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:44,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Synthetic hemp products as they're being sold, but they're actually THC,

11
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:52,379
[SPEAKER_05]: synthetic THC products that we're seeing that come out of the Delta 8 and Delta 10 products.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, the Mass.

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:05,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Agriculture regulates hemp, and it's deemed that selling and possessing Delta 8 THC products is illegal.

14
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:08,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a naturally occurring hemp.

15
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:10,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It's synthetic.

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Farm Bill did remove hemp from the Controlled Substances Act,

17
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:21,568
[SPEAKER_05]: but it did not impact control or static, um, status of synthetically derived cannabinoids.

18
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:27,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's Delta H Delta eight THC remains a controlled substance.

19
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do not allow that in Massachusetts.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, obviously, you know, the mass department of health is the agency that regulates food pursuant to one Oh five CMR 500.

21
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And the food requires that all edible products must be from approved food sources.

22
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:44,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

23
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:51,464
[SPEAKER_05]: and comply with all regulation and it prohibits the addition of CBD, hemp-derived cannabinoids, in food.

24
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:53,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not an approved food source.

25
00:01:54,666 --> 00:02:04,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, any edible product that contains hemp-derived delta-8 and or delta-10 cannot be manufactured or sold in Massachusetts.

26
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:12,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with all flavored vaping products, including hemp-derived THC vaping products with delta-8 and delta-10 are prohibited.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

28
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:24,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I sent you, and the other product we're seeing kind of grow exponentially around here is called Kratom.

29
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:35,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Kratom's from a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, but its leaves contain compounds that have psychotropic effects.

30
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be addictive.

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be the source of overdose.

32
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:41,861
[SPEAKER_05]: We see it.

33
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:48,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, coming in pill form, liquid form, as an additive.

34
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's not approved food source.

35
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not approved by the FDA.

36
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:56,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been banned in several countries due to its addiction potential.

37
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:04,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Withdrawal symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, insomnia, diarrhea, body aches.

38
00:03:05,324 --> 00:03:09,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Most recently, we heard of an overdose, unfortunately, in the city of Lowell.

39
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:14,909
[SPEAKER_05]: where a young man, these are what we call freedom shots that we were seeing pop up.

40
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:24,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Just these little bottles, not to be sold to under 21, but you'd find them in your circle keys at your local little rich sales.

41
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:27,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And now this was, I picked up this morning down the street from a smoke shop.

42
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:35,607
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently the young man and little added, this is a tiny bottle, I don't know if you can tell.

43
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:43,200
[SPEAKER_05]: But supposedly there are six, I'm telling you, there are six doses in here.

44
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,181
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not to drink more than one at a time.

45
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm telling you there are six of them.

46
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:56,744
[SPEAKER_05]: The individual put this entire thing into an energy drink and then ended up taking his life.

47
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are,

48
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:11,014
[SPEAKER_05]: The regulation I sent you, which I will be forwarding to Kevin as a draft, was written up by the Massachusetts Health Board attorneys.

49
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:19,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does cover Delta-8, Delta-10, and Kratom as banned substances.

50
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Sophie Greenbaum and Catherine and their team are going to be doing what we call an environmental scan.

51
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:32,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I went out and I bought this Delta product right here.

52
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually buds that you can smell.

53
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the store know they're illegal in Massachusetts?

54
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:42,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are they there?

55
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:54,480
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a very fine line the way they're selling them right now, and that's why we want to do this environmental scan to make sure we really know what products are legal, what products are illegal.

56
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:03,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them, if they're CBD, they're supposed to be okay, but again, they can't claim to have any kind of health effects.

57
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,788
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't claim to make you better.

58
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:09,609
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't claim to make you, you know, feel less paid.

59
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:14,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see that a lot with CBD products being advertised illegally, wrong.

60
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:19,212
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a bag of Freedom powder.

61
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:22,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You're supposed to use a quarter of a teaspoon.

62
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:30,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that anyone would, but over a quarter of a teaspoon may have bad side effects.

63
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:38,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we have some tough students as interns with us this semester.

64
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:55,047
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to do an environmental scan, really get out into our community, see what products are out there, and what products we need to be aware of, what products we need to educate people about, and what products we need to ban.

65
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:58,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be revisiting this.

66
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted you to kind of have a little bit of background

67
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:08,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we'll be revisiting this regulation over the next couple of meetings, once we get more and more information.

68
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:17,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, make sure we have the appropriate education going on out there, as well as making sure that these products are available.

69
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:19,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Kevin.

70
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering, who is enforcing this?

71
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the Attorney General?

72
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:28,748
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, they're not.

73
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:49,713
[SPEAKER_05]: The FDA recently sent out warning letters to companies for illegally marketing products containing Kratom, because again, it's not a lawful dietary supplement or a food additive or an ingredient or any approved drug.

74
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So they did send out warning letters.

75
00:06:53,005 --> 00:07:00,453
[SPEAKER_05]: But how to identify which products are illegal and which products are legal is very confusing.

76
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:07,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time we put out something, or the FDA puts out something, or MDAR puts out something, or GPH puts out something,

77
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:17,162
[SPEAKER_05]: they were able to tweak their formulation just a little bit to make sure it kind of falls outside of the regulations.

78
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:29,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm just sort of wondering, what would be your sense, would it be, or maybe the doctor would know on which entity, which agency, whether it's in terms of the state level.

79
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:49,632
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be involved with enforcement actions because, you know, my experience with this is that once enforcement actions begin, whether they're selective enforcement, and then they usually publicize, and then that gets the message out pretty quickly that this is not going to be acceptable.

80
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:55,957
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know whether or not you, Marianne, or the doctor would know, you know, for any illegal substance.

81
00:07:56,904 --> 00:08:03,605
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs that are sold in this fashion, who would be the enforcement authority on it?

82
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:06,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, it depends.

83
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:12,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, so MDOT would regulate the hemp, but they're not out there enforcing it as much as they could.

84
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:14,668
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't, I guess.

85
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:19,329
[SPEAKER_05]: FDA, again, they're issuing warning letters.

86
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:24,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're out there doing the enforcement efforts.

87
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:37,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And DPH looks to us as both food enforcement agencies and the local community to really kind of police what's being added to our foods out there.

88
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Miriam, the hemp is different though from the other synthetics lookalikes.

89
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:46,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

90
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:49,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Because hemp naturally occurring and Florida does that.

91
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:53,040
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell hemp to get around the marijuana loss.

92
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some certain percentage THC in it.

93
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's legal for them to do it that way.

94
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:04,084
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the easy low hanging fruit, though, is the synthetics, because that's not covered by anything.

95
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are already illegal.

96
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:11,446
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no reason why any of that should be being sold in Mefford right now.

97
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised that that's even going on.

98
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:15,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

99
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:17,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's everywhere.

100
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just in Bedford.

101
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,328
[SPEAKER_05]: We're finding them in all different communities.

102
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:30,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to do, like you said, the environmental scan and craft up some letters to all those stores that are doing and tell them, you know, cease and desist.

103
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:31,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

104
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:32,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

105
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:37,700
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they contain less than 3% of the Delta 9 THC, the hemp is legal.

106
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:40,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, very interesting.

107
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:54,887
[SPEAKER_05]: The cannabis commission had a hearing a month or so ago and, uh, they, some of the, uh, the cannabis store owners had done their own environmental scan and went out and grab some products from different places.

108
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:57,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they actually sent them to laboratories for testing.

109
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And the testimony that they gave was incredible.

110
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:15,044
[SPEAKER_05]: The level of THC in the products they were collecting from these, you know, that was supposed to be hemp or non-THC, was higher than they were even allowed to offer.

111
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So that testimony was pretty intense.

112
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:20,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can certainly share that with you all.

113
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, yeah, we'll do that environmental scan.

114
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,768
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll really take a look at our community and the region.

115
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:38,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And then see what we can do, but I did want to put this regulation out in front of you as something that at least we have in our toolbox that we can move forward with when necessary.

116
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:44,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Marianne, I know you mentioned the gentleman that passed away.

117
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we working with other cities on this?

118
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,079
[SPEAKER_06]: With who I'm sorry, we're working with other cities.

119
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:51,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

120
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:52,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

121
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,820
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at this as a region as a mystic Valley, public health agent.

122
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the joining communities, Malden, Wakefield.

123
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:04,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Melrose, Winchester.

124
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:10,745
[SPEAKER_05]: As a region where the survival scans will be done regionally as well.

125
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:11,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

126
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:12,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

127
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:17,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so.

128
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:22,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Reading is already, and North Reading has been looking at this for some time as well.

129
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:25,274
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had their eye out there on this as well.

130
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:29,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were looking to be on Creighton going forward too.

131
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:33,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be working with them as well.

132
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:35,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

133
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:44,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, well, it's been an interesting road these last couple of months around vaccines.

134
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:47,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have Jill with us today.

135
00:11:49,140 --> 00:12:06,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Jill could certainly join in and help me out here, but Massachusetts has decided to move forward on its own and actually recommend this season's flu and COVID vaccines, regardless of the federal recommendations.

136
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:12,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever the DPH Commissioner says is the recommendations is what Massachusetts is going to follow.

137
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:20,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in that light, the governor also arranged that all Massachusetts based insurance companies will cover these recommendations.

138
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:23,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no matter, regardless of the federal recommendations.

139
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so what I sent you was Jill worked on, um, what will be our standing orders.

140
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:35,915
[SPEAKER_05]: We have flu clinics, uh, COVID clinics coming up shortly.

141
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:38,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to have our standing orders in place.

142
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:49,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Jill, I don't know if you want to go over the recommendations that you made or the changes you made, but last year's standing orders that you updated, basically what we have.

143
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so these are the standing orders that DPH issued for pharmacies or pharmacists to be able to use.

144
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:03,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they also issued a similar template that local boards of health can use and modify for their purposes.

145
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:10,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for the pharmacies, they are able to issue the vaccine to everyone unless it's contraindicated who's 5 and older.

146
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:15,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So, regardless of risk factors for our purposes, we.

147
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:27,798
[SPEAKER_07]: due to younger children as well, so I just modified it for six months and older, but similarly for everyone six months and older, regardless of risk factors, unless contraindicated.

148
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:31,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these are recommendations, not mandates, right?

149
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:38,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot of people that disagree with immunization, especially COVID and young kids.

150
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:43,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so this would just be for the... But there's no mandates with this anymore, right?

151
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:44,239
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

152
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:44,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

153
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:45,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

154
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,920
[SPEAKER_07]: This would just be for our flu and COVID clinics.

155
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

156
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:49,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

157
00:13:53,302 --> 00:14:00,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, any problem then with the six months plus we'll go forward with the COVID vaccines and outstanding orders and being able to offer that to our community.

158
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:10,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, yeah, we have, we already have the COVID vaccines in,

159
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, we have them ready to go.

160
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:17,979
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just waiting for the orders so I can send those along to Dr. Plotowicz.

161
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:22,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just signature Dr. Plotowicz on those.

162
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have first clinics coming up in October, Jill?

163
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:34,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, so we're starting in the beginning of October and then starting next week we're going to be vaccinating our homebound residents.

164
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:35,433
[SPEAKER_07]: We have about

165
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:43,109
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 or so homebound residents that will go around and vaccinate as well as their caregivers, family members.

166
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:53,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have multiple clinics across the city through October and November, library, city hall, senior center, housing authority, schools.

167
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So getting ready for all that.

168
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:59,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll plan to offer both flu and COVID at those clinics.

169
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:02,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

170
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:03,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jill.

171
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:08,320
[SPEAKER_05]: and we'll send those over for your signature.

172
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just included our monthly reportable disease updates.

173
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:20,751
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have a meeting in August, so I included both July and August.

174
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:27,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really kind of the enteric diseases that were interesting other than even the norovirus obviously, but other than norovirus,

175
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: could see in July and August the spikes, and that's a good reminder for us to really emphasize food safety during the summer months.

176
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:49,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it was up regionally, not just MedFed, but in the grant that we're with Arlington and Somerville, you could see that as a region, it's consistent.

177
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:54,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you had any questions or comments on that report.

178
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:13,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think we had mentioned to you in the past that we were involved in our young adult gambling assessment.

179
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:24,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We received funding to the Mass Gaming Commission to have casino mitigation funds to do this young adult gaming assessment, gambling assessment.

180
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:34,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, Catherine was presented at a national conference, some of our preliminary results last month.

181
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:40,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to kind of give you a little peek at that.

182
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Catherine, do I need to let you share your screen somehow?

183
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you can enable for me to share.

184
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:58,605
[SPEAKER_03]: That would say.

185
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, we should be able to now.

186
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:17,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're doing a larger presentation in October of the full results, but I think this you'll find this really interesting.

187
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:24,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll just do a sorry.

188
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,750
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, can everyone see that?

189
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, okay, great.

190
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:42,209
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so what is problem gambling?

191
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:56,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So like Marianne said, I a few weeks ago was down in DC and with our casino mitigation funds, we spent this last year doing a needs assessment around young adult gambling in Medford.

192
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,964
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were fortunate to present our consultants that we've been working with.

193
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:24,562
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to spotlight a state so they spotlighted the state of Virginia and a local municipality on this data assessment stage of how to collect data around young adult or problem gambling because it's a growing concern and you'll see how it's impacting our community.

194
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:26,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a few

195
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,025
[SPEAKER_08]: overviews of gambling.

196
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:38,087
[SPEAKER_08]: The gambling is risking something of value on activity with an uncertain outcome in hopes of winning something of greater value.

197
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:44,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So common forms of gambling are the ones that we really can consider.

198
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:53,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Lotteries scratch off sports betting and lately the explosion of online betting and

199
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:01,156
[SPEAKER_08]: using even now the state lottery system has, you can purchase lottery tickets on your phone.

200
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:16,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a little bit about problem gambling disorder, often sometimes referred to as gambling addiction or gambling disorder, defined as when gambling behavior negatively impacted the individual or those around them.

201
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:22,129
[SPEAKER_08]: and experiencing four or more of the following.

202
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:45,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So the need to gamble with increasing amounts to achieve desired excitement, restlessness or irritability when trying to stop or cut down, repeated unsuccessful efforts to control and cut back on or stop gambling and frequent thoughts about gambling and often gambling when feeling distressed and often returning to the habit.

203
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:49,581
[SPEAKER_08]: So, when individuals have 4 or more of these.

204
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:56,487
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions, it's known as a problem gambling disorder.

205
00:19:56,827 --> 00:20:00,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit on the data that we found here in Medford.

206
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:06,831
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we did was we worked with our consultants to develop a survey of 18 to 24 year olds.

207
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:18,876
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually hired with our Tufts and a young person living in the area, we hired PR data collection specialists because going out and getting this population isn't easy.

208
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,356
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not all in one place.

209
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,417
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had to really

210
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:28,863
[SPEAKER_08]: strategize on how to get these young people or young adults to fill out these rather lengthy surveys.

211
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:31,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were successful in getting 200 of them.

212
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:38,791
[SPEAKER_08]: We also conducted focus groups and did key informant interviews with both individuals.

213
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:48,459
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they might have been athletes or tough students, and they were also youth coaches, educators, a lot of different folks.

214
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,060
[SPEAKER_08]: that we gathered this information from.

215
00:20:51,080 --> 00:21:01,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we wanted to know was not just the gambling and gaming behaviors, but that correlation between that and mental health, financial wellness, substance use.

216
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:04,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So the survey tracked all of that.

217
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:19,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So of the over 200 young people that we surveyed, 90% had gamed in their life and 73%, so three and four young adults had gambled at some point in their lifetime.

218
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:30,274
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what we saw was over 1 in 4 young adults had placed a sports bet in person in the past months, which we were, we thought was a little high.

219
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,800
[SPEAKER_08]: We were thinking it might be online betting, but the in person sports betting.

220
00:21:36,821 --> 00:22:00,657
[SPEAKER_08]: was the highest and then followed you can see there on the data bet on sports online and playing poker in person is still very popular and that's something that we got a sense of and then you can see about 17% of our young people had been to physically been to a casino in the past month so that's that's rather high.

221
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:23,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And then a lot of what we did was, in addition to the quantitative data, was that qualitative data and hearing the stories of young people and how they socialize at the casinos and how betting takes place and how the socialization, especially for young males, happens around poker playing.

222
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,667
[SPEAKER_08]: So it gave us a good sense of that.

223
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:46,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So one thing that we learned was we dove into the data and what it looks like if folks ever engaged in any type of gambling, we saw that those young adults were 75% of them had bet on sports online in the past month.

224
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:54,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they'd ever engaged, so that's telling us not only did you try it once, but there's a high probability that you're regularly

225
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,284
[SPEAKER_08]: participating in gambling behavior.

226
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:10,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see, again, betting on sports online, betting on sports in person, poker playing were all common in the past 30 days.

227
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:18,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we saw a high correlation between substance use for those who gambled versus those who didn't gamble.

228
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:19,002
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see in the blue.

229
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,225
[SPEAKER_08]: versus the purple are those who gamble.

230
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:36,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's significantly higher, particularly around tobacco is the highest where there's a much higher correlation between tobacco use and gambling versus non gamblers.

231
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we, what we really delved into is the social and economic consequences.

232
00:23:45,052 --> 00:23:52,335
[SPEAKER_08]: and negative financial impacts being the most commonly reported among the young adult.

233
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:59,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So we saw that 43% of our past 30 day gamblers reported experiencing negative financial impacts.

234
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:03,559
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a lot of young people when you think about that population.

235
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:09,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of those who gambled in the past 30 days spent between 50 and $100.

236
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And 16% of that population spent over $200.

237
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:21,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not a, you know, usually at that age, you don't have a lot of disposable income.

238
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:27,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So spending 16%, spending over 200 really kind of tells us something.

239
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:37,246
[SPEAKER_08]: We also found out that young adults who gambled in the past 30 days were significantly more likely to report having too much debt compared to those who hadn't.

240
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:39,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a huge surprise.

241
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:55,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And then young adults who gambled in the past 30 days had different attitudes about borrowing money and about paying money back and their attitudes, whether they felt responsible for paying it back.

242
00:24:55,645 --> 00:25:01,727
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see those in the blue, 91% of non gamblers believed it was important to pay it back versus 65%.

243
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:17,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Young adults who gambled in the past 30 days were also less likely to keep a close eye on their personal financial affairs versus those who do not gamble.

244
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:25,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And then young adults who have gambled in the past 30 days were also less likely to say they've set long-term financial goals.

245
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:35,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of telling us the story of what is going to happen for this population if this behavior continues.

246
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:45,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we wanted to do is just give you a snapshot of some of the data that we collected.

247
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:50,569
[SPEAKER_08]: On October 15th, we're going to be doing a full data

248
00:25:55,822 --> 00:26:14,306
[SPEAKER_08]: report on everything from the literature review that we did with our consultants around national trends, local trends, and then giving us a sense of where we should start to develop and implement strategies to address these concerning behaviors.

249
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:23,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And whether it's partnering with the state on some of their strategies, looking at some of the local support systems we have around the area.

250
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,209
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for example, the bridge

251
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:33,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Recovery Center in Malden has reported that they've needed to expand their gambling anonymous support groups.

252
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:44,793
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're looking at expansion of gambling anonymous support groups around the state as the different avenues for betting.

253
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:55,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know personally having two teenage sons watching how they are targeted by online gaming.

254
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:05,244
[SPEAKER_08]: and sports betting is all over their social media feeds and it's really becoming a part of young adult culture.

255
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:11,250
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so much so that Medford High is very interested in this and they wanna bring this into their health curriculum.

256
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,533
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we're gonna have multi strategies to address this.

257
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:18,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's just a snapshot.

258
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,457
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone has any questions, go ahead.

259
00:27:20,477 --> 00:27:23,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin?

260
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:34,180
[SPEAKER_00]: So Catherine, I may have missed it, but in terms of the young adults, was there an age range or a cutoff of that sample size?

261
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:39,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that was 18 to 24 year olds.

262
00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:41,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it break out any further in terms of

263
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,375
[SPEAKER_00]: gender or any other demographics?

264
00:27:46,675 --> 00:28:06,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we'll be presenting that when we, but yes, yes, there are definitely, we got a really good cross-section, so a cross-section of college students, tough students, gender, so definitely you saw the higher percentage of males, and we can

265
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,490
[SPEAKER_08]: versus people who identified as females.

266
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we were able to break it down in the different racial ethnic groups as well.

267
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:18,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it all Tufts students?

268
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:21,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it all?

269
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:23,872
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it was not all Tufts students.

270
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:31,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was it was in the students weren't surveyed on Tufts campus, but they were surveyed around Medford.

271
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:36,315
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were able to identify whether they were a college student or non-college student.

272
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:36,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So

273
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,361
[SPEAKER_08]: we can break it down in that way.

274
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:42,586
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a pretty good call versus none.

275
00:28:48,290 --> 00:29:12,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the college students, some of that qualitative data was really interesting as far as trends of them going to the casino and them and how kind of male athletes felt about it versus, so there's kind of a lot of nuanced information.

276
00:29:15,996 --> 00:29:22,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so that presentation will be happening on noon, I believe, right on October 15 at City Hall here in the chambers.

277
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:30,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be sending an invite out to our board of health members with anyone else interested in joining is more than welcome.

278
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:33,402
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have that information up on the website as well.

279
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:55,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and as Catherine mentioned, we did get funding again this year from the Gaming Commission, from the Casino Mitigation Funds, to take this information and move forward and come up with some strategies and programming or services or education, whatever needs to be done within the schools or within the community.

280
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're grateful to the MassGaming Commission for refunding this year's efforts as well.

281
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:06,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, see other business.

282
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:10,015
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other business I have is I made a mistake on the agenda.

283
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next meeting is not October 14th.

284
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:14,538
