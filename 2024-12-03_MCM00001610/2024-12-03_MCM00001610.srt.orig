1
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:03,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's, uh, let's start it nice and simple.

00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:06,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a quick roll and we can talk about the minutes and get started.

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we have one more.

[SPEAKER_01]: Luke is joining right now.

11

[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

12
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:08,464
[SPEAKER_01]: We're losing people left and right.

13
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:13,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Has everyone had a chance to look over the minutes?

14
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:16,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

15
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:19,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Any addendums, anything we need to note?

16
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:25,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

17
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:29,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, we have so many new people.

18
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:30,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, perfect.

19
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,716
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a motion to accept the minutes?

20
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:34,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love that.

21
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:38,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I'm allowed to propose them, but I would second it.

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So moved.

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

24
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down the line.

25
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:47,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have some extra folks that just joined, so we can all vote on our minutes here.

26
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:49,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Lois?

27
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:50,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

28
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:53,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Benji, welcome.

29
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, perfect just in time.

30
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:07,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry abstain stand Loretta.

31
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, perfect Kathleen.

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

33
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:24,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke.

34
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:29,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not there.

35
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:29,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

36
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:32,375
[SPEAKER_01]: A little quiet there.

37
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke, we're just voting on accepting the minutes.

38
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:37,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say abstain.

39
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:38,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not present.

40
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,820
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries at all.

41
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:41,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan?

42
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:43,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll abstain.

43
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:44,283
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't present.

44
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:46,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob?

45
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:47,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

46
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:51,347
[SPEAKER_01]: John Rogers?

47
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

48
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also vote yes, Will, and Paul is still not here.

49
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,717
[SPEAKER_01]: The yeas have it, seven to three.

50
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:06,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Will, if I wasn't at the meeting, do I have to abstain?

51
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.

52
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Then change my best to abstain.

53
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:13,667
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

54
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:15,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Good catch.

55
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Still six to four.

56
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:19,092
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the clear.

57
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting notes accepted and we can get on with.

58
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,013
[SPEAKER_01]: All the good stuff for this week this month.

59
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any administrative updates?

60
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:35,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Brenda.

61
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything we want to talk about.

62
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:43,540
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing right now.

63
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That isn't talked about later in the meeting is so the next meeting is January 6.

64
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:56,303
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that might be the meeting where we might want to vote on any new co-chairs.

65
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:08,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Where folks can say in this meeting, if they're interested and we can have a discussion about it, but maybe we can wait until the next meeting to actually vote on it.

66
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:18,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we should actually, that'll be the next point of voter.

67
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:25,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So, be great to discuss co-chairs unless there's anything else you'd like to add in.

68
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:31,714
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think the long and the short of it is.

69
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:41,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I love being a chair, but, you know, it's always easier to lighten the load and have someone to stand with me and help me out a little bit.

70
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I worry that Brenda's doing a lot of the heavy lifting right now, so.

71
00:04:47,595 --> 00:05:01,701
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's anyone who is at all interested in taking up that mantle, helping out as a co-chair, we have a little bit of time devoted to discussing if anyone is interested.

72
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:14,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, well, this is Bob.

73
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:16,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to commend your

74
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:26,167
[SPEAKER_00]: your duties this year, you've come up to speed very nicely, and you should certainly continue on.

75
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:36,931
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not able to be there, I can be a backup, not necessarily a co-chair, but a co-chair of last resort, if you will.

76
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:41,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Very reticent co-chair.

77
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:46,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've done it now for like three plus years,

78
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,375
[SPEAKER_00]: It was last year I did it for most of the year.

79
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:50,576
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the fourth year.

80
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:53,457
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to pass it on.

81
00:05:54,118 --> 00:06:01,221
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes I have, even this year, I did one or two meetings when you weren't there and no one else was there.

82
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could be a backup of last resort.

83
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:11,567
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would certainly love to see someone else be a more regular co-chair if anyone wants to do that.

84
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:27,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I see, we have a guest, but I don't, it says sustainability.

85
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that someone from the office?

86
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh Hecker Green.

87
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:34,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a Medford resident.

88
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,111
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my job title in the Zoom.

89
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:38,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fantastic.

90
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:40,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's he's being modest here.

91
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:43,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Josh is is one of the potential new members.

92
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:44,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

93
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:45,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

94
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:46,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fantastic.

95
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:54,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason it says sustainability there is because he works in the sustainability as a sustainability planner for the city of Somerville.

96
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:56,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, OK.

97
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:56,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

98
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you all.

99
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to interrupt.

100
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:00,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know.

101
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:00,437
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.

102
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:01,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to hear from you.

103
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:02,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked.

104
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

105
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:18,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So not hearing anything, I will say, as Bob can attest, I was a co-chair with Bob, and he ended up doing almost all of the work.

106
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not a very helpful co-chair.

107
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,819
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, I would be happy to be a support.

108
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,098
[SPEAKER_02]: chair, so to speak.

109
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:43,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm, I am already over committed into many other areas of life to be able to really kind of lead on many of the things that we should be leading on.

110
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:58,524
[SPEAKER_02]: But that said, like Bob, I would be happy to step up if needed, and as needed, and I'd be happy to work with you during the month to prep for meetings.

111
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:08,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to say, I don't really have the time to do that either.

112
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:17,398
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand that's true for many people.

113
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's completely fair.

114
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:30,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I just wanted to devote a little bit of time, see if anyone was feeling itchy and wanted to move up.

115
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,706
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, they're all here.

116
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,146
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep doing good work.

117
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other closing thoughts?

118
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,407
[SPEAKER_01]: We might just end that section early.

119
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearing and seeing none.

120
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:59,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just jump right to Brenda, a discussion on some of our new members.

121
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Or potential new members.

122
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:11,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so we've had four people apply for the committee who are still interested at this point.

123
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:18,307
[SPEAKER_08]: We had more earlier in the year, but they have joined other committees or have had other commitments come up.

124
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:22,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am talking to each one of them.

125
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have one more that I need to talk with.

126
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Alicia and I will make recommendations to the mayor who will make the appointment.

127
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:40,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we have two seats open now, so we should be making two appointments.

128
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:46,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And I expect that this can be done in time for the January meeting.

129
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:51,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully that the new members could have their first meeting be the first meeting of the year.

130
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:53,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems appropriate.

131
00:09:56,777 --> 00:10:04,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope, Brenda, that you would encourage the others to continue to come to the meetings.

132
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,540
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to be a member.

133
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're interested, whenever they can make the meeting, we should encourage them and welcome them.

134
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:15,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, absolutely.

135
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:24,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone I've talked to so far has said that they would love to work with the Energy Committee on specific topics throughout the year.

136
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:37,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I know last meeting we had discussed potentially opening more than just 2 slots.

137
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:38,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that still the case?

138
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we hesitant to bring in too many people?

139
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:50,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're hesitant to bring in too many people at the moment.

140
00:10:50,686 --> 00:11:01,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Alicia recommended to me that when we make the recommendation to the mayor, we also have an explanation of why this committee is so large.

141
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:16,379
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to other committees that the city has and the fact that we want it to be large because there are lots of volunteer opportunities and we want a lot of input from the folks in this group.

142
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,903
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're already making the case for why this group should be 14.

143
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:21,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Good note.

144
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:54,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so something I might, I don't know if this will be tangential to it, or in some way a segue, but would love to see for the new year as well.

145
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can discuss this under new business.

146
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to talk out of turn here.

147
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:08,521
[SPEAKER_01]: As we get new members, potentially proposing some new projects or initiatives or things for these new members to start.

148
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,344
[SPEAKER_01]: To start with this committee and hit the ground running.

149
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,108
[SPEAKER_01]: As we look into the new year.

150
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially taking on some new projects that we can get their help with.

151
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:31,750
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, Brenda, were there any aspects of these new members that we can help with?

152
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we vote or vet in any meaningful way, but.

153
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:41,678
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I'd love to get some just some general a general sense of what you're looking for.

154
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,058
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about it last time.

155
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I know folks were very interested in pursuing a zero waste initiative.

156
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:54,344
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's something that we would keep in mind as we were looking at new potentially members.

157
00:12:56,827 --> 00:13:18,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we had, I heard that people were interested in maybe having members with other sort of specialties in their professional life than maybe building science or energy to try to get more varied sort of skills included.

158
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:25,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else that you think we should be considering?

159
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:29,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you all see this morning's Globe?

160
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:40,254
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a front page story on state leads way in cutting food waste.

161
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:44,675
[SPEAKER_07]: It was restaurants composting.

162
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:53,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping they would mention that Medford is a composting city that just passed the new ordinance and so forth.

163
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:55,418
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't quite get to that.

164
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:10,498
[SPEAKER_07]: We are leading the way in this regard because we do have a composting program for the city.

165
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:23,185
[SPEAKER_07]: If any of the new members are interested, they could start assembling data and publish

166
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:38,509
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it be on Facebook, whether it be an article in the newspaper or a letter follow-up, whatever, ways to bring this to more people's attention.

167
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:48,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody needs to talk to the compost collectors.

168
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:50,436
[SPEAKER_07]: How many households are now doing it?

169
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:58,488
[SPEAKER_07]: with what regularity, what problems they're seeing, what figures they have on tonnage.

170
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:09,338
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody's interested in that, they could really dig in and bring it to the attention of more people in the city of Medford.

171
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:19,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Lois.

172
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:20,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

173
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that composting is one of the keys to reducing issues with waste.

174
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:41,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the city has some of that data, and so it could be that working with the city, the committee could gather and

175
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:48,487
[SPEAKER_02]: market, so to speak, a little bit more of what composting is doing for the city.

176
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:58,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on the committee, the waste committee last year that brought this about.

177
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:06,062
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about it and endorsed it and they carried through with it.

178
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,664
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

179
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:18,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was in large part a citizen initiative, and we need to capitalize on it.

180
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:32,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to also along the same lines, though, further support the zero waste or waste reduction goals.

181
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And among those, I would love to see Medford find

182
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:47,011
[SPEAKER_02]: useful ways or effective ways of limiting plastic.

183
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:52,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly single use plastics, but plastics in general.

184
00:16:53,775 --> 00:17:00,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a very complicated challenge.

185
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:07,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, it requires some

186
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: easy solution, not easy solutions, it requires alternatives for people to maintain their kind of comfort and ease of use, ease of life.

187
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:30,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Plastics play such a huge role in making our modern life work.

188
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:37,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do not always have easy replacements for what they're doing.

189
00:17:38,000 --> 00:18:00,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But that said, it would be great if we can help to build the pressure and the network of alternative solutions that are out there and promote what can be done to reduce plastic in our environment and in our bodies, et cetera.

190
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Since there's plenty to talk about there.

191
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:07,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had an issue about that.

192
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:13,071
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not reducing plastic, but as I understand it right now, black plastic does not get recycled.

193
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:20,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the, a lot of the takeout that one gets, the bottom is black plastic.

194
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:23,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume there's no special black plastic lobby.

195
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no interest on the other side.

196
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:29,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of- Oh, there's plenty of interest on the other side.

197
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:30,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, then I'm wrong.

198
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:42,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a useful place for petroleum waste products to go, so to speak.

199
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:49,108
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't go into a useful plastic container of some sort, then it is toxic waste.

200
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:52,386
[SPEAKER_02]: That someone has to pay to get rid of it.

201
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:54,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why it has to be black plastic?

202
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:55,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know.

203
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm speaking a bit out of turn.

204
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:08,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about it from the standpoint of the energy production fossil fuel industry.

205
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:08,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

206
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:14,348
[SPEAKER_02]: There's refinement that goes to making a variety of things.

207
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Black plastic is among them.

208
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if those source materials are not all used in one form or another, then it is waste.

209
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:31,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is technically toxic waste that needs to be dealt with in one way or another.

210
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:38,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, plastics provide a very convenient place to put a lot of fossil fuel material.

211
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:44,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you saying that black plastic is a particular?

212
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:52,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just one of the many plastics that are produced in the process.

213
00:19:52,708 --> 00:20:02,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it like a rainbow, the source material can be divided up in many different ways.

214
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:13,622
[SPEAKER_02]: But the more refined or recyclable plastics utilize, I guess, more valuable raw material.

215
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:23,029
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas the black plastics and the less recyclable are different materials.

216
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:28,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's fair to say that it's less valuable or less refined.

217
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:31,215
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't sound right to me.

218
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:34,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's because the black plastic is

219
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you look at the running arrows that pretend that the stuff is recyclable when it actually isn't, it has the same code and the same name as white plastic.

220
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:51,153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the color that's added.

221
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:55,855
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with what type of plastic it is.

222
00:20:57,232 --> 00:21:09,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I saw a TV article just like three days ago that was saying that the black plastic is made out of things like television cases, electronics cases that are black.

223
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:13,942
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's black plastic, because you can't make black plastic into white plastic.

224
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:16,123
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it's black, you've got to kind of say black.

225
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:21,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And the biggest problem with it is electronics have fire retardants in the plastic case.

226
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:23,252
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other chemicals.

227
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:24,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

228
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:27,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So these fire retardants end up in the black plastic.

229
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:36,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why it's not really good to use black plastic for, um, uh, for like food, food type of, you know, like to go containers.

230
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:38,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

231
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

232
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:40,884
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it said on the article.

233
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:45,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I was a little, I felt that the science was a little off in the,

234
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:51,030
[SPEAKER_05]: in the article, it did seem like it had some real good hard evidence.

235
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was a little suspect of that.

236
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:57,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So that didn't seem right to me.

237
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:00,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm taking that with a grain of salt.

238
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:08,345
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do know that black plastic starts off as black plastic, because like I say, you can't make it white plastic.

239
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:11,188
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't make black plastic into gray plastic.

240
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe by adding a lot of white plastic to it.

241
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:15,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess you could.

242
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:31,437
[SPEAKER_08]: We might be getting a little off track here, but what I had heard about the reason black plastic is less recyclable is because the sensors in the automatic sorting facilities like we use here can't read it because it's absorbing the light.

243
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:32,477
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not reflecting it.

244
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:36,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really reflecting it back, so they can't tell what kind of plastic it is.

245
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be manually sorted, but yeah.

246
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:47,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The point is, there is something we can do, our committee.

247
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

248
00:22:50,380 --> 00:23:09,484
[SPEAKER_07]: As Loretta knows, the tree committee, one of the members did a survey of businesses up and down Mystic Avenue to try to get them to take more trees, to plant more trees up front.

249
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:16,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that we have to do anything with trees.

250
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:22,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I am saying that, again, some of these new people, if somebody has a particular interest,

251
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:35,529
[SPEAKER_07]: to go from business to business, restaurant to restaurant, and talk to the owners, and do you use black plastic or white plastic?

252
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you use aluminum?

253
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:40,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you use paper cartons?

254
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:46,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Directly approaching different businesses

255
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:59,540
[SPEAKER_07]: to see if we can't explain this to them and encourage them to come up with another alternative, how much more would it cost, for instance?

256
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a quick question on all this too.

257
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:06,487
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Medford has a plastic bag ordinance.

258
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:10,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Is black plastic not included in that?

259
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,854
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking at it right now and I'm a little bit confused.

260
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:16,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it like non-compliance with the ordinance that's an issue?

261
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:25,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there maybe something larger here that should be a priority of this committee to try to have that be a bit more broad?

262
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I've lived in multiple cities that have plastic bag bans and it's never been an issue.

263
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:37,879
[SPEAKER_03]: The black plastic, Dan, is hard plastic.

264
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,422
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like number two and number five plastic generally.

265
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:47,427
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like takeout containers that can come in white, they can come clear, they can come black.

266
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:49,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And they often come black.

267
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:56,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I guess I mean if I go to the corner store by me, they'll put stuff for offer a black plastic bag.

268
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that against the ordinance?

269
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:03,591
[SPEAKER_03]: The bag is unrecyclable anyway, so it doesn't matter what color it is.

270
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:07,994
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like there might be an enforcement issue.

271
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:20,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's also, so this is actually an issue with a lot of cities and states that have passed plastic bag ordinances, is that it was initially for those really thin

272
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:31,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastic bags, and they usually have wording for things that are thicker or could be reused, but they found that people don't really reuse the thicker plastic bags either.

273
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:34,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just harder to process in any.

274
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:42,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Fashion, so I think there is a recommendation to be made to update our city ordinance.

275
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,404
[SPEAKER_01]: But that I can put a pin in that because we do have a waste reduction section coming up that might need more time.

276
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:51,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

277
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:56,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be worth putting a pin in that conversation just for another 20 minutes.

278
00:25:58,899 --> 00:25:59,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

279
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:08,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and to just close out my initial point as plastics of all types is what I'm after.

280
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:12,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, it's great that we have a plastic bag ban.

281
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great if it were

282
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great if we were also, to Lois's point, understanding what else could work for businesses, what else could work for residents, and help to encourage

283
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:44,956
[SPEAKER_02]: non-plastic alternatives as well as limit plastics that are not as much as we can, I guess.

284
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:48,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question along this line.

285
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:54,722
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things we've had trouble recycling in the past, I don't know if anybody takes this,

286
00:26:55,585 --> 00:27:07,948
[SPEAKER_10]: except for some supermarkets, it's the plastic wrap that comes on large containers like tissues and toilet paper and- Stretch plastics.

287
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:13,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and sometimes supermarkets would have a little bin.

288
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:20,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they actually recycle it, but I was wondering if the knowledge with this group, is there a recycling,

289
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:24,714
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, place that takes this anymore?

290
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:31,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Whole Foods must know the answer, Loretta, because they take stretch plastics.

291
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:33,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but do they recycle?

292
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:35,460
[SPEAKER_02]: As do some stop-and-chops and Shaw's.

293
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but do they recycle it?

294
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer, I don't know that either.

295
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm asking the group.

296
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:44,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anyone know if it's recycled?

297
00:27:46,497 --> 00:28:00,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that construction plastics, wraps similar to that, technically are supposed to be recycled, and that there are similar collection groups.

298
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:09,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not it actually makes it to recycling facilities and what those recycling facilities can do with them, I don't know.

299
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:13,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be willing to work on that particular one.

300
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so my thought is that, you know, part of this is education.

301
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,705
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people don't know that it could be.

302
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:21,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to talk about it.

303
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:22,968
[SPEAKER_10]: It can't be recycled.

304
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:28,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And so next time I'm at stop and shop, I can ask the manager, do they actually recycle it?

305
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:32,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it just a convenience for people to bring it into the store to get rid of?

306
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:44,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we have Trove Green provisions that does a lot of recycling, the retail store in Medford, they might know, I'm sure Alicia and Brenda might know.

307
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:50,184
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I had heard that some of the stories don't recycle it, it's just a convenience for people.

308
00:28:50,645 --> 00:29:01,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, if we could elaborate that to include that in some event in the future for people to bring or find somebody that takes it,

309
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:05,841
[SPEAKER_10]: as a bulk event to have people drop off.

310
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,663
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be one way to reduce waste.

311
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:18,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Claire was taking black plastic for a couple of years and then she stopped.

312
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:23,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Her recycler was no longer able to take black plastic.

313
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I'm just talking about the clear wrap.

314
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:28,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a huge bag full.

315
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:36,585
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's amazing how much you get, like it just happens.

316
00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:41,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you buy water in bottles, not that we're supposed to be doing that, but you know, it comes in plastic.

317
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:57,422
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm hearing, and again, I'm going to think we return to this issue.

318
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:02,726
[SPEAKER_01]: We can return hopefully to new member discussions as well.

319
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:19,099
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm making notes of potential projects to undertake, surveying Medford businesses, looking at potential ordinances and updates and initiatives that can help with our waste reduction that we can return to in a little bit.

320
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:27,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to kind of round out what was meant to be a new members discussion.

321
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:33,125
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any other aspects of that we want to touch on before we move forward.

322
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:40,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, we've touched on something important, so it'll be good that we return to our waste issues in a moment.

323
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:44,953
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to round out our conversation on new members as well.

324
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:49,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Really quick, and I'm sorry, I know I've missed a lot of meetings.

325
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:59,286
[SPEAKER_12]: With some of the stuff going on in life, but we have that spreadsheet with a lot of priorities and initiatives.

326
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:02,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that still being updated or do we have, like, a central place where.

327
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:07,110
[SPEAKER_12]: These ideas are being kept.

328
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:16,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I have them currently in my notebook and unfortunately, due to my summer busyness, I have not been updating that spreadsheet.

329
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:16,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Although.

330
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:19,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I may just make that.

331
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:28,084
[SPEAKER_01]: make a grand return in January so that we can continue just keeping our thoughts in order month to month and in between these sessions.

332
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:30,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna make a note of that.

333
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:36,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it's, we have a lot of discussions that kind of go down the rabbit hole.

334
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:40,637
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's nice to have a place where everyone can see some of the higher level ideas.

335
00:31:42,805 --> 00:32:12,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd just like to add, Will, that we used to do this in January and start thinking about it in December and send out a spreadsheet of what the members are interested in working on and forming, you know, subcommittees, you know, that would work on projects that we're interested in so that what Dan was saying is important to have so we can review those ideas and options.

336
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:13,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that.

337
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:17,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe add some more or not.

338
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:19,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

339
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I will make sure that makes a grand return.

340
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:31,054
[SPEAKER_10]: And we used to present that to the mayor too, for her, you know, invite her in January, February, maybe beginning of the year.

341
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob knows.

342
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:34,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Bob?

343
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:36,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We used to have advice.

344
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:40,937
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to be able to talk to the mayor because we serve at the mayor's pleasure, I guess.

345
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:42,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

346
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:47,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if we have these ideas that we put forward, these are the things she usually approves of.

347
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,303
[SPEAKER_10]: She may add things that she would like us to work on.

348
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that.

349
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:57,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

350
00:32:58,135 --> 00:32:59,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Filling out my notes right now.

351
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:01,843
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really helpful for me.

352
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:04,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this will be good.

353
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:12,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the past, the mayor has come to, you know, maybe one meeting per year.

354
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what I'm hearing?

355
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:13,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

356
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:22,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, uh, January, February, once we get, especially if we get the new members in and we get an agenda, um, what would you call it?

357
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:29,695
[SPEAKER_10]: A plan, somewhat of a plan of action of ideas of what we're going to focus on and she'll come and, um,

358
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:42,476
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, review that and maybe speak about our work or anything she might want us to work on, like pollinator gardens or composting.

359
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:51,182
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know she was awarded just in the past week or two, Brenda, some kind of award for composting.

360
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:51,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Brenda?

361
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:52,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

362
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let me pull that up.

363
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:04,628
[SPEAKER_10]: She got an award for being a leader in sustainability.

364
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:19,080
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was about- The National Recycling Coalition gave her an award as an outstanding elected leader, specifically focusing on the composting program.

365
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

366
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:20,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

367
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:32,423
[SPEAKER_10]: So she might, you know, I'm not speaking for her, I'm saying that maybe she would want us to concentrate on that, to develop it more as Lois mentioned.

368
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:33,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And Luke?

369
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:40,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we actually haven't hit our goal for the first year of the recycling program, which was 6,000 participants.

370
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:42,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're still around the 5,000 mark.

371
00:34:47,255 --> 00:35:10,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to add, you know, what Lois and Luke were saying, it would be important, and I know that we have the new economic director and his assistant, I can't remember her name, sorry, but to get them, I've always felt in the business side, to get the chamber involved with this, any kind of sustainability or environmental concerns.

372
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:19,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as long as it's with your idea, you know, it may be good to contact the chamber for help to reach out to.

373
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:23,507
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure the city could give us a list to a restaurant and some businesses.

374
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:25,283
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great idea.

375
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:46,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And outside of the restaurant and the plastic outreach to restaurants and stores, I have done some outreach to the chamber about EV charging stations in store parking lots.

376
00:35:47,379 --> 00:36:03,753
[SPEAKER_08]: because I think that might be the next area where that would be really helpful for Medford to have is, you know, outside of the municipal parking lots, which is what we've been focusing on having them in, like, you know, the Wegmans parking lot or the Whole Foods parking lot or things like that.

377
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:11,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had sent a memo to the chamber and talked with the economic development director about it, sent it through him.

378
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:16,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd love to do some follow up about that as well.

379
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:21,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you didn't really get any bites for that 1st outreach.

380
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:22,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

381
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:34,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Well.

382
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:39,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm frantically taking notes.

383
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:40,474
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all very helpful.

384
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:45,875
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, some of the senior members have a lot of.

385
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:49,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Memories of, you know, what we've done in the past.

386
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:52,956
[SPEAKER_01]: So, no, I'm still very new to new to the committee.

387
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:56,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate the having the.

388
00:36:56,697 --> 00:37:03,078
[SPEAKER_01]: The understanding of what's worked in the past, so I can keep expanding and making something that works.

389
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:15,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So, seeing this conversation on new members has kind of run its course and gone every which way, but.

390
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:18,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good.

391
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,681
[SPEAKER_01]: We move forward to the next section.

392
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:26,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get fully sidetracked and work on 8 other projects at once.

393
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:30,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to throw it to Brenda.

394
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:34,251
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our climate policy updates.

395
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,887
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be attended to.

396
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:47,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so 1st up just a quick update on electrify Medford, mainly about some events.

397
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:54,658
[SPEAKER_08]: We were at the winter preparedness event on the 14th, which was a great event.

398
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:57,700
[SPEAKER_08]: A ton of people came people were lining up.

399
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:04,308
[SPEAKER_08]: before the doors opened because there were there were lots of giveaways of like coats and hats and things like that.

400
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:07,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a it was a wonderful event.

401
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:13,098
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get a lot of interest in Electrify Medford, although that's the audience that we definitely were.

402
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,501
[SPEAKER_08]: We're really trying to target, but.

403
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:20,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so it's a wonderful event.

404
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:23,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It might not be the best place to do outreach for that program.

405
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:30,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we might need to do like smaller, more targeted things in order to really be able to talk to people.

406
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:38,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we're going to be at the winter extravaganza on Wednesday.

407
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:43,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that's four 30 to six 30 at city hall.

408
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:43,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

409
00:38:47,002 --> 00:39:04,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Incidentally, I also made a little gingerbread house with little Hershey bar solar panels and an electric vehicle with a Twizzler cord plugging it in and stuff and having the Electrify Medford flyer next to it and the display.

410
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:13,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I'm going to have a little, and I donated a little, um, Christmas tree for the raffle as well.

411
00:39:13,423 --> 00:39:19,891
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Electrify Medford themed with lots of little like LED light bulbs and things like that on there.

412
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:22,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so that should be a really fun event.

413
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:32,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in January, January 18th, sorry, 16th, we're going to have an Electrify Medford event at the library.

414
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:40,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We might have a brief speaker at the beginning, but mostly I'm thinking of it as more office hours.

415
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:48,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So people can come in and have the opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation with coaches, having them at different stations around the room.

416
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:52,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's less sort of a,

417
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:58,053
[SPEAKER_08]: advertising event and maybe more of a practical one where people can get some advice right then.

418
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:08,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, the Andrews and McGlynn HVAC upgrade project.

419
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:19,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're getting the schematic design package December 10th in preparation for school committee and city council meetings in December.

420
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll be doing an RFP for a construction manager at risk, which we hope will be able to on board by the end of January.

421
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:40,431
[SPEAKER_08]: so that we can pre-order equipment, because we're anticipating long lead times for that equipment, and then have the work actually done this summer.

422
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:53,324
[SPEAKER_08]: So fingers crossed that that schedule works out really well and nothing slips as part of it, because we really do want to get that work done by the time kids go back to school in the fall.

423
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:02,018
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working on a school bus electrification plan.

424
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:03,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I mentioned this before.

425
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:08,246
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working with Power Options through a grant from the Mass Clean Energy Center.

426
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Our buses are owned and operated right now by Eastern Bus.

427
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:23,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going back out to RFP for bus service in 2025.

428
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:42,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And so part of what we're doing through this plan is looking at ways to incorporate a preference for a vendor that has electric buses as part of that, or will commit to incorporating electric buses into their fleet as part of that RFP.

429
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:53,674
[SPEAKER_08]: But so this plan will be getting recommendations for buses that meet our needs based on the length of our routes and and things like that.

430
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:58,120
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what charging infrastructure would be needed to support those buses.

431
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:04,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're looking specifically at Eastern Bus's lot in Malden right now where they park them.

432
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:17,919
[SPEAKER_08]: But we know that we're going to have a big high school construction project coming up, so we'll probably want to include bus parking and charging in that high school project as well.

433
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it for that one.

434
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Mothers Out Front is very interested in this.

435
00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:38,632
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know as we are moving along with this, they have been and will be very vocal about the need for electric buses in particular.

436
00:42:45,184 --> 00:42:48,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford is updating our hazard mitigation plan.

437
00:42:50,326 --> 00:42:52,067
[SPEAKER_08]: This was last updated in 2017.

438
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:59,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually it has to be updated every five years to qualify for federal disaster aid.

439
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:03,533
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an important thing for us to do.

440
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:10,997
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working with ACBC Consulting on the project.

441
00:43:11,017 --> 00:43:15,378
[SPEAKER_08]: They're kind of taking the lead and herding all of the cats involved in it.

442
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:23,240
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a year-long process with public meetings planned for January, June, and September.

443
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:29,462
[SPEAKER_08]: So at each stage of the process, they're sort of stopping to get feedback from the public.

444
00:43:30,322 --> 00:43:34,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sure you'll hear more about this as we move along.

445
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:47,486
[SPEAKER_08]: But do you have any initial feedback to pass along about what can be incorporated into the hazard mitigation plan?

446
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:50,907
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the discussion right now is around

447
00:43:52,757 --> 00:44:00,344
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of what are the hazards that we're currently seeing or be moving forward.

448
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:17,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what sort of resources people are currently expecting to use in any sort of emergency situation and what additional need is there.

449
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:19,409
[SPEAKER_08]: for resources.

450
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:25,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So any feedback that you have around that, either now or at any point, feel free to email me.

451
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:42,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the city has a building that's going to be used as an emergency shelter, sort of a place that we can go to for cooling or heating.

452
00:44:43,322 --> 00:44:45,944
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know if it was built or renovated yet.

453
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:54,565
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were looking to or we are hoping to do a more robust or what we're calling resilience hub.

454
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:58,429
[SPEAKER_08]: But we haven't found a location for that yet.

455
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:01,351
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been a couple that we've looked at that have fallen through.

456
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:11,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, what we do have is the Andrews Middle School in the event of emergency could be used as an emergency shelter.

457
00:45:16,237 --> 00:45:25,325
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually just finishing up an electrical recircuiting project there right now to put more circuits on the emergency generator.

458
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:43,428
[SPEAKER_08]: so that it can be used for that, because right now, or before this point, it had emergency lights to help people exit the building and things like that, but not really a lot that people could use in an outage that would actually make it work.

459
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:49,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just finished that recircuiting project, and we're actually having a meeting with

460
00:45:50,597 --> 00:46:03,561
[SPEAKER_08]: MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, and they're going to look at the building and assess its ability to be used as a shelter and what else the city needs to do in order to prepare to use that as a shelter.

461
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:09,683
[SPEAKER_10]: When you mentioned hazard, is that environmental hazards?

462
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:11,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking in the summer, it gets really hot.

463
00:46:13,124 --> 00:46:15,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes we don't have enough air conditioning.

464
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:21,993
[SPEAKER_10]: we need to go to places that are cooler when the temperatures are 98 and 100.

465
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:29,059
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would think that would be an important priority because like the library closes.

466
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:38,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the police station is open sometime, the community room there, but there weren't too many options, you know, for

467
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:46,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people aren't comfortable going to the police station and yeah, yeah, things like that.

468
00:46:46,513 --> 00:47:02,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so yeah, definitely heat, flooding, any sort of, or cold, honestly, heavy snowfall, anything that might knock out power.

469
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:11,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, like charging your phones and tablets and having extra outlets at some place.

470
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:13,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where.

471
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the Andrews Middle School.

472
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

473
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:29,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think that a school could be opened partially, but I'm not familiar with the layout of the schools, so that if there is a high heat event or a power outage, we could go there.

474
00:47:30,944 --> 00:47:35,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the issue is that the school could not be in session while we were using it as a shelter.

475
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:48,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be reserved for use in an event where it's an emergency situation where schools are not in session because it's an emergency situation and it would be used for a shelter then.

476
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:54,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that would be interesting to look into.

477
00:47:54,795 --> 00:48:00,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody at City Hall might have already, like if it was open after five, like five to

478
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:02,764
[SPEAKER_10]: 11 on weeknights.

479
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:13,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's interesting how much that building is used on weeknight, especially the gym, which is one of the areas we would be using.

480
00:48:13,993 --> 00:48:19,077
[SPEAKER_08]: The gym and the cafeteria are the main areas that we'd be using for the emergency shelter.

481
00:48:21,278 --> 00:48:21,939
[SPEAKER_09]: In the summer?

482
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:25,542
[SPEAKER_09]: In the summer they're used?

483
00:48:26,222 --> 00:48:36,135
[SPEAKER_08]: There are, yes, there are camps and other things that are, it's surprising how much the school is actually used.

484
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

485
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:41,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyways, that's probably on a list.

486
00:48:51,603 --> 00:49:05,548
[SPEAKER_08]: The only other thing that I had on my list here, the Climate Equity Council expressed an interest in doing something around green jobs, maybe a job fair, maybe partnering with mass hire, something like that.

487
00:49:06,128 --> 00:49:16,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I followed up with our economic development director, and I think he has some concerns about this because he's done these sorts of job fairs

488
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:25,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and at his previous the town that he was previously working at, um, and he said it's it is a lot of effort.

489
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:29,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and we might not have the resources right now to do it.

490
00:49:29,837 --> 00:49:32,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's not well organized, it can be a.

491
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:49,329
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be a bad situation where you have businesses taking time to be there and not enough people showing up, or you have a lot of people there and you don't have the right businesses to match with them.

492
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:53,832
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a lot of effort, and so that's something that we're looking into.

493
00:49:53,932 --> 00:50:00,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something that we can partner with somebody else to try to organize something like that in Medford?

494
00:50:01,988 --> 00:50:03,649
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a thought there.

495
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:12,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say that is like one of the main reasons that it makes a lot of sense to increase the size of this committee as well.

496
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:14,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that job fairs are

497
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,778
[SPEAKER_12]: useless for the most part.

498
00:50:19,038 --> 00:50:20,018
[SPEAKER_12]: They're kind of a waste of time.

499
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:36,984
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the best ways you find people and you let them know what sort of jobs are available in that, especially green jobs, sustainable jobs, anything in energy or the environment is through having people who work in those jobs be an advocate and do outreach.

500
00:50:37,385 --> 00:50:45,868
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd love to see that as a priority for this group of, as we bring in new people, people who work in these areas go out,

501
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:55,407
[SPEAKER_12]: talk to people, create a community more so than trying to give resources to job fairs or something like that.

502
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:12,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would love to talk more about this at some point.

503
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:37,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I have been, when I worked in Boston, we had a few programs that we were funding to do job training and connecting people with employers at different levels from like entry level, like weatherization type things to like connecting

504
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:42,924
[SPEAKER_08]: small business owners with projects, things like that.

505
00:51:44,025 --> 00:51:45,787
[SPEAKER_08]: But that takes a lot of resources.

506
00:51:45,927 --> 00:51:58,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I would love to maybe brainstorm some ways that we can do some sort of connections like that without the level of resources that a Boston has.

507
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think getting the right people, people are aware, getting the right people who are in hiring,

508
00:52:06,252 --> 00:52:09,515
[SPEAKER_12]: who are able to make hires or who work for certain companies.

509
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:21,883
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of companies around the Boston area and especially up here that are looking for entry-level people, are looking for people for jobs that would fit this kind of description.

510
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:26,607
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to get the right people in the room for that.

511
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:35,253
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I'd love to talk more about bringing more kind of blood into this committee to help facilitate that.

512
00:52:35,814 --> 00:52:36,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be great.

513
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:52,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that in the chat here, Josh said that the city of Somerville would be interested in a partnership and suggested contacting Emily Sullivan or Rachel Ned Carney in economic development.

514
00:52:54,667 --> 00:53:00,811
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a great thing to partner on because, yeah, it's a very small geographic area here.

515
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually on a LinkedIn group.

516
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember which one it is.

517
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:18,480
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many groups around environment and sustainability and they send out a job list for these kinds of jobs, but it's for all over the country.

518
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,382
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, just to do Massachusetts in this small area.

519
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:30,097
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just one group.

520
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:33,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I get a couple, actually, from different groups.

521
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:36,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Luke, there's some group that you belong to.

522
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:46,622
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to do with Energy Efficient Houses, Passive House, or I can't think of the name of the group, but they send me invites all the time.

523
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Passive House Massachusetts.

524
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:57,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it them, or is it the group that's larger and they have internships for students to study design?

525
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:15,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, there's... MassCEC also supports that, but I'm directly involved with Passive House Massachusetts, and we do support education and other kind of internship opportunities.

526
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:24,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are a bunch of trainings and other things through... Yeah, there's a link on one of their websites, and it's jobs posted.

527
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:25,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

528
00:54:26,261 --> 00:54:29,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's that is that one.

529
00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:30,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same organization.

530
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:32,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it could be done.

531
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:37,028
[SPEAKER_10]: But like Brenda said, it's a lot of work to get everyone combined, you know.

532
00:54:44,693 --> 00:54:46,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, something definitely to circle back on.

533
00:54:46,514 --> 00:54:51,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it for my updates.

534
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

535
00:54:55,541 --> 00:55:01,826
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, it looks like next on the docket would be Loretta with a TREES Medford update.

536
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:04,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

537
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:05,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get my eyes on here.

538
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:06,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some notes.

539
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:19,761
[SPEAKER_10]: So TREES Medford at their monthly meeting, which was in November that Lois and I attended, none of the other members from the committee were able to attend.

540
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:23,056
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's okay, that was just a monthly meeting.

541
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:36,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had asked at the meeting for the city council committee of the whole, which was November 20th, what they expected to talk about, or if they had any previews of what was going to happen.

542
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:42,500
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had sent out an email about this meeting to the Medford Energy and Environment Committee.

543
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:45,681
[SPEAKER_10]: And they thought that just the,

544
00:55:47,308 --> 00:55:54,511
[SPEAKER_10]: public tree ordinance, the tree committee ordinance that they submitted for review, it's a draft, would be discussed.

545
00:55:55,672 --> 00:56:03,596
[SPEAKER_10]: But also, there was some confusion in the post on the website, the city website, for the city council meeting.

546
00:56:04,036 --> 00:56:07,898
[SPEAKER_10]: It showed like older comments from last year from,

547
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:11,223
[SPEAKER_10]: and older ordinances.

548
00:56:11,523 --> 00:56:31,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So moving to the Committee of the Whole meeting that happened, City Council Committee of the Whole, that was on November 20th, I attended, and Therese Medford was there, Amanda and Sarah and Kim, those are members of Therese Medford, and there were just a few city councilors there.

549
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:35,678
[SPEAKER_10]: And they discussed, it was confusing.

550
00:56:35,738 --> 00:56:38,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll tell you why it was a little confusing.

551
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:41,400
[SPEAKER_10]: They were reverting to last year's ordinances.

552
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:48,422
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was like they didn't have time to read the updated ones that was submitted in July.

553
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:52,323
[SPEAKER_10]: The reworked ordinances, there were three of them.

554
00:56:54,304 --> 00:56:57,465
[SPEAKER_10]: But I believe the chair or the council had

555
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:06,364
[SPEAKER_10]: actually taking the old documents and inserted the new changes.

556
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:11,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So they were showing that, but a lot of people hadn't read it yet.

557
00:57:11,802 --> 00:57:15,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why, but that's okay.

558
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:20,770
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think Lois and Stanza were trying to say it was confusing.

559
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:28,997
[SPEAKER_10]: They really didn't have a lot of time to review what was submitted in July, this past July, the new updated ordinances.

560
00:57:29,017 --> 00:57:31,860
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, but they did still have some comments.

561
00:57:34,279 --> 00:57:42,664
[SPEAKER_10]: They talked about the idea, I think the thought was that they would at least move forward with the tree committee, the separate ordinance.

562
00:57:43,324 --> 00:57:53,069
[SPEAKER_10]: So the ordinances were split out into three separate ordinances, tree committee, public tree ordinance, and a private tree ordinance.

563
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:58,752
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll talk about the tree committee.

564
00:57:59,173 --> 00:58:03,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We were hoping they would move that forward because that would be a lot of help for the city.

565
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:08,820
[SPEAKER_10]: to help with some of these initiatives that are in the other documents.

566
00:58:13,143 --> 00:58:26,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim McGiven, who's the head of the DPW was there and reading through the tree committee draft ordinance that was submitted by Trees Medford and that we assisted with.

567
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:28,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just gonna read some notes.

568
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:31,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim McGiven comments about

569
00:58:32,997 --> 00:58:58,062
[SPEAKER_10]: that it was somewhat overstepping the authority of the DPW and maybe change the wording that the committee would be providing or able to give advisory support to the DPW because he said there was an overlap of duties of what they were suggesting with the Trade Committee.

570
00:59:00,062 --> 00:59:02,243
[SPEAKER_10]: So the wording would need to be changed

571
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:13,212
[SPEAKER_10]: So the overlap of duties in the document would be with the DPW in the forestry department tree board.

572
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:23,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Scarapelli had concerns from some residents that a new committee would be in charge of these

573
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:28,247
[SPEAKER_10]: issues that were in the Tribune Committee document.

574
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:36,256
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, Tim addressed that by saying there was an overlap and that they really have the authority.

575
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:42,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, I did make a comment.

576
00:59:42,443 --> 00:59:43,645
[SPEAKER_10]: This was later on.

577
00:59:44,925 --> 00:59:52,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarapelli also had some concerns, and he brought up the private tree units, which I didn't think they would talk about.

578
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:58,034
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't talk about it too much, but he was concerned.

579
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:05,159
[SPEAKER_10]: He was addressing the concerns that some residents had about who this tree committee would be.

580
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,761
[SPEAKER_10]: So he had to leave.

581
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:11,143
[SPEAKER_10]: He just wanted to mention those concerns.

582
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:21,415
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was surprising to me and I think, lowest and a few other people that were there.

583
01:00:23,138 --> 01:00:23,839
[SPEAKER_10]: It may be.

584
01:00:24,279 --> 01:00:25,721
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I made a comment.

585
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:54,940
[SPEAKER_10]: that the idea of the tree committee was to help the city because we do have budget problems and to move these initiatives along to also keep track of the tree canopy and possibly if there is a permitting process, so we can keep track of the tree canopy and know where we need to plant trees and that other committees in the city and commissions or whatever,

586
01:00:55,688 --> 01:01:05,314
[SPEAKER_10]: do a lot of work, which will save the city money if this new tree committee is put forth and started.

587
01:01:06,435 --> 01:01:22,525
[SPEAKER_10]: And they came back with a comment that not the city council, the TBW commissioner, I'm trying to remember his exact words, that the tree committee

588
01:01:24,066 --> 01:01:28,590
[SPEAKER_10]: would be like other committees, like the Bicycle Commission or the Bicycle Committee.

589
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:40,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, we do more of events and education and things like that, not sort of jurisdiction and authority.

590
01:01:41,422 --> 01:01:43,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So he somewhat ended with that.

591
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:45,526
[SPEAKER_10]: And then

592
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to interrupt, I wanted other people.

593
01:01:49,402 --> 01:01:51,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't go back in and say anything.

594
01:01:51,683 --> 01:02:06,132
[SPEAKER_10]: But my advice to Theresa Medford, and I write to them and maybe this committee is that, I remember what Alicia said last year when we had a meeting about this, and she actually brought this up.

595
01:02:06,152 --> 01:02:11,975
[SPEAKER_10]: There's many commissions, boards, and committees that do a lot of work and make these decisions.

596
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:14,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And the appointees are approved by the mayor.

597
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:39,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to allude to that, but I think trees meant that I just didn't have a chance to write to them, say maybe it's as simple as changing it from being a tree committee to a tree commission or the board, the tree advisory board to be able to work with the outline they submitted.

598
01:02:40,843 --> 01:02:43,945
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was quite a bit of backlash about that.

599
01:02:44,985 --> 01:02:52,190
[SPEAKER_10]: But they were very thankful for all the work that Trees Medfit had done to present these ordinance drafts.

600
01:02:53,891 --> 01:02:56,012
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me move on to the public one.

601
01:02:58,336 --> 01:03:03,079
[SPEAKER_10]: to make your van had concerns on the public tree ordinance about the budget.

602
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,941
[SPEAKER_10]: And he suggested a cost estimate.

603
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:08,063
[SPEAKER_10]: He mentioned that last year, but it hadn't been done.

604
01:03:08,183 --> 01:03:21,873
[SPEAKER_10]: So he said he'd try to have one done by January to see what it would cost the city, the DPW to actually do the outline that's in the ordinance to update the public trees.

605
01:03:23,474 --> 01:03:25,095
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the private tree ordinance,

606
01:03:28,432 --> 01:03:29,393
[SPEAKER_10]: the public to review the public tree ordinance.

607
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:29,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember what I said?

608
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:32,415
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like they were reading this for the first time all the changes.

609
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,699
[SPEAKER_10]: So they said, Well, this is complicated, even the public tree one.

610
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:40,882
[SPEAKER_10]: So Amanda has suggested that it could be simplified.

611
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:41,943
[SPEAKER_10]: They were open to that.

612
01:03:42,904 --> 01:03:43,104
[SPEAKER_10]: And.

613
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:50,010
[SPEAKER_10]: The building commissioner was also there, and he'd like to more time to review the private tree

614
01:03:56,335 --> 01:04:01,939
[SPEAKER_10]: and she has been working with Councilor Collins on reviewing these tree ordinances.

615
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:18,410
[SPEAKER_10]: So the motion was made, Councilor Callahan will work with Councilor Collins and Trees Metric and the building department, probably the DPW too, I might have skipped that one, to revise and review the ordinance, and that was the motion passed.

616
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:25,835
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think they're gonna work on it more before they send it to the city solicitor for review.

617
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:41,976
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Kim from Trees Medford suggested, which I thought was a very good idea, to invite other towns, building departments, or commissions for a future meeting to explain how they got this done.

618
01:04:44,157 --> 01:04:51,201
[SPEAKER_10]: How did they get their tree ordinance, tree protection ordinance, or tree preservation ordinances implemented?

619
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:54,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it is all new to Medford.

620
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:58,899
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope they take that under advice.

621
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:01,719
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where it's at right now.

622
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:07,921
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to review it and they'll go through different departments and try to update it.

623
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:18,863
[SPEAKER_10]: But I agreed with them, Therese Medford and Lois, and I think our committee, is that if they can just get the tree committee done,

624
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:27,334
[SPEAKER_10]: And the questions about who would be on the committee, it's not just like any residents, people who are experienced with trees.

625
01:05:30,516 --> 01:05:33,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have any questions, that's the end of my report.

626
01:05:33,878 --> 01:05:38,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they hope to have some of this done maybe in January after the holidays.

627
01:05:42,602 --> 01:05:44,783
[SPEAKER_11]: So Loretta, can you hear me?

628
01:05:45,584 --> 01:05:45,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

629
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:46,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Paul.

630
01:05:46,764 --> 01:05:47,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that Paul?

631
01:05:47,987 --> 01:05:48,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, it's Paul.

632
01:05:49,088 --> 01:05:53,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry I've been a bit of an absent member.

633
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm dealing with a lot of stuff.

634
01:05:58,692 --> 01:06:08,818
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks to me like there is a resistance to have any tree ordinance.

635
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:11,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

636
01:06:12,152 --> 01:06:12,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

637
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:15,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what, you know, what trees method has done a lot.

638
01:06:17,297 --> 01:06:19,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not discounting what they've done.

639
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:22,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, yeah, what it is, is that it's a lot of work.

640
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:22,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And

641
01:06:29,654 --> 01:06:31,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I really, we have new city counselors.

642
01:06:32,396 --> 01:06:45,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned this at, Paul, I've also missed quite a few meetings too, but I did, I've got more involved in September, October, November, and I have been attending meetings.

643
01:06:46,246 --> 01:06:51,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And the problem is, you know, the cost to the city, but also,

644
01:06:53,549 --> 01:07:01,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Our group is more knowledgeable about sustainability and the environment and the trees.

645
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:07,241
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've worked with Trees Method and we've worked with Aggie Tune at times, whereas the city council isn't.

646
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:11,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had asked at the, this is December, sorry.

647
01:07:11,685 --> 01:07:15,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd asked at the November meeting that more of our members show up.

648
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:22,495
[SPEAKER_10]: to support this city council, the whole meeting, so that we could provide comments if needed.

649
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:32,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though Trees Medford is the lead on this, you know, they don't tell us and they don't have to tell us everything they're doing, but we wanted to support them since we worked on this project with them.

650
01:07:33,738 --> 01:07:35,459
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just Lois and myself.

651
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:45,182
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really important that more people show up that have worked on this and

652
01:07:47,348 --> 01:07:51,271
[SPEAKER_10]: This could be a whole meeting in itself to talk about all the nuances.

653
01:07:52,272 --> 01:08:01,798
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have more than 20 towns in Massachusetts, maybe 30 now, with some kind of tree preservation ordinances.

654
01:08:02,939 --> 01:08:07,922
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were in the tree report, and they've grown since then, that this committee worked on.

655
01:08:08,783 --> 01:08:15,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if these city councilors

656
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:22,517
[SPEAKER_10]: understand that it can be done and all these other cities started with something.

657
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:27,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have to be, excuse me, sorry.

658
01:08:30,442 --> 01:08:31,122
[SPEAKER_10]: impossible.

659
01:08:31,863 --> 01:08:32,843
[SPEAKER_10]: We can start somewhere.

660
01:08:32,883 --> 01:08:38,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why the tree committee had offered, well, Trees Memphis had mentioned that the tree committee can help with these costs.

661
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:41,247
[SPEAKER_10]: So it doesn't cost the city a lot.

662
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:47,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this point, um, I think it would be a good idea to have other cities involved.

663
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:53,753
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem is the staffing for the city, which I understand, um,

664
01:08:55,813 --> 01:09:10,553
[SPEAKER_10]: that they just don't have the GIS engineering people and the DPW to map the trees, and they don't have a lot of this, so we can start small and do something.

665
01:09:13,953 --> 01:09:17,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, maybe a dumb question.

666
01:09:17,054 --> 01:09:27,397
[SPEAKER_12]: When I go to trees, when I look at the trees website and we have been thinking about, you know, potentially putting a tree on the sidewalk in front of our house.

667
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:30,618
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of it just comes back to.

668
01:09:31,678 --> 01:09:33,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Send an email to our tree warden.

669
01:09:34,965 --> 01:09:45,868
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hearing you talk about committees and commissions and staffing and all of that, but I feel like I haven't really heard about the tree warden.

670
01:09:47,528 --> 01:09:49,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't that what that person is?

671
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:52,830
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of what you're talking about, isn't that their responsibility?

672
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:59,051
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like the city has a role that is responsible for trees and for this.

673
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:01,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is something that has come up.

674
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:05,204
[SPEAKER_10]: big question answer.

675
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:07,165
[SPEAKER_10]: We only have one.

676
01:10:08,506 --> 01:10:12,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to be very professional in my answer to you.

677
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:14,368
[SPEAKER_10]: We only have one tree warden.

678
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:24,572
[SPEAKER_10]: And for decades, decades, that forestry department has been understaffed and under budgeted for.

679
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:31,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So she handles all the trees that are public.

680
01:10:32,059 --> 01:10:39,744
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you're talking about Trees Medford, that does not have to do necessarily with planting a tree in front of your house.

681
01:10:39,824 --> 01:10:41,585
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the city, that's city property.

682
01:10:42,506 --> 01:10:43,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'd go to Raggy Tudor.

683
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:52,052
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, Trees Medford does also have events where they provide trees to people, but it's not for city sidewalks.

684
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:55,694
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for residents to plant on their private property.

685
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:05,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So Trees Method is a separate group that has become a non-profit that helps with the education and information of trees.

686
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:15,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was saying I would I would second that the DPW has been under resources under resource in this area for a long time.

687
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:26,029
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a large backlog right now of of just tree stumps that they need to remove so that they can plant a tree in the space where the, the old tree was and I.

688
01:11:30,621 --> 01:11:37,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's more than a hundred tree stumps that they need to remove because it's just been building up year after year.

689
01:11:37,686 --> 01:11:45,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think they're maybe having a hard time doing some of the more basic things that are under their responsibility.

690
01:11:45,591 --> 01:11:51,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're having a hard time thinking of taking on more with the resources that they have.

691
01:11:52,467 --> 01:11:52,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

692
01:11:53,167 --> 01:12:01,110
[SPEAKER_10]: So Trees MedFed has worked with AgD2 to help in certain areas, grants.

693
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:11,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that Mayor's going to be coming out with something, because I saw the email, actually, that they just had over, I think it's 100 or more trees delivered to MedFed.

694
01:12:11,974 --> 01:12:18,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they came in last week or the week before, and they're rushing around planting them in South MedFed.

695
01:12:21,057 --> 01:12:31,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I can't remember what school, does some, Hormel Stadium had a whole bunch of trees sitting here that came in that they'll be, those are city trees, but they are addressing the stumps too.

696
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:36,912
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like up to 400 stumps just a couple of years ago.

697
01:12:37,432 --> 01:12:39,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So they need help.

698
01:12:39,675 --> 01:12:42,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when you think about a tree committee,

699
01:12:43,403 --> 01:12:49,388
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of ordinances that are throughout the state in many cities and towns.

700
01:12:49,808 --> 01:13:08,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So when they write their tree preservation ordinance, it always includes, I shouldn't say always, but more than 50% of the time was the tree committee as part of that one big ordinance that helps with, you know, reviewing trees and reviewing land clearing and all these other things.

701
01:13:08,702 --> 01:13:10,764
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened was that the,

702
01:13:11,871 --> 01:13:14,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me think back, because it's been going on for several years now.

703
01:13:16,536 --> 01:13:33,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was the city council, or the previous building commissioner, said that the ordinance they submitted originally, which was a few years back, should be split up into three parts.

704
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:44,974
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how we got three separate, instead of one big ordinance that talked about private treaties and having a treaty committee, it was separated into three.

705
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:51,328
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds like they're separate, but they sort of work together.

706
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:59,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And that went to the legal counsel for the city to evaluate, and they wrote their comments.

707
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:13,137
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they came back last November, the city council, and asked for Trace Medford and the Energy Committee to read through

708
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:24,945
[SPEAKER_10]: the older draft tree ordinances and the city solicitors comments and building, you know, department and other city comments to revise it.

709
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:30,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how the energy committee got even more involved because we work with trees methods last year.

710
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:35,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they submitted new drafts, um, in July to the city council.

711
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:39,109
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dan, I don't know.

712
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:40,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I answer your question?

713
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:41,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh,

714
01:14:44,629 --> 01:14:45,649
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate the response.

715
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:49,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't really, I'm still a bit confused, but thank you.

716
01:14:49,731 --> 01:14:52,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, so public trees are under.

717
01:14:53,052 --> 01:14:58,375
[SPEAKER_10]: The city trees are under the department of the forestry department magnitude and trees management.

718
01:14:58,435 --> 01:15:02,737
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a separate group trying to have a tree.

719
01:15:03,327 --> 01:15:06,709
[SPEAKER_10]: preservation ordinance and start a tree committee.

720
01:15:06,989 --> 01:15:22,356
[SPEAKER_10]: They wouldn't be, they could recommend, you know, members of the tree committee, but it's up to the mayor and, and input from the DPW forestry department, you know, who those may be like a arborist, a certified arborist.

721
01:15:23,057 --> 01:15:23,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thanks.

722
01:15:23,957 --> 01:15:27,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think the general message is, thank you.

723
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:31,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So Loretta, how long have we, have we been at this?

724
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:39,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, how long does it take to get a tree ordinance going on average?

725
01:15:41,098 --> 01:15:47,906
[SPEAKER_10]: On average, or just this started during COVID, so that was like a big blow up, you know, when COVID happened.

726
01:15:47,926 --> 01:15:48,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So 2020, right?

727
01:15:52,854 --> 01:15:54,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe before that.

728
01:15:55,215 --> 01:16:09,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to say that Loretta and I did the original tree with the previous chair of this committee back before COVID.

729
01:16:09,262 --> 01:16:11,263
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the pre-report.

730
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:17,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, report and then the first ordinance did come out.

731
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:22,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the first drafts came out in 2022 or 23

732
01:16:27,646 --> 01:16:35,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So your engagement, Luke, and Lorella, were in, I'm guessing, 2018.

733
01:16:36,912 --> 01:16:37,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

734
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:37,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

735
01:16:37,533 --> 01:16:38,954
[SPEAKER_10]: 2017, maybe.

736
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:41,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that took us a couple of years to write that in.

737
01:16:47,679 --> 01:17:02,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Loretta, if you are able, I have to admit, going through my emails, I cannot quite tell what the, I don't seem to have the last iteration of the tree ordinance.

738
01:17:03,069 --> 01:17:07,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see something from Alicia for October of last year, of 2023.

739
01:17:07,432 --> 01:17:07,592
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

740
01:17:07,612 --> 01:17:08,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back to November.

741
01:17:15,565 --> 01:17:19,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would have come from Brenda, because Brenda sent it out to Remy, you see.

742
01:17:20,787 --> 01:17:22,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's links in the email.

743
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:26,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And it says, like, treaty, semantics, committee of the whole.

744
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,991
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has the links to the ordinances.

745
01:17:30,811 --> 01:17:31,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

746
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:38,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So my guess is that it's probably about seven or eight years.

747
01:17:39,815 --> 01:17:40,055
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

748
01:17:40,695 --> 01:17:43,396
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so let's just recap something.

749
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:44,737
[SPEAKER_10]: So what happened was,

750
01:17:46,309 --> 01:18:05,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in 2017 or 18, Luke, myself, Carolyn Meckleburg, who works for the state now, but she was an intern in the office, Curtis Tootin, and I think there was someone else, I can't remember, we decided to,

751
01:18:06,653 --> 01:18:09,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Or someone asks, what can we do about a tree ordinance?

752
01:18:10,015 --> 01:18:12,497
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how it started back in 2017 or 18.

753
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:16,660
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it was Alicia said, well, why don't we draft this?

754
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,421
[SPEAKER_10]: And then people started adding their comments.

755
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:21,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're going to draft ideas for one.

756
01:18:22,123 --> 01:18:23,964
[SPEAKER_10]: So it ended up being a research project.

757
01:18:24,165 --> 01:18:26,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And Kathleen McKinnon was really thankful that we did.

758
01:18:26,746 --> 01:18:30,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And she was really nice because she said, wow, that's like a research project.

759
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:31,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And it ended up being that.

760
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,992
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we did was we researched

761
01:18:35,832 --> 01:18:47,479
[SPEAKER_10]: ordinances in the whole state that were existing and we had all these notes and similarities and it was we did a pre-draft and we found that education was the most important thing.

762
01:18:48,619 --> 01:18:49,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So we wrote a guide

763
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:52,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh God, what's it called?

764
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:55,820
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on the Go Green Medford website.

765
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:56,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Go Green Medford.

766
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:07,057
[SPEAKER_10]: If you click on trees, the introduction to the guide to municipal, guide for municipalities to maintain the tree camp.

767
01:19:09,437 --> 01:19:15,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And it starts with an introduction letter and the actual research project.

768
01:19:16,339 --> 01:19:19,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And it talks about different education programs we found.

769
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:23,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the end, there's a sample ordinance and what other cities have done.

770
01:19:24,322 --> 01:19:28,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we had to go back and actually Alicia made a great suggestion.

771
01:19:28,104 --> 01:19:34,006
[SPEAKER_10]: So you should actually list all the towns that have these ordinances under each paragraph, which we did.

772
01:19:34,246 --> 01:19:37,607
[SPEAKER_10]: So we wrote a sample draft ordinance.

773
01:19:38,867 --> 01:19:41,369
[SPEAKER_10]: in this report.

774
01:19:41,509 --> 01:19:43,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a huge appendix too that goes with it.

775
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:46,532
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's on ogrebaymethod.org under Tracy.

776
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was our project from the Energy Committee.

777
01:19:50,814 --> 01:19:59,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And we sent it out to other cities, and we used Cambridge and Brookline, and we used Wellesley, Concord,

778
01:20:00,961 --> 01:20:01,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons.

779
01:20:01,802 --> 01:20:03,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons of cities.

780
01:20:05,145 --> 01:20:08,008
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd allow me to interject for two seconds.

781
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:14,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Other cities have tree ordinances, don't they?

782
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:16,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, many.

783
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:16,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

784
01:20:19,188 --> 01:20:27,272
[SPEAKER_11]: And have they taken as long as Medford to come up with a tree ordinance?

785
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:31,274
[SPEAKER_11]: What was their battle like?

786
01:20:33,615 --> 01:20:45,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you guys have researched this, and I'm just popping in as somebody who hasn't been involved in it.

787
01:20:45,045 --> 01:20:48,027
[SPEAKER_11]: And I regret that to some extent.

788
01:20:48,688 --> 01:20:50,529
[SPEAKER_10]: It took a couple of years.

789
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:52,131
[SPEAKER_10]: It usually took a couple of years.

790
01:20:52,191 --> 01:20:56,715
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of these cities that have the more detailed ones have a lot more money.

791
01:20:58,156 --> 01:21:01,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way you fund this program is through a permitting process.

792
01:21:02,179 --> 01:21:06,945
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, Cambridge has, you know, guidelines.

793
01:21:09,608 --> 01:21:15,816
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me get back to just, I don't want to spend any more, too much time because we might run out of time if we end at 8.

794
01:21:16,257 --> 01:21:20,662
[SPEAKER_10]: But the way this works is they're funded by the permits that

795
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:28,331
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be that you're just targeting developers and flippers for land clearing, and that's how it started.

796
01:21:29,191 --> 01:21:32,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So they took our report and they're like, well, when are you going to do an ordinance?

797
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,796
[SPEAKER_10]: When are you going to do an ordinance for MedFed?

798
01:21:35,336 --> 01:21:38,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And we said, well, this is a guide and we're not actually pushing it.

799
01:21:38,999 --> 01:21:46,265
[SPEAKER_10]: We should have something to prevent land clearing and property flippers from clearing the land.

800
01:21:47,606 --> 01:21:49,588
[SPEAKER_10]: But Therese MedFed took it upon themselves

801
01:21:49,968 --> 01:21:52,191
[SPEAKER_10]: to write the drafts and submit it.

802
01:21:53,312 --> 01:21:56,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And I congratulate them because it's a huge task.

803
01:21:56,636 --> 01:21:59,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting back to your question about how long does it take,

804
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:09,643
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a couple of years, you know, but you can start with something simple, like, let's prevent land clearing on lots and a percentage of lots.

805
01:22:10,183 --> 01:22:18,649
[SPEAKER_10]: So, when they're reading through these documents, if they're not familiar meeting the city council and departments, and they're not familiar with the cities, they have the information.

806
01:22:19,169 --> 01:22:19,970
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be done.

807
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:41,406
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so, so Loretta, is this is this like, do you think this is an issue that that is is like, akin to having trying to go for the big scoop or trying to have some sort of constrained.

808
01:22:41,426 --> 01:22:44,688
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, ordinance.

809
01:22:48,437 --> 01:22:50,898
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the differentiation there?

810
01:22:51,058 --> 01:22:54,459
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you see this?

811
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:59,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we grasping for too much in this ordinance?

812
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:11,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we whittle it down so we actually have an ordinance going forward and then maybe modify it incrementally as we go along?

813
01:23:12,306 --> 01:23:13,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it like a...

814
01:23:14,979 --> 01:23:23,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like, you know, we need to have all these components in the project?

815
01:23:27,374 --> 01:23:29,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they said at the meeting, it could be simpler.

816
01:23:30,999 --> 01:23:31,860
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be simpler.

817
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:36,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So it could be much simpler.

818
01:23:36,904 --> 01:23:41,707
[SPEAKER_10]: We could think, you know, but this is because they broke it out into 3 separate ones.

819
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:47,910
[SPEAKER_10]: It got a little bit as to how the tree committee would help, you know.

820
01:23:50,607 --> 01:23:57,489
[SPEAKER_10]: That was really surprising to me that it would be an overlap of DPW responsibilities.

821
01:23:57,969 --> 01:24:00,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Loretta, I don't want to interrupt.

822
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:02,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to be mindful of our time.

823
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:05,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

824
01:24:05,851 --> 01:24:09,051
[SPEAKER_10]: I had also mentioned to the members to show up at the Trees Method meetings.

825
01:24:09,151 --> 01:24:10,992
[SPEAKER_10]: They're only an hour.

826
01:24:11,512 --> 01:24:14,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's the third Tuesday of the month.

827
01:24:16,393 --> 01:24:26,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard from them, not that I would, but I will suggest to them to maybe change the title to Tree Commission or Tree Advisory Commission or Board.

828
01:24:27,722 --> 01:24:31,365
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's as simple as a name change, it could be done.

829
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:37,329
[SPEAKER_10]: But if anybody wants to write with more questions, you can feel free to email me.

830
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:41,613
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just there to assist Tree Smith, and that's what we should be doing too.

831
01:24:43,668 --> 01:24:44,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Loretta.

832
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:45,970
[SPEAKER_11]: You're exemplary.

833
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:46,890
[SPEAKER_11]: You really are.

834
01:24:47,391 --> 01:24:48,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

835
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:48,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

836
01:24:49,412 --> 01:24:50,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Very complicated.

837
01:24:50,393 --> 01:24:51,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I didn't talk too long.

838
01:24:52,734 --> 01:24:53,715
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

839
01:24:59,699 --> 01:25:00,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Righty.

840
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, please.

841
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:09,574
[SPEAKER_01]: We should feel free, I think, to write to Loretta, get extra questions in.

842
01:25:11,115 --> 01:25:15,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Having looked over the earlier drafts of these ordinances, it's a lot to parse.

843
01:25:15,817 --> 01:25:19,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to have a couple of experts in here to help us out.

844
01:25:22,137 --> 01:25:27,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Being mindful of the time, I know most of us wanted to be out of here by 8.

845
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:34,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look to Bob who had the next, looks like 2 different prompts.

846
01:25:34,787 --> 01:25:38,590
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 on waste reduction, 1 on climate, the climate bill.

847
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:43,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able or wanting to postpone them?

848
01:25:43,895 --> 01:25:44,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Give a quick summary.

849
01:25:46,617 --> 01:25:47,558
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your preference?

850
01:25:48,437 --> 01:25:53,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we move the climate bill to the January meeting a little earlier in the meeting?

851
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:58,903
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes 10 minutes, maybe, plus discussion, but I think it's important.

852
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:06,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set out a 12-slide presentation about it, but I think I want to talk about it.

853
01:26:06,547 --> 01:26:08,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we move that to the January meeting?

854
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:10,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at the end.

855
01:26:10,849 --> 01:26:14,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And quickly on the waste reduction,

856
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:33,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to communicate with Melrose and I think getting the input from other towns and cities that have actually successfully implemented a zero waste initiative, maybe plastic ordinances, hearing from them would be a good step.

857
01:26:34,778 --> 01:26:44,582
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's maybe one of the next steps is to get input from other cities on this or other experts should they join the committee.

858
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:49,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I am no expert at all on it, but I can reach out.

859
01:26:49,825 --> 01:26:58,236
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to see if we can arrange for input from other communities that have successfully done this.

860
01:26:58,256 --> 01:27:01,220
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my current initiative on waste reduction.

861
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:05,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Bob, I'm willing to work on you with that.

862
01:27:06,032 --> 01:27:08,873
[SPEAKER_11]: So email me when you Oh, yeah, sure.

863
01:27:08,913 --> 01:27:09,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

864
01:27:09,633 --> 01:27:13,075
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want, and I, I'll essentially do what you want.

865
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:15,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So okay, so just let me know.

866
01:27:15,716 --> 01:27:16,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.

867
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:16,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

868
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:18,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll communicate but I

869
01:27:19,393 --> 01:27:22,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, I said, we ought to have a further discussion.

870
01:27:22,176 --> 01:27:27,040
[SPEAKER_00]: That was named as the lead for the waste reduction.

871
01:27:27,161 --> 01:27:35,609
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I have no experience in this, but I have experience in getting some assistance from other towns and cities.

872
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:37,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And Melrose would be one of the first ones.

873
01:27:37,671 --> 01:27:38,872
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to have done a lot.

874
01:27:39,873 --> 01:27:41,735
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my idea on that.

875
01:27:43,525 --> 01:27:50,887
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just end those two discussion items at this point, unless other people want to join in.

876
01:27:52,007 --> 01:27:59,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Bob, are you looking to have someone from Melrose come to do a guest presentation in January?

877
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know what month would be the best.

878
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:05,811
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I haven't heard back from them.

879
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:09,812
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to communicate with them, I have to send them a form.

880
01:28:10,212 --> 01:28:11,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who to communicate with.

881
01:28:12,999 --> 01:28:16,862
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't let you email somebody, because I don't know what their email addresses are.

882
01:28:16,882 --> 01:28:22,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have some contacts there, Brenda.

883
01:28:22,606 --> 01:28:23,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I can reach out to see who.

884
01:28:23,807 --> 01:28:25,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can reach out to them.

885
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:29,311
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, when I communicate with somebody, no one responds to me.

886
01:28:30,832 --> 01:28:33,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't coach anybody, because they don't think I'm a legitimate coach.

887
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:37,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get any respect here.

888
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:40,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Even I'm having that experience, Bob.

889
01:28:40,462 --> 01:28:43,665
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a third of the people... Bob, I respect you.

890
01:28:44,146 --> 01:28:49,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but people, I get assigned to coach Electrify Medford, and no one responds to me.

891
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:50,932
[SPEAKER_00]: They're afraid of me.

892
01:28:51,352 --> 01:28:52,433
[SPEAKER_00]: They think I'm a scam artist.

893
01:28:52,673 --> 01:28:53,974
[SPEAKER_00]: You're intimidating.

894
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:55,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a scam artist.

895
01:28:55,676 --> 01:28:57,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know so much.

896
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:02,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's the holidays too.

897
01:29:02,973 --> 01:29:06,356
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes back to October and even September.

898
01:29:06,416 --> 01:29:14,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no luck in getting five people to, none of five people ever responded to me after they signed up for this.

899
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:18,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just speak out.

900
01:29:18,546 --> 01:29:27,754
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to say that in the January meeting, if there is an interest, I can present something on COP 29.

901
01:29:29,035 --> 01:29:33,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, it would be my sardonic input as usual.

902
01:29:33,738 --> 01:29:36,060
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's where it is.

903
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,021
[SPEAKER_11]: So all right.

904
01:29:38,602 --> 01:29:41,985
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's feasible, we can put that in.

905
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:44,666
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, then we'll go for the February meeting.

906
01:29:44,786 --> 01:29:46,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I will let you know.

907
01:29:46,467 --> 01:29:52,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, everybody, that we have Matt Barlow scheduled to make a presentation in February.

908
01:29:52,731 --> 01:29:53,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

909
01:29:54,652 --> 01:29:55,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's good.

910
01:29:55,453 --> 01:29:59,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long is that going to be for, the presentation?

911
01:30:00,276 --> 01:30:01,197
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tell him.

912
01:30:01,217 --> 01:30:02,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.

913
01:30:02,357 --> 01:30:02,798
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

914
01:30:02,918 --> 01:30:03,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.

915
01:30:04,897 --> 01:30:07,818
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, yeah, well, okay, maybe if.

916
01:30:08,098 --> 01:30:13,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Brenda, you can communicate with Melrose if they can make January or March.

917
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:15,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be the 2 options.

918
01:30:17,523 --> 01:30:22,265
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they can talk about plastic as well as other waste reduction ideas.

919
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:28,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

920
01:30:29,903 --> 01:30:49,431
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm kind of drafting up the agenda for January, something important to me will be making sure we nail down our projects ready to go for the new year, make sure if we are to invite the mayor along,

921
01:30:51,047 --> 01:30:58,190
[SPEAKER_01]: That we have something to talk about some things we want to get done some initiatives and priorities ready to go.

922
01:31:00,771 --> 01:31:03,053
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will see what we have time for.

923
01:31:04,693 --> 01:31:11,296
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just too much to do so much to say not enough minutes in our hour and a half.

924
01:31:13,277 --> 01:31:19,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any new business people want to discuss at the end of this meeting?

925
01:31:21,283 --> 01:31:23,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an update from last meeting.

926
01:31:25,065 --> 01:31:26,826
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's okay, I'll just speak briefly.

927
01:31:26,866 --> 01:31:43,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was about the rat poison I talked about with Newhouse Wildlife presenting to the Pest Control Board because they had, of Massachusetts, to reduce the use of escars, rat poison that kills the predators of rodents.

928
01:31:44,555 --> 01:31:47,497
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had another meeting actually with,

929
01:31:49,016 --> 01:31:55,881
[SPEAKER_10]: the Pest Control Board, and many people showed up to that Zoom meeting, and they didn't allow them to speak.

930
01:31:57,522 --> 01:31:59,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're very upset about that.

931
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:15,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And the people had raised hands, and they wanted to comment about the status of their review of limiting rodenticides that kill foxes, wolves, and, I mean, coyotes and all the other animals.

932
01:32:16,776 --> 01:32:19,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Hawks and eagles, so pretty upset about that.

933
01:32:20,017 --> 01:32:23,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure where it stands, but it didn't respond.

934
01:32:24,619 --> 01:32:26,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a big concern.

935
01:32:26,759 --> 01:32:34,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I did see an article by CAPE in Wildlife, who actually takes care of a lot of the birds that are submitted to them.

936
01:32:35,881 --> 01:32:38,643
[SPEAKER_10]: to try to keep them alive, they're injured by rodenticides.

937
01:32:39,324 --> 01:32:46,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not sure, it was a Facebook post and explained really well how the rodenticides really don't work.

938
01:32:47,371 --> 01:32:59,402
[SPEAKER_10]: The rats get used to it, because we have a rat problem in all the cities, it's all over the East Coast because of the warming temperatures, they're just having more and more offspring.

939
01:33:00,847 --> 01:33:15,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'd like to share that with the group, but I'm not sure, I'll have to ask them if I can copy and paste their interesting analysis of it to send to you people, if you're interested in reading it, and how the rats actually get used to it.

940
01:33:15,997 --> 01:33:18,658
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't work, you know, they just keep multiplying.

941
01:33:19,539 --> 01:33:29,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But the animals that are affected and die from the rodenticides, they can not become immune to it at all, the way it's been formulated.

942
01:33:32,658 --> 01:33:37,872
[SPEAKER_10]: So if that's something people are interested in, I'll keep following up with that.

943
01:33:40,164 --> 01:33:41,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I am interested in it.

944
01:33:41,545 --> 01:33:41,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

945
01:33:42,506 --> 01:33:53,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of playing with the idea of creating some kind of Google Doc or something where we can just put all of this information.

946
01:33:53,757 --> 01:34:01,203
[SPEAKER_01]: As we get these updates, things like those links, then we can read them throughout the month and have them ready for us.

947
01:34:02,825 --> 01:34:04,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a space for you to drop that.

948
01:34:04,446 --> 01:34:05,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might look into that.

949
01:34:07,148 --> 01:34:10,530
[SPEAKER_01]: For next session next year as we kind of.

950
01:34:12,611 --> 01:34:16,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Streamline our priority to streamline how we how we run things.

951
01:34:18,595 --> 01:34:19,995
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, thank you for that update.

952
01:34:20,236 --> 01:34:22,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely want to hear more as we go forward.

953
01:34:23,395 --> 01:34:28,659
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can both, anybody that's interested can follow Newhouse Wildlife on Facebook.

954
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:44,572
[SPEAKER_10]: They're wildlife rehabbers, and they get a lot of animals that are, you know, from the state of Massachusetts, they're licensed, that are injured by rodenticides, and some of them die, actually, many of them do, and KPM Wildlife, too.

955
01:34:44,592 --> 01:34:51,338
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes to show we know not what we do.

956
01:34:52,822 --> 01:34:57,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was surprised to, you know, throw it into sites don't really work.

957
01:34:58,866 --> 01:34:59,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

958
01:35:03,549 --> 01:35:03,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.

959
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:16,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other pieces of business that needs, uh, attending to just happy holidays to everybody before you end up a say goodbye usually ends quick.

960
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:18,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy holidays.

961
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

962
01:35:19,953 --> 01:35:21,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, happy holidays.

963
01:35:21,474 --> 01:35:23,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you all January 6th.

964
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:27,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any final movements that need to be made?

965
01:35:27,978 --> 01:35:29,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn?

966
01:35:30,459 --> 01:35:33,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

967
01:35:34,142 --> 01:35:38,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to apologize for not being here a couple of times.

01:35:44,568 --> 01:35:47,190

01:36:06,181 --> 01:36:07,601
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandchildren are interested.

01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:08,502
