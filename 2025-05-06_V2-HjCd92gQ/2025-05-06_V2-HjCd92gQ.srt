[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have reports of subcommittees.

42
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,738
[SPEAKER_10]: We have three reports from our superintendent.

43
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:21,940
[SPEAKER_10]: First up, recommendation to approve no school choice district, school year 2025 to 2026.

44
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:25,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Suzanne B. Galussi, interim superintendent.

45
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:27,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

46
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:27,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

47
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:28,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

48
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:42,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So under current school law, a school district is assumed to be accepting school choice for school year 25-26 unless the school committee votes otherwise.

49
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:54,361
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm here tonight to discuss and have you make a recommendation to approve the no school choice, Medford Public Schools as a no school choice district.

50
00:04:55,845 --> 00:05:04,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to report this decision to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education by June or within June of 2025.

51
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:20,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So after careful consideration, this has kind of also been our plan for the past several years, but it is my recommendation that we continue to not be a school choice district.

52
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:24,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was in my transition plan, we are,

53
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:30,803
[SPEAKER_08]: having a lot of conversations around enrollment and capacity.

54
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:49,718
[SPEAKER_08]: We have three out of our four elementary schools that are having some spacing and some enrollment capacity issues, as well as our thriving CTE program, which is wonderful, but there is a wait list for the CTE program.

55
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:55,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And this school committee has also expressly

56
00:05:56,537 --> 00:06:05,046
[SPEAKER_08]: made their priorities and goals well known about serving the needs of our Medford families to the fullest.

57
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:14,096
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just my request that we make a recommendation to continue that Medford is a no school choice district.

58
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

59
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:20,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Galussi.

60
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,789
[SPEAKER_10]: In our packet, we do have the explanation in writing.

61
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor?

62
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:38,191
[SPEAKER_10]: By Member Intoppa to be a no school choice district.

63
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Member Graham.

64
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:41,872
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

65
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:43,952
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

66
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:45,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

67
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:47,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

68
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:54,296
[SPEAKER_10]: We have number two recommendation to approve budget transfers.

69
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:57,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Noel Velez, our director of finances present.

70
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

71
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:08,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.

72
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:13,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I have a budget transfer request totaling $25,971.41 regarding seven separate transactions

73
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:31,343
[SPEAKER_03]: for different school districts and schools, just kind of moving some funding around as they purchase their last items before we get to the end of the school year.

74
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:36,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you, Mr. Velez.

75
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:47,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like a lot of office supplies, instructional supplies, transfers, and then contractual services to maintenance of equipment, totaling

76
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,952
[SPEAKER_10]: 25,971.41.

77
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve the budget transfers?

78
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:57,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

79
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:57,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

80
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:03,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this is actually a question for you, but I was curious.

81
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:10,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, the budget transfer will cover the need for sound system repair at the McGlynn Auditorium.

82
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that bring it to full function?

83
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I hear a lot of

84
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,913
[SPEAKER_06]: commentary from families that that sound system is quite bad.

85
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So does this like fix it, fix it?

86
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is this like a small minor thing?

87
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is more of a small minor thing.

88
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,178
[SPEAKER_03]: We are aware of that right now.

89
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:33,360
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kind of running the preliminary numbers of what that would cost.

90
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll probably have that number, I believe by July or August.

91
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:41,124
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is something we are with myself and Peter, I've been having conversations about.

92
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:50,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won't hold you to this number, but do you have any idea, like in a ballpark, is it like 5,000, is it 50,000, is it something in the middle?

93
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter has that number.

94
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let Peter control that one.

95
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:55,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

96
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:59,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I have had people interested in what it would take to fix it.

97
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:00,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I'm asking.

98
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:06,531
[SPEAKER_12]: So building 25 years old, original sound system.

99
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:10,072
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're looking at the neighborhood of $25,000 to $30,000.

100
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:32,787
[SPEAKER_12]: What that would give you would give you a fiber optic board using Cat6 wiring to run from a sound board in the back of the house to a stage box that would allow you to have probably up to about 16 channels and then a line array with four new speakers but for a

101
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:44,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Auditorium that size, you would probably only need two in the line array, plus some stage monitors so that people on stage are able to pick up and hear what's going on.

102
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:48,780
[SPEAKER_12]: So fully installed, probably between $25,000 and $30,000.

103
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,105
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a really accurate estimate given what these systems cost.

104
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:56,205
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, perfect.

105
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:56,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

106
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:59,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And motion to approve the budget transfers.

107
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:04,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

108
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:05,029
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

109
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:08,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have to roll call this because it's budget transfers?

110
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe so, but we can do it just in case.

111
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

112
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:13,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call has been requested.

113
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:17,812

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

115
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:19,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham?

116
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:19,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

117
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:21,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Intoppa?

118
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:21,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

119
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:22,473

00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:22,733

00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:23,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

123
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Rossell?

124
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:24,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

125
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:25,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Loecker?

126
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:25,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

127
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:27,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

128
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:29,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Budget transfers have been approved.

129
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

130
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:35,703
[SPEAKER_10]: We have number three approval of the school year 2025 2026 school committee calendar.

131
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:41,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

132
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:42,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Galussi, yes.

133
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

134
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:44,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

135
00:10:44,485 --> 00:11:01,392
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a draft of the school committee dates for next school year, keeping with the same kind of frequent schedule that we have now, which is the first and third Monday of the month, maybe with some careful tweaking around vacations, but I don't think it was that difficult this year.

136
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:03,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are some dates for

137
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:13,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. McHugh and Mr. Velez's budget times, which will be fully developed, and I can get that to you.

138
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:21,622
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not, if you have any questions or if there are dates that you'd like to discuss, please let me know.

139
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Galusi.

140
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:27,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham?

141
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,100
[SPEAKER_06]: to one question and maybe one comment.

142
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:48,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So this year, what we did was we put a third date in June on the calendar so that there's space on the calendar for what may need to happen, which we would then cancel if we don't need it.

143
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:52,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was wondering if we should do the same for next year.

144
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:56,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I just know when we get to the end of the year, it is impossible to

145
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:02,485
[SPEAKER_06]: wedge things into the calendar versus like if it's there, we know what we can plan for it.

146
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:09,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was wondering if we could amend this to add June 15th if necessary.

147
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:22,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's fine to say if necessary, but that we might want that and thank ourselves in the, our future selves might thank us if we put it on the calendar now.

148
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:23,621
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

149
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:34,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other question I had was whether these dates line up with our budget process policy.

150
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:34,948
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.

151
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:35,548
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.

152
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,449
[SPEAKER_06]: They absolutely do.

153
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:36,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

154
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:40,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

155
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:40,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

156
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:42,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve as amended.

157
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by Member Bramley.

158
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:47,762
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

159
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:48,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

160
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:49,543
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

161
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:54,185
[SPEAKER_10]: The school committee meeting date calendar has been approved.

162
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:55,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

163
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:55,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

164
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:02,069
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have any presentations of the public or continued business.

165
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:05,670
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have new business, an MSBA update.

166
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll turn it over to Member Graham.

167
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:13,584
[SPEAKER_06]: to give this committee a quick update on where we are.

168
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:24,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been working since our invitation to the feasibility study to secure what is called an owner's project manager.

169
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:31,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And that process started with having to take some boilerplate documents,

170
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:44,431
[SPEAKER_06]: infuse our Medford specific things and then go through all of the procurement hoops that are required by both the city's procurement team and the MSBA to push out a request.

171
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:48,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So we put out what they call an RFS, which is a request for services.

172
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:51,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did a walkthrough at the high school.

173
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:52,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a good attendance.

174
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:56,377
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like 15 or 20 people there from various organizations.

175
00:13:57,117 --> 00:14:05,742
[SPEAKER_06]: walking through just to get a feel for the building itself and get to hear some information from us, although it was not required.

176
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:09,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they were asked to submit their proposals.

177
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:18,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And we received 10 proposals, which everyone says, wow, it sounds like that's actually a lot.

178
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everybody, yes, apparently it's very good.

179
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:27,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And people even on the tour were just so interested in this project.

180
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:31,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is a very desirable project in the world.

181
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:32,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's like,

182
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:34,472
[SPEAKER_06]: It has something for everyone.

183
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:37,634
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like space challenges, we've got that.

184
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:43,876
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like having to not disrupt vocational programs, we've got that.

185
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,356
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something for everyone in here.

186
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:53,859
[SPEAKER_06]: So from the perspective of people who do this for a living, I think it's a very desirable project.

187
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got 10 RFSs.

188
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, the OPM selection subcommittee met with three finalists.

189
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:07,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And we met each of them on Wednesday.

190
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a very long day on Wednesday.

191
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:19,311
[SPEAKER_06]: The ultimate winner of that evaluation process was unanimous.

192
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:28,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We had three really good options, but one just sort of stood a little head and shoulders above the rest.

193
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, their name is left field.

194
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:33,517
[SPEAKER_06]: They are OPMs by trade.

195
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:37,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's lots of organizations out there that do OPM services and they do other things.

196
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe left field is just an OPM.

197
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they do.

198
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:43,019
[SPEAKER_06]: This is their passion.

199
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:49,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they will bring a team to Medford, um, upon like sort of all these final steps.

200
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:52,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but our recommendation to MSBA is that we'll work with left field.

201
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:59,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're, um, working through the final, um, back and forth on the contract negotiation right now.

202
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:05,288
[SPEAKER_06]: The building committee will meet next Monday, and actually get to meet the team from left field.

203
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:10,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anybody, it's an open meeting so if people would like to join us they're welcome to do so.

204
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all our paperwork.

205
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:19,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's six, and we're still trying to look, find a location because the bistro.

206
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:20,428
[SPEAKER_06]: is booked.

207
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:37,846
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but by Wednesday of this week, we will have to submit our recommendation and our request to work with left field to MSBA, along with a whole slew of other paperwork to sort of

208
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:44,559
[SPEAKER_06]: outline the process that we went through and turn over all the documentation that they require.

209
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:54,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And that deadline will put us on track for going to what they call the OPM selection panel in early June.

210
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it's June 2nd.

211
00:16:57,587 --> 00:17:05,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that meeting, presuming that MSBA is in agreement with our selection, they will give us the green light.

212
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:07,753
[SPEAKER_06]: We will execute the contract and we will

213
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:15,000
[SPEAKER_06]: begin work immediately, very immediately, to bring on the designer.

214
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:30,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the architect who will actually do the feasibility study and grapple with all of the cool, interesting, really challenging things that will go into making decisions about what the future of the building looks like.

215
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really exciting.

216
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:37,199
[SPEAKER_06]: When we met with all three vendors.

217
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I opened with saying that I am hopeful that my eighth grader sees the inside of something new before he graduates.

218
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:49,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think they understand our urgency quite clearly.

219
00:17:49,466 --> 00:18:07,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And even, we were able to have a lot of dialogue with all of the bidders but with left hand specifically to really impress upon them, just how overdue this is in Medford and that we're very aware that every day that we wait means this will cost more.

220
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:15,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are already thinking about how to accelerate the work that has to be done.

221
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:25,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it can't be accelerated, but where we can accelerate things like paperwork and getting through gates, we're ready to think about that.

222
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:32,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were just all for the energy that we imparted on them about what we are trying to do here.

223
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:33,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was exciting.

224
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,065
[SPEAKER_06]: The team is amazing.

225
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:39,707
[SPEAKER_06]: They provide a project manager.

226
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,468
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually two on our project.

227
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:47,812
[SPEAKER_06]: One is more communications and engagement focused, and the other is more construction focused.

228
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,693
[SPEAKER_06]: They seem like a very good team.

229
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,013
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of nice energy.

230
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:57,597
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an educational consultant who was the principal of a vocational school, maybe a superintendent.

231
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember, superintendent.

232
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:17,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Along with another, you know, any other number of credentials I think she was a special educator to start like she's sort of got lots and lots of good history behind her to help advise from an educational planning perspective, which is an important part of this project.

233
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:21,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's, you know, we got to meet the people who will be on the ground.

234
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:27,020
[SPEAKER_06]: when there's construction going on, you know, and everybody just really knew their stuff.

235
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was really exciting.

236
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you all would like to join us on Monday, you can meet them too.

237
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:49,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So our next thing is to work with, to get through this gate and then work with left field to issue a similar request for services for the designer, which is the architect.

238
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:56,433
[SPEAKER_06]: That selection process is quite different than what we've just done, so we'll learn more about that as we go.

239
00:19:58,808 --> 00:19:59,188
[SPEAKER_10]: questions.

240
00:19:59,228 --> 00:19:59,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.

241
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:00,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

242
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

243
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Reinfeld.

244
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:08,073
[SPEAKER_07]: So this sounds incredibly exciting, and I love the timeline, not just because I also have an eighth grader.

245
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:19,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious how the begin work immediately in June lines up with community input, particularly given that summer is a vacation time and our educators are gone.

246
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:23,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's an architectural selection and that probably needs to happen before we get the community involved.

247
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:27,923
[SPEAKER_07]: But when can we expect those sorts of conversations and meetings?

248
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:28,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

249
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:37,191
[SPEAKER_06]: The big thing is to get the designer on board, because they need to be part of those engaged discussions.

250
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:42,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So my goal would be that we use the summer for what I would call paperwork.

251
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:43,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more than paperwork.

252
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:53,304
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the not engaging part of this process, but to fill out the team, get that designer on board.

253
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:57,227
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can line up to the gates and stages that are

254
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:01,412
[SPEAKER_06]: outlined with MSBA so that come September, we're ready to go.

255
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:09,834
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the early fall, we wanna be ready to be having those kinds of community conversations that can't happen until the designer's on board.

256
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:17,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So the OPM will be very involved in that, but they can't do it without the designer because then we would just have to redo it and that would cost more money.

257
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:21,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, and I know you have a subcommittee for engagement and communication.

258
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We do, and they had,

259
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:33,935
[SPEAKER_06]: They had already like watched all of those meetings, of course, and they knew that we had a website they had already seen it so they're ready to bolster like on top of that.

260
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:37,861
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I appreciated that they talked a lot about is that.

261
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:44,883
[SPEAKER_06]: community engagement now is not just about hearing whether people want to pool or don't want to pool.

262
00:21:45,143 --> 00:21:45,863
[SPEAKER_06]: That's important.

263
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:57,345
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also important for the community engagement to start now so that we are building community interest in the project in the lead up to what will be a debt exclusion vote.

264
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:06,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're very tuned in to the fact that they play a really, really important role in helping us tell this story again and again and again.

265
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:12,368
[SPEAKER_06]: in all kinds of different ways in the lead up to what ultimately will be a really big ask.

266
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:13,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

267
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:15,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for laying that out.

268
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,610
[SPEAKER_07]: And congratulations.

269
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:23,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank the selection team who accommodated my awful schedule last week.

270
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:26,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a very, very long day on Wednesday, but we got it done.

271
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:29,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

272
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:29,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Great work.

273
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to the selection team.

274
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:39,096
[SPEAKER_10]: No further questions, we'll go on to resolutions.

275
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:42,759
[SPEAKER_10]: First is 2025-13 offered by member Rousseau.

276
00:22:43,519 --> 00:23:01,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Benefit school committee may send a delegate, an alternate delegate to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, MASC, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, MASS, an annual joint conference for the purpose of voting during the delegate assembly on the resolutions of the MASC.

277
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:09,371
[SPEAKER_10]: The conference is Wednesday, November 12th through Saturday, November 15th, with the delegate assembly being held on Friday, November 14th.

278
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:16,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Voting is only allowed in person and thus is recommended that only members who are able and planning to attend the conference be nominated.

279
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any nominations for delegate?

280
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:26,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

281
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:29,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to nominate Russo to be our delegate.

282
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,495
[SPEAKER_06]: He loves this activity so much.

283
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:38,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we have member Rousseau nominated.

284
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:43,249
[SPEAKER_10]: If there are no other nominations, do I hear a second?

285
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by member Olapade.

286
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:48,974
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

287
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:49,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

288
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:50,936
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

289
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:54,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, member Rousseau for representing Medford School Committee.

290
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there nominations for an alternate delegate?

291
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:07,836
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

292
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:08,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was really loud, sorry.

293
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,817
[SPEAKER_10]: You're good.

294
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:11,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really loud.

295
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:11,637
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

296
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Who would like to be an alternate delegate if we have no nominations?

297
00:24:14,718 --> 00:24:16,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Is anybody else planning on going to the conference?

298
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a definite.

299
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:19,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

300
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Member Topper could plan on going.

301
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,940
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're definitely going, you should be the alternate.

302
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we have Member Topper and Member Olapade planning on going.

303
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,902
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of you two maybe could, would one of you like to be an alternate?

304
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:45,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Member Intoppa has been nominated by Member Olapade, seconded by Member Branley.

305
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,413
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

306
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

307
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:54,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Intoppa, thank you for being the alternate delegate for the Medford School Committee.

308
00:24:58,307 --> 00:24:58,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Easy peasy.

309
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:13,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, 2025-14 offered by members so resolution in support of Massachusetts Association of School Committees resolutions reaffirmation, whereas the Massachusetts Association of School Committees ma sc bylaws article nine section one

310
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:32,892
[SPEAKER_10]: requires adopted resolutions of the association to expire three years after adoption, whereas the MASC bylaws article nine section one requires members member school committees to vote for the readoption of expiring resolutions for consideration of the annual car conference, and whereas the following resolutions are matters

311
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:35,493
[SPEAKER_10]: The school committee has previously supported.

312
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:52,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Now therefore be it resolved that the metric school committee reaffirmed support for the following resolutions regarding sanctuary laws for transgender students to increase the maximum balance allowed by the special education reserve fund membership of the board of elementary and secondary education.

313
00:25:53,587 --> 00:26:13,792
[SPEAKER_10]: to request the secretary of the member school committee convey to the MSC resolutions committee chair our support for the above resolutions being reaffirmed and request the secretary of the school committee engage with the MSC resolutions committee and other Massachusetts school committees as necessary to reaffirm the above resolutions pursuant to the bylaws of the MSC.

314
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:23,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, member Rousseau.

315
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:24,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

316
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:45,140
[SPEAKER_00]: So this last year we did this for the first time because the MASC two or three years ago made a change because every resolution that had been approved by the body just stayed as a resolution forever to be worked on by the MASC, which, as you can imagine, that list just grew and grew and grew.

317
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if everything's important, then nothing is important.

318
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:57,885
[SPEAKER_00]: So they changed the rules to require, so the things stay active as resolutions for three years, I'm pretty sure it's three years.

319
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:05,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, they would drop off unless school committees vote to say, no, we really wanna continue to work on this.

320
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:12,629
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the three, they were, I think, I can't remember, we got our packets from the association.

321
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:13,489
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of them.

322
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:17,530
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three that I thought were timely and necessary to continue to work on.

323
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:20,796
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two are pretty self-explanatory.

324
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:33,374
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one is because the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education does not allow educators in Massachusetts to be on the board, which

325
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:37,817
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much every school committee member and probably every educator thinks is insane.

326
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:47,983
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what this is about, is trying to make a change there so that there can actually be some professional educators on the board of education.

327
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,524
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems reasonable.

328
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:52,146
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have any other questions, let me know.

329
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:54,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have a motion to approve?

330
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:59,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

331
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,891
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

332
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:01,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

333
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:02,552
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

334
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:18,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes 2025-15 offered by member Reinfeld be resolved that the family engagement and communication subcommittee will meet to discuss protocols for family facing communications around after school enrollment and academic transitions.

335
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,047
[SPEAKER_10]: This meeting will include the director of communications as well as relevant program directors and school leaders member Reinfeld.

336
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:27,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

337
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:42,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things we hear a lot is, what do I expect when there's an after school lottery or when my child is coming to kindergarten or moving up to sixth grade or to eighth grade and I think the district has done a really nice job and.

338
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:59,356
[SPEAKER_07]: bringing on a director of communications to centralize some of the communications coming out of the central leadership, but I think we do better in some areas than others when it comes to communicating expectations about transitions for families.

339
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:09,661
[SPEAKER_07]: knowing that we have a director of communications now, and we recognize some of the things that are always going to need to be communicated.

340
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:16,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, there are program specific things that need to come from a program in the moment, but I think overall,

341
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:24,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we are at a point where we can really start to put together some frequently asked questions and some schedules that can be communicated to families in advance.

342
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:39,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would just like to have a deeper conversation and bring Director Pappichelli into that conversation to discuss how his position can support some of these very broad communications that affect a lot of people.

343
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:42,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor?

344
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:45,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Dr. Galusi.

345
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:46,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for this.

346
00:29:47,068 --> 00:30:06,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know that I have reported and spoke about to this board, spoke about my meet and greets that I had at all of the elementary, well, at all of the schools, but at every single elementary school and at some of the middle schools, this topic came up a lot.

347
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I would welcome the,

348
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,030
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunity to have continued conversation.

349
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:20,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we are trying internally to really look at our current afterschool, what we're able to offer for opportunities.

350
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that it's important to keep the lines of communication open.

351
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:30,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And Will does an exceptional job with communication.

352
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:33,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it would be positive and beneficial.

353
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:48,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will just add this isn't to take authority away from people who are doing communication, but it's to support them in that work and to, I think this meeting could also give some of our families a chance to communicate to us.

354
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:58,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you heard a lot of it at the meet and greets, but what they would like to know what they're expecting so we can be ahead of that and not

355
00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:08,617
[SPEAKER_07]: have all of our folks on the ground, spending all their time answering questions about things that could have been communicated in advance so that they could focus on doing the work and executing on it.

356
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:10,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

357
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:11,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

358
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

359
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,601
[SPEAKER_10]: So motion approval by Member Reinfeld, seconded by...

360
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:19,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham, all those in favor.

361
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:39,737
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed motion passes 2025-16 offered by member Reinfeld, whereas the federal government's current approach to taxation and tariffs has the potential to affect supply chains for school supplies, whereas shipping ports are currently experiencing fluctuations in their regular traffic from international goods and shipping.

362
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:52,800
[SPEAKER_10]: be resolved that the superintendent shall direct school and department leaders to identify the essential supplies for classroom use in 2025-2026 school year and make student supply lists available to families by June 2nd.

363
00:31:53,501 --> 00:32:09,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the district make every effort to anticipate internal needs for such materials so that a reserve of necessary supplies will be available throughout the year in the event of product scarcity and or rising costs, including for students and staff experiencing economic hardship.

364
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Good resolution.

365
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

366
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this mostly speaks for itself.

367
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:19,305
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of a trumped up version of our don't run out of paper resolution that I think we passed this time last year.

368
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:34,575
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and I, I do apologize because I know it is work to put together those school supply lists because they do change from year to year and I hate putting more work on school staff in this busy time, but I think it's really important that we give our families and indeed are the people in the system.

369
00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:45,201
[SPEAKER_07]: As much lead time as possible to pull together what they need for academic success in the new year when in the new academic year when we don't necessarily know what's coming down the line.

370
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that okay?

371
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:50,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you?

372
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

373
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

374
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:57,742
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, I do want to make sure I know one quick thing or just a few quick things.

375
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,643
[SPEAKER_08]: One student, we can work to get the student supply lists.

376
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:03,923
[SPEAKER_08]: They may fluctuate.

377
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:07,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the harder piece would be checking in with secondary.

378
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:16,066
[SPEAKER_07]: That was actually, I was going to mention that because I know that class selections are still being made and we're still figuring out what the offerings are.

379
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:19,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would look to you to advise on how best

380
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:46,756
[SPEAKER_08]: to handle that right there are core supplies that are needed and with the disclaimer that we cannot give this these elective sorry i cut you off no no no no no no but yes i did mean to mention that no i appreciate that because that would be the bigger lift right now because of the the middle school and high school builds with the passing of the new contract that's all still very fluid right now and some of the supplies are really

381
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:48,890
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of positioned at that level.

382
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:57,382
[SPEAKER_08]: When we're talking supplies at elementary, they're all suggested, none of it is like required, but we can work to do that.

383
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:02,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I think our meeting, so you would like this by the June 2nd meeting.

384
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:08,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking that gives us, because normally I think the lists go home on the last day of school in elementary school.

385
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,194
[SPEAKER_07]: They typically, yes.

386
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:10,815
[SPEAKER_07]: At least that's when I've gotten them.

387
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:11,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just say that.

388
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:17,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and I think secondary is more when the students receive their schedules in the middle of the summer.

389
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can try our best.

390
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:26,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know if I can sit here and tell you we're going to have a complete full list by June 2nd.

391
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,631
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems fair to me, and I think some is absolutely better than none here.

392
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:35,032
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's in draft mode, I can show you one in draft mode.

393
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:43,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other piece I did wanna say, and if you have like specific questions, I know that Noel can answer some of them.

394
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:53,145
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been keeping in constant communication with his Masbo network and other financial directors across the Commonwealth.

395
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:55,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they are definitely tracking

396
00:34:56,147 --> 00:35:03,689
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of this piece for you and has, you know, given me a lot of information pertaining to this subject.

397
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:18,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know a lot of the conversations that have been happening that Noel has been having, and I don't necessarily want to speak for him, but you know, the anticipated piece would probably fall heavy on technology and CTE.

398
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:23,334
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of what people are feeling right now is that we'll be okay with consumables.

399
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:25,355
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them are made in this

400
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:43,638
[SPEAKER_08]: country, but some of the materials that CTE may need and things around technology devices would be the pieces that are being tracked a little bit more closely with this uncertain time right now.

401
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:51,822
[SPEAKER_08]: But I welcome if you have specific questions, Noel might be able to answer them a little bit in more detail than myself.

402
00:35:53,344 --> 00:36:14,922
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe if, I don't know if you wanna adjust and just be resolved that the superintendent requests district school and department leaders to identify the essential supplies for next year and make them available as soon as possible versus by June 2nd, as we just heard that it, that might not, June 2nd might not be possible from all.

403
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:18,725
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the resolution goes a long way that you want them out as soon as they can.

404
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:21,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm okay.

405
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:28,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I normally don't like the vague language of as soon as possible or at earliest convenience, but I think that's reasonable.

406
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So I accept that amendment.

407
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:32,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

408
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Member Ruseau had.

409
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:36,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

410
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:39,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

411
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:49,159
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like it's been many years where we've talked about, or I've talked about, you know, we have these huge supply lists.

412
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:52,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to descend on target.

413
00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:01,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things that people are being asked to buy for the most part are not, they're good for a couple thousand years, probably.

414
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:07,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know how long a Rima paper is actually good for, but if it's not in the sun, it's probably good for a very long time.

415
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:13,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, if we weren't dealing with the schedule change, I would feel like I would say, let's do it now.

416
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:28,837
[SPEAKER_00]: we should just order a truckload or two of this stuff and have our students buy it from us at a discount, because it'll be cheaper if we were ordering pallets of paper and pallets of three-ring binders than Target's going to sell them for.

417
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:33,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So next year we should do that, okay?

418
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,422
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much going on right now, I feel like it's

419
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:40,950
[SPEAKER_00]: totally not okay to ask for this because it is a logistics piece of work.

420
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,271
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really, I don't think it costs that much.

421
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:55,755
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a, it's a logistics effort and I don't think we have the bandwidth, but something to think about for next year because I do think it's silly that, you know,

422
00:37:56,981 --> 00:38:06,930
[SPEAKER_00]: These things that are the same things that my kids bought when they were in kindergarten are the same things being bought today in kindergarten, and they do not go bad, other than maybe glue.

423
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:19,561
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no reason we can't buy them in bulk and have them for our students at a lower cost, or maybe someday at no cost, but that's a different conversation.

424
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:24,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it might help teachers also to be like, okay, we have,

425
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:50,793
[SPEAKER_00]: know 20 students and I need 20 of these and if we can get the parents out of the middle then the teachers can just fill out a requisition to get 20 of those and it just seems really clean and people aren't driving all over on weekends when they're busy and Facebook black market and you know it seems like an awful lot of effort by an awful lot of people when I think that if we took it out of the hands of

426
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:59,894
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the caregivers, and just teachers fill out a form I want this many things for my classroom for my students, it just seems really straightforward.

427
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:03,777
[SPEAKER_00]: But next year we should approach that.

428
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:06,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

429
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

430
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:13,284
[SPEAKER_10]: So, okay so there's a motion on the floor by member Ryan feld as amended member and tapa.

431
00:39:14,295 --> 00:39:20,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, as amended, so we're changing the shall to requests and the June 2nd to as soon as possible.

432
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,222
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Intoppa.

433
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:24,103
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

434
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:26,265
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

435
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:27,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion is approved.

436
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:29,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Member Intoppa.

437
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:41,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Food Allergy Awareness Week Proclamation, whereas more than 33 million Americans have food allergies, nearly 6 million are children under the age of 18.

438
00:39:41,784 --> 00:40:00,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas research shows that the prevalence of food allergy is increasing among children and adults, whereas nine foods cause the majority of all food allergy reactions in the US, which is shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, wheat,

439
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:19,267
[SPEAKER_10]: and sesame, food allergy reactions can range from mild symptoms to severe reactions such as anaphylaxis, whereas anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death, whereas every 10 seconds food allergy sends a patient to the emergency room.

440
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:25,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Reactions typically occur when an individual unknowingly eats a food containing an ingredient to which they are allergic.

441
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:37,779
[SPEAKER_10]: whereas emergency medical treatment for severe allergic reactions to food has increased by 377% in only a decade, whereas childhood food allergies cost U.S.

442
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:54,312
[SPEAKER_10]: families 34 billion each year, whereas now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools and the Medford School Committee proclaim May 11th through the 17th, 2025, Food Allergy Awareness Week in the Medford Public Schools and encourage the residents of the city of Medford

443
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:59,376
[SPEAKER_10]: and its associates to increase their understanding and awareness of food allergies and anaphylaxis.

444
00:41:00,237 --> 00:41:12,708
[SPEAKER_10]: The source can be found at the Food Allergy Research Education, which is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life and the health of individuals with food allergies and to providing them hope throughout the promise of new treatments.

445
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:17,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll pass it on to you, my fellow colleague with allergies, Amber and Tapa.

446
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:20,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

447
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:30,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's no surprise to anyone that this is a huge, you know, aspect of my life as someone who suffered with an anaphylaxis, you know, tree nut allergy for all my life.

448
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:43,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was actually the first meeting with that whole chaos of me coming onto the committee where I promised I wasn't gonna say anything and lay back and then ended up going into a whole tirade about how I went through therapy as a child.

449
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that.

450
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:54,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up going through therapy as a child because of an allergy incident within my elementary school where that was a safe haven for me.

451
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a place where I felt like I could be safe and eat food and not have to worry.

452
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:03,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found something with nuts in it in the school and it was being served by the school and I spiraled.

453
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was put into therapy for it.

454
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:08,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shouldn't happen to any child.

455
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:10,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And the school took abrupt action.

456
00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:13,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually remember the vice principal at the time, Ms.

457
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:19,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenner, sitting me down in her office and made me look through all of the food information sheets.

458
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:21,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't make me, but was like, this is everything.

459
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:26,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I would refuse to eat anything because I didn't trust it in the school system.

460
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:30,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've evolved and we've changed.

461
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:32,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's real.

462
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:33,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Gen Z is showing.

463
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,241
[SPEAKER_02]: really alarming statistics of the increase of those with food allergies.

464
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:45,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And the awareness level does not match the increase that people are suffering from it.

465
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:52,307
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people still think hand sanitizer kills those germs, or I can eat it two seats away, or if I just wipe it with hot water, I'll be fine.

466
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:53,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not.

467
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:55,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not okay.

468
00:42:57,672 --> 00:43:05,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, how do people use epinephrine, you know, auto injectors, my entire senior thesis was in epinephrine auto injectors and the lack of people knowing how to use them.

469
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's no fault of their own, they just weren't taught.

470
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:12,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at ways that we can better make this aware, you start with a proclamation.

471
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:18,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the Pellican family for sending this our way and making us aware of this and telling their story.

472
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I just wanted to put this proclamation forward so we can get the ball rolling on, you know, better ways to make sure that the community is aware of how to deal with this issue.

473
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:30,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

474
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:31,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

475
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:32,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Intoppa.

476
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:33,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for putting this on.

477
00:43:33,997 --> 00:43:46,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Shanine Pelequin emailed us all, her child, you know, children with food allergies, one thing for us adults to have them, but children with food allergies is scary and it's so hard.

478
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:54,630
[SPEAKER_10]: bringing awareness through the school committee and obviously I'm sure we'll all do it next week through our social media accounts is so important.

479
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,752
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to pass it off to Dr. Lucy.

480
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:59,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we have somebody on Zoom that would like to speak.

481
00:43:59,414 --> 00:43:59,854
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.

482
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:01,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for this resolution.

483
00:44:02,036 --> 00:44:03,077
[SPEAKER_08]: It is very important.

484
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I too am an adult with food allergies and I carry my EpiPen around with me always.

485
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:13,045
[SPEAKER_08]: But our director of nursing Jen Silva has

486
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:18,789
[SPEAKER_08]: just consistently been an advocate and a champion for this work.

487
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:29,678
[SPEAKER_08]: She and her whole entire department, especially with a lot of information and a lot of training for staff around the use of proper EpiPen if need be.

488
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:36,444
[SPEAKER_08]: She is on via Zoom and has some things to share about the work of the district and her department.

489
00:44:40,363 --> 00:44:41,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr Lucy and good evening.

490
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:44,168
[SPEAKER_01]: John, thank you for bringing this forward.

491
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:52,298
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so important and I'm so excited about us making this proclamation to make May 11 to 17 food allergy awareness week in our schools.

492
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to talk a little bit about how we currently promote food allergy awareness, though.

493
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:58,946
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know there's so much more work to do.

494
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:11,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, I'd like to talk a little bit about our Food Services Director, Retta Smith, and her staff and how diligently they work to ensure that our students with food allergies who need meal modifications can access school meals.

495
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:20,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Retta really works with families who need support and who need different meals in the cafeteria to make sure those meals are safe to consume.

496
00:45:21,502 --> 00:45:31,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Our building administration, our nurses, our cafeteria staff all work with families to determine different systems that can be used in the cafeterias to keep kids safe with food allergies.

497
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:38,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our cafeterias are using what we call peanut tables rather than peanut-free tables, which are kind of a thing of the past.

498
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:49,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And at those peanut tables, a student who has a peanut-containing meal can actually sit with a friend and eat at that table to sort of keep it a little bit more contained.

499
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:55,708
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some schools that are using sort of individual desks so that students can eat and prevent cross-contamination.

500
00:45:55,728 --> 00:46:01,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these really are efforts to support our mission to be inclusive and not exclude students with food allergies.

501
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Our nurses train all staff on how to give epinephrine.

502
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:15,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, people without food allergies may not know this, but there has been a huge advancement in medication for food allergies, for emergencies.

503
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:23,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have an intranasal spray that we can use, which is much easier for lay people to give rather than an injection.

504
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:29,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So soon enough, we'll be training all of our staff how to give that as well, which is a big improvement.

505
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:37,255
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Misatoch Elementary School, students have had the opportunity to participate in what we call the Be a Pal or Protect a Life program.

506
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:45,298
[SPEAKER_01]: What the Be a Pal program does is it helps children learn how to protect a life by being a good friend to others with food allergies.

507
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:55,778
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do is they partner sort of older students to be leaders to younger elementary students, and those students mentor those students about food allergies.

508
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:05,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Our nurses, Karen Roberto and Lori Boriello, train those leaders about food allergy awareness, and then those leaders visit assigned classrooms throughout the year.

509
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:08,168
[SPEAKER_01]: and work to teach younger students about snack rules.

510
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:21,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Their goal is to teach them about how serious even life-threatening food allergies can be, how important it is not to share food with each other because of food allergies, and about washing hands after every snack and meal to prevent cross-contamination.

511
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:32,072
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of our professional development this year, Karen and Laurie also educated their fellow nurses about the Be a Pal program so that we can work on bringing it to all of our schools in the district.

512
00:47:32,952 --> 00:47:41,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, this past weekend, there was a New England School Nurse Conference where Karen and Laurie had the opportunity to present their work to about 300 school nurses.

513
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:43,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty exciting to share what they've been doing.

514
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:52,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing I want to talk about is that we are currently working with caregivers to form a food allergy educational support group.

515
00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:03,430
[SPEAKER_01]: The objective really is to provide camaraderie, friendship, networking, support, education for all of our families who are managing their children who have been diagnosed with food allergies.

516
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:19,858
[SPEAKER_01]: We've affiliated with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America in New England to provide support for the group and Dr. Xavier, our school physician, is also providing some support at a physician level for the group and we're looking forward to our first meeting via Zoom on May 15th at 7 30.

517
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:21,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, thank you so much.

518
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:23,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that this proclamation was made.

519
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:28,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much Ms.

520
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:29,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Silva.

521
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:30,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Intoppa.

522
00:48:32,497 --> 00:48:33,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so thank you so much.

523
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:48,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually meant to mention that in my whole, you know, speech on top of the speech of, so like many of us, I got to go serve lunch for, you know, I'm going to lunch service hero day.

524
00:48:48,646 --> 00:48:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to visit my old school, the Mistletoe, and they sort of gave me a tour of the building and I got to feel like, you know, principal for the day.

525
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And it felt really wrong to be back there because that was a no go zone as a student.

526
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:14,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I was really happy to learn about was that the nut, the, you know, the peanut tree nut free table is now the peanut tree nut table and where, you know, I used to have to sit there away from all my friends and I used to sit there and eat, you know, lunch every day.

527
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:16,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that's not the case.

528
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:21,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And that those students don't feel ostracized from the group and separated from the group because of something they can't control.

529
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really happy to see that.

530
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:27,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And they showed me the bathroom that they lead the students to so they can properly wash their hands.

531
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:30,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not bringing it back to the classroom where they may sit next to that student.

532
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:36,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you Nurse Silva for bringing that, Director Silva for bringing that to all of our attention.

533
00:49:36,899 --> 00:49:39,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice to see that on Friday.

534
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

535
00:49:42,471 --> 00:49:42,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

536
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:46,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor by Member Intapas for this proclamation?

537
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:48,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Member Reinfeld.

538
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:49,035
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

539
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

540
00:49:50,076 --> 00:49:50,836
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

541
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:52,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion is approved.

542
00:49:52,237 --> 00:49:55,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week will be declared Food Allergy Awareness Month.

543
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,221
[SPEAKER_10]: A week, sorry, week.

544
00:50:00,472 --> 00:50:04,616
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have reports requested or condolences, which is nice.

545
00:50:05,637 --> 00:50:14,024
[SPEAKER_10]: We have our next regular meeting on May 19th, 2025, here in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

546
00:50:14,384 --> 00:50:19,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, next week, six to eight, on Monday the 12th is our MSBA, is the MSBA committee meeting.

547
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to adjourn?
