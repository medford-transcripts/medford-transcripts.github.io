1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,199
Thank you so much for joining us today.

10
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,924
If you don't mind just starting with an introduction, so if you could share your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:53,725
Sure.

12
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:55,086
Thank you for having me.

13
00:00:55,346 --> 00:01:00,531
My name is Patrick Clerken, and you'll see on a lot of my signage, my first name is actually Charles.

14
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,692
So if you see Charles, that is Patrick.

15
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,634
My pronouns are he, him.

16
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:09,758
And my backstory is I've lived in Medford for seven years now.

17
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:12,624
I live in the Tufts practice fields area.

18
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:22,169
And what got me to, I'm sorry if I'm skipping ahead and you're gonna ask this question anyway, but what got me into this race was a neighbor said, oh, I really wish someone would join.

19
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:34,795
So that was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back, but it's really been this cumulative process of me getting more and more involved in the neighborhood that I live in because community neighborliness is something that I really value.

20
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,216
So I feel like it's been a long time coming.

21
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:42,668
Thank you, yeah, and we definitely will follow up with some other questions about the campaign.

22
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:53,150
But before we do that, we're just gonna ask you kind of like common question for everyone, which is what is your choice to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat?

23
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,571
So I really, people will argue with me over what qualifies as a restaurant.

24
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:02,792
Like I say, a cafe, I would say I really like Brownder, which is right near me.

25
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,093
I really like Rosso's on Mystic Ave.

26
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:17,942
Particularly, they have a pork chop with fingerling potatoes and vinegar peppers, which I find really delicious.

27
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:20,444
So I'll give you the specific dish as well.

28
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:22,646
Thank you.

29
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,849
Well, I think so maybe we can just jump in.

30
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:33,195
You started to touch on reasons for running and what your initial commitments to council may look like.

31
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:47,527
Maybe you could dive in a little deeper and maybe even share some sort of pieces of why your particular background and, you know, capacities, capabilities might lend to a strong, you know, experience on the council.

32
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:49,148
Sure.

33
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:49,868
Yeah.

34
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:57,550
I think that what you'll see in a lot of my campaign imagery and various sites and social media is this image of the bridge.

35
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:11,093
And it's because, uh, throughout my life, I've been involved in a lot of different, uh, organizations or jobs where I find myself basically being this, this mediator role between different groups.

36
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,793
So I'm a mechanical engineer.

37
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:17,499
And I worked in a corporate job for a little bit as an employee.

38
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,420
I'm now a contractor for that same company.

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,483
But I was often between the engineers and the marketers who really speak a different language.

40
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:33,006
And they're both valuable, but in isolation, they can go way to the extreme.

41
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:36,548
And that's what I find in a lot of political situations is

42
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:55,056
I think that people get really bogged down in the culture wars, and I'm not saying that there's no value in the culture wars, but I think that conservatives and progressives can actually have a lot of areas of agreement and overlap that they don't necessarily realize.

43
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:59,558
And I think that I can be sort of a fundamental link between them.

44
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:03,820
To give you some other examples of me being sort of this

45
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:10,380
this bridge or this intermediary role is when I was in college, I went to Northeastern.

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,483
I joined a fraternity, Alpha Kappa Sigma, and I am now out of college.

47
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:18,064
I'm on the fraternity trust.

48
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:24,246
And so that means basically working between the different generations, the alumni and the actives.

49
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:29,349
Growing up, went to a church and I grew up in North Reading.

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,281
and the Union Congregational Church.

51
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:44,307
And I was on their board, the House Committee, which dealt with sort of handyman type stuff around the church, the church grounds and facilities.

52
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,608
And so that was dealing with a lot of different groups of people.

53
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:46,948
I don't know.

54
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,929
I just often find myself in this position.

55
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,851
So it seems a little bit destined.

56
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,652
I think I can really do it for Medford.

57
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:57,013
I have a lot of patience and a lot of curiosity.

58
00:04:57,073 --> 00:04:58,534
And I think it's a role that

59
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:01,165
is needed right now because I've seen a lot of animosity.

60
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:06,893
Agents might be key if you're used to a corporate pace stepping into public office.

61
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:15,424
Yeah, I've been watching a lot of Parks and Rec too to get myself prepared for some of the things I might see.

62
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:22,150
Yeah, we saw you're checking out your campaign page on Instagram and we're seeing a couple of your posts.

63
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,235
The most recent one was like a meme of calling yourself a cautious optimist.

64
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:29,817
Yeah, yeah.

65
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:35,262
I've used that term before and I differentiate that from obviously a pessimist.

66
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:43,438
and a naive optimist, which is kind of like the, we all know the pessimist, or maybe it's optimist.

67
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,899
Well, I was gonna say the meme with the dog with everything on fire.

68
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,741
You know, I guess that's more of an optimist, but, and he's saying, oh yeah, everything's fine.

69
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:57,123
But a naive optimist to me is the like, oh, like good vibes only, nothing wrong here.

70
00:05:57,203 --> 00:06:00,765
And so I'm not naive to the problems of the world.

71
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,463
But I believe it or not, I am actually optimistic.

72
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:08,904
I think that people, like I said before, I think people have more in common than they realize.

73
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:10,344
It's just untapped right now.

74
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:15,685
I wonder, though, what you've seen those areas of contention to be in Medford.

75
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:21,907
Because I think sometimes when we hear some of those topics, like you mentioned the term culture wars, some of those ideas

76
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:27,371
are sometimes do center around like certain groups like human rights, right?

77
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:44,284
So like I do wonder like what you see as those topics being in Medford and sort of what the ones you would choose to be most relevant or where there could be some sort of sharing of common ground versus maybe a right or wrong answer.

78
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:47,146
So two things that come to mind right away.

79
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,668
The first is relations between

80
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:54,913
tenants, landlords, homeowners, and developers.

81
00:06:55,334 --> 00:07:01,116
I see that has a big core as to what Medford has been and what Medford wants to be.

82
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:09,299
And people have different opinions on both of those and very strong opinions because those are opinions that are not purely objective.

83
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,359
They're wrapped around people's identities, right?

84
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,581
And anything that's wrapped around your identity is going to be fraught and difficult.

85
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,682
And so trying to

86
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:28,014
bring those different interests to the table in a way that allows them to see that you do need balance among these things.

87
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:39,004
There are different roles in an ecosystem, you have to look at Medford as an ecosystem and to say we need to basically prioritize homeowners above renters or renters above homeowners.

88
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:53,400
Unless it's a very specific context, it's kind of like saying, oh, we should just get rid of pine trees in the ecosystem and not thinking that's going to have rippling consequences, right?

89
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,985
I do think there's a balance that's kind of underappreciated right now when people have these narrow special interest views.

90
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:01,526
So that's one thing.

91
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:05,450
And the other thing is transparency.

92
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,510
People talk about it a lot.

93
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,012
It's become a buzzword, but I think

94
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:28,510
not just transparency, but the ability to communicate between the mayor and the council and the school board, between all of the departments of City Hall, and then between the constituents of Medford across all 16 precincts and City Hall.

95
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,691
So it's like there's a lot of siloing.

96
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:37,633
And I think that when,

97
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:46,137
When we look at the issues out on the streets, like the potholes in the roads, I, like most people in Medford, want to see those fixed.

98
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:50,379
But I also want to get across to people that it's often the tip of the iceberg.

99
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,779
It's not just what you see in front of you.

100
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,760
It's also a behind the scenes.

101
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,722
And like I said before, I have the patience to kind of disentangle that mess.

102
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:06,764
If you ever worked with a box of holiday lights that are all tangled up in a knot,

103
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,616
I have the patience of working with different people with that.

104
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:13,667
So that's what I really am going to try to bring to this.

105
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:21,287
Yeah, I think too over the last, I'm going a little bit off of our script here, so I apologize.

106
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:38,798
I think over the last couple of years, especially during COVID, as people became like a little more engaged in city politics and issues in the city, and we saw the murder of George Floyd and all the sort of cultural outcomes for that for Medford, there have been some big issues that I think have divided folks.

107
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:45,022
So like an example would be like the renaming of what's now the Missiduck School and sort of how

108
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:55,708
that what that's meant for different people in Medford and I think that that was like a really like contentious argument.

109
00:09:55,728 --> 00:10:03,032
Or maybe even the vote to declare racism a public health crisis and just, you know, absorb that as a truth.

110
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:03,413
Yeah.

111
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:10,649
And you mentioned sort of intergenerational communication, right?

112
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:22,098
And I think Medford has a history of being like a pretty culturally Italian city and how that sort of came up in that, in the renaming of the Mizzou Tuck School.

113
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:30,546
So yeah, I guess I see those as like some of those issues I was referencing before that like really have impacts on

114
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:36,523
some people's like, you know, sense of safety in the city and how you feel like that.

115
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:42,268
I don't know how you feel like that would work into your sort of bridge making approach.

116
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:53,480
Yeah, I think it's like what you mentioned with the renaming of the Columbus School to the Mississippi Tuck School is a good example of these various groups that

117
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,592
any given issue isn't just in isolation.

118
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,413
It's chained to a whole bunch of other issues, right?

119
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:11,256
And so that isn't just seen as a simple, for the various sides involved, it's not seen as a simple one-off change.

120
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,917
It's different groups of people feeling

121
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:20,168
sort of this anxiety of are we being slowly eroded or erased here, you know?

122
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:44,183
And I think that what I'm trying to bring to the table is more like explaining to people the fuller context of things and sort of reassuring them that like this isn't a symbolic of, you know, if someone's saying, I don't want the school to be renamed because it's, you know, like there's a proud history here for us, like I understand

123
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:53,881
that they're not saying that they're proud of all the terrible things that Columbus might have done, aside from the good things that he might have done, right?

124
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:03,645
I also would try to explain that this isn't part of a large conspiracy to erase

125
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:09,322
your cultural history from Medford, it's more to sort of balance things.

126
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,083
And there's always a give and take, you know?

127
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:21,752
I really do think that a lot, like there's a missed opportunity where a lot of people feel that they're approached on these topics in a very adversarial way.

128
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:30,900
And it's just like the conversation from there only starts with people digging their heels in, and it only gets worse from there.

129
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,202
So it's funny because,

130
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:46,447
I have some policy ideas, but I also think a big part of this is just cultural, where you've got to get people to, like I said before, put down the guns and the standoff where everyone's got a gun pointed at each other.

131
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:50,290
And that's not just a me thing.

132
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,253
I'm going to do my best to do that and treat all the different parties with respect.

133
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:59,216
That doesn't mean that I think that any given party is fully right on anything.

134
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,135
that's not just a me thing.

135
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,136
Like a lot of people need to pull together to that.

136
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:09,600
So I'm going to try to at least display that as much as possible.

137
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,302
Do you have thoughts on what that looks like?

138
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:28,033
And you know, in your potential role as counselor, what does it look like to practice, you know, listening, hearing, education, you know, the pieces you're kind of mentioning around shifting perspective, even if it's just a little bit for some.

139
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:45,679
Well, I've already started it to an extent, I've tried to incorporate it as much as I can in my campaign where I have tried to meet with all the other candidates that are running to various degrees of success I know people are busy but I'm at least trying to do that.

140
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:55,869
have sent letters to all the city hall departments basically being like, look, I'm not trying to get you to rat on anyone or anything.

141
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:58,370
I'm not trying to get you to put yourself in a hot seat.

142
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:05,874
I can understand if you don't want to, but what are the things that you think work well in your department that you think don't work well, that kind of stuff.

143
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,274
And it was to every department.

144
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:10,836
I didn't just focus on one area or another.

145
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:18,100
So it's kind of bringing the voices to the table in a broader way.

146
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:33,403
And with the expectation that, okay, this is going to be a constructive conversation rather than like a quick devolution into the depths of the culture wars, you know?

147
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:35,966
Because there's a lot of baggage that comes with that.

148
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:55,779
I guess when I asked that question, my assumption was that you might speak about sort of grassroots, the folks of Medford, I think in some ways, other candidates who are already running and folks who are employed by City Hall occupy spaces of power in a different way than kind of the common citizen.

149
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:06,286
So I guess I wonder, like, do you have, you were talking about potential policy thoughts, do you have thoughts on how you might, you know, own some of the work on the ground?

150
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:11,259
and how can constituents feel connected to your work?

151
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,641
How to own some of the work on the ground, is that what you asked?

152
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:18,241
Yeah.

153
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:19,042
Yeah.

154
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:29,906
So almost borrowing from the idea of the fireside chat from like 70 years ago or whatever, this idea of having an update for people.

155
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:34,468
And I hope that can somehow merge into the idea of

156
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:39,044
a common source that people can reference.

157
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:41,706
It used to be print journalism.

158
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:49,791
I don't know to the degree that it will be print journalism, but I do know that everyone has their own facts now or their own thing that they check.

159
00:15:50,471 --> 00:16:01,838
So trying to bring some of that into ideally something that could be distributed to the different precincts in Medford so that people have an idea of what's going on.

160
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:19,363
And then another idea that I had was how people could contribute and understand and put forward better ideas is inspired by basically Google Maps, where on Google Maps, you have these different layers.

161
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:23,646
You can see the transit layer, the business layer, the recreation layer.

162
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:33,354
And I was thinking, what if Medford had basically that, but for each department, where each department submitted a map that represented its ongoing projects or where its key

163
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,156
uh, resources are located.

164
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:47,242
I don't, you know, if it's, if it's all the schools, if it's all the spiritual stuff in Medford, if it's all of the, um, the, uh, street repairs under construction, everything.

165
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:58,027
And then you, you basically brought that together in some form of, uh, document and, and made it accessible for everyone so that when they put forward ideas for projects,

166
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:08,128
It kind of forces them to see Medford in a more multi-dimensional way rather than just, oh yeah, take all the money out of the budget and put it towards my project.

167
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:11,888
Those are two ways.

168
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:15,792
I have a mentor who used to say, build it and white people will come, right?

169
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:19,456
Like whether it's print journalism, whether it's office hours, Facebook live, right?

170
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:26,382
If you create a mechanism for access, especially oftentimes the loud minority will show up because they're used to being heard.

171
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,384
They're very comfortable with engaging.

172
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:34,751
And I say, I think one of my thoughts is what does access to you and your, you know,

173
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:40,129
the power that you might glean by way of this role, what does that look like for women, right?

174
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,791
How will you lift female voices in Medford?

175
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,933
How will you lift BIPOC voices in Medford?

176
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:51,698
I think especially since Floyd, we've had a lot of conversation about how and why that hasn't happened.

177
00:17:53,059 --> 00:18:01,026
And so like, I'm very, I am in Medford known for being very, very blunt, but like just saying like, you know, why another white guy?

178
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:04,269
Or like, what is special about your role in making space for us?

179
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:20,811
So I would imagine that all these various groups aren't just some people lumped together and cluster together, but there's probably also quite a spread of all these different groups across Medford, right?

180
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:31,395
And so I would hope that in just making sure that each of the precincts has access to, like what I was saying before,

181
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:49,532
the journalism or if there's a new repository that's put on the website, making sure that the marketing is put towards each precinct rather than just where most of the money is.

182
00:18:51,593 --> 00:19:03,995
I would say that's really at a granular level, probably as far as I can go, and I have to trust that the rest of it needs to happen with other on-the-ground people and micro-community leaders in

183
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:19,637
I'm trying to focus on the arteries and the veins, and I need other people to focus on the capillaries, because I can't do it all myself, and nor would I try to do it all myself.

184
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:34,788
I want this to be a group effort, and I want to, like I said before, bring the voices to the table, and not just the loud, angry voices in every group,

185
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:39,779
you know, really some of the voices that get talked over a lot.

186
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:52,950
And I'm not, I'm not saying anyone, any group in particular here, because I feel like once I say, oh, I'll do this for a particular group, it's just this very polarized time that we live in.

187
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:59,615
People just assume that you mean, oh, well, yeah, to the exclusion of this other group, you're gonna focus exclusively on them, you know?

188
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,258
So I'm not trying to be like,

189
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:07,388
evasive, per se, when I am answering this way.

190
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:16,894
It's more like, it's trying to preserve some degree of neutrality in the campaign so that people truly see this as representative of all of Medford.

191
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:31,844
And not just in this lumpy way of, oh, we are all one, and kind of just marginalizing some of these voices that you're talking about, but in a way that is almost like a mosaic, where it brings together all the differentiation in a bigger whole.

192
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:34,187
That's what I'm trying to.

193
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:47,315
Probably equality of, I'm trying to say it without the word equality.

194
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:56,460
It's access rather than results oriented, I think, or yeah, equality is based on,

195
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:20,033
Sort of like let the chips fall where they may getting people to a position where, where, you know, everyone's given the same opportunity but but then let the chips fall where they may and then equity is is trying to more level the playing field I think to go a bit further.

196
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:29,635
Yeah, and I would say that, like, by not highlighting certain groups, it's sort of ignoring the fact that those groups have been ignored by the city for a long time.

197
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:33,376
And we talked to David Harris, I think a couple, maybe like a year and a half ago.

198
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:37,217
And he's like, actually, what is he?

199
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,058
He's pretty, he's pretty famous around here.

200
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:43,559
He was like a professor at Harvard, but he is one of the most genuine, like, I want to be David.

201
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,760
He is a genuinely, you know, brilliant person.

202
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,801
And because he commits to

203
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:52,266
You know, the next iteration of knowing.

204
00:21:52,286 --> 00:22:00,171
And he said something that really stuck out to me about like, we always use this idea of like how to bring people to the table.

205
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:09,537
And, and I think that that's we're assuming we're making that's making a lot of assumptions about people's associations with this table and I think that like, even if it's not been explicit.

206
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:27,091
there's been a lot of exclusion of people of color like young people renters women like in the in city hall right like yes, we can say like anybody can come to these meetings and tell us what they think but really like it's not that's not how it feels for lots of these folks so I do think sometimes like.

207
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:44,825
in the vein of equity, if we're not saying, like, we are working on, like, building relationships with the Brazilian population in our city, with the Haitian population in our city, with the queer population in our city, because those are the people that we want to be hearing more from, rather than just expecting them to show up because we've invited them.

208
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:56,273
And so I think maybe what Shelley's also leading towards is, like, we've interviewed several other candidates that are part of those communities, so they are maybe more, in your metaphor, like,

209
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:21,617
able to access those capillaries and so I do wonder like for you if you I mean we've sort of asked this a couple of times but like what if you have any thoughts about that idea of how to maybe help what the city can do for like increasing equity and and reaching some of those folks that have I think been excluded from you know policy change and you know city government in general.

210
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:32,518
I think using existing resources and institutions to try to make sure that people know what is already available is pretty critical.

211
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:47,047
And like I said, I think that you can get, even in an already local situation, you can get very micro-targeted with how deeply you want to go with any of this stuff.

212
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:50,569
So I'm trying to do with what's in reason here.

213
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:58,852
you know, partnerships and pairings with various groups around Medford, I think, would help.

214
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:07,877
But yeah, like I said before, I don't want to just become associated with the, like, you're the X group candidate, right?

215
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,679
Or you're the X group representative.

216
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:20,784
I do believe that there's a awareness problem

217
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:34,036
And, and obviously a, um, like there's been a discrimination problem and then there's also a motivation problem too, where it's like, um, you try to focus on the first two and then the, and then the third.

218
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,217
Could continue to be a problem too.

219
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:37,418
Right.

220
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:38,678
Cause there's that old expression.

221
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,959
If you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

222
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:47,121
So you, you basically want to get people, uh, as aware of things as possible.

223
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:50,703
You want to get people encouraged, but you also have to realize that

224
00:24:55,562 --> 00:25:02,543
Yeah, so you can go crazy trying to force people sometimes to join into programs.

225
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:07,924
And then there's also a question of who truly represents any given group, right?

226
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:11,084
Because do I represent white people just because I'm white?

227
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:14,725
Or do I represent men as a group just because I'm men?

228
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:20,326
There's all kinds of diversity within groups as well that I think often gets overlooked.

229
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:43,645
I don't know if any of these groups in Medford have specifically designated leaders in any capacity, or if they're informal leaders, or if they're just sort of these more polyglot groups of people that are leaderless and decentralized, right?

230
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:50,168
Like, there's always gonna, like, if I said, oh, I'm gonna engage with this group, and I'm gonna engage with their leader,

231
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:55,116
half of that group might then say, well, who the hell's anointed that person later, right?

232
00:25:55,936 --> 00:26:04,139
So there's, it gets very fractal, like it's very difficult if you get too granular.

233
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:12,843
So I'm trying to, I'm trying to balance the pieces in the whole without getting lost in either, if that makes sense.

234
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:18,985
And I know that sounds kind of abstract, but it's, it's a, it's a tough balance to get right.

235
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:20,546
You know, and I, and there's a lot of,

236
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:33,273
suspicion surrounding, uh, understandably politicians now because they lie a lot and they, uh, they make promises that they don't deliver.

237
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:36,735
So yeah.

238
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:43,319
Trying to bring earnestness, earnestness, sincerity, working with people.

239
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:50,923
If things are brought to my attention to, to try to work with those groups, but I don't know everything about Medford, you know,

240
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,665
I it's every day is a learning experience.

241
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:57,986
So thank you.

242
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:03,969
So we do have like some more fun questions for the end.

243
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:07,911
Um, so we always ask folks to share kind of like a fun fact.

244
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:13,574
So something that they, uh, want to share with us that they think we might not know or might surprise us.

245
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:16,595
So I wonder if you have anything that you'd want to share like that.

246
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:19,557
Uh, so I,

247
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:26,249
I briefly had a podcast, I left, it was called Nan vs. Mob.

248
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:44,694
And it was basically this kind of similar to the themes that I've been describing throughout this interview of trying to kind of bring people together and rise above some of the kind of the more obnoxious aspects of people screaming in each other's faces.

249
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,595
And so that was, that was kind of what

250
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:56,626
started this trajectory probably before my neighbor ever brought up running for office of any kind.

251
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:01,188
And it started the trajectory if I did

252
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:07,390
20,000 plus miles of driving around the country at the start of the pandemic.

253
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:15,255
I wanted to see the country sort of not just the coasts, but, uh, between the coasts everywhere and off the interstates everywhere.

254
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:31,884
And so, um, yeah, this, this podcast that I did kind of launched me on this, uh, this trajectory of, of stepping away from that traditional corporate job and, uh, seeing a lot of things in a short amount of time, I'd say.

255
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,545
and just having conversations with people in a spread out, geographically spread out way.

256
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:41,767
Interesting.

257
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,049
Thank you.

258
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:52,215
And I think that rental car companies, it's safe to say rental car companies probably have me on a list as don't rent to this guy because I put 18,000, yeah.

259
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:56,638
Yeah, I put 18,000 miles on a rental car in like four weeks or something.

260
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,879
Well, thank you.

261
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:10,160
So the last thing we just want to check in is if there's anything else that you want to plug, any events that you have that are upcoming.

262
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,060
Yes.

263
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,321
So I have a fundraiser coming up on Thursday, September 21st at the Chevalier Theater.

264
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:19,741
I'm sorry, not at the Chevalier Theater.

265
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:20,442
That's in my head.

266
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:25,362
At Ford Tavern, which is across from Wegmans in Medford.

267
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,443
And that starts at 6 p.m.

268
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:30,669
like I said, on Thursday, the 21st.

269
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:34,231
And my website is now fully operational.

270
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:39,695
I've been doing a lot of this, this stuff solo, you know, kind of like this.

271
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,777
Like I said, I'm not associated with any special interests or anything.

272
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:45,780
So sometimes things take a lot longer.

273
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,764
And so my website, Clerken for Medford, that's C-L-E-R-K-I-N with the number four.

274
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:59,859
ClerkenforMedford.com is now up and on Instagram it's at Clerken for once again number four Medford.

275
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,484
So that's primarily what I engage with and you'll probably see me out canvassing.

276
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,685
I'm doing a lot of canvassing now.

277
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:07,846
All right.

278
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,807
Traveling through the precincts.

279
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:12,550
Well thank you Patrick.

280
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,872
Anything else that you want to add before we wrap up for today?

281
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:18,843
is pretty much it.

282
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,389
I covered a lot and you guys asked great questions.

283
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,972
So I appreciate it.

284
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:24,774
And thank you once again.

285
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,517
