[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

36
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:15,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure who's going to get us started, but I'll turn it over to Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent, Mr. Murphy, to get us started.

37
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

38
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:25,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pleased to report that this is our eighth meeting on the budget process.

39
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:32,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, Mr. Murphy, who's going to, you know, explain

40
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,763
[SPEAKER_02]: the steps that were taken, but I really feel like this year it has really been an opportunity for us to really look at the budget through another lens.

41
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:52,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would like to thank Mr. Murphy, Michelle Kingdon, and the team that have worked really hard in putting this presentation together.

42
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:56,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to the questions and conversations that we're going to have today.

43
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So without much further ado, Mr. Murphy, please begin your presentation.

44
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:02,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

45
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:07,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and I'll just echo the thanks particularly from Ms.

46
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:21,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdon for all of her support and help, as well as all the principals, department heads, and other administrators who assisted in developing the budgetary proposals that have been brought before you over the course of the last month.

47
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor, with your permission, I'm going to bring up a deck that should be very familiar to everyone by now.

48
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,429
[SPEAKER_00]: as I know large portions of it, you've seen several times.

49
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:57,405
[SPEAKER_00]: So in light of the fact that this is the eighth time in which you've been presented with this information with hopefully some new and refined information in each go round, I am going to go at a relatively brief pace, understanding that as is always the case in the budget process, we have members of the community who are jumping on the train at various stops

50
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:07,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to provide appropriate context, I will reiterate certain points that we have discussed throughout all of our committee of the whole meetings.

51
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:12,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be more than happy to answer questions from the committee.

52
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:24,317
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that this is a public hearing, respond to comments from the public to the extent that there are some related to both the process and to the priorities that have been presented before you.

53
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our overall budget process.

54
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:30,833
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen this flowchart many, many times now.

55
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:32,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank Ms.

56
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:40,956
[SPEAKER_00]: McLaughlin in particular for the suggestion of ensuring that the timeline was a piece of the information that we reiterated time and time again.

57
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:48,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And slight change now in this next slide, as we've now moved, you've received the superintendent's recommendations.

58
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're at this final section of the flowchart in which tonight we will ask that you

59
00:05:55,357 --> 00:06:11,147
[SPEAKER_00]: take a vote to send to the municipal government a budget request, and we'll talk a little bit about, in a moment, the distinction between adopting the budget and making the request that you as the governing body of the school system are empowered to make.

60
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:21,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from very early in the budget process, we've talked about the various lanes of funding that go into developing the school district's budget.

61
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:32,595
[SPEAKER_00]: our 70 allocation that comes from the state, our local contribution that comes from the municipal government generated primarily through property taxes from the people of Medford.

62
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:36,617
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our external funds that come in year in and year out.

63
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:49,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a particularly important lane in the COVID era in that the federal government has provided to school systems a significant amount of funding that is earmarked specifically for districts

64
00:06:50,578 --> 00:07:04,770
[SPEAKER_00]: with the intention, as we've echoed at the local level many times over, the importance of attempting to provide the remedial support necessary to support our students in the wake of an unprecedented instructional disruption.

65
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:17,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we discuss the budget priorities, as we have discussed the budget priorities over the course of the last month, we've returned to that theme over and over again of making sure that

66
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:26,392
[SPEAKER_00]: we are funding priorities and building goals to make sure that our students' educational careers are not defined by this instructional disruption.

67
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:34,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on April 26th, I think, on or about April 26th, we presented to you our initial projections.

68
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:43,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we said at the time, you'll remember, is that we were estimating about a $2 million, $2.1 million increase in fixed costs.

69
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:46,588
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the costs that are attributable

70
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:51,790
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions that far predate the FY22 budget.

71
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,431
[SPEAKER_00]: They are contractual in nature.

72
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:57,314
[SPEAKER_00]: They are oftentimes compliance-based.

73
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:09,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the costs that we know before the school committee or the administration make any strategic decisions related to our students' needs in FY22, the 21-22 school year, those are costs that we know we're going to incur.

74
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:14,869
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we discussed over the last several weeks, it became clear throughout the budget process

75
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:24,004
[SPEAKER_00]: that primarily due to some increases in special education tuition and transportation costs, that that number was actually going to go up to closer to $3 million.

76
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:32,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, again, you've heard me say several times, special education budgeting is a roller coaster of sorts.

77
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:34,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fluid.

78
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:35,788
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always very fluid.

79
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,288
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fluid, frankly, throughout the fiscal year.

80
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:40,469
[SPEAKER_00]: The $1 million variation is not particularly

81
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:46,137
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual at any point, even in the development of the budget before it's adopted.

82
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:59,506
[SPEAKER_00]: What buffers that, what insulates us from the total impact is there's a significant amount of external funding that comes in through Circuit Breaker or IDEA grant to help defray that.

83
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:03,869
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are not going to see, of the 3.1, it's about $2 million.

84
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,850
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from special education.

85
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,631
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to see a $2 million increase

86
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:15,851
[SPEAKER_00]: effect at the local level, because we're going to have that external funding that's going to offset that to some degree.

87
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:24,956
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have fluidity, as I said, throughout the fiscal year, meaning that that it could go up and therefore we have to plan based on those projections.

88
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why that number is where it is.

89
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:40,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also been some fluctuation in the numbers since we presented on May 19th, the final committee of the whole, as was relayed to the communication that came with the budget to the school committee.

90
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:56,624
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been available on the school district website now for several days, that as we, the process we call scrubbing the budget, going through and looking at each line to determine, is there a more appropriate place to put a particular budgetary priority?

91
00:09:57,385 --> 00:10:09,155
[SPEAKER_00]: From that, we were able to reduce by north of a million dollars, primarily by when we presented with our department heads and principals in order to provide an authentic representation

92
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:10,772
[SPEAKER_00]: of the school district's needs.

93
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:22,799
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a number of budgetary priorities that ultimately when we looked at them with a closer lens and really scrutinized them, we saw them as belonging on the capital side of the budget process.

94
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a reduction to suggest we are not going to do the things that were represented by the information presented to you throughout the committee of the whole meetings.

95
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,826
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that some of them we think, it varies.

96
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:38,768
[SPEAKER_00]: There's additional grant funding that we've learned about last week.

97
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:41,074
[SPEAKER_00]: that may come through our E-rate process.

98
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:45,276
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could assist in the building out some of our technology infrastructure.

99
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:55,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some other capital funding available that we think we're going to be able to address things like generators and hot water heaters.

100
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:03,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had some good conversations with some folks in the city administration about various funding sources for some of that work.

101
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:08,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of the information that was presented to you, to the best of my knowledge, was accurate.

102
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:13,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it does, uh, detail what it is that we are expecting and hoping to do.

103
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:24,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately the recommendation before you tonight, um, does land within that 3.1 to $5.8 million range that we had projected on, on April 26th.

104
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:37,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So with regard to the total numbers, we'll talk a little bit about in a second, the highlights, um, the operating budget, not including external funds for

105
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,620
[SPEAKER_00]: FY21 is $62.3 million.

106
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:48,425
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes that $1 million supplement that the district received when the Chapter 70 funding was released in late August.

107
00:11:50,026 --> 00:12:00,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the critical recommendations, that's the first column in each of the budget narratives that were presented to you over the course of the last month in all of those Committee of the Whole meetings, is $67.2 million.

108
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:19,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the recommendation tonight for a request to the municipal government is the $68.2 million, which is reflective of the committee's endorsements of, uh, the, the priorities presented to you during the budgeting process.

109
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:29,800
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the point in which I have to say, as you've heard me say many times, the school administration has, uh, concurrent responsibilities.

110
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:41,911
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our responsibilities is to assess the district's needs in an authentic manner and present that information to you as the governing body of the school system.

111
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:55,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that the authentic needs of the district in terms of what would be a sound prudent investment that would benefit the students of Medford is $68.2 million, thereabouts.

112
00:12:56,453 --> 00:13:00,574
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, our second concurrent responsibility

113
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Is to plan to operate the district with whatever appropriation is ultimately made.

114
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:11,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the $67.2 million represents.

115
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:18,254
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we discussed at the very beginning of this process, a range from 3.1 to $5.8 million.

116
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:27,201
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that when we make this request to the municipal government, the municipal government, the mayor, the city council, all of the other municipal officers.

117
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:39,805
[SPEAKER_00]: who I would say incidentally have been cooperative partners and there's been, I think, excellent dialogue between our school administration and our counterparts at City Hall throughout this process.

118
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:51,527
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there is a broader context in which that appropriation is being made and we will be prepared to operate the district effectively to benefit students regardless of what the appropriation is.

119
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:58,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have a responsibility to be straightforward and transparent and candid with the community

120
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,348
[SPEAKER_00]: about the importance of this investment.

121
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:17,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we have attempted to fulfill those two dual responsibilities, both to be prepared for whatever contingencies there may be, and also to be transparent and straightforward with the school committee and the community at large as to what the needs of the district are.

122
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:24,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would also say that the other variable involved in this budgeting process is that we know

123
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:37,008
[SPEAKER_00]: that the federal funding that is available is going to position us to pursue several of those priorities for which there is a strong nexus between the need and the impact of the pandemic.

124
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:42,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly that having that essentially a federal backstop to that is important.

125
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:52,534
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we've discussed, understanding that the ESSER funds are one-time funds and when possible should not be used for reoccurring expenses,

126
00:14:53,226 --> 00:15:01,492
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that positions us in a place where we don't want to be creating the types of structural deficits that we know are unsustainable at our current pace.

127
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:19,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that, and I know there's been a lot of discussion about this, so I just want to be candid about the fact that I'm not suggesting that this investment, as sizable as it is, represents a revolutionary or fundamental change in investment on the part of the community and public education.

128
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,031
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what this is.

129
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:38,218
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is is an attempt to be honest and sincere about the needs and the priorities of the district in a way that will do right by students within realistic parameters and without being shy about what the needs of the district are.

130
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:45,861
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is not always the easiest needle to thread when presenting this information, but over the course of this process,

131
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,011
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we've attempted to do.

132
00:15:50,671 --> 00:16:17,425
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, understanding that after you make this request to the municipal government, and the municipal government ultimately makes an appropriation, we will then present to the school committee a revised budget that will either look identical to the one that you see tonight, represent where necessary a scaling back of certain investments, or theoretically,

133
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,071
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding upon those investments.

134
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:25,954
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do that, we will also have a clearer sense as to what the ESSER budget will look like.

135
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:32,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some highlights here in terms of the things that this budget would position the district to do.

136
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:43,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you've heard about these over the course of the last month in the several meetings that we've held, and all of that information is available on the district website and for members of the community who

137
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:59,117
[SPEAKER_00]: have not had the opportunity to go back and see, well, I don't know that, I would say, and I thank, and I both thank and commend the committee for the extent to which each of these committee of the whole meetings have been run in a very timely and efficient manner.

138
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:03,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of them have landed pretty much at the two hour mark.

139
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:14,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for those looking for 10 hours of, I think, fairly interesting, insightful, and candid discussion about the budget of the Medford Public Schools, I think those are,

140
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:21,389
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're looking to spend 10 hours to doing this is as good of a way to do it as any other 10 hour allotment that I'm aware of.

141
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:29,331
[SPEAKER_00]: And these bullets here with regard to intensive literacy and math support expanded after school and extended school programming investment.

142
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:37,633
[SPEAKER_00]: And all key and targeted staffing support and investments, all of those are represented in the presentations.

143
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:41,258
[SPEAKER_00]: that we made and that were endorsed by the committee.

144
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:49,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, this represents the end of my presentation for the moment.

145
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that because, again, you've heard a lot from myself and other members of the team over the course of the last month.

146
00:17:56,866 --> 00:18:04,990
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said in my memo to the school committee, we are grateful to the committee and to the members of the community who have allowed us and given us this audience to present this information.

147
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:11,966
[SPEAKER_00]: We do believe that this represents an authentic assessment of the needs of the Medford public schools.

148
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:22,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look forward to taking your questions and working with the municipal government to continue this budget process over the course of the next several weeks.

149
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:22,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

150
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:30,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

151
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:45,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we were all hand delivered our budget book over 145 pages on Friday.

152
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:53,467
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did spend several meetings, like Mr. Murphy said, discussing the budget.

153
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:58,530
[SPEAKER_09]: But are there any further comments or questions or any questions from the community we can answer?

154
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:04,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

155
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:06,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

156
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:13,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to be 100% clear that our request.

157
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:28,088
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if that was the allocation that the mayor actually gives us in her budget that that will be the line item in her budget, not a different number with understanding that funds are coming from s or other places.

158
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:37,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our recommendation is for the request to the municipal government to be for $68.2 million.

159
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:49,157
[SPEAKER_00]: If the municipal government were to appropriate less than that, then when we present to you again on this, it would present a proposed budget reflective of the appropriation that was made.

160
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:55,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, we would present a proposed budget to use the ESSER funds for.

161
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:06,081
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've talked about, and this is, I appreciate their question, Mr. Russo, because it's an opportunity to say again that there are sort of two schools of thought when it comes to ESSER.

162
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:21,834
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that the ESSER funds are there and should provide relief to municipal governments because that's the money that can go to schools and they need not essentially, it doesn't need to be considered a supplement.

163
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,617
[SPEAKER_00]: The other school of thought is that the,

164
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:50,805
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools, I'm using schools very broadly now, really nationwide, not just in Medford or Massachusetts, but that school districts have incurred disproportionate expenses because of the effects of the pandemic and the instructional disruption that we discussed, and that therefore ESSER should essentially be walled off and should be used only to support those additional expenses and challenges caused by the pandemic.

165
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:57,396
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point that we've discussed several times is that it is impossible to completely separate the two.

166
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,558
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been increased costs on schools.

167
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:05,081
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why there is additional federal funding available to address all of the municipal government's needs.

168
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:20,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And to say that ESSER should be the only money that goes to schools would completely discount the fact that we've incurred greater expenses in many ways and have greater challenges than almost any other entity in society, nevermind municipal government.

169
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:31,164
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, it is impossible to completely wall off a set of budgetary priorities and say, well, those are COVID-related expenses.

170
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:43,170
[SPEAKER_00]: The social-emotional supports that our students are in greater need of now were and will be needs even when the pandemic is a distant memory.

171
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,072
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we have to acknowledge that these things are intertwined to some degree.

172
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we've tried to do is

173
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,941
[SPEAKER_00]: We're presenting the operating budget proposals first.

174
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:59,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is appropriated, we will use the operating budget to support.

175
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:19,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know there are some specific pieces that either because the nexus is so tight and strong with the COVID impact, or because as a contingency plan, in the event that the appropriation is less than what the request is by the school committee, then we know that that's how those two things will be separate.

176
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:34,996
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's why we've generally outlined the things that we have a pretty good sense are gonna go to the ESSER budget, and then others that we prefer operating budget, but we will present that information and ultimately propose to the school committee based on the appropriation that is made.

177
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:36,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

178
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:41,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have lots of questions, but I have sort of a specific question.

179
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:52,703
[SPEAKER_01]: about transportation, the budget shows it going up 50,000 or 56,000, which I assume is actually the increase that the contract requires each year.

180
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,865
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows us going up to 18 buses.

181
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:57,627
[SPEAKER_01]: We're currently at 17.

182
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:06,894
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be able to cut that down to 16 to give us the two bus buffer to accomplish the transportation for the high school.

183
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:11,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see any money related to actually doing that.

184
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:14,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that money?

185
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:16,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

186
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:18,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So the $56,000 is the fixed cost increase.

187
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:22,234
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is at least the increase in cost for FY22.

188
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:23,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to that.

189
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:28,440
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a slight variation in any given fiscal year, but the FY22 increase is $56,000.

190
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're correct that as we discussed, I believe it was on May 19th,

191
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:52,131
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be the case that by repurposing some buses and taking a closer look at the bus routes, at least based on our initial consultations with the bus vendor, and just as a reminder, this was a contract that was extended in the spring of 2020.

192
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're completing year one of a three-year contract.

193
00:23:56,872 --> 00:24:04,194
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe there's at least one bus that can be repurposed and therefore we can expand the free transportation

194
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,733
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow bus capacity at the high school.

195
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:18,976
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee has directed the administration to establish the transportation program such that no students will have to pay to get the transportation that they're entitled to.

196
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:33,859
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the process now, we've had one initial meeting with the bus vendor in which this was discussed and there's plans to meet on an ongoing basis over the course of the next month and potentially slightly longer than that.

197
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:42,647
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the process of accumulating the data we need to determine what is the most prudent strategy to expand that transportation option.

198
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:55,776
[SPEAKER_00]: You're correct that it is not in this current budget proposal because we don't have the data to say with specificity, how many buses we would need to accomplish the goal established by the committee in that vote.

199
00:24:56,376 --> 00:25:03,661
[SPEAKER_00]: And my concern is that we have a partner, one that we work well with in the Eastern bus.

200
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,122
[SPEAKER_00]: They are under contract.

201
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:16,521
[SPEAKER_00]: we have notified them that we very well may want to expand our yellow bus capacity in the next fiscal year.

202
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:23,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting them on notice of that and communicating to them is frankly as comfortable as I am.

203
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:32,109
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I am most comfortable doing at the moment, because if we do anything else of a more official variety,

204
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:37,190
[SPEAKER_00]: to suggest that we are definitely going to need additional buses.

205
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we look at the data, it may be the case that we only need one more.

206
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:44,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And by repurposing the buses we have, we can accomplish that.

207
00:25:44,374 --> 00:26:02,804
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do anything else to indicate that we intend to expand that capacity, I am somewhat concerned that the vendor could then rely on that representation to procure the infrastructure that they need

208
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:05,314
[SPEAKER_00]: to fulfill that intention.

209
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:25,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it turns out that either because the data we collect, and the data includes where students live and what high school students are expressing as their intention, and for anyone who has met a high school student before, on occasion, their intentions change, as do their preferred methods of transportation.

210
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:32,528
[SPEAKER_00]: If that were to happen, we could be in a situation in which we've made a sizable investment in transportation

211
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,441
[SPEAKER_00]: without any actual benefit being realized by students.

212
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:44,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it may be the case that by the time we present a budget to you to adopt, we have data that we think is reliable.

213
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:49,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might say at that point, okay, you know, we want to shift this around.

214
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:56,526
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to use this funding for this at the time, for the time being to increase from one to two or one to three or what have you.

215
00:26:56,966 --> 00:27:00,887
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we have a mandate from the school committee, which is very clear.

216
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:06,495
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, frankly, makes a lot of sense and seems to be a big step forward in terms of transportation equity.

217
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:14,522
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have enough data to actually say, let's spend this amount of money on it, which is why right now we're only going with the fixed cost increase.

218
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:15,983
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a long explanation.

219
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:17,644
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good question.

220
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,606
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not the only person who's asked it.

221
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:21,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you are asking it.

222
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:26,892
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to need more time to figure out exactly what we need to do to comply with that directive.

223
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:28,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

224
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:37,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham, then Member Kreatz, and then I think I saw Member Van der Kloot's hand up.

225
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:40,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mayor.

226
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:56,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna make sure I'm clear that anything listed in the tables with a TBD next to it is not something we can expect to see at the beginning of the next school year.

227
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:57,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that?

228
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:02,793
[SPEAKER_06]: under this budget, under the $68,221,865.

229
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:09,055
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think I would necessarily say that that's true.

230
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:12,036
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably true in the TBDs that I can think of.

231
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:17,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the TBDs that were in a column that say long-term priority, I think that's probably true.

232
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:24,121
[SPEAKER_00]: There is and there always will be a lot of fluidity within a $68.2 million budget.

233
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:54,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is certainly possible that if the municipal government were to appropriate $68.2 million, given the types of movement that you always see during a budget and savings that is just sort of naturally realized during the course of the year, it's totally possible that something could materialize and something that currently has TBD next to it could become something that we're able to do and certainly keep the committee informed of that.

234
00:28:56,201 --> 00:29:16,505
[SPEAKER_00]: But most likely the TBD ones are, again, the most smart, they're long-term priorities that were presented to the school committee because we, at the committee's direction, wanted to present as authentic and comprehensive a collection of priorities and goals as possible.

235
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:25,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a specific example or examples, I'd be happy to speak to that, and I might be able to get into more specificity as to the sort of likelihood

236
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:30,375
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, if it's listed at TBD, it's more likely that it's long-term.

237
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:35,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to collect more data to determine whether it is both necessary and possible.

238
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:43,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually, as I was saying, the bus is a great example of that, that we know what the S, we know what it would be, but the variable is not the cost per bus.

239
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:46,259
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's in the $75,000 to $80,000 range.

240
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:49,840
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, how many would we actually need?

241
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a variable that at the moment, it's very possible that it could happen.

242
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:54,661
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't have enough data

243
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:56,838
[SPEAKER_00]: information at this point to say that it will.

244
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

245
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was about $852,605.20 outlined as infrastructure requirements.

246
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:08,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they part of the $68 million ask to the municipal government?

247
00:30:08,984 --> 00:30:10,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for the most part, no.

248
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:35,050
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that, you know, there will be times where if things are, depending on the urgency of something that has to happen, it's conceivable that they could overcome that.

249
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,931
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be something we would bring back to the school committee.

250
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:46,457
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't, if it's something that really should be a capital expense, it's certainly our hope that we would keep it on the capital side of the ledger.

251
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:51,120
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think specifically, there's some,

252
00:30:54,203 --> 00:31:00,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology infrastructure related to archiving and network security.

253
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:10,494
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some subscriptions related to our access points and making sure that they're properly renewed in a timely manner.

254
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:20,601
[SPEAKER_00]: That piece, which is about 75 or $100,000, that's something that could theoretically be considered essentially an annual maintenance or semi-annual maintenance.

255
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be.

256
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:48,210
[SPEAKER_00]: but by and large of the $850,000, anything beyond the points that I just made technology-wise, and then all the heavy infrastructure that we discussed in the Buildings and Grounds presentation, generators at the high school, security cameras at various schools, Chris, tough spoiler, those are things that we intend to put out, request for proposals, and to utilize the existing capital budget to support.

257
00:31:50,231 --> 00:32:06,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And also in the building and ground budget, there was $240,000 listed for restroom, rehab, Medford High main entrance, a truck and plowing equipment and renovation of the Karen Theater.

258
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:10,170
[SPEAKER_00]: All capital, not in the 68.2.

259
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:10,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in the 68.2.

260
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:12,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

261
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:15,195
[SPEAKER_06]: And when will we be talking about the capital budget?

262
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:20,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as soon as we get done talking about this budget, it would be my guess.

263
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:24,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully within the next, I would, hopefully very soon.

264
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:32,039
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I would just say there's, there is $153,000 increase in the buildings and grounds.

265
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:43,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's in contracted services, but it might be the blind below contracted services with the idea being that the maintenance that is required to maintain upkeep of the improved HVAC systems

266
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:45,266
[SPEAKER_00]: will have added costs.

267
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:51,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that 153,000 is attributable to that.

268
00:32:52,332 --> 00:33:09,907
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, and then on the elementary school side of the budget, the language in each was building-based literacy and math coaching positions under long-term budget priorities.

269
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:15,849
[SPEAKER_00]: You are correct and I appreciate the attention to that detail.

270
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:26,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is included in the 68.2 and it's an exception to the rule related to keeping long-term priorities out of the FY22 budget.

271
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:31,917
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that, and I really genuinely appreciate Ms.

272
00:33:31,937 --> 00:33:40,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham raising this point because it's an opportunity to illustrate what I meant by ultimately we are planning for the contingencies necessary

273
00:33:41,274 --> 00:33:42,795
[SPEAKER_00]: based on whatever appropriation we're giving.

274
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:58,604
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee communicated to us at one of the latter committee of the whole meetings, at least to some extent, their hope that some of the previous long-term priorities would be incorporated into this budget proposal.

275
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:09,911
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sentiment from that was very, very clear, even though ultimately the endorsement of the budget proposals that were being made, I would say, includes the endorsement of something designated as a long-term priority.

276
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:17,450
[SPEAKER_00]: because it fit within that projected range, we did include that in this proposal.

277
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:33,719
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will also say that the administration I think has been very clear and candid about where our priorities are and what we are essentially currently structured to utilize and to capitalize on best.

278
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the appropriation is less than the request,

279
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:48,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect that the coaching positions are not going to be included in the recommendation that comes before you for the budget adoption.

280
00:34:48,670 --> 00:35:07,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about why that was in the May 18th committee of the whole, but just essentially it is that while we think ultimately literacy and math coaches would be an excellent investment and it will help build up our capacity and will improve instruction for students,

281
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:21,152
[SPEAKER_00]: going from our current zero to eight as outlined here is not something that we think, frankly, we have the capacity to do to the standards that we would need to.

282
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:32,960
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, now, could it be the case that we do fund one position and start to build out our train-the-train models and build out our capacity to prepare for eventual additional investment?

283
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think that is possible, but I do not anticipate

284
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:43,462
[SPEAKER_00]: that those would be high priorities based on the contingency planning that we're doing.

285
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:55,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're out there and you're thinking about applying to be a math or literacy coach, I would say probably rethink that at least for the time being.

286
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:58,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for clarifying that.

287
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:05,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also wanna clarify that we're sticking with half of a librarian for four elementary schools for the upcoming year.

288
00:36:06,977 --> 00:36:08,779
[SPEAKER_06]: as the desired number.

289
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:18,267
[SPEAKER_00]: The library staff, the library staffing allocation is currently embedded within the instructional technology department.

290
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:30,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it was referenced in the memo that there's still some clarification that we need to, we need to iron a few of those details out.

291
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:32,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't anticipate

292
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:37,830
[SPEAKER_00]: that we would make a significant increase in the recommendation related to library staffing.

293
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:53,113
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think that there are some short-term staffing needs due to the expanded technology that is going to need to go into that umbrella department.

294
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:59,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, and this is, I think that both administrators, Mr. Heron and Ms.

295
00:36:59,414 --> 00:37:00,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Laden, who presented to you,

296
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:11,158
[SPEAKER_00]: is not at all a reflection on them, but the structure of those departments, I think, is leading to some challenges.

297
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:23,249
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that manifests itself is that because those departments are structured the way that they are, there's staff that should be focused on libraries that are having to address technology-based issues.

298
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:28,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is never, it's not a good practice, generally speaking.

299
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:38,546
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be the case that we use some ESSER funding to have some temporary support on the technology side to free up some capacity on the library side.

300
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:42,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the ways that we're going to address some of the challenge that we're seeing.

301
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:53,931
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not, and we talked about at the beginning, this being a significant and healthy investment, but not necessarily representing the type of fundamental change that has been discussed in various forms.

302
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:58,472
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not suggesting that our temporary technology support

303
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:06,891
[SPEAKER_00]: that frees up some library staff represents the type of fundamental change that some may advocate for.

304
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:15,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that would be represented, but I do think it would improve the situation in terms of just having more support in the libraries.

305
00:38:16,237 --> 00:38:22,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that sounds like a convoluted answer to a very simple question, I would say that I agree with that.

306
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:28,066
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that there's some more untangling that has to happen

307
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:36,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I don't expect us to recommend a significant increase in the library staffing.

308
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I do expect we'll be able to improve the situation.

309
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:53,554
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be some change by way of a slight increase in investment when the numbers play out over the course of the next several weeks before we come before you with a recommendation for a budget to adopt.

310
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,475
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a messy one.

311
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:57,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to talk in circles.

312
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:04,464
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that that is a particular difficult one that we're trying to fix.

313
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:05,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

314
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:09,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Graham.

315
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:14,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz, and then I believe Member Van der Kloot, Member McLaughlin, and then Member Ruseau.

316
00:39:16,093 --> 00:39:16,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

317
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question might be similar to Ms.

318
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:19,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Graham's question.

319
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:23,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a very, I mean, I think it might be the same exact question.

320
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a question.

321
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:39,972
[SPEAKER_05]: How will the costs associated with some of the repairs that we discussed in the building and ground subcommittee last Wednesday, you know, we talked about the generator at the high school, the hot water system.

322
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:50,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the transformer is listed in this budget and the Curtis Tufts hot water system or boiler.

323
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:55,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you mentioned at the beginning, I was just trying to type everything down really fast.

324
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,171
[SPEAKER_05]: How will those costs be paid?

325
00:39:58,812 --> 00:40:06,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially, there's a few different sources, but they're all in the capital budget line.

326
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:13,042
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's approximately $815,000 line item that's been appropriated to the schools and about $160,000 line item that was appropriated from a previous project.

327
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:35,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, the ones that you specifically just mentioned, I would anticipate RFPs being issued, and then the administration coming before the committee to request authorization to spend down from those capital funds to address those urgent capital needs.

328
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:44,516
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's specific to the generator, the boiler, and there's a third one that's not the hot water heater.

329
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:51,773
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would have to get back to, and I'd have to get back to you at a later date on the third one.

330
00:40:51,793 --> 00:41:01,079
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hot water heater, we're in active discussions right now in the hope of not having to utilize those funds for that.

331
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,261
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same for the restroom project and the front entrance as well.

332
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:06,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

333
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:10,685
[SPEAKER_05]: And when do you think we'll get the appropriation from the municipal government?

334
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:12,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess in the past,

335
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:28,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I'm wrong, but I think in the past, we typically had the appropriation, like when we went into the final budget meeting, like we knew what we got for a number, but I could be just not remembering it correctly.

336
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:29,064
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you are.

337
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:31,306
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I can answer that.

338
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:42,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Just meeting with consultants today for the first time, CLA, they're gonna be helping the city, and we still have interim guidance on ARPA.

339
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:48,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So that guidance isn't final, therefore there's no final numbers, but we're still working through it.

340
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:54,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're right, membercrats, usually the city would give a number, we'd have that number already outlined.

341
00:41:55,646 --> 00:42:00,127
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to do is do everything I can to make this a reality for our students and faculty.

342
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:01,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

343
00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:20,633
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just say again that our from just from a finance perspective that our communication with the city's finance team is continuous and collaborative and you know really it's not uncommon for the person in my job and the person the city CFO job to

344
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:25,374
[SPEAKER_00]: not always have the most collaborative conversations, that just has not been the case.

345
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:29,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that and I'm grateful for that.

346
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:49,834
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the sort of shift in the process that the committee asked us to employ and what we've done over the course of the last month, and this is really important, particularly for members of the community that may have watched this process play out year in and year out, is that we've tried to build a proposal

347
00:42:50,475 --> 00:42:52,677
[SPEAKER_00]: that is authentic to the needs of the district.

348
00:42:53,157 --> 00:43:00,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And so rather than build a budget that just drives toward a predetermined number, we have assessed the full needs.

349
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:02,125
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's such a big number.

350
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:09,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're making this recommendation so that the school committee can fulfill its responsibility to make the request.

351
00:43:09,691 --> 00:43:17,217
[SPEAKER_00]: The municipal government has responsibilities that are inclusive of the schools, but certainly also

352
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:20,552
[SPEAKER_00]: effect the community in its entirety.

353
00:43:21,052 --> 00:43:30,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And we understand that we're a constituent part of that community, which is why, again, we concurrently are preparing to operate the district based on whatever appropriation is made.

354
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:37,079
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to be transparent and honest with regard to what our needs are, which is why we presented this publicly.

355
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:45,242
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it's the case that every other municipal department does not present their needs in a public forum.

356
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:46,663
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the

357
00:43:47,128 --> 00:43:49,049
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what is unique about a school department.

358
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:59,295
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if we're not going to build a proposal that it's authentic to the needs of the school district, as you heard me say on April 26, I don't know what the point of the school committee is.

359
00:43:59,935 --> 00:44:03,057
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to make that request.

360
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:10,161
[SPEAKER_00]: The municipal government has to take that request and then balance that against the needs of the city in its entirety.

361
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:16,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will address, we will operate the district with whatever appropriation is made.

362
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:19,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

363
00:44:19,232 --> 00:44:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said one follow up.

364
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:28,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think it would be two weeks, three weeks, like where, you know, I'm just curious, like, I mean, you know, we don't know.

365
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:30,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we'll just be waiting.

366
00:44:30,277 --> 00:44:36,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, well, we have plenty to do in the meantime.

367
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to, we'll build out in addition to those contingencies, build out the the ESSER

368
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:52,993
[SPEAKER_00]: which will include obviously priorities and work that we'll be doing over the course of the summer and some of those pieces that we know that there's such a strong nexus between the impact of the pandemic.

369
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:56,934
[SPEAKER_00]: So it won't be after June 30th, I know that.

370
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,855
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly a backstop to that.

371
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:12,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I also would say that once there is a clarity as to what the municipal government is expected to appropriate, we wouldn't necessarily have to wait until like June 29th to bring it before you.

372
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:22,005
[SPEAKER_00]: we could present it to you based on what we know is being recommended and, you know, and then along with the ESSER number.

373
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:38,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've sort of penciled in the week of June 21st, I think, if that's a Monday, somewhere in that week, could be toward the end of that week, but, you know, that's probably where we would end up landing, but the worst case scenario would be the following week.

374
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:41,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

375
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:47,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Kreatz, Member Van der Kloot, Member McLaughlin, Rousseau.

376
00:45:50,128 --> 00:46:01,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mr. Murphy, you and I spent considerable time today discussing the issue that my colleague brought up at the top of this meeting with the transportation for the high school students.

377
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:11,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what we come down to, if I'm clear on it, is that no final decision has been made except that you are working towards the fact that the school committee wants to provide transportation.

378
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:21,634
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I thought about after our discussion was whether students would still be able to buy bus passes if they were so inclined.

379
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:41,046
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to the committee what you want to be available here, but I certainly would strongly recommend that we leave that option available to students, in part because, as we discussed, there are students that are using the MBTA pass for part-time jobs or for

380
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:46,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine internships, or frankly, just to get around town and to see their friends.

381
00:46:46,894 --> 00:46:59,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the discounted pass is a benefit that we wouldn't want to deprive them of, even if we are taking steps to ensure that they're not dependent upon it to get to school.

382
00:47:01,544 --> 00:47:01,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

383
00:47:02,225 --> 00:47:17,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to follow up, during the course of the discussion, I expressed great concern that the Eastern bus projection that we would be able to go down a bus was a terrific surprise to me.

384
00:47:18,073 --> 00:47:22,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it is true that we have less students currently than we did.

385
00:47:22,315 --> 00:47:25,917
[SPEAKER_03]: It is unclear exactly how many students will be returning to us.

386
00:47:26,997 --> 00:47:44,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is, I just, I think that we need to keep what our budgeting generous in this area because I believe, I just know from the past that all of a sudden we have requests from the woodwork and it's very, very difficult to take back something that you've given before.

387
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:46,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a concern.

388
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:52,023
[SPEAKER_03]: On the bright side, I do wanna mention that there were so many things in this budget which are positives.

389
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,663
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, I'll just pick a small one.

390
00:47:55,764 --> 00:48:04,465
[SPEAKER_03]: In the world languages, we are going to introduce French in the sixth grade level and textbooks for that have been provided for.

391
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:18,628
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also textbooks in the science area, and I didn't go through all of them, but I don't want members of the public to think that there aren't, in fact, major upgrades in many, many areas.

392
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:22,644
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, there are some areas which I am a little concerned about.

393
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:27,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go back to my fine arts where earlier I had asked many questions about this area.

394
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:34,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I had been advocating strongly for a supervisor, a director position of fine arts.

395
00:48:36,315 --> 00:48:41,619
[SPEAKER_03]: After a discussion with the superintendent, it's clear that she's not yet ready to move on this.

396
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I understand that in some ways, in other ways,

397
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:55,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I still feel that the area is so critical in that social emotional well-being of life area.

398
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:02,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So we aren't doing that right now, but I've certainly made it clear that my concerns in the future.

399
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be watching that very carefully.

400
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:15,930
[SPEAKER_03]: However, given that that isn't happening, I was a little surprised not to see some of the smaller requests increase inventory of instruments, including ukuleles.

401
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:20,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I had asked about the number of violins, being that we're going to be starting both

402
00:49:21,315 --> 00:49:22,836
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially two grade levels.

403
00:49:24,017 --> 00:49:27,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those things I don't see funded.

404
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to ask about that.

405
00:49:29,482 --> 00:49:43,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also wanted to question, I assume that some of the other things that we talked about for science, I mean, excuse me, for summer enrichment programs are under the TBD sort because that's gonna come from ESSER funding?

406
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:44,996
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct, yes.

407
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:50,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, could you go back and talk about the smaller bylines and fine arts at them?

408
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:52,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

409
00:49:54,017 --> 00:49:54,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.

410
00:49:55,378 --> 00:50:09,589
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the reason that they're not specifically identified in particular lines at the moment is that we need a little more time to identify exactly what the investment would be and what the budgetary impact would be.

411
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:13,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it is very possible that

412
00:50:14,775 --> 00:50:17,756
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the relatively small nature of that investment.

413
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:35,583
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, not having determined how many ukuleles we need to buy, I can't say exactly how small it is, but it's not something that is going to be so sizable that we won't be able to absorb it within the general fluidity of the budget.

414
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:43,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to change that would be difficult because there could be

415
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:48,584
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 other things of a similar magnitude that we can't anticipate right now.

416
00:50:49,224 --> 00:51:00,749
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would definitely say, I would definitely not say that because, and I'm using ukuleles, not in any way to make light of ukuleles, just because I think it's a good illustration and it's one that we can all remember.

417
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:12,494
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are going to determine that our increased, say our extended school day initiatives focusing on the arts are going to require

418
00:51:13,018 --> 00:51:28,722
[SPEAKER_00]: an additional 25 ukuleles, that investment is something that, one, we will in all likelihood be able to absorb as a result of the fluidity of the budget and funds that are realized in the early part of the fiscal year.

419
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:42,326
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, because it is an attempt to provide a specific type of remedial support to students because the priority is

420
00:51:42,955 --> 00:51:59,529
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of coming to the head of the front of the list because of the disruption that students have had, particularly by way of musical instruction over the course of the last two years, it's very likely, I think, that that would ultimately be absorbed by the ESSER budget.

421
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:10,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And so both because the size of it is such that there could be many other things that it wouldn't make sense to include the ukuleles, but not things that cost the same amount as the ukuleles,

422
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:21,405
[SPEAKER_00]: and because the ukuleles are likely to have a strong nexus with the initiatives that we're undertaking in order to build back from COVID, that would be the only reason that it would not be included.

423
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:26,270
[SPEAKER_00]: There certainly should not be an inference that those smaller investments will not be made.

424
00:52:27,074 --> 00:52:35,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I see there is a line item restoration of supplies and transportation lines to provide for resumption of normal event participation post pandemic.

425
00:52:35,138 --> 00:52:42,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So I assume that one perhaps is about transportation for the band.

426
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:44,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one is in.

427
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:49,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess one of the things is when I talk about and you mentioned ukuleles, but there's also

428
00:52:50,445 --> 00:53:09,293
[SPEAKER_03]: part of my real concern was the violin and the orchestra program, that while they're small numbers, and I certainly understand you can say, yes, they'll be covered in the course, that there were some of these that are, you know, really germane to the enjoyment of students.

429
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:14,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that enjoyment and going to school is, you know, a very important piece of it.

430
00:53:14,335 --> 00:53:18,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I mentioned them, kind of like the chocolate chips and the pancake.

431
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:22,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right.

432
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:40,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's an important illustration that I think in presenting the $68 million worth of stuff, it's something that isn't specifically called out, but it's something that I think the committee is very right to be concerned about.

433
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:46,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we have heard that priority and have begun the necessary discussions to make sure that we're able to address that.

434
00:53:49,554 --> 00:53:58,381
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a world where we can't say with enough specificity exactly what we want to do with it, that's the only reason it's not specifically called on.

435
00:53:58,481 --> 00:54:13,532
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we can certainly make sure that it is highlighted when we present the additional information related to either the ESSER budget or the vote to adopt, depending on where the appropriation lands.

436
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:16,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one last, just building on a previous issue,

437
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:35,917
[SPEAKER_03]: It does under, for example, in the mathematics department, it does set aside 35K in, it says, for a week-long, four-hour-a-day math academy, which we had spoken about, certainly, in the curriculum subcommittee.

438
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:41,661
[SPEAKER_03]: It says COVID mitigation priority, so I'm assuming, again, that means ESSER funds?

439
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:42,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

440
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:43,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

441
00:54:43,982 --> 00:54:44,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that.

442
00:54:46,404 --> 00:54:47,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned

443
00:54:47,668 --> 00:55:16,087
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned to the committee in the memo that the 68.2 represented the number that we landed at through a certain number of rounds of scrubbing the budget subsequent to May 19th, but prior to May 28th, when you received, or May 27th, I guess, when you received the budget book and the explanatory documentation.

444
00:55:18,038 --> 00:55:37,629
[SPEAKER_00]: From that, in between, in that window of time, there was, we identified one or two items that were essentially double counted, which is why I said in my communication to you that if you were to request 68.1, that could also be an accurate reflection of the needs that we've identified.

445
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:45,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I identified the 68.1, I can tell you that we further identified about,

446
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just get this number exactly right here.

447
00:55:53,819 --> 00:56:13,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was 110,000 of something that theoretically could be included in the operating budget, but likely would ultimately land in ESSER, which is why ultimately our recommendation is still 68.2, because that amount of movement is just inevitable given the numbers that we're talking about.

448
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:19,762
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spelled out for you line by line how the 68.2, I'll say, would be spent.

449
00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:31,266
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is inevitable that even if the exact number that we are recommending that you request were to be appropriated, there would be some movement within that.

450
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:34,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's just an example of that.

451
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:36,467
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.

452
00:56:36,787 --> 00:56:41,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for all the work you've done on the budget, as well as Michelle and the rest of the team.

453
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:42,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

454
00:56:44,172 --> 00:56:50,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot, Member McLaughlin, and then Member Rossell, and we have a resident that would like to speak.

455
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:52,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

456
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:57,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy and everyone else for putting all this work together, much appreciated.

457
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:11,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Regarding the special education outside costs, circuit breaker and external funding that offsets the money that we were talking about, when does that get sort of backed out so that we can see what those numbers actually are?

458
00:57:12,165 --> 00:57:15,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And where does the money go that was allocated towards special education?

459
00:57:18,129 --> 00:57:19,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good question.

460
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:26,035
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in some cases it goes towards special education because the costs can increase throughout the course of the fiscal year.

461
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:37,283
[SPEAKER_00]: As I know the committee is familiar that the district assumes responsibility for students enrolling up until April 1st of the fiscal year.

462
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:47,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we say it's a roller coaster because the external funds come in that can help offset some of those costs, but the costs can go up and sometimes can exceed the extent to which

463
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:49,548
[SPEAKER_00]: their stroke funds have come in.

464
00:57:49,588 --> 00:57:55,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't really necessarily rely on those funds for anything, at least for a large portion of the fiscal year.

465
00:57:56,351 --> 00:58:04,033
[SPEAKER_00]: In times when that money is freed up, there has to be a look at what the rest of the needs are across the district.

466
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:16,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't necessarily say, it's kind of like, if you want to check back on April 2nd, 2022, I'll have a better sense at that point of knowing sort of exactly where we are with regard to that.

467
00:58:17,284 --> 00:58:37,312
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to the numbers, those can fluctuate a little bit, but by the conclusion of the summer, we should have estimated projections, which I know, I think as we've discussed in previous years, it's been somewhere between a million and $1.5 million have come in.

468
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:46,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while we've seen an enrollment decline and some of that external funding has declined over the course of

469
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:51,622
[SPEAKER_00]: the last several fiscal years, it's generally stayed within that range of a million to 1.5.

470
00:58:52,944 --> 00:58:59,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would anticipate that before the beginning of the school year to have a better sense as to what we should expect.

471
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:01,550
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

472
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there a reconciliation process?

473
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:16,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there a process at which point we see what there actually was an IDEA funding and what there actually was in Circuit Breaker and sort of how that was applied and what the reconciliation of those numbers are?

474
00:59:16,797 --> 00:59:29,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, whether there's a standing process in Medford, I actually, frankly, I can't necessarily speak to, but certainly I think it would be prudent to establish a quarterly

475
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:30,605
[SPEAKER_00]: process.

476
00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:53,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think over the course of this year, I think I presented several times on this information, but I think I would, I would think it would be a very good practice to sort of build into our school committee calendar, essentially a quarterly update with regard to funds coming in in projections for the remainder of the fiscal year.

477
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:58,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably worked out that way over the course of the last year, but I think it would probably be a good idea

478
00:59:59,377 --> 01:00:05,461
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to establish that as a timeline over the course of the coming fiscal year.

479
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:08,003
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that would fulfill that.

480
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:13,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think a reconciliation process would be great to be able to understand where that money actually goes.

481
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:24,233
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm assuming one-to-one aids for individuals with IEPs are under the paraprofessional allocation for special education.

482
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that right?

483
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:26,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

484
01:00:27,155 --> 01:00:28,075
[SPEAKER_00]: In the proposed budget,

485
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:36,189
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a significant amount of investment in paraprofessional staffing, and that is reflective of two things.

486
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:53,033
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it relates to the increased, or the new substantially separate program that is envisioned for the Roberts School, and there are paraprofessional staffing needs associated with that.

487
01:00:53,473 --> 01:00:56,074
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an investment, and frankly,

488
01:00:56,847 --> 01:01:02,569
[SPEAKER_00]: The magnitude of the investment will be determined ultimately by the size of the appropriation.

489
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:24,659
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, as we discussed at the elementary and middle school presentations, the need for building-based paraprofessionals to not be connected with specific special education programming, but to be available at various grade levels for students who are in inclusive settings, but require additional classroom-based support.

490
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:33,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two of the examples of paraprofessional staffing investment that's represented in this budget.

491
01:01:33,408 --> 01:01:53,617
[SPEAKER_00]: The one-to-one paraprofessional support, and frankly, I can't say off the top of my head exactly how many would be represented, but generally speaking, it would be considered part of the fixed cost increases because those are situations in which students have an IEP that requires a one-to-one paraprofessional, and so we know

492
01:01:54,147 --> 01:02:03,382
[SPEAKER_00]: that regardless of any strategic decisions that are made in terms of investments, we know that that's going to be a compliance-based obligation that the district is going to incur.

493
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:09,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we talked about the $2 million increase in special education costs, that would be enveloped in that.

494
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:24,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and, you know, our concern is obviously that we're not taking when you're saying building based professionals that, you know, I know that historically what's been happening and I don't know if it's because of the allocation of substitutes or the difficulty in getting

495
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:40,103
[SPEAKER_07]: substitutes that, you know, at least anecdotally, we're hearing that paraprofessionals are being used for substitute positions within the schools, and then, you know, being taken out of specialized programming, which obviously is problematic.

496
01:02:40,764 --> 01:02:42,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I wanna, two questions about that.

497
01:02:42,905 --> 01:02:49,431
[SPEAKER_07]: One is instructional tutor paraprofessionals versus the other paraprofessional.

498
01:02:49,451 --> 01:02:52,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's a pay rate difference, but I'm wondering what the,

499
01:02:52,754 --> 01:02:54,335
[SPEAKER_07]: qualification differences on that?

500
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:55,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe that's a question for Ms.

501
01:02:55,716 --> 01:02:56,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Bowen.

502
01:02:57,117 --> 01:02:58,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd certainly invite Ms.

503
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:02,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen to comment on that, but I just want to reiterate the point about Ms.

504
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,562
[SPEAKER_00]: McLaughlin that we've characterized it as problematic.

505
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:15,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Paraprofessionals who are supporting students in a classroom as part of their IP are there as part of an obligation that the district owes those students and those families.

506
01:03:16,229 --> 01:03:19,551
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not to be allowed, they are not to be used as substitute teachers.

507
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:22,013
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not, that is not sanctioned

508
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,203
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not allowed.

509
01:03:23,223 --> 01:03:29,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe the practice is widespread when there was indications that it had happened.

510
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I cannot speak to the frequency with which it happened.

511
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:37,967
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that it happened very sparingly, but when there was an indication earlier in this school year, Ms.

512
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:49,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen communicated in no uncertain terms to all school communities that that practice was to cease and it was not to happen, period, regardless of how frequent it was happening before.

513
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to be clear.

514
01:03:51,247 --> 01:04:02,600
[SPEAKER_00]: These investments that we're talking about right now are not about pulling paraprofessionals out of places in which they need to be as a result of obligations we owe to students and those students' needs.

515
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:12,090
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about making sure that students for whom they have a right to a less restrictive environment have the opportunity to do that and to be in that inclusive setting.

516
01:04:12,854 --> 01:04:14,756
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this investment is about.

517
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:15,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

518
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:15,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

519
01:04:16,498 --> 01:04:17,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

520
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:27,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, you know, I appreciate that, Mr. Murphy, and I just want to also clarify, and I know that you, you know, intended this and mean well by this, but for folks that are watching, all students are entitled to the least restrictive environment.

521
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:28,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you know that.

522
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:31,656
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure they're actually getting it though.

523
01:04:31,696 --> 01:04:32,256
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.

524
01:04:32,316 --> 01:04:32,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

525
01:04:33,277 --> 01:04:33,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

526
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:39,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for the, I know that we had had trouble historically with, you know, acquiring, I believe substitutes.

527
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:44,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see that the budget has gone down about $11,000 in the substitute budget.

528
01:04:44,825 --> 01:04:48,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering why are we going down in that line item?

529
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:52,951
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's been, you know, difficult historically to get substitutes.

530
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:58,995
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to be totally honest with you, I'd have to go back and check on that, but I suspect

531
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:19,195
[SPEAKER_00]: that the number 11,000 may be reflective of how we increase that budget when additional funding came in because of the staffing challenges we were facing related to COVID and the number of staff members who were out or working remotely.

532
01:05:19,735 --> 01:05:20,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's a higher number.

533
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Mr. Murphy, you're right.

534
01:05:23,056 --> 01:05:24,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a higher number for FY22.

535
01:05:24,536 --> 01:05:26,077
[SPEAKER_07]: That is exactly what it is.

536
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:26,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

537
01:05:26,737 --> 01:05:27,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at it wrong.

538
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:29,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

539
01:05:30,147 --> 01:05:33,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and I think that's it for my question.

540
01:05:33,688 --> 01:05:34,109
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you say?

541
01:05:34,129 --> 01:05:36,430
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a guest, but I appreciate that.

542
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you did very well.

543
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,031
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good guess with all these pages.

544
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:40,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

545
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:43,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I will, um, yield to my colleagues for now.

546
01:05:43,252 --> 01:05:43,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

547
01:05:55,487 --> 01:05:58,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I know member Vanderfoot spoke about a fine arts director.

548
01:05:58,528 --> 01:06:01,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I do hope that next year we can prioritize that.

549
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:12,292
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at departments and you organize them how they should be versus how they are in the budget, fine arts took a pretty huge hit last year.

550
01:06:12,312 --> 01:06:16,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do need to restore that.

551
01:06:16,793 --> 01:06:21,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as great as all of our fine arts department staff are,

552
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:31,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I got to know the fine arts director at every single program, at every single school.

553
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:46,011
[SPEAKER_01]: He was not just a paper pusher or any kind of derogatory term you could think of for, not that you all are administrators of that kind, but sometimes people take administrators and they just think somebody who sits and writes emails.

554
01:06:46,532 --> 01:06:49,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was not what we had for a finance director.

555
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:51,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want us to return to a time when the finance director

556
01:06:54,537 --> 01:06:56,138
[SPEAKER_01]: can do what that person's supposed to do.

557
01:06:57,378 --> 01:06:58,299
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's for next year.

558
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:06,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we had a cover letter, a memo, which I realized we're not gonna really have time to do this year.

559
01:07:07,803 --> 01:07:08,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different year.

560
01:07:08,503 --> 01:07:11,184
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pandemic still going on.

561
01:07:11,885 --> 01:07:17,647
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that, we had about $9.6 million of identified unmet needs.

562
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:18,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And

563
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:34,712
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as excited as I am for the number, the big number, I just think it's important to recognize that it's not as big as it looks, the increase, because we took such a huge cut last year by going to not adding the, well, we laid a lot of people off.

564
01:07:35,212 --> 01:07:43,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's sort of like the sale for buying a diamond, you know, but the week before the price went way up.

565
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:45,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not getting that good of a deal.

566
01:07:46,201 --> 01:07:48,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of the reverse of that.

567
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:57,713
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my estimate is that biggest number is about a 5.2% increase, not a 9.4% increase.

568
01:07:57,913 --> 01:08:01,536
[SPEAKER_01]: When you consider a three and a half percent increase, have we gotten it last year?

569
01:08:03,457 --> 01:08:09,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And 5.4 or 5.5% is a big increase for Medford.

570
01:08:10,281 --> 01:08:13,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just also suggest we think about 5.4 or 5.5% increase in the context of

571
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:25,625
[SPEAKER_01]: vast sums of money coming from the federal government showered on our city and schools, it doesn't feel very big.

572
01:08:26,005 --> 01:08:39,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And to put it in context, and I know we're not Cambridge with their crazy tax base, but last year in the pandemic, they only gave their school system a 5.5% increase.

573
01:08:39,356 --> 01:08:43,379
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like, they suffered and give them a 5.5% increase.

574
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:47,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to not get too joyful

575
01:08:48,644 --> 01:08:51,305
[SPEAKER_01]: about a potentially 9.4% increase.

576
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:55,285
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not reflection of going from a good place to a better place.

577
01:08:56,045 --> 01:09:00,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place where our buildings and ground budget in 2017 was $56 million.

578
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:01,386
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, it was 58.

579
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:02,527
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we're going up to 57 million.

580
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:03,287
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're going down.

581
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:03,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we cut

582
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:19,495
[SPEAKER_01]: $400,000 from 2018 to 2019 in buildings and crafts.

583
01:09:20,516 --> 01:09:35,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just don't feel like maintenance is still, like, what's the right number for maintaining, like, if I was a company and had to figure out a business plan, what would be the right amount of maintenance for the amount of buildings and structures we have?

584
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:38,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's certainly, I'm sorry, I said 58, 5.8.

585
01:09:41,921 --> 01:09:44,743
[SPEAKER_01]: We went down to 5.4, but this year we're going to 5.7.

586
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:52,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy that this number is as big as it is, definitely happy.

587
01:09:54,109 --> 01:10:11,041
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think it's not a reason to have a party because 30 or 40 years now of figuring out how to cut year after year, it's an improvement, but that's not much more than that in my opinion.

588
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:21,972
[SPEAKER_01]: But the memo that we had last year where we identified 9.6 million of critical needs, or not all of them are critical, six million of them are critical.

589
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:40,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe somewhere in one of our myriad budget meetings, we did ask that this memo be updated, not to be sent to the city council or the mayor's office, but just be updated so that we could say something like, you know, we had on here,

590
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,209
[SPEAKER_01]: cybersecurity training and professional development for $10,000.

591
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,734
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was done, we should check it off and cross it off the list.

592
01:10:51,015 --> 01:10:58,082
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of things on here that did get done through the pandemic because of the money we got.

593
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:05,269
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also, there's no way we spent nearly $10 million in covering these needs.

594
01:11:05,509 --> 01:11:10,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just ask that we already motioned to have this document updated.

595
01:11:10,393 --> 01:11:22,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to reiterate that, but I don't wanna come the fall or worst case next budget season being like, what about that 2020-21 document?

596
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:23,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?

597
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:26,587
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like this is the right time to get this updated so that

598
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:38,254
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fresh, and also when we go into the next budget cycle, we are not just completely confused about where we are from just what would have been two short years before.

599
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:40,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

600
01:11:41,955 --> 01:11:48,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor, if I could just add, we will certainly make those updates and provide an updated list.

601
01:11:48,477 --> 01:11:54,600
[SPEAKER_00]: That memo was done as the committee was adopting the final budget that had been appropriated.

602
01:11:55,931 --> 01:12:07,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sort of corresponding time to do that would be when you adopt the final budget, because then we can actually update it inclusive of things that are going to be done as a result of funding and FY22.

603
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:10,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Murphy, can I just, can I just jump?

604
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:15,707
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the letter that we, this was the government memo that we sent to the city council.

605
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:20,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was for the request, which as you pointed out, was the same thing.

606
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:25,255
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was to them when we adopt the appropriation,

607
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:34,325
[SPEAKER_01]: at least as I understand the process, we're not sending them something else, we're done, right?

608
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:40,129
[SPEAKER_00]: You're done except that like, I think you need continuous communication.

609
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:54,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the updated memo would be more accurate and compelling if it incorporated things that we at this point know we're going to be able to do, or at least at that point would know we're able to do.

610
01:12:55,668 --> 01:13:08,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, but I mean, and I realized this was before your time last year, but the city council got the memo and talked about it and what was in it and what we were saying we weren't, we didn't have the money for.

611
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:20,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that whole conversation where they will be adopting the budget that the mayor sends to them will have already happened before we vote on our appropriation.

612
01:13:20,634 --> 01:13:22,715
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feels like it's a bit of a,

613
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:23,420
[SPEAKER_01]: that.

614
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Um car before the horse problem.

615
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:26,722
[SPEAKER_01]: We can write a lovely memo to them.

616
01:13:27,643 --> 01:13:33,787
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have gone for the summer and well, they are because the city council needs in the summer, but It's just it's too late.

617
01:13:35,488 --> 01:13:38,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than just feel like we wrote a memo and sent it to

618
01:13:52,717 --> 01:13:53,957
[SPEAKER_09]: name and address for the record, please.

619
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:55,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

620
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:56,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So can everybody hear me?

621
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:57,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

622
01:13:58,278 --> 01:13:58,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

623
01:13:58,558 --> 01:13:59,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

624
01:13:59,578 --> 01:14:01,159
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Leticia Rocha.

625
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:03,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 3620 Mystic Valley Parkway.

626
01:14:03,879 --> 01:14:09,700
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I have a question regarding transportation, and I have some follow-ups depending on the answer.

627
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:14,061
[SPEAKER_04]: To make things quite clear, this is really a yes or no question.

628
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:22,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Will all high schoolers who live over two miles from the school be guaranteed reliable yellow bus transportation in this proposed budget?

629
01:14:26,914 --> 01:14:44,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as I said earlier, we're looking at that as a result of the direction the committee has provided us, and it's our intention to make sure that there are no students who don't have the option for free transportation to get to school if they're outside of that radius.

630
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it has not been set in stone.

631
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:58,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just want to reiterate what has been communicated by many members of the community, which is that the MBTA is not a reliable form of transportation for high schoolers.

632
01:14:58,499 --> 01:15:00,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that there are members of the school committee who

633
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:13,760
[SPEAKER_04]: support an expansion to a one mile radius for the yellow buses for high schoolers, which I strongly support, as well as that this mode of transportation is free to students, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged.

634
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:23,048
[SPEAKER_04]: This administration really continues to talk about prioritizing equity and getting students to school safely and reliably on a daily basis should be a top priority.

635
01:15:23,608 --> 01:15:26,470
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are students who prefer the MBTA, then that's fine.

636
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:32,693
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get numbers on that and offer it as an option, but it shouldn't be the primary option because it's simply not reliable.

637
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:39,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And every single high school student that needs yellow bus transportation should be able to access it, not only in a single area of Medford.

638
01:15:40,357 --> 01:15:43,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And with all that said, I have two follow-up questions.

639
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:50,123
[SPEAKER_04]: How will the administration be gathering data about transportation preferences and ensure that all families are heard?

640
01:15:50,643 --> 01:15:55,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And when will we know for certain that yellow buses will be available to all high schoolers who need one?

641
01:15:57,508 --> 01:15:58,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are my questions.

642
01:15:58,448 --> 01:16:02,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, again, I think the second part of it, I think I answered in the first question.

643
01:16:03,652 --> 01:16:07,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to reiterate, this is a longstanding practice in Medford.

644
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:18,182
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, when we discussed this on May 19th, if there's a yellow bus that goes to one area of Medford that's outside of a two mile radius,

645
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:24,458
[SPEAKER_00]: and students who reside in another area of Medford are told that they can purchase an MBTA pass.

646
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:27,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from an equity perspective, that's outrageous.

647
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:32,183
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that the committee directed the administration to address approximately two weeks ago.

648
01:16:32,844 --> 01:16:39,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't really speak to a practice that has been in place, as I understand it, for decades in Medford.

649
01:16:39,287 --> 01:16:40,568
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we want to address.

650
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:44,090
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that on its face appears to be unfair.

651
01:16:44,691 --> 01:16:48,373
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that in order to do in a fiscally responsible way,

652
01:16:48,823 --> 01:16:53,425
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, in a coherent way, it's something we have to collect additional data to determine.

653
01:16:53,545 --> 01:16:58,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I certainly appreciate the sentiment that's being expressed.

654
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,589
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we take very seriously.

655
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we pay with service to equity.

656
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:13,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this would be a really long and complicated budget process if we're just trying to put on a show about equity as opposed to actually try to advance that cause.

657
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:17,397
[SPEAKER_00]: And I frankly, I think every member of the administration and the school committee

658
01:17:18,027 --> 01:17:21,169
[SPEAKER_00]: time spent without putting on a show.

659
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:22,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to continue to look at this.

660
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:28,994
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to collect the appropriate data so we're able to make responsible decisions in the best interest of students.

661
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:37,739
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we have that data and are able to provide a coherent plan, that's something that we look forward to reporting back to the School Committee on.

662
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:42,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

663
01:17:43,002 --> 01:17:44,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

664
01:17:46,305 --> 01:17:46,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

665
01:17:47,066 --> 01:18:01,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank Miss broker for bringing this topic up and I'm wondering, I know that this is complicated and that we have to do some homework on this but this is definitely something that has been an ongoing discussion for years and is definitely something that's a priority.

666
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:03,986
[SPEAKER_07]: and something that I'm very concerned with.

667
01:18:04,026 --> 01:18:17,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering if we could have a June 14th deadline of what we are actually doing, what those numbers are, and we make a final decision to that end, because we do need to know for the upcoming school year.

668
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:20,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has, I do feel like we keep kicking this can down the road.

669
01:18:21,815 --> 01:18:27,237
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanna be clear that the school committee renewed the Eastern bus contract last spring.

670
01:18:27,517 --> 01:18:30,719
[SPEAKER_00]: We are finishing year one of a three-year contract.

671
01:18:31,252 --> 01:18:41,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend that we commit to finalizing a new plan before we close the first fiscal year of the three of the three year contract.

672
01:18:42,099 --> 01:18:56,168
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly think we can provide an update and prevent present whatever information we're able to collect by June 14 but I have a version to committing to something that I don't know whether it's possible or not so.

673
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,281
[SPEAKER_00]: If the committee would like an update by June 14th, we'll certainly provide that.

674
01:19:00,701 --> 01:19:19,696
[SPEAKER_00]: If the committee directs us to come up with a plan with specific numbers attached to it by June 14th, I have a responsibility to tell you that the numbers may not be solid, the data may not be complete, and we could end up in a situation in which a significant amount of money is expended without actually seeing a benefit incurred by students.

675
01:19:20,776 --> 01:19:21,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we'll follow-

676
01:19:24,417 --> 01:19:26,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

677
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:36,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say, Member McLaughlin, in order for us to get that information by the 14th, it's not a realistic timetable.

678
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:43,317
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need the time to be able to get the information, and we've been given a charge by the committee.

679
01:19:43,937 --> 01:19:46,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are working to definitely meet that charge.

680
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:54,907
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to reiterate that today being June 1, that doesn't even give us two weeks to gather accurate information.

681
01:19:55,307 --> 01:20:02,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to be able to have reliable information that we're able to share with you and with the community.

682
01:20:03,194 --> 01:20:06,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So we definitely need more time in order to be able to do that.

683
01:20:07,578 --> 01:20:07,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

684
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:08,699
[SPEAKER_07]: May I, Mayor?

685
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:10,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin.

686
01:20:11,484 --> 01:20:14,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, and I appreciate that, and I can appreciate that the time that it takes.

687
01:20:14,587 --> 01:20:22,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess what I'm asking then is, can you give us a time frame, either Mr. Murphy or the superintendent, so that the community and Ms.

688
01:20:22,313 --> 01:20:26,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Rocha can know when we will have answers to these questions and some data?

689
01:20:26,757 --> 01:20:30,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's not June 14th, is it July 14th?

690
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:35,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Or when can we expect that we could have this information that's a reasonable time frame for you guys?

691
01:20:37,372 --> 01:20:43,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're gonna, this is something that we're going to work on in the remainder of this school year in terms of collecting data.

692
01:20:43,657 --> 01:20:57,667
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to meet with the bus vendor and as I said, I had already, we've already met once and planned to meet with the vendor, along with involvement by the Metro Police Department to determine the routes, the routes are necessary.

693
01:20:58,171 --> 01:21:02,433
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine the capacity that we have that theoretically could be repurposed.

694
01:21:02,933 --> 01:21:07,555
[SPEAKER_00]: That could then help us to determine our financial capacity if we have to add additional buses.

695
01:21:08,836 --> 01:21:16,840
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's certainly our intention that prior to the beginning of the school year, we're able to provide expanded transportation options.

696
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:25,924
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on data we're able to collect, determine whether or not we have to further expand the options to be consistent with the mandate from the school committee.

697
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:36,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there are parameters in which we're operating, including the contract that was renewed last spring.

698
01:21:36,945 --> 01:21:45,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am confident that one way or another, we are going to be able to expand transportation options next year.

699
01:21:45,953 --> 01:21:58,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we can fulfill the mandate that there are no students beyond a two mile radius who do not have free access to transportation, I don't know.

700
01:21:58,871 --> 01:22:01,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, I'm hopeful that we'll be able to do that.

701
01:22:01,532 --> 01:22:12,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly, as I've said a few times, the idea that we're running one bus to one section of the community is odious.

702
01:22:12,676 --> 01:22:17,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, on its face, I think we have to look at it more closely, but something about that doesn't add up.

703
01:22:17,417 --> 01:22:19,078
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question about that.

704
01:22:20,578 --> 01:22:25,440
[SPEAKER_00]: But without having some of these other variables identified,

705
01:22:26,826 --> 01:22:36,329
[SPEAKER_00]: the only option would essentially be to write a sizable check, procure additional transportation infrastructure, and then hope that it gets used.

706
01:22:37,029 --> 01:22:55,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I think that this is, it appears that we've got a real problem in terms of having a great discrepancy between how transportation is provided, depending on where students live, it will be another problem if we expend unnecessary resources

707
01:22:56,604 --> 01:23:12,548
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be used more sensibly to provide the types of supports that we know students need, particularly students who are at risk and have other factors that need, therefore need additional support.

708
01:23:12,608 --> 01:23:16,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty complicated problem.

709
01:23:18,089 --> 01:23:24,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal, ultimately the goal is to comply with the committee's mandate.

710
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,881
[SPEAKER_00]: both because it's our obligation as your employees and because it just, it seems like the right thing to do.

711
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:39,383
[SPEAKER_00]: My primary goal at the moment is to make sure the situation is improved before the beginning of the school year.

712
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:44,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will come back and report to the school committee on what, if anything, needs to be done in order to make that happen.

713
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:47,705
[SPEAKER_07]: When?

714
01:23:50,145 --> 01:23:54,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the school year is going to begin the last week of August.

715
01:23:54,853 --> 01:24:02,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want a better situation to be in place before that time, whether we will get to 100% compliance with the mandate in the committee.

716
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,020
[SPEAKER_00]: To be frank with you, I don't know.

717
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:13,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that I'm not that I don't know is my answer to your question.

718
01:24:14,408 --> 01:24:16,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau, did you have a point of something?

719
01:24:17,406 --> 01:24:18,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, point of something, that's not right.

720
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:25,733
[SPEAKER_01]: We did just pass a motion, I believe, and the date we specified was August 1st.

721
01:24:27,754 --> 01:24:32,959
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the minutes yet, so I can't confirm, but I believe we said August 1st.

722
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, member Ruseau.

723
01:24:36,501 --> 01:24:40,985
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not our plan to put the plan together on August 29th, I promise you that.

724
01:24:41,445 --> 01:24:44,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you'll certainly have an update from us before August 1st.

725
01:24:48,544 --> 01:24:49,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

726
01:24:49,547 --> 01:24:55,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Member Van de Kloop?

727
01:24:56,757 --> 01:25:05,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the school committee received a letter this week from some of our CCSR students asking about our user fees.

728
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:11,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has been something that over the years we've sought to reduce user fees.

729
01:25:11,643 --> 01:25:14,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's a fairly substantial number.

730
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:19,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And perhaps, Mr. Murphy, do you know how much user fees bring in or approximately?

731
01:25:19,567 --> 01:25:20,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between.

732
01:25:21,067 --> 01:25:25,409
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some fluctuation because of the number of students for whom it's waived.

733
01:25:26,061 --> 01:25:29,807
[SPEAKER_00]: on a yearly basis, but it's in the vicinity of 75 to $95,000 generally speaking.

734
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:37,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, this is certainly another concern.

735
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:49,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we have taken great pains to make sure that students who could not afford user fees were in fact waived, yet the students are bringing it before us.

736
01:25:50,524 --> 01:25:54,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So I realized that at this point now we've set our budget number.

737
01:25:55,805 --> 01:25:59,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also clearing that there's going to be some level of,

738
01:26:01,087 --> 01:26:03,409
[SPEAKER_03]: change yet in the budget as they normally are.

739
01:26:03,429 --> 01:26:08,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is something that we should take up again at a school committee meeting.

740
01:26:08,992 --> 01:26:15,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly know that for years and years and years, the ideal thought would be that we would waive all user fees.

741
01:26:16,317 --> 01:26:19,999
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's always been a budget impact, just the way the transportation is and everything else.

742
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:27,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can look at it in the future, and again, the students spoke up, I would certainly like to

743
01:26:28,803 --> 01:26:37,465
[SPEAKER_03]: hear more from their concerns, because I guess in many ways, I was thinking that we were meeting the needs of students.

744
01:26:37,565 --> 01:26:39,085
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're not, we need to know that.

745
01:26:40,925 --> 01:26:41,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

746
01:26:42,626 --> 01:26:43,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone?

747
01:26:45,886 --> 01:26:46,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mayor.

748
01:26:46,687 --> 01:26:50,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make a motion that we accept the budget and put it forward to the city council.

749
01:26:52,388 --> 01:26:52,708
[SPEAKER_03]: For $68,221,865, Mia?

750
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:52,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

751
01:26:58,939 --> 01:26:59,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

752
01:26:59,139 --> 01:27:01,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion on the floor, seconded by... Second.

753
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pull it.

754
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz and member Van der Kloot, roll call, please.

755
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:08,061
