24
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:36,154

[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the opportunity that if an item is not on the agenda to speak.

[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not seeing anyone in person who would like to speak.

48
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:58,260
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have it away from us unless or we can revert back to regular order of business.

49

[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business second by Councilor Caraviello Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_17]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council thank bill Mazaka for his 47.5 years of service to the city of Medford's public schools.

58
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:43,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council extend its congratulations and best wishes to Mr. Mazaka on his retirement Councilor Knight.

59
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, thank you very much.

60
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:51,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of us that have gone through Medford High over the past, I guess, what looks like 50 years will be very familiar with Bill Mazzacca.

61
00:03:51,866 --> 00:04:02,293
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a security officer there for the last 47 and a half years where we went to school every day during rain, snow, sleet, and hail to protect the children in the city of Medford.

62
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:06,456
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's always been a great individual, a great public servant, and someone that I've always respected.

63
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:07,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very

64
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:15,743
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting when I brought my son up to kids corner for daycare, and I sat there and my son said, Oh, I was talking to Mr. Bill.

65
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:21,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And I look over and there's Bill Mosaic, who was Mr. Bill, when I was a student at Medford High School.

66
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,850
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's just a gentleman who's dedicated his whole life to this community.

67
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone who's done great good for the students in the city of Medford.

68
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:30,774
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's someone that deserves a little bit of recognition for the hard work that he put in.

69
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:35,077
[SPEAKER_08]: He's someone that was always behind the scenes a man of not many words, but great action.

70
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:36,558
[SPEAKER_08]: He's someone that the city of Medford

71
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:40,068
[SPEAKER_08]: should be very thankful that they had the opportunity to have for 47 and a half years.

72
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:49,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Madam President, I'm asking my colleagues to join me in extending some congratulatory notes to Mr. Mazeka in the momentous occasion of his retirement.

73
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:51,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, and I apologize for the mispronunciation.

74
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:53,326
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't privileged to have him.

75
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:54,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

76
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:55,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

77
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.

78
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:00,616
[SPEAKER_04]: True words couldn't be spoken.

79
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:02,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Mosaic is a true gentleman.

80
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,644
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're talking about the last of

81
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:18,621
[SPEAKER_04]: The old guard that I remember in high school where there was a team of maybe six security guards that roam the vast hallways of Medford High School keeping the peace.

82
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,142
[SPEAKER_04]: As time went on,

83
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:27,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Mosaica became the total opposite of what you think a security guard was.

84
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:35,811
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a person that kids could speak to, a person that when you needed a strong arm, he was there.

85
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:40,555
[SPEAKER_04]: When you needed an ear to talk to, he gave it to you.

86
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:47,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think every kid that walks the halls at Medford High School, love and respect Mr. Mosaica.

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,302
[SPEAKER_04]: He is truly a gentleman.

88
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:55,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, I don't think I've ever heard a negative word said about Mr. Mosaic.

89
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:06,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a contentious job, you know, at times you have to be the heavy in the school, where it's a suspension or removal of a student or, you know,

90
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:12,630
[SPEAKER_04]: or a faculty member, Mr. Mosaic was the person that had to be that heavy.

91
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was always there with respect and kindness.

92
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:23,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad that he's retiring and I wish him well and his family well.

93
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Madam President, for giving me the moment.

94
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:27,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

95
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:35,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had the privilege of getting to know Mr. Nzeka back in my four years at the high school.

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:47,029
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a loved member of our school community, and to be able to congratulate him on such a momentous occasion is truly a privilege.

97
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:55,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of us have specific memories of, you know, just seeing him welcoming us into the high school every day, seeing him walk around the building.

98
00:06:56,198 --> 00:07:00,921
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was someone who really built trust with all of our students at the high school.

99
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:08,065
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very grateful for his service to our city, and I wish him the best in his retirement.

100
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:11,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tsai.

101
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:15,729
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

102
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

103
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:23,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

104
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:25,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's a Caribbean.

105
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:25,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

106
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:25,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

107
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:34,798
[SPEAKER_05]: President Morell.

108
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:35,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

109
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:58,605
[SPEAKER_17]: So I mean the firm is here in the negative the motion passes to two dash 306 offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins be it so resolved that the Metro City Council by the Medford City Council that we support the proposed fair share amendment that would create an additional tax of four percentage points on annual income above $1 million and dedicate the funds raised by this tax to quality public education

110
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:04,386
[SPEAKER_17]: affordable public colleges and universities, and for the repair and maintenance of roads, bridges, and public transportation.

111
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:06,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

112
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

113
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The fair share amendment has been a major topic of conversation in Massachusetts for nearly a decade.

114
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:26,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I think too often it is used as an excuse for the state not to fund schools, fund colleges, and fund roads now because we'll do it when the fair share amendment happens.

115
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:28,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily enough, we are here.

116
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:32,630
[SPEAKER_02]: The fair share amendment is on the ballot for the November 2022 election.

117
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: This would raise funds for the state that would go towards public education, public colleges and universities and our transit and roads.

118
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:54,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all of us know how deeply needed these funds are for municipalities like Medford and the campaign to support this amendment when it's on the ballot in November is currently

119
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: soliciting the support of city councils across the Commonwealth.

120
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:03,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to add our voice to that chorus of city councils, and I would move approval on this resolution.

121
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:09,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell.

122
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:12,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to echo Vice President Bears's sentiments.

123
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:17,330
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so excited for the fair share amendment to finally be on the ballot.

124
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:34,397
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and I think looking at this through the lens of how this would affect the city like Medford, you know, is the perspective that I, you know, that I hope my fellow Councilors and, you know, really every resident and voter in Medford beyond to take into account, you know, public education,

125
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:43,363
[SPEAKER_14]: public higher education, roads, infrastructure, hopefully climate change resiliency, you know, these are areas where we need

126
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:46,527
[SPEAKER_14]: new revenue sources.

127
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:57,691
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't do the things that we need to be the kind of community that we want to be, to live in the kind of community that we want to live in, without revenues for these incredibly important projects.

128
00:09:58,352 --> 00:09:59,732
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, the source is right.

129
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:11,037
[SPEAKER_14]: When there's so much need spread throughout our communities, you know, we need to shift from a model of wealth hoarding to a model of making sure that we bring up the baseline for the parts of our communities that are

130
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:13,318
[SPEAKER_14]: in most need of investment.

131
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:21,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank Vice President Bears for his advocacy of this, and I'll be excited to vote in support and then vote in support in November as well.

132
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:22,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

133
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

134
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from Councilors?

135
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:30,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on to the public, I'm going to return to you, Laura.

136
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:34,767
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have, you already have the name and address or address for the record.

137
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,467
[SPEAKER_17]: You just state your name again.

138
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,128
[SPEAKER_17]: We already have your address and then go right ahead.

139
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Laura Panette.

140
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak tonight.

141
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,432
[SPEAKER_12]: As was just stated, there are several reasons, there are a number of reasons to be in favor of the fair share amendment.

142
00:10:51,173 --> 00:11:02,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here speaking both as the parent of a graduate of Medford Public Schools, and also as a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

143
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:11,686
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm looking at the benefits both for our K-12 schools in Massachusetts and also for public higher education.

144
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:30,420
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to point to the extreme need for additional staffing in K-12 schools, not only regular classroom teachers, but also ESPs, the valuable support personnel in the schools.

145
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:32,930
[SPEAKER_12]: to support every child.

146
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:44,039
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a long time since our public schools had librarians or music teachers who were in the building for more than a few minutes a week.

147
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:52,466
[SPEAKER_12]: College Councilors are a wide variety of support staff who are badly needed by the children of the Commonwealth.

148
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,370
[SPEAKER_12]: As a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Lowell,

149
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:05,335
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm privileged to work with many students who are first generation in their families to be in higher education.

150
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:13,316
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't come from settings where their parents know all about how to get into college or how to succeed once they get there.

151
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:17,857
[SPEAKER_12]: They also need and deserve extra support services.

152
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:25,559
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is again, part of what the fair share amendment could contribute

153
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,584
[SPEAKER_12]: in terms of supporting the aspirations of the next generation of our residents.

154
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:39,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd also like to point to the physical plant, both in K-12 schools and in higher education.

155
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Many school buildings are old.

156
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:51,859
[SPEAKER_12]: We've seen, especially during the pandemic, the critical problems with inadequate ventilation, not enough fresh air coming in,

157
00:12:52,429 --> 00:13:03,193
[SPEAKER_12]: not enough ability to filter air and prevent transmission of the COVID virus or other transmissible diseases.

158
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:15,257
[SPEAKER_12]: There are buildings that have mold and even mushrooms growing in them because of the extreme lack of adequate ventilation.

159
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:22,960
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a wide range of needs that have been put off for a long time in being dealt with.

160
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for your attention.

161
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:28,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Laura.

162
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the public?

163
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:34,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

164
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:38,742
[SPEAKER_15]: forestry.

165
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:44,226
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the I'm not familiar with the Fair Share Amendment Act, but so I have a couple questions.

166
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:50,350
[SPEAKER_15]: How is the money being managed and diverted to the cities and towns?

167
00:13:51,030 --> 00:14:01,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Once this once this money is collected, if this gets approved at a state level, and people are taxed 4% that money then goes into a state must mean some state account.

168
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:05,299
[SPEAKER_15]: So how, how is it diverted to the cities and towns?

169
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, thank you.

170
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this would only apply to income over $1 million so any income you make under $1 million would not be subject to the time I understand that that wasn't my question.

171
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:21,574
[SPEAKER_02]: We said people would be taxed 4% of only be people's income over $1 million.

172
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:35,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's obviously subject to the appropriation by the state legislature, but generally, you know, one of the biggest expenditures in the state legislature is Chapter 70, which is the multi-billion dollar fund that diverts state aid to local schools.

173
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:41,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 90 is a similar program which diverts state funding to roads, bridges, municipalities.

174
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:48,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So increases in those amounts for Chapter 70 or Chapter 90 would come through the existing formula to the city of Medford.

175
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:54,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally, they could, you know, earmark for specific projects.

176
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:58,029
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the West Medford commuter rail upgrade station upgrades.

177
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:59,310
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be one thing.

178
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it obviously would be subject to the appropriation by the legislature.

179
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:10,732
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way the ballot question is written, the money has to be spent on public education, public higher education and transit and roads.

180
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:14,172
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't know, though, how much money would actually be coming to the city of Medford.

181
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:18,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that not at this point, but more.

182
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:23,193
[SPEAKER_15]: more than the 1.9 billion money that was as we get in any.

183
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,775
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's including the SSR money that already that we're getting.

184
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:32,016
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not in relation to the SSR or anything like that.

185
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:42,159
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know it's not related but we are getting funds from those, those other places right, I believe, the city's allocation from ARPA was about $50 million in one time funds spread out over five years.

186
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

187
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:53,875
[SPEAKER_17]: on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins.

188
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:58,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, before we call the roll, Councilor Knight has recused himself from the debate and the vote.

189
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:13,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

190
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

191
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:15,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

192
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:19,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins?

193
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:19,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

194
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:22,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight has recused himself.

195
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,153
[SPEAKER_16]: As a state employee.

196
00:16:28,874 --> 00:16:29,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

197
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:29,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

198
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:32,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng?

199
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:33,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

200
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:36,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

201
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:42,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Four in the affirmative, two in the negative, one recused, the motion passes.

202
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:45,317
[SPEAKER_17]: 22-307 offered by Vice President Bears.

203
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:54,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council expresses its support of Senate Bill 1819, an act establishing a commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent.

204
00:16:54,982 --> 00:17:04,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of the resolution to the Medford legislative delegation, as well as House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilker.

205
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:05,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

206
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:07,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

207
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:11,845
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a resolution requesting that we support

208
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,952
[SPEAKER_02]: statewide commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent.

209
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:27,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Community leaders in Medford's Haitian community have reached out regarding this item, and the intent of this commission would be to look at a number of issues facing Haitian communities across the Commonwealth.

210
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:35,581
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one of the largest Haitian American communities in the whole country here in Massachusetts, and as many people know, there are a number of issues

211
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:52,952
[SPEAKER_02]: We've discussed previously this term that affect the Haitian community when it comes to immigration, federal, state policy, and this commission would be a voice for members of the Haitian community across the state to issue reports and request action by our state government.

212
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would move approval.

213
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

214
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:02,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

215
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:07,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is in line with the values of our city as a welcoming, inclusive place.

216
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:13,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is, um, you know, this resolution is something that reflects who we are as a city.

217
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:19,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the support that we all, um, we all want to show for our Haitian neighbors.

218
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:22,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is in line with what we've passed as a city council before.

219
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:27,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, um, Councilor, uh, bears for putting this on the agenda tonight.

220
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And I second his motion.

221
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

222
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:33,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

223
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Any discussion from the public?

224
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:37,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Naik.

225
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:41,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly understand that the city of Medford has a very strong Haitian population.

226
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:46,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing up in this community, I've gone to school and come friends with a number of people that are from Haitian descent.

227
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:57,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And I certainly have no problem with a commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent that's being created by the state legislature.

228
00:18:57,746 --> 00:18:59,007
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've said it before, I'll say it again.

229
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not putting my name on a letter.

230
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:11,342
[SPEAKER_08]: going to speak of Mariano or Senate Spelker, unless it's us asking for money for the city, because pretty soon they're going to become tone deaf to the wants and desires of our community.

231
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:15,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so for that reason, I'll be voting against this this evening.

232
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:24,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I certainly support the piece of legislation as a private citizen, but as a member of this body, I don't feel as though it's good practice for us to continue to put our noses into what's going on with the state.

233
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:30,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I haven't never gotten a letter from a state delegation telling us to vote a certain way in a resolution that's before this council.

234
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:40,684
[SPEAKER_08]: If we want our delegation to come down and present to us and talk to us about some of these pieces of legislation, I think that might be a little bit more productive because, well, Council of Business is pretty well-versed in a lot of this stuff.

235
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:42,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think all of us are.

236
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:52,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of us would be a little bit more comfortable if maybe we had members of our delegation come down and talk to us, tell us what this bill does and why they're in favor of it or why they're opposed to it.

237
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:59,369
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the council can make a determination as to whether or not we want to encourage our delegation, the people that represent us on Beacon Hill, to support that.

238
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:02,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I thank the council for bringing the measure forward.

239
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also thank him for being so up to date and involved in the goings on at Beacon Hill.

240
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:09,332
[SPEAKER_08]: However, my focus here is in the city of Medford.

241
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:15,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that this council really needs to take a look at what's going on in this community.

242
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're going to Beacon Hill, well, one thing we need more than anything is money.

243
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:19,775
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I think we should be asking for.

244
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:21,396
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thank the council for the resolution.

245
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:26,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council President.

246
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Biazzi.

247
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:44,869
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I know that you do your due diligence, but again, I've represented myself in the same fashion Councilor Knight has spoken, so it would not be legal to point, but I will not support this paper for those facts as well, so thank you.

248
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Powell.

249
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:49,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the Council or the public?

250
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,540
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Vice President Bears is seconded by Councilor Tseng.

251
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

252
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:00,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

253
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:01,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

254
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:02,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

255
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

256
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:06,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

257
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:07,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

258
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Councilor Scarpelli.

259
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So noted, Councilor Tseng.

260
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:43,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

261
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,214
[SPEAKER_05]: President Morell.

262
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:48,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

263
00:21:49,863 --> 00:21:51,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Or in the affirmative three in the negative the motion passes.

264
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:56,105
[SPEAKER_17]: 22-308 offered by Vice President Bears.

265
00:21:56,285 --> 00:22:08,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration inform residents about the Mystic to Bikeway survey currently underway to explore pedestrian and multimodal path improvements in Medford and Arlington to connect the Mystic River to the Minuteman Bikeway.

266
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:16,450
[SPEAKER_17]: You can fill out the survey and make your voice heard at tinyurl.com slash mystic to bikeway survey and the number two.

267
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

268
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:23,175
[SPEAKER_02]: While it may not be within the walls of Medford, it certainly will affect our city.

269
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:38,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And this item is about a project that's currently undergoing review, mostly in Arlington, but it will connect a piece of Medford, the bridge between the two rotaries on High Street Route 60.

270
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:46,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a couple of different routes currently being explored, but it would connect essentially that area of the Mystic River to the Minuteman

271
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:48,505
[SPEAKER_02]: bikeway in Arlington.

272
00:22:50,506 --> 00:23:13,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a essentially if you go to the survey tiny url.com slash mystic to bikeway survey to you can look at a set of plans that are currently proposed it would, I think, personally as someone who has driven through these rotaries and then walked near these rotaries relatively frequently significantly improve traffic safety in that area for all modes of transportation.

273
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of why I put it on I think that's a great benefit for the city of Medford in and of itself, but it will also connect the mystic pathways to the Arlington Minuteman bikeway.

274
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:32,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I would love the city administration to let residents know that this project is happening I didn't hear about it from Medford I heard about it from.

275
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:39,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a different group I'd actually can't remember quite right now, but also that residents can fill out the survey.

276
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,574
[SPEAKER_02]: where they can review the plans and let their voice be heard.

277
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:53,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the URL is tinyurl.com slash mystic to bikeway survey number two, the number and then the number two and I would move approval.

278
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell.

279
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:03,184
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you, Vice President Bears, for letting everybody know that this is going on.

280
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:08,047
[SPEAKER_14]: For anybody who's interested in learning more about it, I took the survey myself today.

281
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:10,288
[SPEAKER_14]: It took under 10 minutes.

282
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:11,129
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a box to check.

283
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:12,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you a constituent from Arlington?

284
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you a constituent from Medford?

285
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:18,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a great thing for our community members to weigh in on.

286
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:19,534
[SPEAKER_14]: It will affect this community.

287
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:23,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And even going beyond that, this is the type of project that I hope that our

288
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:27,206
[SPEAKER_14]: city administration can really look to and be inspired by.

289
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:40,731
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think we talk a lot about how much more we could be doing with our riverfront, how much more we want to be doing about traffic calming, pedestrian safety, expanding pedestrian and bike access along our beautiful scenic waterfront.

290
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:47,093
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm excited to see how this is spearheaded by the community of Arlington, how it affects our community positively.

291
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:54,954
[SPEAKER_14]: and I really hope that we can see projects like this unfolding along the, you know, the riverfront that we control here in Medford as well.

292
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:55,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

293
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

294
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Tseng?

295
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:08,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that as a community, if we want to see something change, we need to show up at the table, and I think this is one of the ways we can show up and have our voice be heard.

296
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:16,598
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, knocking on doors through the last campaign season, something I heard from a lot of families was,

297
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:33,556
[SPEAKER_01]: was the desire for us to have a grand scheme of bike, a network of bikes, bike lanes that kind of connected better to other cities and that was better integrated in our, that was better integrated in our own community.

298
00:25:33,937 --> 00:25:44,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is, taking surveys like this is one of the most important ways through which our community, our constituents, our residents can

299
00:25:44,522 --> 00:26:00,193
[SPEAKER_01]: make our voices heard and to make sure that, you know, that grant money so that some of that grant money does come to Medford and that we have that kind of more, that better, better planned out, better thought out bike network that we want to see here in Medford.

300
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:04,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Councilor Bears, we're putting this on the agenda.

301
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:07,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

302
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,759
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the Council?

303
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:09,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

304
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, yes, I'll be supporting this measure this evening.

305
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,283
[SPEAKER_08]: If we remember back to the mistake

306
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:23,610
[SPEAKER_08]: River Watershed Association and the presentation that they made to us several years ago when they were coming to us for some community development block grant funding or CPA funding I believe it was.

307
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:32,872
[SPEAKER_08]: and they were seeking funds to design a shared use path along the Mystic River down to Shannon Beach and then beyond Shannon Beach down to Wedgman Station.

308
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:38,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this is a key link to us bringing that project to fruition.

309
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:45,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna allow us to connect the multimodal transportation roadways to the two train stations as well.

310
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's gonna be something very beneficial to the communities to split the people out of them.

311
00:26:50,403 --> 00:26:50,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

312
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:52,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council?

313
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on to the public.

314
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,511
[SPEAKER_17]: I see Mimi Gordon on Zoom.

315
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Mimi, name and address for the record, please.

316
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:09,475
[SPEAKER_17]: I see a box asking you to unmute when you're ready.

317
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Mimi, if you're able to unmute, I'll give you another moment.

318
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:34,712
[SPEAKER_17]: While we wait for Mimi, is there anyone else who would like to speak on this paper?

319
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:53,673
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I could, from the chair, as we wait for Mimi, I mean, this is something that's come before the council in different versions, not exactly the survey, but issues that happen in this area, particularly as you're walking around the beautiful paths along the Mississippi River towards the lakes, you're dumped out into a rotary.

320
00:27:53,693 --> 00:27:55,634
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no crosswalk, there's no safe way to cross.

321
00:27:56,094 --> 00:28:02,839
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you bike, walk, drive by there any beautiful day, you're seeing people try to scramble across the bridge right there.

322
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:06,301
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully this is something that would address that as far as many other issues.

323
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:14,432
[SPEAKER_17]: residents to take the survey if they can, and I thank Vice President Bears for bringing this to the attention of the council and to residents in this forum.

324
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Mimi, are you able to unmute?

325
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:20,998
[SPEAKER_17]: I do see, okay, so while we wait for Mimi, I see Martha Andres.

326
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Martha, name and address for the record, please.

327
00:28:24,622 --> 00:28:28,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Martha Andres, 45 Kilgore Avenue, Medford, Mass.

328
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:32,694
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited about this project.

329
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:43,145
[SPEAKER_00]: It was initiated by Arlington, but it does include, I would say a third of the people who showed up for public participation were from Medford.

330
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:50,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very excited about having the rotaries at the High Street Bridge dealt with.

331
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:57,306
[SPEAKER_00]: to make them safer for driving, safer for pedestrians, safer for bicyclists.

332
00:28:57,326 --> 00:29:07,191
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is an area that, especially since the pandemic, everybody wants to be outdoors and walking in a beautiful area along the river.

333
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:11,974
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is so important to us to make this project happen.

334
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:18,657
[SPEAKER_00]: As Councilor Knight has pointed out, you know, there's been some interest in improving the path on the other side of the river.

335
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:25,575
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Medford side and you know hopefully that will follow from this improvement.

336
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:27,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for bringing it up.

337
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:35,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you Martha and we'll maybe we'll try you once more to see if we can get you to unmute and share.

338
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:40,565
[SPEAKER_17]: I did see you briefly unmuted before but

339
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:53,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Mimi, we're going to move forward.

340
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:58,420
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have comments, you can send them to the clerk or any of the individual Councilors.

341
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:06,246
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

342
00:30:13,231 --> 00:30:13,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears?

343
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:14,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

344
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Kariviello is absent.

345
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:18,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins?

346
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:19,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

347
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:21,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Naik?

348
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:21,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

349
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:22,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

350
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

351
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:25,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng?

352
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:26,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

353
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:28,292
[SPEAKER_05]: President Morell.

354
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:28,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

355
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:31,993
[SPEAKER_17]: 16 affirmative one absent in motion passes.

356
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:57,662
[SPEAKER_17]: 22-309 offered by Vice President Bears be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Department of Public Works and Director of Traffic and Transportation report to the Council regarding the potential to work in partnership with the City of Somerville to establish a shared use path on the northeast side of Auburn Street across from the current Whole Foods to provide a safer crossing of Auburn Street for members of the public in connection to existing paths and

357
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,963
[SPEAKER_17]: of Parkland along Mystic Valley Parkway.

358
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

359
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:02,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

360
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:14,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Resolution is relatively self-explanatory, but essentially the land on the riverbank across from Whole Foods, part of it is owned by the city of Menford, part of it is owned by the city of Somerville.

361
00:31:15,328 --> 00:31:24,652
[SPEAKER_02]: There's currently not a path or sidewalk on that side of the street, which means that people have to cross at the relatively dangerous intersection of Auburn and Route 16 across the Auburn Street Bridge.

362
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:30,720
[SPEAKER_02]: residents in the area said that they would really benefit from a connection on this side of the road.

363
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:38,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to see if our city administration can reach out to partners in the city of Somerville.

364
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:43,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I've reached out to a couple of councillors in the city of Somerville who said that they would be interested.

365
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:51,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hopeful that we can build that partnership and make things a little safer and more accessible at that area.

366
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

367
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:58,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that stretch of roadway is DCR controlled.

368
00:31:59,455 --> 00:32:02,276
[SPEAKER_08]: The crossing right from Route 16.

369
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:03,597
[SPEAKER_08]: The crossing is yes.

370
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Councilor Caraviello is going to run for that.

371
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:10,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that he's been working with them on the guide rails as well with DCR.

372
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:15,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the DCR would have to be involved in doing anything that doesn't cross their road or block their road.

373
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:34,736
[SPEAKER_02]: the crossing would actually be on the Medford-controlled section of Auburn, well, potentially on the Medford-controlled section of Auburn Street, and the land, that bank is owned by the city, it's not by DCR, so we may need to collaborate with them to connect it, but it's mostly out of their jurisdiction, which in this case, I think is a good thing.

374
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:38,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

375
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the Council?

376
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Any discussion from the public?

377
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:47,006
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by

378
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:51,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

379
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

380
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

381
00:32:56,981 --> 00:32:57,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello-Lazzaro.

382
00:32:57,821 --> 00:32:57,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

383
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

384
00:32:59,461 --> 00:32:59,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

385
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:00,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

386
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:01,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

387
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:02,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

388
00:33:02,722 --> 00:33:02,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

389
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:03,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

390
00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:04,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

391
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:06,543
[SPEAKER_05]: President Morell.

392
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:07,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

393
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:11,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

394
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:15,246
[SPEAKER_17]: 22310 offered by Vice President Bears, whereas the city of Medford

395
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:29,648
[SPEAKER_17]: And Councilor Collins, whereas the city of Medford and greater Boston region are in the midst of a deep housing crisis that is displacing residents and families and whereas the city of Medford saw 15% year over year increase in average rents from March 2021 to March 2022 and a 5% increase in average rents

396
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,201
[SPEAKER_17]: from February, 2022 to March, 2022, according to GBH news.

397
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:45,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas many Medford residents are facing significant rent increases or other methods of displacement from rental units.

398
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:59,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, therefore be it resolved by the Medford city council at the housing subcommittee meet to discuss the potential of drafting home rule petitions on the following policies to protect Medford residents facing housing instability and a lack of affordable housing options.

399
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:13,315
[SPEAKER_17]: including rent stabilization, tenant right to purchase, tenant right to counsel, just cause eviction protections, regulation of upfront lease fees, anti-price gouging protections, and exemptions for small owner-occupant landlords.

400
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:28,144
[SPEAKER_17]: be it further resolved that the Housing Subcommittee discuss a potential council resolution supporting House Bill 1378 and Senate Bill 886, an act enabling local options for tenant protections currently under consideration by the Massachusetts legislature.

401
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:30,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears or Councilor Collins?

402
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:34,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to go first.

403
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And if my fellow councilors would like to sever the votes on the resolve and the further resolve, I'm more than happy to do it.

404
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:56,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been talking about this issue for a while, since I've been on the council, since before I was on the council, of housing, the housing crisis and the issues facing a lot of longtime residents of our community.

405
00:34:58,245 --> 00:35:05,568
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some really good work in subcommittee last term, addressing emergency issues around the COVID pandemic.

406
00:35:06,848 --> 00:35:10,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we did a lot of good work on that as a council.

407
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:22,283
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of the pandemic or into the latest phase or however we want to countenance it, the housing situation is deteriorating rapidly.

408
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:32,571
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had residents in here for the past couple of weeks who are facing displacement from units that they've lived in for decades.

409
00:35:34,192 --> 00:35:38,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And the intent seems to be on that, that these long-term residents are being forced out.

410
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:46,263
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just so that we can do a quick renovation and then raise the rents by a certain amount and then bring in a new type of person.

411
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:56,650
[SPEAKER_02]: The intent here is that the housing subcommittee look at a variety of options as we discussed last week you know the city's authority here is significantly limited by state law.

412
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:05,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a number of items on all of these items discussed we would have to file a home real petition and request action from the state for the city to do anything.

413
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:17,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I listed these these different policy items I personally support all of them I understand that if the council may support some of them and not others so I think we want to have that discussion and maybe look at them separately.

414
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:23,530
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the key things about all of these items, as well as the, the state legislation that again

415
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:30,099
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this resolution just asked that the housing subcommittee discuss a potential resolution regarding that state legislation.

416
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:39,814
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these would have as currently constituted would have exempt exemptions, you know for small owner occupant landlords this is really talking about people buying

417
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:49,222
[SPEAKER_02]: these 2030 unit buildings are building large luxury apartments or we're seeing now resale of large apartment complexes and the resulting rate rent increases.

418
00:36:50,103 --> 00:37:05,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So really the focus is on is on those properties and what we can do as a city to try to limit the deep impact you know 15% rent increase in a year is really unsustainable and I think we're going to keep seeing that with just the high demand.

419
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,099
[SPEAKER_02]: and the regional issues around housing.

420
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:27,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really important that as a city, we do our best to advocate for as much power as we can possibly have to make sure that residents have housing stability and aren't facing the trauma and deep emotional, financial and personal impacts that displacement and other forms of types of

421
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,688
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eviction have on them.

422
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:39,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the intent of this resolution here, is that we have the housing committee discuss what we can ask the state to return power to our community to do.

423
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:45,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would move approval on that, obviously, pending discussion of the council.

424
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:48,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

425
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:52,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins, then Councilor Knight.

426
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:57,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears, for going through the resolution so thoroughly.

427
00:37:57,754 --> 00:38:05,402
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate you bringing up the context of the mass displacement that we're already starting to see in Medford over the past week.

428
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:19,917
[SPEAKER_14]: We had residents from the building on Bradley Road, some of whom are in attendance tonight, who were telling us about what they're currently going through with that exact type of situation, with where we are currently in the housing market, the housing crisis coming out of the pandemic as we seem to be doing.

429
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:27,499
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, mass mass displacement of tenants from our community from the community that they want to live in.

430
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:38,423
[SPEAKER_14]: And what really shapes me about this whole situation is the fact that, you know, our hands are so tied as Council as a city for what we're able to do to protect the people who live in our community who want to stay here.

431
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:53,668
[SPEAKER_14]: protect our constituents, the people that we represent, and that's because of these many, you know, potentially more impactful tenant protection, really just constituent protection measures that we're not allowed to do because of

432
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,612
[SPEAKER_14]: because of decisions affected on the state level.

433
00:38:56,993 --> 00:39:01,598
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the reason that these tenant protections are being considered as home rule petitions.

434
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:07,804
[SPEAKER_14]: For anybody who's unfamiliar, measures such as rent stabilization are illegal in Massachusetts.

435
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:17,034
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this has been said by others before me, but I think it's a very frustrating position to be in, to be hearing from constituents saying,

436
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:18,628
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to stay in this community.

437
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:26,915
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to continue being a part of this community and to be so very constrained in what we can do to effectuate helping people stay in this community.

438
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:44,410
[SPEAKER_14]: With just the situation that we're currently seeing on Bradley Road, I think it's been incredible coming together of housing advocates, people who've been through this type of situation before, residents coming together to see how they can help one another, mutual aid volunteers, just trying to alleviate a really painful, traumatizing, expensive

439
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:52,828
[SPEAKER_14]: situation for a lot of people, but there's a limit to how much you can volunteer and advocate your way out of a situation.

440
00:39:53,368 --> 00:40:00,972
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why we need to be advocating for changes to what we as a city are allowed to do to help people stay in our community.

441
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:06,975
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I'm excited to take up these potential home rule petitions in the housing subcommittee.

442
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:10,617
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to briefly touch on, I know it's a,

443
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:16,028
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a four letter word, but it's a four letter and numeral word.

444
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:27,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that, you know, some of my fellow Councilors would, you know, totally understand my fellow Councilor's perspective on advocating for things at the state level.

445
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:33,772
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, I feel strongly about this one in particular because it directly relates to our authority as a council.

446
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:40,714
[SPEAKER_14]: It's saying, please give us authority back to make decisions about what's right for our community here at the community level.

447
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:44,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, well, and I'll leave it there.

448
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:44,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

449
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:47,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

450
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:47,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam president.

451
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:48,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

452
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:54,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, when looking at the language of this, first of all, it looks very much like a rent control bill to me.

453
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:57,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, rent stabilization, anti price gouging protection.

454
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like rent control to me.

455
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:02,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's a homerun petition and we're going to the legislature.

456
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:08,415
[SPEAKER_08]: We're asking them to let mention create its own laws and make its own specific set of laws for just people live in this community.

457
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,801
[SPEAKER_08]: This is gonna go to the state legislature and it's gonna go right in the circular file.

458
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:14,501
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, it's good for show.

459
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:16,121
[SPEAKER_08]: In practice, it's never gonna happen.

460
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:24,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about a regional housing crisis, but each community that we live in is gonna have different rules of application as to how it applies.

461
00:41:25,723 --> 00:41:28,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's also important that we look at the policies that we adopt.

462
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:38,106
[SPEAKER_07]: If we take some blame for the rising cost of housing in our community, when we advocate for the Green Line,

463
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:41,313
[SPEAKER_07]: We know the Green Line brings increased property values.

464
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:52,916
[SPEAKER_07]: When we advocate for the revitalization of Medford Square, and we ask people to present proposals on how we can improve and better our downtowns, we're part of the issue.

465
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:54,036
[SPEAKER_07]: We're the government, right?

466
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're asking people, how can we revitalize downtown?

467
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley Road's right downtown.

468
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:00,438
[SPEAKER_07]: We're saying, let's bring the Green Line.

469
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we know the Green Line's gonna bring high property values.

470
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:05,900
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been waiting 20 years for the Green Line to come.

471
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:09,779
[SPEAKER_07]: We still don't have a parking plan for Ball Square, as we're going to notice if we look at this.

472
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:10,560
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew it was coming.

473
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,781
[SPEAKER_07]: We've known it's been coming for two decades.

474
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:15,303
[SPEAKER_07]: We've known it's been coming for two decades.

475
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:20,407
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't address the problems that have followed in our purview and the problems that followed in our scope.

476
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:34,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it really reasonable for us to think that we're going to be able to create laws that are different than those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that just affect just our community right here that relate to something as large scale as a regional housing crisis?

477
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:35,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

478
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I'm going to vote against it.

479
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:42,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't find it reasonable for us to go create rent control locally in one community.

480
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is something that does need to be addressed at the state level.

481
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:57,045
[SPEAKER_08]: If I were a little bit more familiar with these two bills, if I had like a state rep and some staff on my team, and I'd have them research the bills and provide the bill summaries and the like.

482
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,587
[SPEAKER_08]: But as of right now, I just think that this is nothing more than a, hey, we tried.

483
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:02,648
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't pass up at the state house.

484
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:06,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Blame the rep, it's not my fault, right?

485
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:06,927
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it looks like to me.

486
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,588
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look like it's rooted in reality.

487
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:14,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the gentleman for bringing the issues to the table, and I appreciate the lady for bringing the issues to the table.

488
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:17,514
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've seen bills like this filed in other communities, and they've gone nowhere.

489
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:21,757
[SPEAKER_17]: They've gone nowhere.

490
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:30,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and the reason why they've gone nowhere is because we can't just have one set of rules for Medford, a different set of rules for Somerville, a different set of rules for Allington when it comes to something like housing.

491
00:43:31,606 --> 00:43:38,570
[SPEAKER_08]: When we're trying to go with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and address a regional crisis, we can't have rules that just work in one area and not in another.

492
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

493
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:41,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

494
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:44,092
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to, and it worked well.

495
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:52,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the housing lobby and rich people in the W communities voted away our rights.

496
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the fundamental story here.

497
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:58,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have tools.

498
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were taken away from people who don't live here, by people who don't live here.

499
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:05,597
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the story at the end of the day.

500
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:08,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I agree that it's a long hike?

501
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:08,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

502
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I agree with what you said that our reps are trying and quite frankly failing?

503
00:44:14,064 --> 00:44:15,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I agree with that.

504
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:17,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happening.

505
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:18,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even necessarily speak to our reps.

506
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:26,734
[SPEAKER_02]: At least two of our reps are supportive of all of this legislation, signed onto the bills that are here.

507
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:29,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we talk about

508
00:44:30,593 --> 00:44:36,655
[SPEAKER_02]: why it's important for this city council to add our voice to a chorus.

509
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:43,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because the only way that anything gets done is when it's overwhelming demand from the people of the Commonwealth.

510
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:53,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly that's the bar and the threshold of the state legislature, which is the sovereign authority of our state, which has the power to give and take our control over our community at a whim.

511
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:56,600
[SPEAKER_02]: They've decided it's an incredibly high bar.

512
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,060
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, you know,

513
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:00,015
[SPEAKER_02]: do the Fair Share Amendment.

514
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:05,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take eight years to do the Fair Share Amendment when we're talking about millionaires making more money than they've ever made in their life.

515
00:45:06,558 --> 00:45:07,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take you years.

516
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to throw it in the trash when we're talking about a 15% rent hike in Medford.

517
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:16,182
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't want to do their job, let us do the job.

518
00:45:16,902 --> 00:45:19,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the purpose of this right here.

519
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Many communities, it started out in one community or two communities.

520
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:26,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It started out with the communities that had rent control and then had it stripped away from them in 1994.

521
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:29,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

522
00:45:29,513 --> 00:45:31,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking even about going back to those policies.

523
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:34,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even necessarily what I'm saying.

524
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:44,784
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're looking at now is a much more targeted and defined policy saying if 8% a year isn't enough for you, whatever is going to be enough for you.

525
00:45:44,964 --> 00:45:50,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically the rules of the market as set now are if you're a renter, we can do whatever we want to you.

526
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:56,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're a giant corporate property owner and landowner, we can make as much money as we want over the right to shelter.

527
00:45:57,477 --> 00:45:58,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a fair playing field.

528
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:07,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's our job to stand up and say we deserve power and tools as a community to level the playing field for the people who live here.

529
00:46:07,386 --> 00:46:08,287
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the purpose here.

530
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand it's a long shot.

531
00:46:10,649 --> 00:46:12,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Many things in life are a long shot.

532
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that means we shouldn't try.

533
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:17,234
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I put this on the agenda with Councilor Collins.

534
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:19,247
[SPEAKER_02]: we should at least try.

535
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:38,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll lose, but at least we can say we tried and we believe that these are the tools and powers and opportunities that we need as a community to make sure that when we talk about a Green Line extension or a new high school or revitalizing our squares, that doesn't mean that that's just for rich people.

536
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:44,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think just rich people deserve a nice high school or a nice Medford Square or access to public transit.

537
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:56,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can create a set of policies and rules that allow growth and development and expansion to happen and benefit people in a broad range of incomes and preserve the income and economic diversity that we have as a community.

538
00:46:57,463 --> 00:47:04,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that your point is well taken, that the past 20 years of inaction have left us in a very difficult position.

539
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:17,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to really have to put the pedal to the metal to make sure that the vision of what people see Medford as, as a working class community, as a community where people of all incomes and all backgrounds can come together and live and work and play.

540
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:18,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to be hard.

541
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:24,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard to do that now, because there's been inaction and the state won't let us do anything.

542
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:27,695
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of what I come up here on a variety of issues.

543
00:47:27,715 --> 00:47:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about ball square.

544
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:37,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just did a decent job with the zoning recodification to address some of those principles and make it so that we have more options for affordability for people.

545
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,943
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's all tools in the toolbox.

546
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:40,984
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all hands on deck.

547
00:47:41,944 --> 00:47:45,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is another way that we can try to help.

548
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:56,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford residents, hey, and maybe we'll do it so well, all the communities around us will adopt it too, and then we'll have a regional model, and then we'll have solved the regional housing crisis, because that's the goal here.

549
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:02,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the bill at the end would give the power to do all of these to all communities in the state.

550
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,231
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this isn't even just an issue in Boston and regional, it's an issue in Nantucket.

551
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:09,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an issue in North Hampton.

552
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:10,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an issue everywhere.

553
00:48:11,072 --> 00:48:14,253
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people from across the state, councils from across the state,

554
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:27,315
[SPEAKER_02]: are putting forward resolutions like this and filing home rule petitions and trying to say, hey, state legislature, we understand that there are certain interests that have a very loud voice and have your ear.

555
00:48:28,796 --> 00:48:32,918
[SPEAKER_02]: We think, hey, maybe the people should be the biggest interest on Beacon Hill.

556
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:34,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what this is about.

557
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand the position of my fellow Councilors.

558
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,441
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I just said is my position.

559
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope everyone will.

560
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:46,119
[SPEAKER_02]: vote for this.

561
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:46,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

562
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:47,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very soon.

563
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Affairs.

564
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion from the council for members of the public?

565
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:57,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Lisa Maloney of 26 Bradley Road.

566
00:48:57,745 --> 00:49:01,707
[SPEAKER_16]: And with all due respect, none of us are looking for rent control.

567
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:02,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you know what I mean?

568
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:04,588
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not no one's looking for that.

569
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:08,670
[SPEAKER_16]: In our case, we're just hoping for more time.

570
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,672
[SPEAKER_16]: 30 days is absolutely not realistic.

571
00:49:12,228 --> 00:49:13,829
[SPEAKER_16]: to find something else, right?

572
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:18,793
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know this has been extended to 60 days, which is still very difficult.

573
00:49:19,354 --> 00:49:29,482
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really applaud you for your willingness to kind of consider this and take this up because I think we wanna show more compassion, right?

574
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:35,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Just for tenants who have lived some over 25 years in that building.

575
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:38,108
[SPEAKER_16]: So how do we wanna be as a society?

576
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:40,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope a little bit more compassionate

577
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,882
[SPEAKER_16]: So no one's looking again for rent control or a handout or anything like that, right?

578
00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:49,323
[SPEAKER_16]: We understand Bradley Road is right in Medford Center, right?

579
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:52,644
[SPEAKER_16]: And the building is in a great location.

580
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:54,885
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why it was attractive to the developers.

581
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:03,088
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, to kick residents to the curb in 30 days is really, it's unconscionable.

582
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:04,428
[SPEAKER_16]: I can tell you that.

583
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:05,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

584
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Ferris.

585
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

586
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is my third time, so I'll stop here.

587
00:50:10,611 --> 00:50:17,453
[SPEAKER_02]: But to that exact point, you know, some of these things, you know, one of the big issues was is the fees, right?

588
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:21,453
[SPEAKER_02]: The upfront fees, first, last broker's fee, right?

589
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:26,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really high burden and a high bar to pull all that together when you have 30 days or 60 days notice.

590
00:50:26,395 --> 00:50:27,435
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the items in here.

591
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cause eviction protections to provide more time for folks.

592
00:50:31,336 --> 00:50:36,457
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not saying we're going to get everything in here, but even one of these things would help.

593
00:50:37,476 --> 00:50:38,617
[SPEAKER_02]: even one of these things would help.

594
00:50:38,857 --> 00:50:43,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why there's a list of policy ideas here that we can use.

595
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll stop there.

596
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

597
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:47,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Barros.

598
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

599
00:50:51,864 --> 00:50:53,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, my name's John Petrello.

600
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:55,546
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 61 Locust Street, Method Mass.

601
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Very noble cause, what we're trying to do here.

602
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:03,690
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're rehashing something that's already been done.

603
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:06,652
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's basically what you're trying to do is rent control.

604
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:08,648
[SPEAKER_18]: It never worked before.

605
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:10,029
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not going to work now.

606
00:51:10,189 --> 00:51:10,649
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all.

607
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:12,129
[SPEAKER_18]: It never worked.

608
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:14,390
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had it all over the place.

609
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,570
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a failure.

610
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:22,412
[SPEAKER_18]: The second thing I'd like to say is I take exception to rich people.

611
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:25,753
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't call my rich friends rich.

612
00:51:25,853 --> 00:51:27,373
[SPEAKER_18]: I just call them successful.

613
00:51:27,573 --> 00:51:30,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing wrong in this country with being successful.

614
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:33,088
[SPEAKER_18]: That's okay too, okay?

615
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:39,330
[SPEAKER_18]: So I do take exception to rich people, like there's something wrong with them.

616
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,790
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's a very noble cause.

617
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,531
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate what you're trying to do here, I do.

618
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:49,572
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's been rehashed, it's been done.

619
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:50,612
[SPEAKER_18]: It never worked before.

620
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:55,093
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe we can think outside the box, come up with something, I don't know.

621
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,694
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's something to discuss.

622
00:51:59,614 --> 00:52:01,155
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not gonna work.

623
00:52:01,736 --> 00:52:04,999
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's all I can say, I mean.

624
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:07,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

625
00:52:08,142 --> 00:52:08,522
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

626
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:10,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

627
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:12,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell.

628
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:15,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanna echo something that Vice President Bears said.

629
00:52:15,368 --> 00:52:20,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, not to belabor the point, the discussion tonight is only whether or not to send this to subcommittee to discuss further.

630
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:25,297
[SPEAKER_14]: What if any, hopefully many, in my opinion, I think everybody knows my opinion.

631
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:34,459
[SPEAKER_14]: home rule petitions to send to our state delegation in order to say, you know, we need more tools to protect the people who want to stay in this community.

632
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:52,794
[SPEAKER_14]: To echo Vice President Beard's point that he just made, you know, for situations like the ones that we're seeing very recently in our community, any one of these would make a difference in the experience of a person who all of a sudden they have to move out of their home, you know, their home.

633
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Any one of these could,

634
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:04,204
[SPEAKER_14]: alleviate that experience of something traumatizing and heartbreaking happening that you didn't know was going to happen and you had no role in it.

635
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:25,533
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also want to say, you know, in the aftermath, and I know these home rule petitions are not about the specific situation that's going on on Bradley Road, but I know that when, you know, myself and my other Councilors first heard about it, I think I'll assume that we all felt sympathy, you know, felt distraught, felt, you know, my gosh, I can't believe that some of my constituents are going to have to leave

636
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:28,425
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, not because they wanted to, but because they were forced to.

637
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:29,606
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's important to know.

638
00:53:29,646 --> 00:53:40,474
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard from our city housing staff just last week that we can expect this exact same situation to happen again very soon at another large apartment building that was also recently sold elsewhere in Medford.

639
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:49,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I just, you know, as perspective for why I feel very passionate about this being on the agenda, being able to discuss this further is because, you know, we can feel upset over and over again.

640
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,782
[SPEAKER_14]: We can feel sympathy for our constituents over and over again.

641
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:54,724
[SPEAKER_14]: We can feel heartbroken over and over again.

642
00:53:55,312 --> 00:54:06,500
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, it's not in my theory of change to not try to do everything that we have in our power to do, even if sometimes we're tilting at windmills, what else can we do?

643
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:13,084
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank my fellow councilors for their consideration, and I hope that this is something that we can discuss further.

644
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:13,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

645
00:54:14,225 --> 00:54:15,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

646
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:15,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

647
00:54:16,912 --> 00:54:26,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm my fellow Councilors Councilors Collins and bears have made very strong and very compelling arguments for why we should pass this resolution tonight.

648
00:54:27,694 --> 00:54:31,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe, you know, I believe you're it's really about.

649
00:54:31,395 --> 00:54:39,817
[SPEAKER_01]: We we recognize that we're in a place where we aren't, we can't we just can't do as much as we want to do.

650
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is.

651
00:54:42,297 --> 00:54:50,467
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the only ways right now that we one of the only paths that we can take forward out of this situation, and it's it's a difficult path.

652
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:59,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, and it will require a lot of work, and we have to be prepared to be disappointed, but if we never step forward on this path we.

653
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:11,089
[SPEAKER_01]: We really aren't doing our jobs as city Councilors, we're not really, you know, we won't be advocating for the public we won't be advocating for people who are being who are going to be kicked out of their houses.

654
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:17,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's been a lot of focus on rent control, and I, you know, I'm actually someone who.

655
00:55:18,975 --> 00:55:26,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I studied economics at a very traditional institution that doesn't look very kindly on certain economic policies.

656
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:40,339
[SPEAKER_01]: But even from that perspective, there's a lot of research today that shows that perhaps it's not so much about the policy itself, but rather how you construct it that affects whether this policy is positive or negative.

657
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:44,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that with time, with effort, with cautious planning,

658
00:55:45,680 --> 00:56:00,996
[SPEAKER_01]: our city council, I have faith in our city council to, you know, create to craft policies that are, you know, that are considerate of different arguments that are considerate of economic forces, and that, you know, I think

659
00:56:01,897 --> 00:56:05,339
[SPEAKER_01]: bring that new one to the to the policy discussion.

660
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to reiterate Councilor Bears' point that this resolution, at least from how I read it, is not just about rent stabilization or rent control, whatever you might want to call it.

661
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:26,968
[SPEAKER_01]: This resolution, you know, lays out many, many different policy suggestions that I think many of us in the city can get behind.

662
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:40,861
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of how we can help people who live here and people who are being pushed out of our community from the tenants right to counsel to kind of right to purchase just cause eviction protections.

663
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:52,371
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all mechanisms that will help that could help people living in our community that don't aren't tied to rent control so I think you know

664
00:56:54,207 --> 00:57:04,414
[SPEAKER_01]: there might be a big kind of discussion about rent control, but this also doesn't, I want to note, this resolution doesn't tie us down to one policy.

665
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:09,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It merely starts the conversation that we need to move us forward.

666
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:16,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And this resolution gives us alternative paths too, that we can take as a city that I think there is wide consensus behind.

667
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:18,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

668
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:22,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Just your name again, please.

669
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:25,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, John Petrolla, 61 Locust Street.

670
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Listen, it's a great cause, it really is.

671
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:30,343
[SPEAKER_18]: One more comment I have, though.

672
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:33,105
[SPEAKER_18]: I received phone calls today.

673
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:40,609
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we have a new IT person, but you are aware the website's been down for I don't know how long.

674
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:47,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I got this agenda, I don't wanna be here tonight, by the way, but I got the agenda, I don't know,

675
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:49,829
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you gave me an agenda tonight, right?

676
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:51,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah.

677
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,731
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm only here because I got a few phone calls and a lot of people couldn't make it.

678
00:57:55,592 --> 00:57:59,533
[SPEAKER_18]: But as far as this topic goes, this place would be filled tonight.

679
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:03,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just telling you that, and not rich people, okay?

680
00:58:04,095 --> 00:58:11,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Successful people, you know, that own a two family in Medford and live in a single family in Medford, or maybe they own

681
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:16,978
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, two, two families, I don't know, but a lot of phone calls.

682
00:58:17,018 --> 00:58:25,301
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just, I don't understand how it all works that you're gonna, you know, vote on this tonight.

683
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:30,603
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know it's legal because it was post, someone told me it was posted in city hall.

684
00:58:31,463 --> 00:58:32,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Like we're all supposed to come.

685
00:58:34,484 --> 00:58:35,704
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, I understand that.

686
00:58:35,925 --> 00:58:36,945
[SPEAKER_18]: I am agreeing with you.

687
00:58:38,353 --> 00:58:38,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

688
00:58:40,857 --> 00:58:41,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

689
00:58:41,177 --> 00:58:41,678
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no.

690
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:42,459
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand that.

691
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:44,021
[SPEAKER_18]: But let's be honest.

692
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:47,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Years ago, people, yeah, we came to City Hall.

693
00:58:47,246 --> 00:58:48,387
[SPEAKER_18]: We looked at the agenda.

694
00:58:48,528 --> 00:58:53,114
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a daily paper that had a big circulation.

695
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:54,957
[SPEAKER_18]: It was posted there every week.

696
00:58:55,686 --> 00:58:57,908
[SPEAKER_18]: school committee was posted.

697
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,590
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't get this information when that website's done.

698
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,572
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just being honest.

699
00:59:03,652 --> 00:59:08,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not trying to be a troublemaker or anything else, but you've got to look at these things.

700
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:11,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know who the new IT person is, but

701
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:16,984
[SPEAKER_18]: I imagine we brought him in, we're paying him some decent money.

702
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:18,987
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying he's not doing his job.

703
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:19,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we bring someone in?

704
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:21,511
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have a director of IT.

705
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,633
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have anyone.

706
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:24,936
[SPEAKER_18]: So what are we going to do with the website?

707
00:59:25,217 --> 00:59:25,617
[SPEAKER_18]: It is backup.

708
00:59:25,737 --> 00:59:26,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It's backup.

709
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:30,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it is it came back up.

710
00:59:30,743 --> 00:59:35,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, just just to clarify and reaffirm the vote tonight is just to send this to a subcommittee.

711
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:36,587
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing.

712
00:59:36,847 --> 00:59:38,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so there's nothing vital going on.

713
00:59:39,249 --> 00:59:43,491
[SPEAKER_18]: And I you know, I want to be very clear that we all agree.

714
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:45,933
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it is a serious issue.

715
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:47,154
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot going on.

716
00:59:47,854 --> 00:59:51,820
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think, you know, maybe you can get a large group together.

717
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,385
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, everyone wants to do what's right for the people of Method.

718
00:59:55,665 --> 00:59:57,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody, everybody.

719
00:59:57,207 --> 00:59:59,450
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no one that doesn't want things to happen.

720
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:00,071
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

721
01:00:03,757 --> 01:00:09,483
[SPEAKER_18]: over the years, rent control and the things that we're talking about right now just haven't worked.

722
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:17,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I don't know if that's the way people want to go or that's the decision fine, but I don't know, maybe we think outside of the box.

723
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:19,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe there's other ways, that's all.

724
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:21,836
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm just concerned because I wasn't sure

725
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,341
[SPEAKER_18]: if this was gonna be, you know, voted on and that's that.

726
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:26,481
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's not gonna happen.

727
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:32,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the attendant is essentially to get this to a dedicated space where these conversations can happen.

728
01:00:32,903 --> 01:00:33,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

729
01:00:34,143 --> 01:00:41,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if we voted on sending a home rule petition tonight, which we're not, the state would still have to take action on it.

730
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are about a million steps away from changing policy.

731
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

732
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Daniel Craven, 21 Maple Ave.

733
01:00:53,761 --> 01:01:05,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So you keep saying that it's about big apartment complexes displacing people, but how would the tenant right to purchase affect anyone's ability to not get evicted from the apartment complex?

734
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible they might have an opportunity to purchase the unit.

735
01:01:13,366 --> 01:01:15,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Purchase in an apartment complex.

736
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:17,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Potentially, I mean, we haven't written anything yet, so.

737
01:01:18,148 --> 01:01:19,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Apartments and not condos.

738
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:22,294
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to purchase the whole building, correct?

739
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:23,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Potentially.

740
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:27,098
[SPEAKER_09]: How much does an apartment building go for in the city of Medford?

741
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,821
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people get the right of reservations of those 32 units?

742
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:31,423
[SPEAKER_09]: How long would it take them to sell it?

743
01:01:31,443 --> 01:01:35,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a lot of what about arguments we can make about any issue that comes before this body.

744
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:40,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just looking at some of these things and I think they are not aimed at apartment complexes.

745
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:41,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

746
01:01:41,693 --> 01:01:42,494
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

747
01:01:42,955 --> 01:01:44,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at it and I read

748
01:01:45,393 --> 01:01:49,514
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the right to purchase, and that's totally aimed at multifamily houses.

749
01:01:50,094 --> 01:01:59,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you've lived in your house for 30 years and had the same tenant, and you're lucky enough to have the same tenant, but they can't afford it, should you forego your retirement?

750
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:02,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Because now I can't sell my house at a timely manner.

751
01:02:02,676 --> 01:02:06,337
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the way I feel.

752
01:02:07,437 --> 01:02:07,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

753
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:08,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

754
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:09,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Collins.

755
01:02:09,257 --> 01:02:14,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to note for the record, I think in a lot of tenant right to purchase policies that have been enacted or discussed in other communities,

756
01:02:15,395 --> 01:02:22,296
[SPEAKER_14]: exemptions for small owner-occupied properties so that it would be germane only to larger commercial landlords.

757
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:24,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

758
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:25,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

759
01:02:28,897 --> 01:02:31,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

760
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:32,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey Tbaggi, 75 Marshall Ave.

761
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:41,079
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the non-owner-occupied small landlord who owns maybe two or three units in the city?

762
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:42,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it gonna hurt them?

763
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely gonna hurt them.

764
01:02:45,434 --> 01:02:51,696
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what about taking some real estate taxes are consistently increasing?

765
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Why they can, what are we supposed to do?

766
01:02:54,357 --> 01:03:01,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do we go up consistently with the real estate tax and the water bill and everything like that?

767
01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:04,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what if we lose a house?

768
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody has to move because they can't afford the rent.

769
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:10,722
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the landlord can't afford the mortgage?

770
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:16,185
[SPEAKER_03]: He loses the house, loses his credit, loses quite a bit.

771
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:19,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Rent controls never worked.

772
01:03:19,746 --> 01:03:22,227
[SPEAKER_03]: How about just competition?

773
01:03:23,148 --> 01:03:30,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Competition is really the only way to keep your tenants in there, and it's the only way to keep rents lower.

774
01:03:31,832 --> 01:03:35,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to see an apartment somewhere else.

775
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,155
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to say, hey, I can save $100 a month.

776
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:39,095
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to go there.

777
01:03:40,058 --> 01:03:42,740
[SPEAKER_03]: per place that they've been for five years or whatever.

778
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:49,044
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe the landlord will say, you know something, we'll do that same rent.

779
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:51,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stay here because you're a good tenant.

780
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:59,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Small owner, small owner occupied, small landlords are not out to gouge the people.

781
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:09,018
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, doesn't sound like anything that you're doing is going to hurt the 60 unit of the poverty bonus.

782
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: it's only going to hurt a little guy.

783
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:22,997
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point, the competition and I think it's important to point out, you know, we're having a very heated debate on an issue that's before us this evening, but there have been other housing related initiatives that have been before us.

784
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:26,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of those was the creation of the affordable housing trust fund.

785
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:32,303
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something I think we're all on the same page with right we want to create an affordable housing trust fund where we can

786
01:04:32,928 --> 01:04:37,730
[SPEAKER_08]: create units here in this community that are affordable to create that competition to drive the cost down.

787
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

788
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:39,531
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something we're working on.

789
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:47,694
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have a piece of paper that's been drafted by the administration that we're working on with the administration to bring through the legislative process.

790
01:04:47,974 --> 01:04:52,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that I think we'll see benefits from because when you look at the taxes that you referred to.

791
01:04:53,113 --> 01:05:05,255
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have the Community Preservation Act and part of the CPA is the ability to generate 10% of those funds that we take it from the CPA, which is 1.5% of the total tax roll on and above.

792
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:10,496
[SPEAKER_08]: 10% of that goes into the affordable housing bucket for the creation of affordable housing, the retention of affordable housing.

793
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:17,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So that gives us an opportunity to begin to start creating units and then hopefully creating competition.

794
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:18,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I think

795
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:27,640
[SPEAKER_08]: 6,000 units wish I had something like that according to the, to the governor's MBTA MBTA community.

796
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:32,659
[SPEAKER_08]: document the municipal modernization bill.

797
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, you know, it's going to take a lot of work for us to, to be where we need to be.

798
01:05:38,123 --> 01:05:38,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I agree with you.

799
01:05:38,924 --> 01:05:41,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, you know, competition is really the answer.

800
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:46,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, a lot of the times creation of units is what's necessary, how we create these units and where we create these units is late.

801
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:47,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Therein lies the rub, right?

802
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,492
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want skyscrapers all over Mr. Gaff, right.

803
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:53,174
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to keep the fabric of our community.

804
01:05:53,874 --> 01:05:57,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time also maintain the level of services that we're providing people, which

805
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:58,862
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't great right now.

806
01:05:58,982 --> 01:06:05,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we have skyscrapers, all of them is to have, I can just imagine the level of services that we're going to get with that influx of people, the traffic and so on.

807
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:10,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I certainly understand me a comment and that was my concern as well.

808
01:06:10,629 --> 01:06:12,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like some of the stuff is really good.

809
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The person that owns our two or three family home.

810
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:16,811
[SPEAKER_08]: might have been in the family for three generations.

811
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:22,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And now the children have moved away, but they've inherited the home and they've used it as an income property.

812
01:06:22,533 --> 01:06:25,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something that the family's worked on.

813
01:06:25,974 --> 01:06:30,615
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also the question of the transfer tax that's been discussed and how you fund these affordable housing funds.

814
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:38,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fair share amendment has a transfer tax component to it as well, where you could buy the worst house on the street and live there for 30 years, pull permits every year.

815
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:42,568
[SPEAKER_08]: get all the work done in the street to make it the nicest house on the street, you're paying an assessment every single year.

816
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:46,672
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when you go to sell the house, you have to pay another fee or an assessment to create affordable housing, right?

817
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:47,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are gonna be trade-offs here.

818
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:50,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And the biggest question is always, right?

819
01:06:50,195 --> 01:06:51,836
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the biggest question in everybody's life, right?

820
01:06:52,057 --> 01:06:52,777
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we gonna pay for that?

821
01:06:53,398 --> 01:06:55,179
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we gonna pay for that?

822
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:56,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we are right now.

823
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,161
[SPEAKER_10]: How are we gonna pay for that?

824
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,663
[SPEAKER_08]: But I agree, I think competition is the answer.

825
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:02,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank you for your comments because I think we share a lot of the same concerns.

826
01:07:02,926 --> 01:07:04,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The point about competition

827
01:07:05,759 --> 01:07:12,744
[SPEAKER_02]: if we had a competitive market, then like we have a free market right now except for construction of housing.

828
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:16,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So well supply and demand, we massively constrict supply.

829
01:07:17,588 --> 01:07:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless we want to talk about like the fundamental issue here is that the cost of housing is too high.

830
01:07:23,112 --> 01:07:24,153
[SPEAKER_02]: That means for some people

831
01:07:25,093 --> 01:07:28,155
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a windfall of they've owned this property.

832
01:07:28,195 --> 01:07:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they bought it 50 years ago.

833
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:30,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they inherited whatever.

834
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:31,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's of a benefit to them.

835
01:07:31,997 --> 01:07:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't begrudge that whatsoever.

836
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:39,081
[SPEAKER_02]: But it means that for other people, it's completely inaccessible and they're never going to be able to live here.

837
01:07:40,582 --> 01:07:51,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we want to talk about a fully free market solution to addressing the balance of supply and demand, to address the cost of housing, to make it reasonable for everybody, let's build 6,000 new units in this city.

838
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:58,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you find one person in this I can find one I know one person who comes to these meetings regularly will be completely fine if we build 6000 units in the city.

839
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:00,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's about it.

840
01:08:01,964 --> 01:08:02,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the one answer.

841
01:08:03,405 --> 01:08:10,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The other answer if you want to talk about addressing the cost of housing is limiting the growth of the cost of housing, using the powers of the government.

842
01:08:11,069 --> 01:08:17,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the options before us, I personally believe we should find a fair balance all of this, you know, just because there's an idea of a policy.

843
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It says right here, exemptions for small owner occupant landlords.

844
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:25,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to discuss exemptions for people who maybe own a second home.

845
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:27,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it has to be everyone gets the right to purchase.

846
01:08:27,624 --> 01:08:30,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying it's a potential tool that we should look at.

847
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:33,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the intent here, that all of these are potential tools.

848
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:39,235
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at economic studies about rent stabilization, about all of these tools, there are places that make this work really well.

849
01:08:40,187 --> 01:08:45,690
[SPEAKER_02]: where property owners can make a reasonable return, where renters have a level of stability.

850
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:52,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, the fundamental housing stability tool in the American housing market is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage.

851
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:58,196
[SPEAKER_02]: The 30-year fixed rate mortgage is a creation of the federal government that no reasonable

852
01:08:59,188 --> 01:09:15,196
[SPEAKER_02]: financial institution would ever authorize, except for the backing of the federal government and the idea that it's fundamentally a way to say that a regular person with an average income should have the ability to know that what their housing payment is going to be next month, next year, 15 years, 30 years.

853
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:21,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can say to a homeowner, here you go, 30 years, you know exactly how much your rent's going to be every month, basically.

854
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:31,243
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're a tenant and you can't afford a mortgage or you can't get a mortgage or that's not the option, well, here's a 15% increase, or here's a 30% increase, or it's going to be about supply and demand.

855
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:33,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fundamentally about fairness.

856
01:09:33,604 --> 01:09:39,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying we should have a 1% rent control and everyone gets a right to purchase everything.

857
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:44,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have, you know, if you're not burning the house down, you shouldn't get evicted.

858
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:47,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, price gouging means a single rent increase.

859
01:09:47,409 --> 01:09:48,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying any of that.

860
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying,

861
01:09:50,788 --> 01:09:52,693
[SPEAKER_02]: The tools have been stripped away from us as a community.

862
01:09:53,194 --> 01:09:59,128
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have the option to look at a broad range of policies that address supply and that address things reasonably.

863
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:01,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a big discussion.

864
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:06,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Petrell is right that having these discussions, there's going to be hundreds of people coming down here to want to have them.

865
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:08,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be an open process.

866
01:10:08,942 --> 01:10:12,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally believe the state should leave it up to us to make these decisions.

867
01:10:12,185 --> 01:10:13,226
[SPEAKER_02]: They've decided not to.

868
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:17,489
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been debating this for a while when fundamentally it's here's a bunch of ideas.

869
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go talk about them more.

870
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:21,613
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of the end of the story here.

871
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,221
[SPEAKER_17]: We have someone on Zoom who wants to speak as well.

872
01:10:27,301 --> 01:10:30,622
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to affirm that this is a paper about sending this to a subcommittee.

873
01:10:30,662 --> 01:10:36,644
[SPEAKER_17]: We could debate economic ideology all night long, into the morning, all through the next week.

874
01:10:36,744 --> 01:10:38,165
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that is the intent right here.

875
01:10:38,185 --> 01:10:39,945
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that's effective for anyone right now.

876
01:10:39,965 --> 01:10:41,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a quick question.

877
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:45,227
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned 30 a fixed rate, so that's your monthly rent every year?

878
01:10:49,948 --> 01:10:56,410
[SPEAKER_03]: But meantime, your taxes go up every year, and your water goes up every year, everything increases every year.

879
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So then your rent is going up every year, that's number one.

880
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:01,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, you mentioned it works.

881
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:03,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me where it works.

882
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:06,932
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 1.2 million housing units in New York City where it works very well.

883
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:08,593
[SPEAKER_03]: New York City is probably a mess.

884
01:11:09,753 --> 01:11:11,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to become New York City do we.

885
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:16,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the biggest and most successful and richest city in the history of the world.

886
01:11:17,633 --> 01:11:22,215
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, I don't want to have an argument with you, but New York City doesn't work.

887
01:11:22,716 --> 01:11:23,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

888
01:11:23,976 --> 01:11:26,597
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we do have someone wants to speak on zoom as well.

889
01:11:26,618 --> 01:11:27,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

890
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:37,783
[SPEAKER_04]: This is off topic, but I've just received about eight to 10 text messages and emails that again, the system is breaking down.

891
01:11:37,803 --> 01:11:42,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, people can't watch it's coming in and out.

892
01:11:42,986 --> 01:11:45,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make you aware of that, Madam President, that

893
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:59,539
[SPEAKER_04]: if we can let the administration know that if we could figure this out, because I tried to watch the rest of the meetings last night and a few other meetings, and it was coming in and out.

894
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:08,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say that it's our professional that's working here tonight's fault, but there's obviously some technical issues going on.

895
01:12:09,402 --> 01:12:15,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a mess, and this is what's, you know, we need to correct that.

896
01:12:15,987 --> 01:12:25,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that on this topic, Madam President, I agree with you, but I'm going to stand firm on what I have been voting on for the last few months.

897
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:26,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

898
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Carpalli.

899
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:30,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Sharon D'Eso on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

900
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:36,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I am at Circuit Road in Mass Avenue, Medford.

901
01:12:36,913 --> 01:12:37,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.

902
01:12:38,774 --> 01:12:40,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting topic.

903
01:12:40,875 --> 01:12:49,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that everybody during the last 10 or 15 years has felt the crunch of many different items going on.

904
01:12:51,418 --> 01:13:00,521
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, I'm going to give you some examples, and I'm going to ask you each individually a couple of questions, because I think you're going about this the wrong way.

905
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:02,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I get the point.

906
01:13:03,138 --> 01:13:09,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I my heart goes out wholeheartedly like yours for anyone who loses housing.

907
01:13:10,459 --> 01:13:12,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I have housed international student here.

908
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I have housed a family member to an emergency situation.

909
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:23,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I have experience in real estate part time besides teaching.

910
01:13:24,662 --> 01:13:26,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you one thing.

911
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:28,683
[SPEAKER_10]: If you own a home,

912
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:39,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with the person who spoke and Mr. Petrella that bills do change what you should be doing.

913
01:13:40,365 --> 01:14:02,783
[SPEAKER_11]: if you really want to impress and make a movement in this city with homeowners and then have a rent, kind of a rent in place discussion at some future point, is be the advocate for the homeowners and apartment multi-unit owners and get to National Grid, force these rents rates down, get to Comcast

914
01:14:03,263 --> 01:14:14,151
[SPEAKER_11]: get a 15 to 20% discount automatically for seniors on so that poor people who are 80 years old can even watch a ball game in the summertime.

915
01:14:14,211 --> 01:14:16,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them live on $800 a month.

916
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:24,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you should go into and help people rehab and also go into purchasing

917
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:46,130
[SPEAKER_11]: the little land that might be less or on Mystic Avenue, get permits in place for 100 to 200 maybe limit apartment units, get affordable housing and get that in place first before anybody interferes with the fine residential communities that are in this city.

918
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:51,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just asking you please to raise your hands if you own a home in Medford.

919
01:14:52,173 --> 01:14:55,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, i'm done for the evening and I hope that you take heed with this.

920
01:14:56,016 --> 01:15:03,442
[SPEAKER_11]: We would love to see for a change something done by the council For the people who pay the taxes in this community.

921
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:17,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much Thank you, Sharon, uh, liam on zoom name and address for the record, please Hi, it's actually

922
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:23,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Suzanne Siggins, Suzanne and Arthur Siggins, 12 Garden Street, Medford Mass.

923
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

924
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:32,482
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just raising my hand to represent.

925
01:15:33,182 --> 01:15:34,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you raising your hand to speak?

926
01:15:35,663 --> 01:15:36,623
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just raising my hand.

927
01:15:36,643 --> 01:15:38,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Property.

928
01:15:38,143 --> 01:15:39,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, right.

929
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:40,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

930
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:44,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

931
01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:47,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

932
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:51,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.

933
01:15:52,324 --> 01:15:56,006
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I'm really sorry to hear about Bradley Street displacement.

934
01:15:57,767 --> 01:15:58,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel for those people.

935
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:02,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I think 30 days is not a good thing.

936
01:16:03,011 --> 01:16:11,877
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm here as a small property owner who has been extremely lucky to have very good tenants and I treat them very well.

937
01:16:12,997 --> 01:16:16,380
[SPEAKER_15]: To respond to you, to respond to the,

938
01:16:17,415 --> 01:16:23,038
[SPEAKER_15]: the mortgage payment for individuals, you didn't take into account the maintenance.

939
01:16:23,518 --> 01:16:26,079
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to replace a roof that costs $30,000.

940
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,501
[SPEAKER_15]: So my mortgage payment does not stay the same for the next 30 years.

941
01:16:31,942 --> 01:16:38,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Insurance goes up, taxes go up, water bills go up, everything goes up, and including the maintenance of that home.

942
01:16:38,465 --> 01:16:40,806
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're providing a service to these people.

943
01:16:41,746 --> 01:16:48,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Second of all, I always hear when there's a housing crisis, it always goes immediately to the rent to the owners who rents.

944
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:55,315
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no discussion at all about zoning or other other opportunities to help people actually become homeowners.

945
01:16:55,815 --> 01:17:02,619
[SPEAKER_15]: The only reason I became a homeowner is because I was able to buy a multifamily home and have rent help subsidize my mortgage.

946
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:11,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, we are selling these two-family, multi-family homes to these developers who are turning these two-family homes into $1.2 million condos.

947
01:17:14,678 --> 01:17:17,460
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you doing about the zoning instead?

948
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:21,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead of hurting small property owners, I provide a service.

949
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:25,126
[SPEAKER_15]: My rent is comparable and is cheaper than these units.

950
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:32,872
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you doing to help people buy these units instead of having these developers come in and redo them and selling them for $1.2 million?

951
01:17:33,993 --> 01:17:40,919
[SPEAKER_15]: The house on the corner of Webster Street, that single family house that was sold and subdivided, that house just sold for $1.4 million.

952
01:17:43,717 --> 01:17:54,826
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really, there needs to be zoning laws changed here to help these people become actual homeowners and help people become small property owners to offer rentals that are reasonable to these people.

953
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:57,729
[SPEAKER_15]: We're actually good for the environment.

954
01:17:57,749 --> 01:17:59,810
[SPEAKER_15]: We're good, not for the environment, but good for the city.

955
01:18:00,691 --> 01:18:02,653
[SPEAKER_15]: So it always goes to the rental.

956
01:18:02,753 --> 01:18:07,677
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you want to cap rent, but I don't ever hear anyone capping the sale of a home.

957
01:18:07,697 --> 01:18:11,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, no one ever caps the sale of a home.

958
01:18:14,081 --> 01:18:17,684
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want this government power, why don't you put a cap on the sale of the hall?

959
01:18:17,884 --> 01:18:19,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to add it to the list.

960
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:22,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And condo conversion, I'd be happy to add it to the list.

961
01:18:22,487 --> 01:18:24,569
[SPEAKER_02]: The state doesn't let us do any of those things right now.

962
01:18:24,629 --> 01:18:26,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this discussion is about.

963
01:18:27,931 --> 01:18:29,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

964
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:32,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Laura on Zoom, name and address for the record, please.

965
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:36,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

966
01:18:36,437 --> 01:18:38,479
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still at 40 Tesla Avenue.

967
01:18:38,499 --> 01:18:40,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in Medford Hillside.

968
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:42,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I live on a street that used to be

969
01:18:43,717 --> 01:18:49,419
[SPEAKER_12]: entirely pretty much entirely owner occupied like our houses.

970
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:54,860
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're surrounded by houses that are being rented out to tough students.

971
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:59,241
[SPEAKER_12]: And it has dramatically changed the neighborhood and our quality of life.

972
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:03,423
[SPEAKER_12]: So I need to point out that that's another piece of what's happening.

973
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:08,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I think not only in Medford, but also in the larger Boston area.

974
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:18,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Nonetheless, I do take exception to the generalization implied or stated that somehow if we're homeowners, we're going to be opposed to this motion.

975
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm strongly in favor.

976
01:19:21,331 --> 01:19:28,333
[SPEAKER_12]: I really appreciate all of the points that Councilman Bears has made, and I'm very much in favor of this.

977
01:19:28,893 --> 01:19:29,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

978
01:19:29,273 --> 01:19:31,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Laura.

979
01:19:31,514 --> 01:19:32,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

980
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:40,213
[SPEAKER_17]: But just from the chair, I just want to inform that my support of this is just to keep the conversation going.

981
01:19:40,313 --> 01:19:46,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, nothing in this is binding, even if we voted for it tonight, we do not have the powers to make any of this binding.

982
01:19:46,216 --> 01:19:48,698
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just voting in favor to have this conversation.

983
01:19:48,758 --> 01:19:52,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Continue to hear from residents.

984
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,801
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have every solution.

985
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:56,662
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think this is just throwing some ideas out there.

986
01:19:56,782 --> 01:20:01,625
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, even if this goes through the whole committee and these ideas come back the same, we still don't have the power to enact this.

987
01:20:01,685 --> 01:20:03,226
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to make that clear.

988
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:09,057
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins.

989
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:12,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

990
01:20:15,162 --> 01:20:15,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

991
01:20:16,362 --> 01:20:16,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

992
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:18,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello is absent.

993
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:19,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

994
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:20,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

995
01:20:21,106 --> 01:20:21,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knights.

996
01:20:21,907 --> 01:20:22,127
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

997
01:20:23,468 --> 01:20:24,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

998
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:24,729
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

999
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:26,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

1000
01:20:27,211 --> 01:20:27,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1001
01:20:29,152 --> 01:20:29,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

1002
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:30,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1003
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:34,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Four in the affirmative, two in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

1004
01:20:36,868 --> 01:20:39,070
[SPEAKER_17]: 22-073 offered by President Morell.

1005
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,871
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna read through this.

1006
01:20:44,853 --> 01:20:46,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to force the reading.

1007
01:20:49,276 --> 01:20:52,618
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll take Councilor Knight's motion first.

1008
01:20:52,658 --> 01:20:53,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Second Councilor Knight's motion.

1009
01:20:54,159 --> 01:21:00,923
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to waive the reading in favor of a brief synopsis from the President, seconded by Vice President Bears.

1010
01:21:01,463 --> 01:21:02,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1011
01:21:05,637 --> 01:21:05,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1012
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:07,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1013
01:21:17,283 --> 01:21:19,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, six in front of one absent the motion passes.

1014
01:21:19,925 --> 01:21:21,586
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is an ordinance.

1015
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:41,598
[SPEAKER_17]: The idea behind the ordinance was originally presented to the council in February of 2020 by some CCSR students who had grave concerns about the impact of polystyrene, both as it's listed here on harm to aquatic life, pollution of waterways, human health risks from the leaching of chemicals when hot foods are placed in these items, as well as when these

1016
01:21:42,078 --> 01:21:46,979
[SPEAKER_17]: items end up in waterways and then limited recycling options for these types of containers.

1017
01:21:47,859 --> 01:21:56,261
[SPEAKER_17]: This would apply to prepared food, so it would apply to restaurants, it would apply to schools, it would apply to larger grocery stores that offer prepared foods.

1018
01:21:56,941 --> 01:22:02,963
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a number of, the ban would be, if voted in favor, the ban would

1019
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:07,787
[SPEAKER_17]: be enforced by the health department upon their yearly inspection.

1020
01:22:08,567 --> 01:22:11,848
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it passed, it would be implemented.

1021
01:22:11,868 --> 01:22:14,149
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna find the exact language for this.

1022
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:27,712
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be the ordinance to become effective on July 1st, 2023, or a date that is 180 days from the date that the mayor approves this ordinance or otherwise becomes effective, whichever is later.

1023
01:22:28,412 --> 01:22:33,574
[SPEAKER_17]: There is also the opportunity for businesses to defer

1024
01:22:34,635 --> 01:22:38,613
[SPEAKER_17]: for up to a year period, citing undue hardship.

1025
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:43,152
[SPEAKER_17]: And there is a number of reasons what undue hardship means.

1026
01:22:43,332 --> 01:22:51,917
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be circumstances or situations unique to a particular retail establishment, such as there is no reasonable alternatives to disposable food containers that are not made of polystyrene.

1027
01:22:52,597 --> 01:23:09,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Circumstances or situations unique to the retail establishment such that compliance with requirements of this chapter would deprive a person of a legally protected right or circumstances where a retail establishment requires additional time in order to draw down the existing inventory of disposable food containers made of polystyrene.

1028
01:23:10,846 --> 01:23:14,207
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that covers the main points.

1029
01:23:15,207 --> 01:23:18,088
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's any discussion, or it seems like I may have missed something.

1030
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:18,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bales.

1031
01:23:18,888 --> 01:23:23,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, just to add that they can apply for deferments beyond one year as well.

1032
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:30,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, deferments can be applied for beyond one year, and then also just going to the penalties and fines for violation.

1033
01:23:30,212 --> 01:23:33,093
[SPEAKER_17]: The ordinance shall be enforced by the health department or its designees.

1034
01:23:33,153 --> 01:23:39,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoever violates any provision of this ordinance may be penalized by a non-criminal disposition process as

1035
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:48,838
[SPEAKER_17]: provided in general laws chapter 40 section 21 D. If non criminal disposition is elected than any person who violates any provision of this bylaw shall be subject to the following penalties.

1036
01:23:49,038 --> 01:23:50,359
[SPEAKER_17]: First offense a written warning.

1037
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:55,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Second offense $100 third offense $200 and the fourth and subsequent offense $300.

1038
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:00,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any discussion?

1039
01:24:00,462 --> 01:24:04,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, I will not be supporting this paper this evening.

1040
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:04,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I have

1041
01:24:05,983 --> 01:24:15,913
[SPEAKER_08]: A number of concerns, ultimately, for the last three years, small businesses have been under relatively stringent regulation and oversight I think that we need to let them breathe a little bit.

1042
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:26,707
[SPEAKER_08]: This proposal may have a significant impact on two of the larger employers here in this community, Bianchi Foods and Monogram Foods.

1043
01:24:27,447 --> 01:24:31,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Both of those individual employers we've entered into tax deferred agreements with.

1044
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:37,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Both of those are large scale food processing plants that do, I believe, use this type of material.

1045
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:46,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Monogram foods is also in the process, I believe, of undergoing an evaluation to determine whether or not they're going to be subject to our solar ordinance.

1046
01:24:47,113 --> 01:24:53,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that these regulatory changes that we're making right now are not at the right time.

1047
01:24:54,175 --> 01:25:03,037
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to let our small businesses breathe and we might be making a decision that's going to have a large residual effect on two of our largest employers here in this community.

1048
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:04,838
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those two reasons, I will not be

1049
01:25:05,488 --> 01:25:06,249
[SPEAKER_08]: voting for this paper.

1050
01:25:06,549 --> 01:25:16,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have questions and concerns as to whether why we're focusing ourselves such a narrow scope of just food service establishments, polystyrene juice and a number of other areas as well.

1051
01:25:16,376 --> 01:25:22,881
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, packing materials, styrofoam coolers, we've all, we all know what a styrofoam cooler is.

1052
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:23,682
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen them everywhere.

1053
01:25:24,382 --> 01:25:30,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I think that, well, it's a good, a good how to measure.

1054
01:25:30,287 --> 01:25:32,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that it's appropriate for our community at this time.

1055
01:25:34,093 --> 01:25:35,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1056
01:25:35,414 --> 01:25:35,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1057
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:46,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight brings up some good points, and I won't reiterate them, but I think that there's two very important issues that I received some feedback from.

1058
01:25:46,398 --> 01:25:57,703
[SPEAKER_04]: One being the restaurant owners coming off the pandemic right now, even waiting until 2023 to kick this off, it's still something that they're

1059
01:25:59,814 --> 01:26:11,150
[SPEAKER_04]: little setback and still under the pandemic effects of their financial restraints and that's one.

1060
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, I know that

1061
01:26:15,698 --> 01:26:15,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1062
01:26:15,898 --> 01:26:27,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunt did a wonderful job presenting and doing the best she could, but after the meeting, I got feedback that I note that she mentioned that only a handful of restaurants returned the surveys.

1063
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:41,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I was notified by about four that were watching the meeting that said they would never even were approached or had any knowledge of a survey that would help us make a decision.

1064
01:26:43,525 --> 01:26:52,773
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as what Councilor Knight brings forth, I think it's enough for me to just slow down and try to revisit this.

1065
01:26:53,094 --> 01:26:53,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1066
01:26:54,575 --> 01:26:55,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Powell.

1067
01:26:55,936 --> 01:26:56,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Collins.

1068
01:26:57,497 --> 01:27:11,009
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to quickly make a point for if it's relevant to Councilor Knight's first point that, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think during our discussion and committee of the whole, we established that this would only pertain to establishments serving prepared food.

1069
01:27:12,698 --> 01:27:14,439
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, food for immediate consumption.

1070
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:25,383
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's my impression, I remember we brought this up because we brought up supermarkets in Medford, Wegmans, you know, wanting to make sure that this wouldn't disrupt very large scale supply chains in our neighborhoods.

1071
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:30,285
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's my impression that this would, you know, I understand that the effects on

1072
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:33,791
[SPEAKER_14]: restaurants and smaller businesses are extremely important.

1073
01:27:33,811 --> 01:27:50,805
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why we voted to make an implementation date of July, 2023 with implementation, you know, a year out from that date, but on the point of it affecting these larger retailers, it's my impression that it simply wouldn't apply because they don't, they don't serve prepared food.

1074
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:53,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1075
01:27:53,287 --> 01:27:57,110
[SPEAKER_17]: The prepared food definition, that is the intention as outlined.

1076
01:28:01,404 --> 01:28:09,409
[SPEAKER_17]: the, it was concerned about the prepared food that in the committee of the whole, the discussion was that it would be food that was prepared for immediate consumption.

1077
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:15,592
[SPEAKER_17]: So the thought that the two large employers would not be impacted because they do not prepare food for immediate consumption.

1078
01:28:26,779 --> 01:28:28,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, sorry.

1079
01:28:30,782 --> 01:28:45,029
[SPEAKER_02]: As we discussed in the several meetings, the authority that allows us to implement this regulation stems from the public health dangers of preparing, essentially putting hot food on styrofoam.

1080
01:28:47,951 --> 01:28:53,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's both why it would not impact those two businesses and why the scope is so limited, as you noted.

1081
01:28:57,296 --> 01:28:58,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

1082
01:28:58,576 --> 01:28:59,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

1083
01:29:02,034 --> 01:29:09,398
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion of Vice President Bears to be ordained is the correct language for first reading.

1084
01:29:16,221 --> 01:29:19,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

1085
01:29:21,943 --> 01:29:23,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1086
01:29:27,986 --> 01:29:29,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Approved for first reading.

1087
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:31,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

1088
01:29:31,546 --> 01:29:31,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1089
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:35,389
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a Caribbean those apps.

1090
01:29:35,809 --> 01:29:36,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1091
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:37,430
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1092
01:29:39,712 --> 01:29:41,353
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1093
01:29:41,914 --> 01:29:42,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1094
01:29:43,975 --> 01:29:44,576
[SPEAKER_05]: President Morell.

1095
01:29:44,896 --> 01:29:45,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1096
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:49,720
[SPEAKER_17]: For in the affirmative to the negative one absolutely motion passes.

1097
01:29:56,482 --> 01:29:58,263
[SPEAKER_17]: 22-311 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1098
01:29:58,503 --> 01:30:04,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the overwhelming need for afterschool programming for this coming fall.

1099
01:30:04,905 --> 01:30:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1100
01:30:12,987 --> 01:30:20,829
[SPEAKER_04]: The concerns of lack of afterschool programming in our Medford public schools and asking us for some assistance.

1101
01:30:24,205 --> 01:30:27,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, um, this is my, my, my profession.

1102
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:46,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's some viable solutions that we can discuss working as a partnership with the, uh, public and, uh, the municipal and the school department as a partnership and working together and creating a revolving account that would

1103
01:30:47,034 --> 01:30:56,984
[SPEAKER_04]: put a safe and prosperous program for any of our students that are in need of after-school programming.

1104
01:30:57,064 --> 01:31:06,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of people, and we have some locations that take care of our students.

1105
01:31:08,313 --> 01:31:10,214
[SPEAKER_04]: excuse me, low income through vouchers.

1106
01:31:10,974 --> 01:31:22,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have the residents that can pay high fees to that can pay for an after school program, but they're still not reaching all

1107
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:31,287
[SPEAKER_04]: of those groups, and then there's a group in the middle that's being left out because they do fall in the middle.

1108
01:31:31,387 --> 01:31:42,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a process that I'm hoping that if we can amend this, that we would invite all the parents that have reached out to our

1109
01:31:43,562 --> 01:31:50,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to call for, I know we've asked for a subcommittee meeting, but in the near future to set up a subcommittee meeting for the recreation youth.

1110
01:31:51,067 --> 01:32:09,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we can meet with the recreation department, someone from the mayor's office, a representative from the school department, if we can, and maybe sit down and put a plan together that we can put a program that would house

1111
01:32:10,683 --> 01:32:21,690
[SPEAKER_04]: the needs of our community until, which is the big issue, until we find a recreation facility that other communities have that are fulfilling these needs.

1112
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:26,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you would indulge me, I appreciate that, Madam President.

1113
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:41,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm someone who, who really benefited benefited from after school programming here in the city of Medford.

1114
01:32:41,777 --> 01:32:47,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, my parents they needed, they needed somewhere for me to be while they were working.

1115
01:32:47,843 --> 01:32:52,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, having after school programming was very important to me.

1116
01:32:53,628 --> 01:32:59,270
[SPEAKER_01]: and important to welcoming me into, you know, into the Medford community.

1117
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:09,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of parents have raised this issue with Councilors and with members of the school with the city administration in the last few weeks.

1118
01:33:11,094 --> 01:33:14,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, you know, it's certainly a difficult issue.

1119
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:17,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are steps that we might be able to take

1120
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:25,219
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively soon, but a larger systemic answer to this challenge will take, you know, will take a lot of work.

1121
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:40,285
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is something I think I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing to the table because I do think we should be starting the conversation about how we can increase after school programming both in the short and long runs.

1122
01:33:41,505 --> 01:33:47,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could be good to also invite people who work, who organize and who work in

1123
01:33:48,568 --> 01:34:09,919
[SPEAKER_01]: current existing after school programs to hear about, you know, the challenges that they're facing in terms of staffing in terms of running their programs and increasing occupancy numbers to hear about for us to as a city council and as a city government to have a better understanding of what exactly are the challenges we need to overcome.

1124
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:14,322
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd be happy to support this resolution and to second it.

1125
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:20,205
[SPEAKER_01]: to move it forward and to have us talk a little to have us talk more about this issue.

1126
01:34:20,225 --> 01:34:25,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I also think it'd be worth it to to look.

1127
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:35,159
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at some of some of the proposals that have been before the city council in the past I know, Councilor Marks was a big proponent of having an art center.

1128
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:47,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be one possible step forward for us as well but I think as many ideas as we can get to the table as many concrete problems that we can identify a solution for, I think.

1129
01:34:48,453 --> 01:34:56,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are the right steps that we need to be taking as a city and I applaud Councilor Scarpelli for putting us on the right track.

1130
01:34:58,219 --> 01:35:00,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion.

1131
01:35:02,242 --> 01:35:03,923
[SPEAKER_17]: President Bears you Madam President.

1132
01:35:05,884 --> 01:35:10,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, this is a major issue for families and we've been hearing a lot about it.

1133
01:35:12,028 --> 01:35:13,189
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do know that

1134
01:35:14,216 --> 01:35:26,611
[SPEAKER_02]: The team that runs Medford after school right now has, has looked at other communities that looked at Medford and we have at the Brooks school the biggest single school after school program in the whole state right now.

1135
01:35:28,072 --> 01:35:33,759
[SPEAKER_02]: We have incredibly high demand on all of the elementary school after school programs that is.

1136
01:35:34,877 --> 01:35:37,920
[SPEAKER_02]: even out of comparison to other communities that are similar.

1137
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some Medford specific problems here.

1138
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a good time for us.

1139
01:35:45,626 --> 01:35:51,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I support this effort, any effort to try to address this, but it does seem like the big issues are the staffing.

1140
01:35:51,992 --> 01:35:54,314
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just difficult to find people for the two to 6 p.m.

1141
01:35:54,354 --> 01:35:54,674
[SPEAKER_02]: shift.

1142
01:35:54,994 --> 01:35:57,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may be finding an alternative there.

1143
01:35:59,457 --> 01:36:03,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously that would require some significant systemic change with how the public school system works.

1144
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:07,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the space question you say well we have these schools, how can we not have space.

1145
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:22,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's really that these programs are limited to the existing shared spaces in the buildings like libraries gymnasiums and cafeterias so, you know, re looking at that would also be a significant change for everybody if we were to move into spaces that usually aren't used for programs like this, you know, that would be.

1146
01:36:23,347 --> 01:36:24,469
[SPEAKER_02]: there could be disruptions there.

1147
01:36:24,489 --> 01:36:28,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying these as barriers, I'm just saying that these are the things we need to get over.

1148
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:36,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But I certainly am never gonna vote against trying, so I support this, support having a subcommittee and seeing what we can do on it.

1149
01:36:37,677 --> 01:36:43,842
[SPEAKER_02]: but obviously in partnership with the Metro Public Schools, which is going to be included as the mayor's office.

1150
01:36:43,942 --> 01:36:48,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we can have good ideas, but if it requires money, we can't do it.

1151
01:36:48,165 --> 01:36:50,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it requires space in the schools, we can't do that.

1152
01:36:50,607 --> 01:36:54,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's really going to need to be a partnership of all the branches of government.

1153
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:57,412
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1154
01:36:57,592 --> 01:37:04,317
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of councilor Scarpelli to send this paper to the recreation and youth affairs subcommittee, who did you want to invite?

1155
01:37:04,337 --> 01:37:05,998
[SPEAKER_17]: It's for the clerk.

1156
01:37:06,919 --> 01:37:07,219
[SPEAKER_17]: You got it.

1157
01:37:07,379 --> 01:37:07,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1158
01:37:09,445 --> 01:37:12,447
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1159
01:37:12,887 --> 01:37:14,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1160
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:18,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears?

1161
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:18,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1162
01:37:19,531 --> 01:37:20,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello-Villa is absent.

1163
01:37:21,012 --> 01:37:21,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins?

1164
01:37:21,812 --> 01:37:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1165
01:37:22,352 --> 01:37:22,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

1166
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:23,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1167
01:37:23,813 --> 01:37:24,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1168
01:37:24,694 --> 01:37:24,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1169
01:37:25,574 --> 01:37:26,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng?

1170
01:37:26,735 --> 01:37:26,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1171
01:37:28,366 --> 01:37:28,906
[SPEAKER_05]: President Morell.

1172
01:37:29,167 --> 01:37:33,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1173
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:54,263
[SPEAKER_17]: 22-313, offered by President Morell and Vice President Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide an update on the city's development planning process, new resources for housing stability for Medford residents, and potential changes to street parking policies in the South Medford neighborhood in preparation for the opening of the Greenline Extension Medford branch this summer.

1174
01:37:54,883 --> 01:38:07,661
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a follow up to Council Paper 20-534 from September 8, 2020, which requested a meeting with representatives of the city administration and South Manhattan residents to discuss a district plan for the Ball Square-Boston Avenue corridor.

1175
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:14,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor, I have an issue I can just share from the chair and then I'll pass to Vice-President Harris.

1176
01:38:15,603 --> 01:38:22,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, this is something that came up in 2020 that we've known for a very long time that the green line is coming and it is going to dramatically impact our city.

1177
01:38:22,808 --> 01:38:35,798
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this came up again because in light of the recent processing on Bradley Road and then hearing from some residents in South Medford, they wanna know what the city is doing to, you know,

1178
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:39,939
[SPEAKER_17]: encourage housing stability, but also just simply what's going on with parking.

1179
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:49,742
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is just a further nudge for the administration to hopefully hold a meeting with South Niper residents to discuss how we're going to address the many issues.

1180
01:38:49,762 --> 01:38:55,204
[SPEAKER_17]: There will be many good things that come from the Green Line, but the many issues that are going to crop up once the station is finally open.

1181
01:38:56,425 --> 01:38:57,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

1182
01:38:57,452 --> 01:38:58,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1183
01:38:58,473 --> 01:39:06,404
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to everything you just said, I think my other intention here, certainly with paper 20-534 in this paper, is to look at the opportunities.

1184
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:14,961
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a supply side answer to this housing question an area where it's going to be transit oriented and you're going to have that walkability and we have the density.

1185
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you turn a couple two families into three families that's a big, big change it's big change and we'd have to talk about it but if you're point one miles from a train station, maybe that makes sense in this modern age so you know, well, I'm sure that

1186
01:39:30,219 --> 01:39:32,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I will forever be the boogeyman.

1187
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:38,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I support solutions of all stripes to address the problems that we face, and I think this is one of them.

1188
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:41,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

1189
01:39:41,402 --> 01:39:43,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further discussion?

1190
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:46,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Do I have a motion?

1191
01:39:49,263 --> 01:39:50,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve.

1192
01:39:50,844 --> 01:39:55,305
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to approve, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1193
01:39:55,325 --> 01:39:56,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1194
01:39:59,181 --> 01:39:59,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Pierce.

1195
01:40:00,221 --> 01:40:00,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1196
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:02,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello is absent.

1197
01:40:03,743 --> 01:40:04,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

1198
01:40:04,703 --> 01:40:04,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1199
01:40:05,803 --> 01:40:06,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

1200
01:40:07,364 --> 01:40:08,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1201
01:40:08,144 --> 01:40:08,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1202
01:40:08,944 --> 01:40:09,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

1203
01:40:10,165 --> 01:40:10,345
Yes.

1204
01:40:12,005 --> 01:40:12,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

1205
01:40:12,826 --> 01:40:13,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1206
01:40:13,026 --> 01:40:15,346
[SPEAKER_17]: 16 in front of one absent in motion passes.

1207
01:40:15,707 --> 01:40:16,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Consensus.

1208
01:40:17,047 --> 01:40:19,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Reports of committees 19-502.

1209
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:21,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you're right.

1210
01:40:22,389 --> 01:40:23,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.

1211
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:24,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1212
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:27,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I have to pull it up from my email.

1213
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:28,411
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not have a physical copy.

1214
01:40:29,772 --> 01:40:32,273
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1215
01:40:32,513 --> 01:40:37,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion of Vice President Bears to take papers in the hands of the clerk seconded by Councilor Knight.

1216
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:42,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll and I will find this night.

1217
01:40:44,877 --> 01:40:45,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

1218
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:46,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1219
01:40:47,078 --> 01:40:48,778
[SPEAKER_05]: That's curable is absent Council calls.

1220
01:40:48,978 --> 01:40:49,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1221
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:50,899
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1222
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:51,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1223
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:51,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1224
01:40:51,839 --> 01:40:51,919

[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, 16 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1226
01:40:59,462 --> 01:41:02,664
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-2 is 3-1-4, offered by Councilor Knight.

1234
01:42:21,634 --> 01:42:22,415
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a lot.

1235
01:42:23,162 --> 01:42:31,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, as you're aware, Monday is the marathon, and these individuals that are fortunate enough to have a bib have trained probably for the better part of the last year.

1236
01:42:31,573 --> 01:42:36,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Councilor Scarpelli can talk a little bit about that with his wife being an avid marathoner who ran last year.

1237
01:42:37,428 --> 01:42:43,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, I'm every year the council does extend its well wishes to those participants that reside in our community.

1238
01:42:44,611 --> 01:42:54,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave McGilvery mentioned resident is the race director for the Boston Marathon a proud graduate of high school, grew up on the Fulton Heights area of the city of Medford and he's done great work with this race.

1239
01:42:56,196 --> 01:43:00,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's nice to see that we're back in action after a couple of years off.

1240
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to wish these runners all the best of luck.

1241
01:43:03,902 --> 01:43:11,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I have several friends that are running that you mentioned that I will save the risk of embarrassing them by letting people know that they're friends of mine.

1242
01:43:11,908 --> 01:43:14,450
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, Madam President, I do wish them all the best of luck.

1243
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And I ask my council colleagues to join.

1244
01:43:16,611 --> 01:43:17,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1245
01:43:18,253 --> 01:43:20,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1246
01:43:20,174 --> 01:43:21,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for bringing this forward.

1247
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:25,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's important, yes, living with an avid marathon runner.

1248
01:43:27,251 --> 01:43:34,177
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that are taking on this massive endeavor is something that I look in amazement and awe.

1249
01:43:35,398 --> 01:43:39,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, Dina took the year off this year and should be back next year.

1250
01:43:39,581 --> 01:43:49,209
[SPEAKER_04]: But to all those brave souls that are going to give it a whirl on Monday, wish them good weather and Godspeed.

1251
01:43:49,269 --> 01:43:50,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you and good luck.

1252
01:43:51,191 --> 01:43:52,252

01:43:52,652 --> 01:43:53,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

1254
01:43:53,858 --> 01:43:55,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1255
01:43:56,119 --> 01:43:59,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I certainly am very supportive and have had many friends around the marathon.

1256
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:08,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be supporting this resolution, but I sadly will not be watching the marathon because I will be watching your speech at Patriot's Day.

1257
01:44:08,181 --> 01:44:11,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So very excited, Madam President.

1258
01:44:11,902 --> 01:44:15,063
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess that's where I'm going.

1259
01:44:15,163 --> 01:44:18,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I expect a marathon speech for the ages.

1260
01:44:18,864 --> 01:44:22,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are city celebrations Monday morning as well for Patriot's Day.

1261
01:44:23,497 --> 01:44:24,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Barros.

1262
01:44:24,357 --> 01:44:25,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

1263
01:44:25,738 --> 01:44:29,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Morell, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on the agenda.

1264
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:35,063
[SPEAKER_14]: As somebody with one marathon under my belt, albeit not very fast and not in Boston, unfortunately, maybe one day.

1265
01:44:35,083 --> 01:44:37,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to salute all of the runners.

1266
01:44:37,505 --> 01:44:38,885
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you have a great day.

1267
01:44:39,726 --> 01:44:45,109
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope that everybody has a wonderful Patriots Day wherever it finds them.

1268
01:44:45,189 --> 01:44:45,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1269
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:47,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1270
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:48,511
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I could, from the chair, since we're

1271
01:44:49,248 --> 01:44:58,251
[SPEAKER_17]: playing that game, I did have the privilege of running the Boston Marathon many years ago, and I know the amount of dedication and really thankless hours that go into training for a marathon.

1272
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:03,972
[SPEAKER_17]: So for the many residents running and who put in the training, congratulations, you know, the training is the hard part.

1273
01:45:04,332 --> 01:45:09,614
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're into something that is just takes hours and hours and can feel thankless, can I recommend politics?

1274
01:45:09,654 --> 01:45:10,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Very similar.

1275
01:45:14,597 --> 01:45:19,882
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Knight by Councilor Scarpelli Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1276
01:45:24,405 --> 01:45:24,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1277
01:45:24,585 --> 01:45:24,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1278
01:45:24,786 --> 01:45:25,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1279
01:45:25,446 --> 01:45:25,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1280
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:26,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1281
01:45:27,008 --> 01:45:27,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1282
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:27,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1283
01:45:27,568 --> 01:45:27,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1284
01:45:29,309 --> 01:45:29,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1285
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:29,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1286
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:29,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1287
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:30,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1288
01:45:42,422 --> 01:45:44,043
[SPEAKER_17]: while we're under suspension?

1289
01:45:44,203 --> 01:45:48,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Just this past week, a lot was going on in the city of Medford.

1290
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:52,890
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a police officer rescue someone from drowning in the Mystic River.

1291
01:45:53,911 --> 01:45:58,475
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a severe shooting down at the courthouse on Route 16.

1292
01:45:59,236 --> 01:46:04,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had a very significant car crash where a motor vehicle actually burst into flames and crashed into a car.

1293
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:08,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week was also EMS dispatch week.

1294
01:46:08,868 --> 01:46:14,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, I think it's very important that we point out the work of our first responders and the work that they're doing here in this community.

1295
01:46:15,052 --> 01:46:23,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just our EMS dispatchers, but also those that EMS dispatches out, which would be our ambulance providers, our fire department, our DPW, and our police.

1296
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:24,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're doing an excellent job.

1297
01:46:24,976 --> 01:46:43,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we look at the news and we see what's going on around the world as it becomes, as the restrictions are lifted slowly, we're seeing a lot more gun violence in neighboring communities, a lot more knife violence in neighboring communities, a lot more car accidents going on because people for the last couple of years have been spoiled.

1298
01:46:44,586 --> 01:46:47,107
[SPEAKER_08]: They've not been on the roads driving around.

1299
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:50,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And then obviously we all know the issues that people have with mental health these days.

1300
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:53,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I think it's very important that we recognize the work

1301
01:46:53,887 --> 01:47:02,092
[SPEAKER_08]: that our friends down at the police department and the fire department do in dispatching out the necessary EMS providers to be sure that we're all safe in this community.

1302
01:47:02,132 --> 01:47:04,533
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I'd just like to offer that.

1303
01:47:04,853 --> 01:47:08,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not on the formal resolution, but just as a thank you in this recognition of dispatch week.

1304
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

1305
01:47:10,237 --> 01:47:13,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on to reports of committees.

1307
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:17,401
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to revert.

1308
01:47:17,441 --> 01:47:18,341
Okay.

[SPEAKER_04]: This Subcommittee on Science had tried to do our due diligence.

1324
01:48:06,163 --> 01:48:19,230
[SPEAKER_04]: his requirements, so I believe they're trying to set up a meeting with the building department to properly put the paperwork in order and proceed in the correct process that is asked upon them.

1325
