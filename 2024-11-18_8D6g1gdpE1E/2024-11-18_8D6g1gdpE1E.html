    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=224.26s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=225.941s">Any</a>  of us that have gone through Medford High over the past, I guess, what looks like 50 years will be very familiar with Bill Mazzacca. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=231.866s">He</a>  was a security officer there for the last 47 and a half years where we went to school every day during rain, snow, sleet, and hail to protect the children in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=242.614s">But</a>  he's always been a great individual, a great public servant, and someone that I've always respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=247.217s">It</a>  was very <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=248.618s">interesting</a>  when I brought my son up to kids corner for daycare, and I sat there and my son said, Oh, I was talking to Mr. Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=256.364s">And</a>  I look over and there's Bill Mosaic, who was Mr. Bill, when I was a student at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=261.667s">But</a>  he's just a gentleman who's dedicated his whole life to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=264.93s">Someone</a>  who's done great good for the students in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=267.952s">And</a>  he's someone that deserves a little bit of recognition for the hard work that he put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=271.134s">He's</a>  someone that was always behind the scenes a man of not many words, but great action. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=275.137s">He's</a>  someone that the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=276.905s">should</a>  be very thankful that they had the opportunity to have for 47 and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=280.468s">So</a>  with that being said, Madam President, I'm asking my colleagues to join me in extending some congratulatory notes to Mr. Mazeka in the momentous occasion of his retirement.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=289.741s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, and I apologize for the mispronunciation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=291.984s">I</a>  wasn't privileged to have him. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=293.787s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=294.948s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=295.769s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=299.394s">True</a>  words couldn't be spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=301.197s">Mr.</a>  Mosaic is a true gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=303.96s">When</a>  you're talking about the last of <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=307.517s">The</a>  old guard that I remember in high school where there was a team of maybe six security guards that roam the vast hallways of Medford High School keeping the peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=320.202s">As</a>  time went on, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=322.862s">Mr.</a>  Mosaica became the total opposite of what you think a security guard was. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=328.066s">He</a>  was a person that kids could speak to, a person that when you needed a strong arm, he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=336.192s">When</a>  you needed an ear to talk to, he gave it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=341.275s">And</a>  I think every kid that walks the halls at Medford High School, love and respect Mr. Mosaica. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=347.8s">He</a>  is truly a gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=351.002s">It</a>  was, I don't think I've ever heard a negative word said about Mr. Mosaic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=355.949s">And</a>  it is a contentious job, you know, at times you have to be the heavy in the school, where it's a suspension or removal of a student or, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=367.989s">or</a>  a faculty member, Mr. Mosaic was the person that had to be that heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=372.89s">And</a>  he was always there with respect and kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=377.791s">And</a>  I'm glad that he's retiring and I wish him well and his family well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=383.633s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President, for giving me the moment.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=386.274s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=389.412s">I</a>  also had the privilege of getting to know Mr. Nzeka back in my four years at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=396.92s">He</a>  was a loved member of our school community, and to be able to congratulate him on such a momentous occasion is truly a privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=408.314s">I</a>  think all of us have specific memories of, you know, just seeing him welcoming us into the high school every day, seeing him walk around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=416.198s">You</a>  know, he was someone who really built trust with all of our students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=420.981s">So</a>  I'm very grateful for his service to our city, and I wish him the best in his retirement.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=430.406s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tsai. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=432.547s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=435.769s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=442.986s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=443.948s">Yes,</a>  that's a Caribbean. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=445.632s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=445.812s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=454.238s">President</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=454.978s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=456.019s">So</a>  I mean the firm is here in the negative the motion passes to two dash 306 offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins be it so resolved that the Metro City Council by the Medford City Council that we support the proposed fair share amendment that would create an additional tax of four percentage points on annual income above $1 million and dedicate the funds raised by this tax to quality public education <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=479.145s">affordable</a>  public colleges and universities, and for the repair and maintenance of roads, bridges, and public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=485.326s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=486.486s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=488.887s">The</a>  fair share amendment has been a major topic of conversation in Massachusetts for nearly a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=497.288s">I</a>  think too often it is used as an excuse for the state not to fund schools, fund colleges, and fund roads now because we'll do it when the fair share amendment happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=507.168s">Luckily</a>  enough, we are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=508.348s">The</a>  fair share amendment is on the ballot for the November 2022 election. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=513.79s">This</a>  would raise funds for the state that would go towards public education, public colleges and universities and our transit and roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=521.713s">I</a>  think all of us know how deeply needed these funds are for municipalities like Medford and the campaign to support this amendment when it's on the ballot in November is currently <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=535.321s">soliciting</a>  the support of city councils across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=538.686s">I</a>  would like to add our voice to that chorus of city councils, and I would move approval on this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=548.286s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=549.987s">I</a>  just want to echo Vice President Bears's sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=554.088s">I'm</a>  so excited for the fair share amendment to finally be on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=558.65s">You</a>  know, and I think looking at this through the lens of how this would affect the city like Medford, you know, is the perspective that I, you know, that I hope my fellow Councilors and, you know, really every resident and voter in Medford beyond to take into account, you know, public education, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=575.198s">public</a>  higher education, roads, infrastructure, hopefully climate change resiliency, you know, these are areas where we need <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=584.606s">new</a>  revenue sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=587.547s">We</a>  can't do the things that we need to be the kind of community that we want to be, to live in the kind of community that we want to live in, without revenues for these incredibly important projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=598.352s">And,</a>  you know, the source is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=600.172s">When</a>  there's so much need spread throughout our communities, you know, we need to shift from a model of wealth hoarding to a model of making sure that we bring up the baseline for the parts of our communities that are <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=612.037s">in</a>  most need of investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=613.418s">So</a>  I thank Vice President Bears for his advocacy of this, and I'll be excited to vote in support and then vote in support in November as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=621.841s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=622.722s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=623.542s">Any</a>  further discussion from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=627.223s">Moving</a>  on to the public, I'm going to return to you, Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=632.025s">We</a>  do have, you already have the name and address or address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=635.467s">You</a>  just state your name again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=636.487s">We</a>  already have your address and then go right ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=638.787s">Yes,</a>  Laura Panette. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=640.708s">Thank</a>  you very much for the opportunity to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=644.45s">As</a>  was just stated, there are several reasons, there are a number of reasons to be in favor of the fair share amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=651.173s">I'm</a>  here speaking both as the parent of a graduate of Medford Public Schools, and also as a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=662.88s">And</a>  I'm looking at the benefits both for our K-12 schools in Massachusetts and also for public higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=671.706s">I</a>  want to point to the extreme need for additional staffing in K-12 schools, not only regular classroom teachers, but also ESPs, the valuable support personnel in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=691.328s">to</a>  support every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=693.51s">It's</a>  a long time since our public schools had librarians or music teachers who were in the building for more than a few minutes a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=704.179s">College</a>  Councilors are a wide variety of support staff who are badly needed by the children of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=713.647s">As</a>  a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=718.253s">I'm</a>  privileged to work with many students who are first generation in their families to be in higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=725.395s">They</a>  don't come from settings where their parents know all about how to get into college or how to succeed once they get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=733.896s">They</a>  also need and deserve extra support services. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=738.758s">And</a>  this is again, part of what the fair share amendment could contribute <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=746.02s">in</a>  terms of supporting the aspirations of the next generation of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=752.124s">And</a>  I'd also like to point to the physical plant, both in K-12 schools and in higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=759.91s">Many</a>  school buildings are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=761.952s">We've</a>  seen, especially during the pandemic, the critical problems with inadequate ventilation, not enough fresh air coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=772.429s">not</a>  enough ability to filter air and prevent transmission of the COVID virus or other transmissible diseases. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=784.333s">There</a>  are buildings that have mold and even mushrooms growing in them because of the extreme lack of adequate ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=796.237s">So</a>  there's a wide range of needs that have been put off for a long time in being dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=803.62s">Thank</a>  you very much for your attention.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=807.901s">Thank</a>  you, Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=808.842s">Any</a>  further discussion from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=813.763s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=818.202s">forestry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=819.863s">This</a>  is the I'm not familiar with the Fair Share Amendment Act, but so I have a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=825.406s">How</a>  is the money being managed and diverted to the cities and towns? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=831.03s">Once</a>  this once this money is collected, if this gets approved at a state level, and people are taxed 4% that money then goes into a state must mean some state account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=841.577s">So</a>  how, how is it diverted to the cities and towns?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=847.213s">Madam</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=848.755s">So,</a>  this would only apply to income over $1 million so any income you make under $1 million would not be subject to the time I understand that that wasn't my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=857.568s">We</a>  said people would be taxed 4% of only be people's income over $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=862.635s">And</a>  it's obviously subject to the appropriation by the state legislature, but generally, you know, one of the biggest expenditures in the state legislature is Chapter 70, which is the multi-billion dollar fund that diverts state aid to local schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=876.382s">Chapter</a>  90 is a similar program which diverts state funding to roads, bridges, municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=882.424s">So</a>  increases in those amounts for Chapter 70 or Chapter 90 would come through the existing formula to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=890.508s">And</a>  additionally, they could, you know, earmark for specific projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=894.309s">For</a>  example, the West Medford commuter rail upgrade station upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=898.069s">That</a>  could be one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=899.45s">I</a>  mean, it obviously would be subject to the appropriation by the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=903.65s">But</a>  the way the ballot question is written, the money has to be spent on public education, public higher education and transit and roads.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=911.312s">So</a>  we don't know, though, how much money would actually be coming to the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=914.472s">Oh,</a>  that not at this point, but more.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=919.352s">more</a>  than the 1.9 billion money that was as we get in any. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=924.214s">So,</a>  that's including the SSR money that already that we're getting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=927.955s">This</a>  is not in relation to the SSR or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=932.336s">No,</a>  I know it's not related but we are getting funds from those, those other places right, I believe, the city's allocation from ARPA was about $50 million in one time funds spread out over five years.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=943.02s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1026.217s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1027.879s">This</a>  is a resolution requesting that we support <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1032.63s">statewide</a>  commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1037.733s">Community</a>  leaders in Medford's Haitian community have reached out regarding this item, and the intent of this commission would be to look at a number of issues facing Haitian communities across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1047.898s">We</a>  have one of the largest Haitian American communities in the whole country here in Massachusetts, and as many people know, there are a number of issues <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1056.762s">We've</a>  discussed previously this term that affect the Haitian community when it comes to immigration, federal, state policy, and this commission would be a voice for members of the Haitian community across the state to issue reports and request action by our state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1073.772s">And</a>  I would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1077.315s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1082.158s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1084.086s">Um,</a>  this is in line with the values of our city as a welcoming, inclusive place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1087.768s">I</a>  think this is, um, you know, this resolution is something that reflects who we are as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1094.091s">Um,</a>  and the support that we all, um, we all want to show for our Haitian neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1100.295s">Um,</a>  this is in line with what we've passed as a city council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1103.036s">And</a>  I think, um, Councilor, uh, bears for putting this on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1108.179s">And</a>  I second his motion.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1110.04s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1112.381s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1114.133s">Any</a>  discussion from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1115.734s">Councilor</a>  Naik.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1117.635s">I</a>  certainly understand that the city of Medford has a very strong Haitian population. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1122.258s">Growing</a>  up in this community, I've gone to school and come friends with a number of people that are from Haitian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1128.201s">And</a>  I certainly have no problem with a commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent that's being created by the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1137.746s">But</a>  I've said it before, I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1139.087s">I'm</a>  not putting my name on a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1141.375s">going</a>  to speak of Mariano or Senate Spelker, unless it's us asking for money for the city, because pretty soon they're going to become tone deaf to the wants and desires of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1152.643s">Um,</a>  so for that reason, I'll be voting against this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1155.385s">Um,</a>  I certainly support the piece of legislation as a private citizen, but as a member of this body, I don't feel as though it's good practice for us to continue to put our noses into what's going on with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1164.752s">Um,</a>  I haven't never gotten a letter from a state delegation telling us to vote a certain way in a resolution that's before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1170.882s">If</a>  we want our delegation to come down and present to us and talk to us about some of these pieces of legislation, I think that might be a little bit more productive because, well, Council of Business is pretty well-versed in a lot of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1180.724s">I</a>  don't think all of us are. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1182.945s">And</a>  I think a lot of us would be a little bit more comfortable if maybe we had members of our delegation come down and talk to us, tell us what this bill does and why they're in favor of it or why they're opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1192.127s">And</a>  then the council can make a determination as to whether or not we want to encourage our delegation, the people that represent us on Beacon Hill, to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1199.969s">So</a>  with that being said, I thank the council for bringing the measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1202.37s">And</a>  I also thank him for being so up to date and involved in the goings on at Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1207.632s">However,</a>  my focus here is in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1209.352s">And</a>  I think that this council really needs to take a look at what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1215.514s">And</a>  if we're going to Beacon Hill, well, one thing we need more than anything is money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1218.395s">So</a>  that's what I think we should be asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1220.035s">But</a>  I thank the council for the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1222.229s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1226.453s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Biazzi. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1227.974s">This</a>  is, I know that you do your due diligence, but again, I've represented myself in the same fashion Councilor Knight has spoken, so it would not be legal to point, but I will not support this paper for those facts as well, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1338.913s">While</a>  it may not be within the walls of Medford, it certainly will affect our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1343.956s">And</a>  this item is about a project that's currently undergoing review, mostly in Arlington, but it will connect a piece of Medford, the bridge between the two rotaries on High Street Route 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1360.044s">And</a>  there are a couple of different routes currently being explored, but it would connect essentially that area of the Mystic River to the Minuteman <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1367.385s">bikeway</a>  in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1370.506s">And</a>  there's a essentially if you go to the survey tiny url.com slash mystic to bikeway survey to you can look at a set of plans that are currently proposed it would, I think, personally as someone who has driven through these rotaries and then walked near these rotaries relatively frequently significantly improve traffic safety in that area for all modes of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1394.15s">which</a>  is kind of why I put it on I think that's a great benefit for the city of Medford in and of itself, but it will also connect the mystic pathways to the Arlington Minuteman bikeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1405.173s">So,</a>  I would love the city administration to let residents know that this project is happening I didn't hear about it from Medford I heard about it from. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1414.316s">I</a>  think a different group I'd actually can't remember quite right now, but also that residents can fill out the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1420.231s">where</a>  they can review the plans and let their voice be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1422.594s">Again,</a>  the URL is tinyurl.com slash mystic to bikeway survey number two, the number and then the number two and I would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1436.6s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1438.101s">And</a>  thank you, Vice President Bears, for letting everybody know that this is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1444.105s">For</a>  anybody who's interested in learning more about it, I took the survey myself today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1448.107s">It</a>  took under 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1450.308s">They</a>  have a box to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1451.189s">Are</a>  you a constituent from Arlington? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1452.91s">Are</a>  you a constituent from Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1455.292s">I</a>  think this is a great thing for our community members to weigh in on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1458.313s">It</a>  will affect this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1460.155s">And</a>  even going beyond that, this is the type of project that I hope that our <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1464.725s">city</a>  administration can really look to and be inspired by. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1467.226s">You</a>  know, I think we talk a lot about how much more we could be doing with our riverfront, how much more we want to be doing about traffic calming, pedestrian safety, expanding pedestrian and bike access along our beautiful scenic waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1481.551s">So</a>  I'm excited to see how this is spearheaded by the community of Arlington, how it affects our community positively. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1487.633s">and</a>  I really hope that we can see projects like this unfolding along the, you know, the riverfront that we control here in Medford as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1495.054s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1495.994s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1496.895s">Councilor</a>  Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1500.195s">I</a>  believe that as a community, if we want to see something change, we need to show up at the table, and I think this is one of the ways we can show up and have our voice be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1508.817s">You</a>  know, knocking on doors through the last campaign season, something I heard from a lot of families was, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1517.585s">was</a>  the desire for us to have a grand scheme of bike, a network of bikes, bike lanes that kind of connected better to other cities and that was better integrated in our, that was better integrated in our own community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1533.937s">I</a>  think this is, taking surveys like this is one of the most important ways through which our community, our constituents, our residents can <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1544.522s">make</a>  our voices heard and to make sure that, you know, that grant money so that some of that grant money does come to Medford and that we have that kind of more, that better, better planned out, better thought out bike network that we want to see here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1560.553s">So</a>  I think Councilor Bears, we're putting this on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1566.477s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1567.198s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1568.779s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1569.8s">Madam</a>  President, yes, I'll be supporting this measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1572.141s">If</a>  we remember back to the mistake <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1574.981s">River</a>  Watershed Association and the presentation that they made to us several years ago when they were coming to us for some community development block grant funding or CPA funding I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1584.066s">and</a>  they were seeking funds to design a shared use path along the Mystic River down to Shannon Beach and then beyond Shannon Beach down to Wedgman Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1593.492s">I</a>  think that this is a key link to us bringing that project to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1599.015s">It's</a>  gonna allow us to connect the multimodal transportation roadways to the two train stations as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1606.1s">So</a>  that's gonna be something very beneficial to the communities to split the people out of them.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1610.403s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1611.123s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1613.81s">Moving</a>  on to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1615.37s">I</a>  see Mimi Gordon on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1618.451s">Mimi,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1625.273s">I</a>  see a box asking you to unmute when you're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1637.517s">Mimi,</a>  if you're able to unmute, I'll give you another moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1651.354s">While</a>  we wait for Mimi, is there anyone else who would like to speak on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1657.882s">And</a>  if I could, from the chair, as we wait for Mimi, I mean, this is something that's come before the council in different versions, not exactly the survey, but issues that happen in this area, particularly as you're walking around the beautiful paths along the Mississippi River towards the lakes, you're dumped out into a rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1673.693s">There's</a>  no crosswalk, there's no safe way to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1676.094s">And</a>  if you bike, walk, drive by there any beautiful day, you're seeing people try to scramble across the bridge right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1682.879s">So</a>  hopefully this is something that would address that as far as many other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1688.145s">residents</a>  to take the survey if they can, and I thank Vice President Bears for bringing this to the attention of the council and to residents in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1695.693s">Mimi,</a>  are you able to unmute? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1697.555s">I</a>  do see, okay, so while we wait for Mimi, I see Martha Andres. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1702.62s">Martha,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrus]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1704.622s">Yeah,</a>  Martha Andres, 45 Kilgore Avenue, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1710.371s">I</a>  am excited about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1713.815s">It</a>  was initiated by Arlington, but it does include, I would say a third of the people who showed up for public participation were from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1724.206s">And</a>  we're very excited about having the rotaries at the High Street Bridge dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1732.243s">to</a>  make them safer for driving, safer for pedestrians, safer for bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1737.326s">You</a>  know, this is an area that, especially since the pandemic, everybody wants to be outdoors and walking in a beautiful area along the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1747.311s">And</a>  this is so important to us to make this project happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1752.134s">As</a>  Councilor Knight has pointed out, you know, there's been some interest in improving the path on the other side of the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1760.571s">on</a>  the Medford side and you know hopefully that will follow from this improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1766.875s">Thank</a>  you for bringing it up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1769.957s">Thank</a>  you Martha and we'll maybe we'll try you once more to see if we can get you to unmute and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1775.381s">I</a>  did see you briefly unmuted before but <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1791.575s">Okay,</a>  Mimi, we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1793.957s">If</a>  you have comments, you can send them to the clerk or any of the individual Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1799.241s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1861.463s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1863.384s">Resolution</a>  is relatively self-explanatory, but essentially the land on the riverbank across from Whole Foods, part of it is owned by the city of Menford, part of it is owned by the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1875.328s">There's</a>  currently not a path or sidewalk on that side of the street, which means that people have to cross at the relatively dangerous intersection of Auburn and Route 16 across the Auburn Street Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1886.898s">residents</a>  in the area said that they would really benefit from a connection on this side of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1891.401s">And</a>  I'd love to see if our city administration can reach out to partners in the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1900.028s">I've</a>  reached out to a couple of councillors in the city of Somerville who said that they would be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1903.811s">So</a>  I'm hopeful that we can build that partnership and make things a little safer and more accessible at that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1911.877s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1915.032s">I</a>  believe that stretch of roadway is DCR controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1919.455s">The</a>  crossing right from Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1922.576s">The</a>  crossing is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1924.057s">I</a>  know Councilor Caraviello is going to run for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1926.899s">I</a>  know that he's been working with them on the guide rails as well with DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1930.901s">So</a>  I think the DCR would have to be involved in doing anything that doesn't cross their road or block their road.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1938.003s">the</a>  crossing would actually be on the Medford-controlled section of Auburn, well, potentially on the Medford-controlled section of Auburn Street, and the land, that bank is owned by the city, it's not by DCR, so we may need to collaborate with them to connect it, but it's mostly out of their jurisdiction, which in this case, I think is a good thing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2072.428s">I'm</a>  happy to go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2075.251s">And</a>  if my fellow councilors would like to sever the votes on the resolve and the further resolve, I'm more than happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2082.98s">You</a>  know, we've been talking about this issue for a while, since I've been on the council, since before I was on the council, of housing, the housing crisis and the issues facing a lot of longtime residents of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2098.245s">We</a>  had some really good work in subcommittee last term, addressing emergency issues around the COVID pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2106.848s">And</a>  I think we did a lot of good work on that as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2112.075s">coming</a>  out of the pandemic or into the latest phase or however we want to countenance it, the housing situation is deteriorating rapidly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2123.664s">We</a>  just had residents in here for the past couple of weeks who are facing displacement from units that they've lived in for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2134.192s">And</a>  the intent seems to be on that, that these long-term residents are being forced out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2140.479s">you</a>  know, just so that we can do a quick renovation and then raise the rents by a certain amount and then bring in a new type of person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2147.524s">The</a>  intent here is that the housing subcommittee look at a variety of options as we discussed last week you know the city's authority here is significantly limited by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2157.47s">So</a>  on a number of items on all of these items discussed we would have to file a home real petition and request action from the state for the city to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2167.502s">I</a>  listed these these different policy items I personally support all of them I understand that if the council may support some of them and not others so I think we want to have that discussion and maybe look at them separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2177.927s">One</a>  of the key things about all of these items, as well as the, the state legislation that again <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2184.17s">You</a>  know this resolution just asked that the housing subcommittee discuss a potential resolution regarding that state legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2191.181s">All</a>  of these would have as currently constituted would have exempt exemptions, you know for small owner occupant landlords this is really talking about people buying <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2200.318s">these</a>  2030 unit buildings are building large luxury apartments or we're seeing now resale of large apartment complexes and the resulting rate rent increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2210.103s">So</a>  really the focus is on is on those properties and what we can do as a city to try to limit the deep impact you know 15% rent increase in a year is really unsustainable and I think we're going to keep seeing that with just the high demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2226.157s">and</a>  the regional issues around housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2228.139s">And</a>  it's really important that as a city, we do our best to advocate for as much power as we can possibly have to make sure that residents have housing stability and aren't facing the trauma and deep emotional, financial and personal impacts that displacement and other forms of types of <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2248.847s">you</a>  know, eviction have on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2250.828s">So</a>  that's the intent of this resolution here, is that we have the housing committee discuss what we can ask the state to return power to our community to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2260.071s">And</a>  I would move approval on that, obviously, pending discussion of the council.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2267.834s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2269.135s">Councilor</a>  Collins, then Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2272.276s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears, for going through the resolution so thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2277.754s">And</a>  I appreciate you bringing up the context of the mass displacement that we're already starting to see in Medford over the past week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2285.502s">We</a>  had residents from the building on Bradley Road, some of whom are in attendance tonight, who were telling us about what they're currently going through with that exact type of situation, with where we are currently in the housing market, the housing crisis coming out of the pandemic as we seem to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2301.237s">You</a>  know, mass mass displacement of tenants from our community from the community that they want to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2307.559s">And</a>  what really shapes me about this whole situation is the fact that, you know, our hands are so tied as Council as a city for what we're able to do to protect the people who live in our community who want to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2319.343s">protect</a>  our constituents, the people that we represent, and that's because of these many, you know, potentially more impactful tenant protection, really just constituent protection measures that we're not allowed to do because of <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2334.39s">because</a>  of decisions affected on the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2336.993s">That's</a>  the reason that these tenant protections are being considered as home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2342.559s">For</a>  anybody who's unfamiliar, measures such as rent stabilization are illegal in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2348.505s">And</a>  I think this has been said by others before me, but I think it's a very frustrating position to be in, to be hearing from constituents saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2357.387s">We</a>  want to stay in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2358.668s">We</a>  want to continue being a part of this community and to be so very constrained in what we can do to effectuate helping people stay in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2367.315s">With</a>  just the situation that we're currently seeing on Bradley Road, I think it's been incredible coming together of housing advocates, people who've been through this type of situation before, residents coming together to see how they can help one another, mutual aid volunteers, just trying to alleviate a really painful, traumatizing, expensive <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2385.004s">situation</a>  for a lot of people, but there's a limit to how much you can volunteer and advocate your way out of a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2393.368s">And</a>  that's why we need to be advocating for changes to what we as a city are allowed to do to help people stay in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2401.732s">And</a>  that's why I'm excited to take up these potential home rule petitions in the housing subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2407.075s">And</a>  just to briefly touch on, I know it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2411.387s">It's</a>  not a four letter word, but it's a four letter and numeral word. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2416.868s">I</a>  understand that, you know, some of my fellow Councilors would, you know, totally understand my fellow Councilor's perspective on advocating for things at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2427.131s">But,</a>  you know, I feel strongly about this one in particular because it directly relates to our authority as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2434.252s">It's</a>  saying, please give us authority back to make decisions about what's right for our community here at the community level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2441.837s">Um,</a>  well, and I'll leave it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2444.259s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2445.219s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2447.121s">Madam</a>  president. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2447.681s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2448.822s">Um,</a>  when looking at the language of this, first of all, it looks very much like a rent control bill to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2454.826s">Um,</a>  rent stabilization, anti price gouging protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2457.788s">Sounds</a>  like rent control to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2459.869s">Um,</a>  it's a homerun petition and we're going to the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2462.231s">We're</a>  asking them to let mention create its own laws and make its own specific set of laws for just people live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2468.86s">This</a>  is gonna go to the state legislature and it's gonna go right in the circular file. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2472.621s">All</a>  right, it's good for show. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2474.881s">In</a>  practice, it's never gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2476.562s">We're</a>  talking about a regional housing crisis, but each community that we live in is gonna have different rules of application as to how it applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2485.723s">I</a>  think it's also important that we look at the policies that we adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2489.544s">If</a>  we take some blame for the rising cost of housing in our community, when we advocate for the Green Line, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2498.932s">We</a>  know the Green Line brings increased property values. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2501.953s">When</a>  we advocate for the revitalization of Medford Square, and we ask people to present proposals on how we can improve and better our downtowns, we're part of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2513.216s">We're</a>  the government, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2514.136s">And</a>  we're asking people, how can we revitalize downtown? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2516.917s">Bradley</a>  Road's right downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2519.298s">We're</a>  saying, let's bring the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2520.458s">Well,</a>  we know the Green Line's gonna bring high property values. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2524.359s">We've</a>  been waiting 20 years for the Green Line to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2526.917s">We</a>  still don't have a parking plan for Ball Square, as we're going to notice if we look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2529.859s">We</a>  knew it was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2531.08s">We've</a>  known it's been coming for two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2533.922s">We've</a>  known it's been coming for two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2536.624s">We</a>  can't address the problems that have followed in our purview and the problems that followed in our scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2541.368s">Is</a>  it really reasonable for us to think that we're going to be able to create laws that are different than those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that just affect just our community right here that relate to something as large scale as a regional housing crisis? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2554.834s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2555.654s">Personally,</a>  I'm going to vote against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2557.515s">And</a>  I don't find it reasonable for us to go create rent control locally in one community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2563.458s">I</a>  think this is something that does need to be addressed at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2566.439s">If</a>  I were a little bit more familiar with these two bills, if I had like a state rep and some staff on my team, and I'd have them research the bills and provide the bill summaries and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2577.625s">But</a>  as of right now, I just think that this is nothing more than a, hey, we tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2581.327s">It</a>  didn't pass up at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2583.545s">Blame</a>  the rep, it's not my fault, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2586.047s">That's</a>  what it looks like to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2586.967s">It</a>  doesn't look like it's rooted in reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2588.808s">I</a>  appreciate the gentleman for bringing the issues to the table, and I appreciate the lady for bringing the issues to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2594.872s">But</a>  we've seen bills like this filed in other communities, and they've gone nowhere.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2599.495s">They've</a>  gone nowhere.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2601.977s">I</a>  mean, and the reason why they've gone nowhere is because we can't just have one set of rules for Medford, a different set of rules for Somerville, a different set of rules for Allington when it comes to something like housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2611.606s">When</a>  we're trying to go with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and address a regional crisis, we can't have rules that just work in one area and not in another.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2620.15s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2621.251s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2622.391s">We</a>  used to, and it worked well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2625.373s">And</a>  then the housing lobby and rich people in the W communities voted away our rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2633.917s">So</a>  that's the fundamental story here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2637.779s">We</a>  used to have tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2639.973s">And</a>  then they were taken away from people who don't live here, by people who don't live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2643.996s">That's</a>  the story at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2646.418s">Do</a>  I agree that it's a long hike? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2648.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2648.72s">Do</a>  I agree with what you said that our reps are trying and quite frankly failing? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2654.064s">Yes,</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2656.065s">It's</a>  not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2657.467s">And</a>  I don't even necessarily speak to our reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2659.608s">At</a>  least two of our reps are supportive of all of this legislation, signed onto the bills that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2668.115s">You</a>  know, when we talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2670.593s">why</a>  it's important for this city council to add our voice to a chorus. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2676.775s">It's</a>  because the only way that anything gets done is when it's overwhelming demand from the people of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2683.556s">Clearly</a>  that's the bar and the threshold of the state legislature, which is the sovereign authority of our state, which has the power to give and take our control over our community at a whim. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2694.719s">They've</a>  decided it's an incredibly high bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2696.78s">You</a>  have to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2699.275s">do</a>  the Fair Share Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2700.055s">It's</a>  going to take eight years to do the Fair Share Amendment when we're talking about millionaires making more money than they've ever made in their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2706.558s">It's</a>  going to take you years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2707.698s">And</a>  then we're going to throw it in the trash when we're talking about a 15% rent hike in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2713.421s">If</a>  they don't want to do their job, let us do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2716.902s">That's</a>  the purpose of this right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2720.584s">Many</a>  communities, it started out in one community or two communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2723.525s">It</a>  started out with the communities that had rent control and then had it stripped away from them in 1994. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2728.812s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2729.513s">I'm</a>  not talking even about going back to those policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2732.635s">That's</a>  not even necessarily what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2734.116s">What</a>  we're looking at now is a much more targeted and defined policy saying if 8% a year isn't enough for you, whatever is going to be enough for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2744.964s">I</a>  mean, basically the rules of the market as set now are if you're a renter, we can do whatever we want to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2751.149s">And</a>  if we're a giant corporate property owner and landowner, we can make as much money as we want over the right to shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2757.477s">That's</a>  not a fair playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2759.339s">And</a>  it's our job to stand up and say we deserve power and tools as a community to level the playing field for the people who live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2767.386s">That's</a>  the purpose here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2768.807s">I</a>  understand it's a long shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2770.649s">Many</a>  things in life are a long shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2772.61s">I</a>  don't think that means we shouldn't try. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2774.812s">That's</a>  why I put this on the agenda with Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2778.486s">we</a>  should at least try. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2780.087s">Maybe</a>  we'll lose, but at least we can say we tried and we believe that these are the tools and powers and opportunities that we need as a community to make sure that when we talk about a Green Line extension or a new high school or revitalizing our squares, that doesn't mean that that's just for rich people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2798.523s">I</a>  don't think just rich people deserve a nice high school or a nice Medford Square or access to public transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2804.708s">I</a>  think we can create a set of policies and rules that allow growth and development and expansion to happen and benefit people in a broad range of incomes and preserve the income and economic diversity that we have as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2817.463s">I</a>  think that your point is well taken, that the past 20 years of inaction have left us in a very difficult position. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2825.695s">Now</a>  we're going to really have to put the pedal to the metal to make sure that the vision of what people see Medford as, as a working class community, as a community where people of all incomes and all backgrounds can come together and live and work and play. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2837.369s">Yeah,</a>  it's going to be hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2839.691s">It's</a>  going to be hard to do that now, because there's been inaction and the state won't let us do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2845.233s">A</a>  lot of what I come up here on a variety of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2847.715s">We're</a>  going to talk about ball square. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2848.936s">I</a>  think we just did a decent job with the zoning recodification to address some of those principles and make it so that we have more options for affordability for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2858.522s">But</a>  it's all tools in the toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2860.003s">It's</a>  all hands on deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2861.944s">And</a>  this is another way that we can try to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2865.966s">Medford</a>  residents, hey, and maybe we'll do it so well, all the communities around us will adopt it too, and then we'll have a regional model, and then we'll have solved the regional housing crisis, because that's the goal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2877.289s">That's</a>  why the bill at the end would give the power to do all of these to all communities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2884.09s">You</a>  know, this isn't even just an issue in Boston and regional, it's an issue in Nantucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2888.131s">It's</a>  an issue in North Hampton. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2889.792s">It's</a>  an issue everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2891.072s">That's</a>  why people from across the state, councils from across the state, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2895.651s">are</a>  putting forward resolutions like this and filing home rule petitions and trying to say, hey, state legislature, we understand that there are certain interests that have a very loud voice and have your ear. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2908.796s">We</a>  think, hey, maybe the people should be the biggest interest on Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2913.418s">So</a>  that's what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2915.799s">And</a>  I understand the position of my fellow Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2919.16s">But</a>  what I just said is my position. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2921.801s">And</a>  I hope everyone will. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2925.639s">vote</a>  for this. <a

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3005.449s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3006.69s">Vice</a>  President Ferris.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3007.57s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3008.69s">I</a>  think this is my third time, so I'll stop here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3010.611s">But</a>  to that exact point, you know, some of these things, you know, one of the big issues was is the fees, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3017.633s">The</a>  upfront fees, first, last broker's fee, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3021.674s">It's</a>  a really high burden and a high bar to pull all that together when you have 30 days or 60 days notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3026.395s">That's</a>  one of the items in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3028.235s">Just</a>  cause eviction protections to provide more time for folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3031.336s">You</a>  know, I'm not saying we're going to get everything in here, but even one of these things would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3037.476s">even</a>  one of these things would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3038.857s">So</a>  that's why there's a list of policy ideas here that we can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3044.16s">And</a>  I'll stop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3045.32s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3129.763s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3131.765s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3132.926s">And</a>  I just wanna echo something that Vice President Bears said. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3135.368s">Again,</a>  not to belabor the point, the discussion tonight is only whether or not to send this to subcommittee to discuss further. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3141.534s">What</a>  if any, hopefully many, in my opinion, I think everybody knows my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3146.893s">home</a>  rule petitions to send to our state delegation in order to say, you know, we need more tools to protect the people who want to stay in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3154.96s">To</a>  echo Vice President Beard's point that he just made, you know, for situations like the ones that we're seeing very recently in our community, any one of these would make a difference in the experience of a person who all of a sudden they have to move out of their home, you know, their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3173.254s">Any</a>  one of these could, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3175.78s">alleviate</a>  that experience of something traumatizing and heartbreaking happening that you didn't know was going to happen and you had no role in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3184.664s">And</a>  I also want to say, you know, in the aftermath, and I know these home rule petitions are not about the specific situation that's going on on Bradley Road, but I know that when, you know, myself and my other Councilors first heard about it, I think I'll assume that we all felt sympathy, you know, felt distraught, felt, you know, my gosh, I can't believe that some of my constituents are going to have to leave <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3205.963s">you</a>  know, not because they wanted to, but because they were forced to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3208.445s">And</a>  I think it's important to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3209.646s">We</a>  heard from our city housing staff just last week that we can expect this exact same situation to happen again very soon at another large apartment building that was also recently sold elsewhere in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3220.934s">And</a>  so I just, you know, as perspective for why I feel very passionate about this being on the agenda, being able to discuss this further is because, you know, we can feel upset over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3229.88s">We</a>  can feel sympathy for our constituents over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3232.802s">We</a>  can feel heartbroken over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3235.312s">But</a>  yeah, it's not in my theory of change to not try to do everything that we have in our power to do, even if sometimes we're tilting at windmills, what else can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3247.56s">So</a>  I thank my fellow councilors for their consideration, and I hope that this is something that we can discuss further. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3253.144s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3254.225s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3255.146s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3256.912s">I</a>  think I'm my fellow Councilors Councilors Collins and bears have made very strong and very compelling arguments for why we should pass this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3267.694s">And</a>  I believe, you know, I believe you're it's really about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3271.395s">We</a>  we recognize that we're in a place where we aren't, we can't we just can't do as much as we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3280.377s">And</a>  this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3282.297s">One</a>  of the only ways right now that we one of the only paths that we can take forward out of this situation, and it's it's a difficult path. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3290.968s">It's,</a>  and it will require a lot of work, and we have to be prepared to be disappointed, but if we never step forward on this path we. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3300.64s">We</a>  really aren't doing our jobs as city Councilors, we're not really, you know, we won't be advocating for the public we won't be advocating for people who are being who are going to be kicked out of their houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3311.829s">And</a>  I know there's been a lot of focus on rent control, and I, you know, I'm actually someone who. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3318.975s">I</a>  studied economics at a very traditional institution that doesn't look very kindly on certain economic policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3326.957s">But</a>  even from that perspective, there's a lot of research today that shows that perhaps it's not so much about the policy itself, but rather how you construct it that affects whether this policy is positive or negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3340.459s">And</a>  I believe that with time, with effort, with cautious planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3345.68s">our</a>  city council, I have faith in our city council to, you know, create to craft policies that are, you know, that are considerate of different arguments that are considerate of economic forces, and that, you know, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3361.897s">bring</a>  that new one to the to the policy discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3366.039s">I</a>  also want to reiterate Councilor Bears' point that this resolution, at least from how I read it, is not just about rent stabilization or rent control, whatever you might want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3379.025s">This</a>  resolution, you know, lays out many, many different policy suggestions that I think many of us in the city can get behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3388.789s">in</a>  terms of how we can help people who live here and people who are being pushed out of our community from the tenants right to counsel to kind of right to purchase just cause eviction protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3401.781s">These</a>  are all mechanisms that will help that could help people living in our community that don't aren't tied to rent control so I think you know <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3414.207s">there</a>  might be a big kind of discussion about rent control, but this also doesn't, I want to note, this resolution doesn't tie us down to one policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3424.734s">It</a>  merely starts the conversation that we need to move us forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3429.857s">And</a>  this resolution gives us alternative paths too, that we can take as a city that I think there is wide consensus behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3436.461s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3560.028s">We</a>  do not have a director of IT.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3561.591s">We</a>  don't have anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3563.394s">So</a>  what are we going to do with the website? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3565.217s">It</a>  is backup.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3565.737s">It's</a>  backup.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3568.902s">Oh,</a>  it is it came back up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3570.743s">Oh,</a>  just just to clarify and reaffirm the vote tonight is just to send this to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3576.007s">There's</a>  nothing.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3576.847s">Okay,</a>  so there's nothing vital going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3579.249s">And</a>  I you know, I want to be very clear that we all agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3583.611s">I</a>  mean, it is a serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3585.953s">There's</a>  a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3587.854s">But</a>  I think, you know, maybe you can get a large group together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3592.36s">I</a>  mean, everyone wants to do what's right for the people of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3595.665s">Everybody,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3597.207s">There's</a>  no one that doesn't want things to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3599.931s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3603.757s">over</a>  the years, rent control and the things that we're talking about right now just haven't worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3609.963s">Now,</a>  I don't know if that's the way people want to go or that's the decision fine, but I don't know, maybe we think outside of the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3617.151s">Maybe</a>  there's other ways, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3619.153s">But</a>  I'm just concerned because I wasn't sure <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3622.6s">if</a>  this was gonna be, you know, voted on and that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3625.381s">So</a>  that's not gonna happen.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3626.721s">Yeah,</a>  the attendant is essentially to get this to a dedicated space where these conversations can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3632.903s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3634.143s">Even</a>  if we voted on sending a home rule petition tonight, which we're not, the state would still have to take action on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3641.685s">So</a>  we are about a million steps away from changing policy.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3854.111s">At</a>  that point, the competition and I think it's important to point out, you know, we're having a very heated debate on an issue that's before us this evening, but there have been other housing related initiatives that have been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3863.597s">And</a>  one of those was the creation of the affordable housing trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3866.559s">And</a>  that's something I think we're all on the same page with right we want to create an affordable housing trust fund where we can <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3872.928s">create</a>  units here in this community that are affordable to create that competition to drive the cost down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3878.23s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3878.39s">So</a>  that's something we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3879.791s">We</a>  actually have a piece of paper that's been drafted by the administration that we're working on with the administration to bring through the legislative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3887.974s">And</a>  that's something that I think we'll see benefits from because when you look at the taxes that you referred to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3893.113s">We</a>  also have the Community Preservation Act and part of the CPA is the ability to generate 10% of those funds that we take it from the CPA, which is 1.5% of the total tax roll on and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3905.275s">10%</a>  of that goes into the affordable housing bucket for the creation of affordable housing, the retention of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3910.856s">So</a>  that gives us an opportunity to begin to start creating units and then hopefully creating competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3917.698s">Unfortunately,</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3920.531s">6,000</a>  units wish I had something like that according to the, to the governor's MBTA MBTA community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3931.038s">document</a>  the municipal modernization bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3933.3s">Um,</a>  so, you know, it's going to take a lot of work for us to, to be where we need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3938.123s">Um,</a>  but I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3938.924s">I</a>  think that, you know, competition is really the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3941.105s">Uh,</a>  a lot of the times creation of units is what's necessary, how we create these units and where we create these units is late. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3946.389s">Therein</a>  lies the rub, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3947.41s">We</a>  don't want skyscrapers all over Mr. Gaff, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3950.612s">We</a>  want to keep the fabric of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3953.874s">And</a>  at the same time also maintain the level of services that we're providing people, which <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3958.041s">isn't</a>  great right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3958.982s">And</a>  if we have skyscrapers, all of them is to have, I can just imagine the level of services that we're going to get with that influx of people, the traffic and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3966.366s">Um,</a>  so I certainly understand me a comment and that was my concern as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3970.629s">I</a>  feel like some of the stuff is really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3972.69s">The</a>  person that owns our two or three family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3974.99s">might</a>  have been in the family for three generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3976.891s">And</a>  now the children have moved away, but they've inherited the home and they've used it as an income property. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3982.533s">And</a>  it's something that the family's worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3985.974s">There's</a>  also the question of the transfer tax that's been discussed and how you fund these affordable housing funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3990.695s">And</a>  the fair share amendment has a transfer tax component to it as well, where you could buy the worst house on the street and live there for 30 years, pull permits every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3998.565s">get</a>  all the work done in the street to make it the nicest house on the street, you're paying an assessment every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4002.609s">And</a>  then when you go to sell the house, you have to pay another fee or an assessment to create affordable housing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4006.692s">So</a>  there are gonna be trade-offs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4008.353s">And</a>  the biggest question is always, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4010.195s">What's</a>  the biggest question in everybody's life, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4012.057s">How</a>  are we gonna pay for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4013.398s">How</a>  are we gonna pay for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4015.239s">That's</a>  where we are right now.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4016.22s">How</a>  are we gonna pay for that?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4017.581s">But</a>  I agree, I think competition is the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4019.743s">And</a>  I thank you for your comments because I think we share a lot of the same concerns.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4022.926s">The</a>  point about competition <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4025.759s">if</a>  we had a competitive market, then like we have a free market right now except for construction of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4034.045s">So</a>  well supply and demand, we massively constrict supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4037.588s">So</a>  unless we want to talk about like the fundamental issue here is that the cost of housing is too high. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4043.112s">That</a>  means for some people <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4045.093s">They</a>  have a windfall of they've owned this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4048.195s">Maybe</a>  they bought it 50 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4049.275s">Maybe</a>  they inherited whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4050.676s">And</a>  it's of a benefit to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4051.997s">And</a>  I don't begrudge that whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4055.319s">But</a>  it means that for other people, it's completely inaccessible and they're never going to be able to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4060.582s">Now,</a>  if we want to talk about a fully free market solution to addressing the balance of supply and demand, to address the cost of housing, to make it reasonable for everybody, let's build 6,000 new units in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4072.12s">Can</a>  you find one person in this I can find one I know one person who comes to these meetings regularly will be completely fine if we build 6000 units in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4079.643s">I</a>  think that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4081.964s">So</a>  that's the one answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4083.405s">The</a>  other answer if you want to talk about addressing the cost of housing is limiting the growth of the cost of housing, using the powers of the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4091.069s">Those</a>  are the options before us, I personally believe we should find a fair balance all of this, you know, just because there's an idea of a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4099.096s">It</a>  says right here, exemptions for small owner occupant landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4101.899s">I'm</a>  willing to discuss exemptions for people who maybe own a second home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4105.202s">I'm</a>  not saying it has to be everyone gets the right to purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4107.624s">I'm</a>  saying it's a potential tool that we should look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4111.327s">That's</a>  the intent here, that all of these are potential tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4113.669s">If</a>  you look at economic studies about rent stabilization, about all of these tools, there are places that make this work really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4120.187s">where</a>  property owners can make a reasonable return, where renters have a level of stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4125.75s">I</a>  mean, you know, the fundamental housing stability tool in the American housing market is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4132.773s">The</a>  30-year fixed rate mortgage is a creation of the federal government that no reasonable <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4139.188s">financial</a>  institution would ever authorize, except for the backing of the federal government and the idea that it's fundamentally a way to say that a regular person with an average income should have the ability to know that what their housing payment is going to be next month, next year, 15 years, 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4155.697s">So</a>  we can say to a homeowner, here you go, 30 years, you know exactly how much your rent's going to be every month, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4162.36s">But</a>  if you're a tenant and you can't afford a mortgage or you can't get a mortgage or that's not the option, well, here's a 15% increase, or here's a 30% increase, or it's going to be about supply and demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4171.803s">So</a>  it's fundamentally about fairness. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4173.604s">I'm</a>  not saying we should have a 1% rent control and everyone gets a right to purchase everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4180.167s">And</a>  if you don't have, you know, if you're not burning the house down, you shouldn't get evicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4185.148s">And,</a>  you know, price gouging means a single rent increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4187.409s">I'm</a>  not saying any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4188.75s">I'm</a>  just saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4190.788s">The</a>  tools have been stripped away from us as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4193.194s">We</a>  should have the option to look at a broad range of policies that address supply and that address things reasonably. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4199.995s">It's</a>  going to be a big discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4201.276s">Mr.</a>  Petrell is right that having these discussions, there's going to be hundreds of people coming down here to want to have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4206.881s">It</a>  should be an open process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4208.942s">I</a>  personally believe the state should leave it up to us to make these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4212.185s">They've</a>  decided not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4213.786s">We've</a>  been debating this for a while when fundamentally it's here's a bunch of ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4218.07s">Let's</a>  go talk about them more. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4219.971s">That's</a>  the end of the end of the story here.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4224.0s">We</a>  have someone on Zoom who wants to speak as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4227.301s">I</a>  just want to affirm that this is a paper about sending this to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4230.662s">We</a>  could debate economic ideology all night long, into the morning, all through the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4236.744s">I</a>  don't think that is the intent right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4238.185s">I</a>  don't think that's effective for anyone right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4239.965s">Just</a>  a quick question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4241.846s">You</a>  mentioned 30 a fixed rate, so that's your monthly rent every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4249.948s">But</a>  meantime, your taxes go up every year, and your water goes up every year, everything increases every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4256.97s">So</a>  then your rent is going up every year, that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4259.991s">Number</a>  two, you mentioned it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4262.151s">Can</a>  you tell me where it works.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4263.472s">There's</a>  a 1.2 million housing units in New York City where it works very well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4267.353s">New</a>  York City is probably a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4269.753s">We</a>  don't want to become New York City do we.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4272.834s">I</a>  think it's the biggest and most successful and richest city in the history of the world.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4277.633s">At</a>  this point, I don't want to have an argument with you, but New York City doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4282.716s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4283.976s">And</a>  then we do have someone wants to speak on zoom as well.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4548.241s">Sure,</a>  Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4552.324s">First</a>  of all, I'm really sorry to hear about Bradley Street displacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4557.767s">I</a>  feel for those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4559.869s">I</a>  think 30 days is not a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4563.011s">But</a>  I'm here as a small property owner who has been extremely lucky to have very good tenants and I treat them very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4572.997s">To</a>  respond to you, to respond to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4577.415s">the</a>  mortgage payment for individuals, you didn't take into account the maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4583.518s">I</a>  had to replace a roof that costs $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4587.039s">So</a>  my mortgage payment does not stay the same for the next 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4591.942s">Insurance</a>  goes up, taxes go up, water bills go up, everything goes up, and including the maintenance of that home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4598.465s">So</a>  we're providing a service to these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4601.746s">Second</a>  of all, I always hear when there's a housing crisis, it always goes immediately to the rent to the owners who rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4609.351s">There's</a>  no discussion at all about zoning or other other opportunities to help people actually become homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4615.815s">The</a>  only reason I became a homeowner is because I was able to buy a multifamily home and have rent help subsidize my mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4623.62s">Instead,</a>  we are selling these two-family, multi-family homes to these developers who are turning these two-family homes into $1.2 million condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4634.678s">What</a>  are you doing about the zoning instead? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4638.061s">Instead</a>  of hurting small property owners, I provide a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4641.183s">My</a>  rent is comparable and is cheaper than these units. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4645.707s">What</a>  are you doing to help people buy these units instead of having these developers come in and redo them and selling them for $1.2 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4653.993s">The</a>  house on the corner of Webster Street, that single family house that was sold and subdivided, that house just sold for $1.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4663.717s">It's</a>  really, there needs to be zoning laws changed here to help these people become actual homeowners and help people become small property owners to offer rentals that are reasonable to these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4675.046s">We're</a>  actually good for the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4677.749s">We're</a>  good, not for the environment, but good for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4680.691s">So</a>  it always goes to the rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4682.753s">And</a>  then you want to cap rent, but I don't ever hear anyone capping the sale of a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4687.697s">I</a>  mean, no one ever caps the sale of a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4694.081s">If</a>  you want this government power, why don't you put a cap on the sale of the hall?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4697.884s">I'd</a>  be happy to add it to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4700.266s">And</a>  condo conversion, I'd be happy to add it to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4702.487s">The</a>  state doesn't let us do any of those things right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4704.629s">That's</a>  what this discussion is about.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4877.283s">Yes,</a>  six in front of one absent the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4879.925s">So</a>  this is an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4882.126s">The</a>  idea behind the ordinance was originally presented to the council in February of 2020 by some CCSR students who had grave concerns about the impact of polystyrene, both as it's listed here on harm to aquatic life, pollution of waterways, human health risks from the leaching of chemicals when hot foods are placed in these items, as well as when these <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4902.078s">items</a>  end up in waterways and then limited recycling options for these types of containers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4907.859s">This</a>  would apply to prepared food, so it would apply to restaurants, it would apply to schools, it would apply to larger grocery stores that offer prepared foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4916.941s">There</a>  is a number of, the ban would be, if voted in favor, the ban would <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4924.486s">be</a>  enforced by the health department upon their yearly inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4928.567s">And</a>  if it passed, it would be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4931.868s">I</a>  wanna find the exact language for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4936.629s">It</a>  would be the ordinance to become effective on July 1st, 2023, or a date that is 180 days from the date that the mayor approves this ordinance or otherwise becomes effective, whichever is later. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4948.412s">There</a>  is also the opportunity for businesses to defer <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4954.635s">for</a>  up to a year period, citing undue hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4959.85s">And</a>  there is a number of reasons what undue hardship means. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4963.332s">So</a>  that would be circumstances or situations unique to a particular retail establishment, such as there is no reasonable alternatives to disposable food containers that are not made of polystyrene. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4972.597s">Circumstances</a>  or situations unique to the retail establishment such that compliance with requirements of this chapter would deprive a person of a legally protected right or circumstances where a retail establishment requires additional time in order to draw down the existing inventory of disposable food containers made of polystyrene. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4990.846s">I</a>  believe that covers the main points. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4995.207s">If</a>  there's any discussion, or it seems like I may have missed something. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4998.168s">Vice</a>  President Bales.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4998.888s">Oh,</a>  no, just to add that they can apply for deferments beyond one year as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5004.05s">Yes,</a>  deferments can be applied for beyond one year, and then also just going to the penalties and fines for violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5010.212s">The</a>  ordinance shall be enforced by the health department or its designees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5013.153s">Whoever</a>  violates any provision of this ordinance may be penalized by a non-criminal disposition process as <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5020.015s">provided</a>  in general laws chapter 40 section 21 D. If non criminal disposition is elected than any person who violates any provision of this bylaw shall be subject to the following penalties. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5029.038s">First</a>  offense a written warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5030.959s">Second</a>  offense $100 third offense $200 and the fourth and subsequent offense $300. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5038.942s">Is</a>  there any discussion?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5040.462s">Madam</a>  President, I will not be supporting this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5044.604s">I</a>  have <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5045.983s">A</a>  number of concerns, ultimately, for the last three years, small businesses have been under relatively stringent regulation and oversight I think that we need to let them breathe a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5059.179s">This</a>  proposal may have a significant impact on two of the larger employers here in this community, Bianchi Foods and Monogram Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5067.447s">Both</a>  of those individual employers we've entered into tax deferred agreements with. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5071.792s">Both</a>  of those are large scale food processing plants that do, I believe, use this type of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5079.01s">Monogram</a>  foods is also in the process, I believe, of undergoing an evaluation to determine whether or not they're going to be subject to our solar ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5087.113s">So</a>  I think that these regulatory changes that we're making right now are not at the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5094.175s">We</a>  need to let our small businesses breathe and we might be making a decision that's going to have a large residual effect on two of our largest employers here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5103.518s">So</a>  for those two reasons, I will not be <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5105.488s">voting</a>  for this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5106.549s">I</a>  also have questions and concerns as to whether why we're focusing ourselves such a narrow scope of just food service establishments, polystyrene juice and a number of other areas as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5116.376s">For</a>  example, packing materials, styrofoam coolers, we've all, we all know what a styrofoam cooler is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5122.901s">We've</a>  seen them everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5124.382s">So,</a>  you know, I think that, well, it's a good, a good how to measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5130.287s">I</a>  don't think that it's appropriate for our community at this time.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5134.093s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5135.414s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5135.854s">Councilor</a>  Knight brings up some good points, and I won't reiterate them, but I think that there's two very important issues that I received some feedback from. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5146.398s">One</a>  being the restaurant owners coming off the pandemic right now, even waiting until 2023 to kick this off, it's still something that they're <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5159.814s">little</a>  setback and still under the pandemic effects of their financial restraints and that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5171.31s">Second,</a>  I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5175.698s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5175.898s">Hunt</a>  did a wonderful job presenting and doing the best she could, but after the meeting, I got feedback that I note that she mentioned that only a handful of restaurants returned the surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5187.847s">I</a>  was notified by about four that were watching the meeting that said they would never even were approached or had any knowledge of a survey that would help us make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5203.525s">as</a>  well as what Councilor Knight brings forth, I think it's enough for me to just slow down and try to revisit this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5213.094s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5214.575s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Powell.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5215.936s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5217.497s">I</a>  just wanted to quickly make a point for if it's relevant to Councilor Knight's first point that, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think during our discussion and committee of the whole, we established that this would only pertain to establishments serving prepared food. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5232.698s">you</a>  know, food for immediate consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5234.539s">So</a>  it's my impression, I remember we brought this up because we brought up supermarkets in Medford, Wegmans, you know, wanting to make sure that this wouldn't disrupt very large scale supply chains in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5245.823s">And</a>  so it's my impression that this would, you know, I understand that the effects on <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5251.189s">restaurants</a>  and smaller businesses are extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5253.811s">And</a>  that's why we voted to make an implementation date of July, 2023 with implementation, you know, a year out from that date, but on the point of it affecting these larger retailers, it's my impression that it simply wouldn't apply because they don't, they don't serve prepared food.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5272.306s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5273.287s">The</a>  prepared food definition, that is the intention as outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5281.404s">the,</a>  it was concerned about the prepared food that in the committee of the whole, the discussion was that it would be food that was prepared for immediate consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5290.069s">So</a>  the thought that the two large employers would not be impacted because they do not prepare food for immediate consumption.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5306.779s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5310.782s">As</a>  we discussed in the several meetings, the authority that allows us to implement this regulation stems from the public health dangers of preparing, essentially putting hot food on styrofoam. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5327.951s">So</a>  that's both why it would not impact those two businesses and why the scope is so limited, as you noted.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5337.296s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5412.987s">The</a>  concerns of lack of afterschool programming in our Medford public schools and asking us for some assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5424.205s">I've,</a>  um, this is my, my, my profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5428.489s">And</a>  I think there's some viable solutions that we can discuss working as a partnership with the, uh, public and, uh, the municipal and the school department as a partnership and working together and creating a revolving account that would <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5447.034s">put</a>  a safe and prosperous program for any of our students that are in need of after-school programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5457.064s">I've</a>  heard a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of people, and we have some locations that take care of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5468.313s">excuse</a>  me, low income through vouchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5470.974s">And</a>  we have the residents that can pay high fees to that can pay for an after school program, but they're still not reaching all <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5483.458s">of</a>  those groups, and then there's a group in the middle that's being left out because they do fall in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5491.387s">So</a>  there is a process that I'm hoping that if we can amend this, that we would invite all the parents that have reached out to our <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5503.562s">I'd</a>  like to call for, I know we've asked for a subcommittee meeting, but in the near future to set up a subcommittee meeting for the recreation youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5511.067s">And</a>  if we can meet with the recreation department, someone from the mayor's office, a representative from the school department, if we can, and maybe sit down and put a plan together that we can put a program that would house <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5530.683s">the</a>  needs of our community until, which is the big issue, until we find a recreation facility that other communities have that are fulfilling these needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5541.75s">So</a>  if you would indulge me, I appreciate that, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5554.45s">I'm,</a>  I'm someone who, who really benefited benefited from after school programming here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5561.777s">Um,</a>  you know, my parents they needed, they needed somewhere for me to be while they were working. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5567.843s">And</a>  so, having after school programming was very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5573.628s">and</a>  important to welcoming me into, you know, into the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5580.65s">I</a>  know a lot of parents have raised this issue with Councilors and with members of the school with the city administration in the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5591.094s">I</a>  think it's, you know, it's certainly a difficult issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5594.235s">I</a>  think there are steps that we might be able to take <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5598.916s">relatively</a>  soon, but a larger systemic answer to this challenge will take, you know, will take a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5605.999s">But</a>  this is something I think I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing to the table because I do think we should be starting the conversation about how we can increase after school programming both in the short and long runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5621.505s">I</a>  think it could be good to also invite people who work, who organize and who work in <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5628.568s">current</a>  existing after school programs to hear about, you know, the challenges that they're facing in terms of staffing in terms of running their programs and increasing occupancy numbers to hear about for us to as a city council and as a city government to have a better understanding of what exactly are the challenges we need to overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5651.02s">But</a>  I'd be happy to support this resolution and to second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5655.282s">to</a>  move it forward and to have us talk a little to have us talk more about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5660.225s">Um,</a>  yeah, I also think it'd be worth it to to look. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5666.19s">to</a>  look at some of some of the proposals that have been before the city council in the past I know, Councilor Marks was a big proponent of having an art center. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5675.66s">And</a>  that might be one possible step forward for us as well but I think as many ideas as we can get to the table as many concrete problems that we can identify a solution for, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5688.453s">I</a>  think those are the right steps that we need to be taking as a city and I applaud Councilor Scarpelli for putting us on the right track.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5705.884s">Certainly,</a>  this is a major issue for families and we've been hearing a lot about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5712.028s">You</a>  know, I do know that <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5714.216s">The</a>  team that runs Medford after school right now has, has looked at other communities that looked at Medford and we have at the Brooks school the biggest single school after school program in the whole state right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5728.072s">We</a>  have incredibly high demand on all of the elementary school after school programs that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5734.877s">even</a>  out of comparison to other communities that are similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5738.0s">So</a>  there are some Medford specific problems here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5742.604s">And</a>  I think that's a good time for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5745.626s">Again,</a>  I support this effort, any effort to try to address this, but it does seem like the big issues are the staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5751.992s">It's</a>  just difficult to find people for the two to 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5754.354s">shift.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5754.994s">So</a>  that may be finding an alternative there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5759.457s">You</a>  know, obviously that would require some significant systemic change with how the public school system works. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5763.959s">And</a>  then the space question you say well we have these schools, how can we not have space. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5767.62s">And,</a>  you know, it's really that these programs are limited to the existing shared spaces in the buildings like libraries gymnasiums and cafeterias so, you know, re looking at that would also be a significant change for everybody if we were to move into spaces that usually aren't used for programs like this, you know, that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5783.347s">there</a>  could be disruptions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5784.489s">And</a>  I'm not saying these as barriers, I'm just saying that these are the things we need to get over. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5789.217s">But</a>  I certainly am never gonna vote against trying, so I support this, support having a subcommittee and seeing what we can do on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5797.677s">but</a>  obviously in partnership with the Metro Public Schools, which is going to be included as the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5803.942s">And,</a>  you know, we can have good ideas, but if it requires money, we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5808.165s">And</a>  if it requires space in the schools, we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5810.607s">So,</a>  you know, it's really going to need to be a partnership of all the branches of government.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5814.87s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5817.592s">So</a>  on the motion of councilor Scarpelli to send this paper to the recreation and youth affairs subcommittee, who did you want to invite? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5824.337s">It's</a>  for the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5826.919s">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5827.379s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5829.445s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5832.887s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5937.452s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5938.473s">In</a>  addition to everything you just said, I think my other intention here, certainly with paper 20-534 in this paper, is to look at the opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5947.358s">This</a>  is a supply side answer to this housing question an area where it's going to be transit oriented and you're going to have that walkability and we have the density. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5955.481s">You</a>  know, you turn a couple two families into three families that's a big, big change it's big change and we'd have to talk about it but if you're point one miles from a train station, maybe that makes sense in this modern age so you know, well, I'm sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5970.219s">I</a>  will forever be the boogeyman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5973.36s">I</a>  support solutions of all stripes to address the problems that we face, and I think this is one of them.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6263.497s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Barros. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6264.357s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6265.738s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6269.04s">As</a>  somebody with one marathon under my belt, albeit not very fast and not in Boston, unfortunately, maybe one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6275.083s">I</a>  just want to salute all of the runners. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6277.505s">I</a>  hope you have a great day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6279.726s">And</a>  I hope that everybody has a wonderful Patriots Day wherever it finds them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6285.189s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6344.203s">Just</a>  this past week, a lot was going on in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6348.927s">We</a>  had a police officer rescue someone from drowning in the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6353.911s">We</a>  had a severe shooting down at the courthouse on Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6359.236s">And</a>  we had a very significant car crash where a motor vehicle actually burst into flames and crashed into a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6365.22s">Last</a>  week was also EMS dispatch week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6368.868s">Madam</a>  President, I think it's very important that we point out the work of our first responders and the work that they're doing here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6375.052s">Not</a>  just our EMS dispatchers, but also those that EMS dispatches out, which would be our ambulance providers, our fire department, our DPW, and our police. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6383.217s">I</a>  think they're doing an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6384.976s">And</a>  as we look at the news and we see what's going on around the world as it becomes, as the restrictions are lifted slowly, we're seeing a lot more gun violence in neighboring communities, a lot more knife violence in neighboring communities, a lot more car accidents going on because people for the last couple of years have been spoiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6404.586s">They've</a>  not been on the roads driving around. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6407.167s">And</a>  then obviously we all know the issues that people have with mental health these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6410.989s">So</a>  with that being said, I think it's very important that we recognize the work <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6413.887s">that</a>  our friends down at the police department and the fire department do in dispatching out the necessary EMS providers to be sure that we're all safe in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6422.132s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd just like to offer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6424.853s">I'm</a>  not on the formal resolution, but just as a thank you in this recognition of dispatch week.</p>
