    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=224.26s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=225.941s">Any</a>  of us that have gone through Medford High over the past, I guess, what looks like 50 years will be very familiar with Bill Mazzacca. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=231.866s">He</a>  was a security officer there for the last 47 and a half years where we went to school every day during rain, snow, sleet, and hail to protect the children in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=242.614s">But</a>  he's always been a great individual, a great public servant, and someone that I've always respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=247.217s">It</a>  was very <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=248.618s">interesting</a>  when I brought my son up to kids corner for daycare, and I sat there and my son said, Oh, I was talking to Mr. Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=256.364s">And</a>  I look over and there's Bill Mosaic, who was Mr. Bill, when I was a student at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=261.667s">But</a>  he's just a gentleman who's dedicated his whole life to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=264.93s">Someone</a>  who's done great good for the students in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=267.952s">And</a>  he's someone that deserves a little bit of recognition for the hard work that he put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=271.134s">He's</a>  someone that was always behind the scenes a man of not many words, but great action. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=275.137s">He's</a>  someone that the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=276.905s">should</a>  be very thankful that they had the opportunity to have for 47 and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=280.468s">So</a>  with that being said, Madam President, I'm asking my colleagues to join me in extending some congratulatory notes to Mr. Mazeka in the momentous occasion of his retirement.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=289.741s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, and I apologize for the mispronunciation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=291.984s">I</a>  wasn't privileged to have him. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=293.787s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=294.948s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=295.769s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=299.394s">True</a>  words couldn't be spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=301.197s">Mr.</a>  Mosaic is a true gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=303.96s">When</a>  you're talking about the last of <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=307.517s">The</a>  old guard that I remember in high school where there was a team of maybe six security guards that roam the vast hallways of Medford High School keeping the peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=320.202s">As</a>  time went on, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=322.862s">Mr.</a>  Mosaica became the total opposite of what you think a security guard was. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=328.066s">He</a>  was a person that kids could speak to, a person that when you needed a strong arm, he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=336.192s">When</a>  you needed an ear to talk to, he gave it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=341.275s">And</a>  I think every kid that walks the halls at Medford High School, love and respect Mr. Mosaica. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=347.8s">He</a>  is truly a gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=351.002s">It</a>  was, I don't think I've ever heard a negative word said about Mr. Mosaic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=355.949s">And</a>  it is a contentious job, you know, at times you have to be the heavy in the school, where it's a suspension or removal of a student or, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=367.989s">or</a>  a faculty member, Mr. Mosaic was the person that had to be that heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=372.89s">And</a>  he was always there with respect and kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=377.791s">And</a>  I'm glad that he's retiring and I wish him well and his family well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=383.633s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President, for giving me the moment.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=386.274s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=389.412s">I</a>  also had the privilege of getting to know Mr. Nzeka back in my four years at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=396.92s">He</a>  was a loved member of our school community, and to be able to congratulate him on such a momentous occasion is truly a privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=408.314s">I</a>  think all of us have specific memories of, you know, just seeing him welcoming us into the high school every day, seeing him walk around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=416.198s">You</a>  know, he was someone who really built trust with all of our students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=420.981s">So</a>  I'm very grateful for his service to our city, and I wish him the best in his retirement.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=430.406s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tsai. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=432.547s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=435.769s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=442.986s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=443.948s">Yes,</a>  that's a Caribbean. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=445.632s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=445.812s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=454.238s">President</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=454.978s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=456.019s">So</a>  I mean the firm is here in the negative the motion passes to two dash 306 offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins be it so resolved that the Metro City Council by the Medford City Council that we support the proposed fair share amendment that would create an additional tax of four percentage points on annual income above $1 million and dedicate the funds raised by this tax to quality public education <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=479.145s">affordable</a>  public colleges and universities, and for the repair and maintenance of roads, bridges, and public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=485.326s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=486.486s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=488.887s">The</a>  fair share amendment has been a major topic of conversation in Massachusetts for nearly a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=497.288s">I</a>  think too often it is used as an excuse for the state not to fund schools, fund colleges, and fund roads now because we'll do it when the fair share amendment happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=507.168s">Luckily</a>  enough, we are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=508.348s">The</a>  fair share amendment is on the ballot for the November 2022 election. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=513.79s">This</a>  would raise funds for the state that would go towards public education, public colleges and universities and our transit and roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=521.713s">I</a>  think all of us know how deeply needed these funds are for municipalities like Medford and the campaign to support this amendment when it's on the ballot in November is currently <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=535.321s">soliciting</a>  the support of city councils across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=538.686s">I</a>  would like to add our voice to that chorus of city councils, and I would move approval on this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=548.286s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=549.987s">I</a>  just want to echo Vice President Bears's sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=554.088s">I'm</a>  so excited for the fair share amendment to finally be on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=558.65s">You</a>  know, and I think looking at this through the lens of how this would affect the city like Medford, you know, is the perspective that I, you know, that I hope my fellow Councilors and, you know, really every resident and voter in Medford beyond to take into account, you know, public education, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=575.198s">public</a>  higher education, roads, infrastructure, hopefully climate change resiliency, you know, these are areas where we need <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=584.606s">new</a>  revenue sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=587.547s">We</a>  can't do the things that we need to be the kind of community that we want to be, to live in the kind of community that we want to live in, without revenues for these incredibly important projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=598.352s">And,</a>  you know, the source is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=600.172s">When</a>  there's so much need spread throughout our communities, you know, we need to shift from a model of wealth hoarding to a model of making sure that we bring up the baseline for the parts of our communities that are <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=612.037s">in</a>  most need of investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=613.418s">So</a>  I thank Vice President Bears for his advocacy of this, and I'll be excited to vote in support and then vote in support in November as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=621.841s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=622.722s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=623.542s">Any</a>  further discussion from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=627.223s">Moving</a>  on to the public, I'm going to return to you, Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=632.025s">We</a>  do have, you already have the name and address or address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=635.467s">You</a>  just state your name again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=636.487s">We</a>  already have your address and then go right ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=638.787s">Yes,</a>  Laura Panette. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=640.708s">Thank</a>  you very much for the opportunity to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=644.45s">As</a>  was just stated, there are several reasons, there are a number of reasons to be in favor of the fair share amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=651.173s">I'm</a>  here speaking both as the parent of a graduate of Medford Public Schools, and also as a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=662.88s">And</a>  I'm looking at the benefits both for our K-12 schools in Massachusetts and also for public higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=671.706s">I</a>  want to point to the extreme need for additional staffing in K-12 schools, not only regular classroom teachers, but also ESPs, the valuable support personnel in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=691.328s">to</a>  support every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=693.51s">It's</a>  a long time since our public schools had librarians or music teachers who were in the building for more than a few minutes a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=704.179s">College</a>  Councilors are a wide variety of support staff who are badly needed by the children of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=713.647s">As</a>  a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=718.253s">I'm</a>  privileged to work with many students who are first generation in their families to be in higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=725.395s">They</a>  don't come from settings where their parents know all about how to get into college or how to succeed once they get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=733.896s">They</a>  also need and deserve extra support services. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=738.758s">And</a>  this is again, part of what the fair share amendment could contribute <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=746.02s">in</a>  terms of supporting the aspirations of the next generation of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=752.124s">And</a>  I'd also like to point to the physical plant, both in K-12 schools and in higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=759.91s">Many</a>  school buildings are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=761.952s">We've</a>  seen, especially during the pandemic, the critical problems with inadequate ventilation, not enough fresh air coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=772.429s">not</a>  enough ability to filter air and prevent transmission of the COVID virus or other transmissible diseases. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=784.333s">There</a>  are buildings that have mold and even mushrooms growing in them because of the extreme lack of adequate ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=796.237s">So</a>  there's a wide range of needs that have been put off for a long time in being dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=803.62s">Thank</a>  you very much for your attention.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=807.901s">Thank</a>  you, Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=808.842s">Any</a>  further discussion from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=813.763s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=818.202s">forestry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=819.863s">This</a>  is the I'm not familiar with the Fair Share Amendment Act, but so I have a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=825.406s">How</a>  is the money being managed and diverted to the cities and towns? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=831.03s">Once</a>  this once this money is collected, if this gets approved at a state level, and people are taxed 4% that money then goes into a state must mean some state account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=841.577s">So</a>  how, how is it diverted to the cities and towns?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=847.213s">Madam</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=848.755s">So,</a>  this would only apply to income over $1 million so any income you make under $1 million would not be subject to the time I understand that that wasn't my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=857.568s">We</a>  said people would be taxed 4% of only be people's income over $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=862.635s">And</a>  it's obviously subject to the appropriation by the state legislature, but generally, you know, one of the biggest expenditures in the state legislature is Chapter 70, which is the multi-billion dollar fund that diverts state aid to local schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=876.382s">Chapter</a>  90 is a similar program which diverts state funding to roads, bridges, municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=882.424s">So</a>  increases in those amounts for Chapter 70 or Chapter 90 would come through the existing formula to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=890.508s">And</a>  additionally, they could, you know, earmark for specific projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=894.309s">For</a>  example, the West Medford commuter rail upgrade station upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=898.069s">That</a>  could be one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=899.45s">I</a>  mean, it obviously would be subject to the appropriation by the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=903.65s">But</a>  the way the ballot question is written, the money has to be spent on public education, public higher education and transit and roads.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=911.312s">So</a>  we don't know, though, how much money would actually be coming to the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=914.472s">Oh,</a>  that not at this point, but more.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=919.352s">more</a>  than the 1.9 billion money that was as we get in any. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=924.214s">So,</a>  that's including the SSR money that already that we're getting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=927.955s">This</a>  is not in relation to the SSR or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=932.336s">No,</a>  I know it's not related but we are getting funds from those, those other places right, I believe, the city's allocation from ARPA was about $50 million in one time funds spread out over five years.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=943.02s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1026.217s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1027.879s">This</a>  is a resolution requesting that we support <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1032.63s">statewide</a>  commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1037.733s">Community</a>  leaders in Medford's Haitian community have reached out regarding this item, and the intent of this commission would be to look at a number of issues facing Haitian communities across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1047.898s">We</a>  have one of the largest Haitian American communities in the whole country here in Massachusetts, and as many people know, there are a number of issues <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1056.762s">We've</a>  discussed previously this term that affect the Haitian community when it comes to immigration, federal, state policy, and this commission would be a voice for members of the Haitian community across the state to issue reports and request action by our state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1073.772s">And</a>  I would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1084.086s">Um,</a>  this is in line with the values of our city as a welcoming, inclusive place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1087.768s">I</a>  think this is, um, you know, this resolution is something that reflects who we are as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1094.091s">Um,</a>  and the support that we all, um, we all want to show for our Haitian neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1100.295s">Um,</a>  this is in line with what we've passed as a city council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1103.036s">And</a>  I think, um, Councilor, uh, bears for putting this on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1108.179s">And</a>  I second his motion.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1110.04s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1112.381s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1114.133s">Any</a>  discussion from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1115.734s">Councilor</a>  Naik.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1117.635s">I</a>  certainly understand that the city of Medford has a very strong Haitian population. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1122.258s">Growing</a>  up in this community, I've gone to school and come friends with a number of people that are from Haitian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1128.201s">And</a>  I certainly have no problem with a commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent that's being created by the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1137.746s">But</a>  I've said it before, I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1139.087s">I'm</a>  not putting my name on a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1141.375s">going</a>  to speak of Mariano or Senate Spelker, unless it's us asking for money for the city, because pretty soon they're going to become tone deaf to the wants and desires of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1152.643s">Um,</a>  so for that reason, I'll be voting against this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1155.385s">Um,</a>  I certainly support the piece of legislation as a private citizen, but as a member of this body, I don't feel as though it's good practice for us to continue to put our noses into what's going on with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1164.752s">Um,</a>  I haven't never gotten a letter from a state delegation telling us to vote a certain way in a resolution that's before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1170.882s">If</a>  we want our delegation to come down and present to us and talk to us about some of these pieces of legislation, I think that might be a little bit more productive because, well, Council of Business is pretty well-versed in a lot of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1180.724s">I</a>  don't think all of us are. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1182.945s">And</a>  I think a lot of us would be a little bit more comfortable if maybe we had members of our delegation come down and talk to us, tell us what this bill does and why they're in favor of it or why they're opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1192.127s">And</a>  then the council can make a determination as to whether or not we want to encourage our delegation, the people that represent us on Beacon Hill, to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1199.969s">So</a>  with that being said, I thank the council for bringing the measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1202.37s">And</a>  I also thank him for being so up to date and involved in the goings on at Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1207.632s">However,</a>  my focus here is in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1209.352s">And</a>  I think that this council really needs to take a look at what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1215.514s">And</a>  if we're going to Beacon Hill, well, one thing we need more than anything is money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1218.395s">So</a>  that's what I think we should be asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1220.035s">But</a>  I thank the council for the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1222.229s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1226.453s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Biazzi. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1227.974s">This</a>  is, I know that you do your due diligence, but again, I've represented myself in the same fashion Councilor Knight has spoken, so it would not be legal to point, but I will not support this paper for those facts as well, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1338.913s">While</a>  it may not be within the walls of Medford, it certainly will affect our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1343.956s">And</a>  this item is about a project that's currently undergoing review, mostly in Arlington, but it will connect a piece of Medford, the bridge between the two rotaries on High Street Route 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1360.044s">And</a>  there are a couple of different routes currently being explored, but it would connect essentially that area of the Mystic River to the Minuteman <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1367.385s">bikeway</a>  in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1370.506s">And</a>  there's a essentially if you go to the survey tiny url.com slash mystic to bikeway survey to you can look at a set of plans that are currently proposed it would, I think, personally as someone who has driven through these rotaries and then walked near these rotaries relatively frequently significantly improve traffic safety in that area for all modes of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1394.15s">which</a>  is kind of why I put it on I think that's a great benefit for the city of Medford in and of itself, but it will also connect the mystic pathways to the Arlington Minuteman bikeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1405.173s">So,</a>  I would love the city administration to let residents know that this project is happening I didn't hear about it from Medford I heard about it from. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1414.316s">I</a>  think a different group I'd actually can't remember quite right now, but also that residents can fill out the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1420.231s">where</a>  they can review the plans and let their voice be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1422.594s">Again,</a>  the URL is tinyurl.com slash mystic to bikeway survey number two, the number and then the number two and I would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1436.6s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1438.101s">And</a>  thank you, Vice President Bears, for letting everybody know that this is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1444.105s">For</a>  anybody who's interested in learning more about it, I took the survey myself today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1448.107s">It</a>  took under 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1450.308s">They</a>  have a box to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1451.189s">Are</a>  you a constituent from Arlington? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1452.91s">Are</a>  you a constituent from Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1455.292s">I</a>  think this is a great thing for our community members to weigh in on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1458.313s">It</a>  will affect this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1460.155s">And</a>  even going beyond that, this is the type of project that I hope that our <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1464.725s">city</a>  administration can really look to and be inspired by. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1467.226s">You</a>  know, I think we talk a lot about how much more we could be doing with our riverfront, how much more we want to be doing about traffic calming, pedestrian safety, expanding pedestrian and bike access along our beautiful scenic waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1481.551s">So</a>  I'm excited to see how this is spearheaded by the community of Arlington, how it affects our community positively. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1487.633s">and</a>  I really hope that we can see projects like this unfolding along the, you know, the riverfront that we control here in Medford as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1495.054s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1495.994s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1496.895s">Councilor</a>  Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1500.195s">I</a>  believe that as a community, if we want to see something change, we need to show up at the table, and I think this is one of the ways we can show up and have our voice be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1508.817s">You</a>  know, knocking on doors through the last campaign season, something I heard from a lot of families was, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1517.585s">was</a>  the desire for us to have a grand scheme of bike, a network of bikes, bike lanes that kind of connected better to other cities and that was better integrated in our, that was better integrated in our own community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1533.937s">I</a>  think this is, taking surveys like this is one of the most important ways through which our community, our constituents, our residents can <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1544.522s">make</a>  our voices heard and to make sure that, you know, that grant money so that some of that grant money does come to Medford and that we have that kind of more, that better, better planned out, better thought out bike network that we want to see here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1560.553s">So</a>  I think Councilor Bears, we're putting this on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1566.477s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1567.198s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1568.779s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1569.8s">Madam</a>  President, yes, I'll be supporting this measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1572.141s">If</a>  we remember back to the mistake <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1574.981s">River</a>  Watershed Association and the presentation that they made to us several years ago when they were coming to us for some community development block grant funding or CPA funding I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1584.066s">and</a>  they were seeking funds to design a shared use path along the Mystic River down to Shannon Beach and then beyond Shannon Beach down to Wedgman Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1593.492s">I</a>  think that this is a key link to us bringing that project to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1599.015s">It's</a>  gonna allow us to connect the multimodal transportation roadways to the two train stations as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1606.1s">So</a>  that's gonna be something very beneficial to the communities to split the people out of them.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1610.403s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1611.123s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1613.81s">Moving</a>  on to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1615.37s">I</a>  see Mimi Gordon on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1618.451s">Mimi,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1625.273s">I</a>  see a box asking you to unmute when you're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1637.517s">Mimi,</a>  if you're able to unmute, I'll give you another moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1651.354s">While</a>  we wait for Mimi, is there anyone else who would like to speak on this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1657.882s">And</a>  if I could, from the chair, as we wait for Mimi, I mean, this is something that's come before the council in different versions, not exactly the survey, but issues that happen in this area, particularly as you're walking around the beautiful paths along the Mississippi River towards the lakes, you're dumped out into a rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1673.693s">There's</a>  no crosswalk, there's no safe way to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1676.094s">And</a>  if you bike, walk, drive by there any beautiful day, you're seeing people try to scramble across the bridge right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1682.879s">So</a>  hopefully this is something that would address that as far as many other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1688.145s">residents</a>  to take the survey if they can, and I thank Vice President Bears for bringing this to the attention of the council and to residents in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1695.693s">Mimi,</a>  are you able to unmute? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1697.555s">I</a>  do see, okay, so while we wait for Mimi, I see Martha Andres. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1702.62s">Martha,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrus]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1704.622s">Yeah,</a>  Martha Andres, 45 Kilgore Avenue, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1710.371s">I</a>  am excited about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1713.815s">It</a>  was initiated by Arlington, but it does include, I would say a third of the people who showed up for public participation were from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1724.206s">And</a>  we're very excited about having the rotaries at the High Street Bridge dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1732.243s">to</a>  make them safer for driving, safer for pedestrians, safer for bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1737.326s">You</a>  know, this is an area that, especially since the pandemic, everybody wants to be outdoors and walking in a beautiful area along the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1747.311s">And</a>  this is so important to us to make this project happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1752.134s">As</a>  Councilor Knight has pointed out, you know, there's been some interest in improving the path on the other side of the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1760.571s">on</a>  the Medford side and you know hopefully that will follow from this improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1766.875s">Thank</a>  you for bringing it up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1769.957s">Thank</a>  you Martha and we'll maybe we'll try you once more to see if we can get you to unmute and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1775.381s">I</a>  did see you briefly unmuted before but <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1791.575s">Okay,</a>  Mimi, we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1793.957s">If</a>  you have comments, you can send them to the clerk or any of the individual Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1799.241s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1861.463s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1863.384s">Resolution</a>  is relatively self-explanatory, but essentially the land on the riverbank across from Whole Foods, part of it is owned by the city of Menford, part of it is owned by the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1875.328s">There's</a>  currently not a path or sidewalk on that side of the street, which means that people have to cross at the relatively dangerous intersection of Auburn and Route 16 across the Auburn Street Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1886.898s">residents</a>  in the area said that they would really benefit from a connection on this side of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1891.401s">And</a>  I'd love to see if our city administration can reach out to partners in the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1900.028s">I've</a>  reached out to a couple of councillors in the city of Somerville who said that they would be interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1903.811s">So</a>  I'm hopeful that we can build that partnership and make things a little safer and more accessible at that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1911.877s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1915.032s">I</a>  believe that stretch of roadway is DCR controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1919.455s">The</a>  crossing right from Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1922.576s">The</a>  crossing is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1924.057s">I</a>  know Councilor Caraviello is going to run for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1926.899s">I</a>  know that he's been working with them on the guide rails as well with DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1930.901s">So</a>  I think the DCR would have to be involved in doing anything that doesn't cross their road or block their road.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1938.003s">the</a>  crossing would actually be on the Medford-controlled section of Auburn, well, potentially on the Medford-controlled section of Auburn Street, and the land, that bank is owned by the city, it's not by DCR, so we may need to collaborate with them to connect it, but it's mostly out of their jurisdiction, which in this case, I think is a good thing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2072.428s">I'm</a>  happy to go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2075.251s">And</a>  if my fellow councilors would like to sever the votes on the resolve and the further resolve, I'm more than happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2082.98s">You</a>  know, we've been talking about this issue for a while, since I've been on the council, since before I was on the council, of housing, the housing crisis and the issues facing a lot of longtime residents of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2098.245s">We</a>  had some really good work in subcommittee last term, addressing emergency issues around the COVID pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2106.848s">And</a>  I think we did a lot of good work on that as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2112.075s">coming</a>  out of the pandemic or into the latest phase or however we want to countenance it, the housing situation is deteriorating rapidly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2123.664s">We</a>  just had residents in here for the past couple of weeks who are facing displacement from units that they've lived in for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2134.192s">And</a>  the intent seems to be on that, that these long-term residents are being forced out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2140.479s">you</a>  know, just so that we can do a quick renovation and then raise the rents by a certain amount and then bring in a new type of person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2147.524s">The</a>  intent here is that the housing subcommittee look at a variety of options as we discussed last week you know the city's authority here is significantly limited by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2157.47s">So</a>  on a number of items on all of these items discussed we would have to file a home real petition and request action from the state for the city to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2167.502s">I</a>  listed these these different policy items I personally support all of them I understand that if the council may support some of them and not others so I think we want to have that discussion and maybe look at them separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2177.927s">One</a>  of the key things about all of these items, as well as the, the state legislation that again <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2184.17s">You</a>  know this resolution just asked that the housing subcommittee discuss a potential resolution regarding that state legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2191.181s">All</a>  of these would have as currently constituted would have exempt exemptions, you know for small owner occupant landlords this is really talking about people buying <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2200.318s">these</a>  2030 unit buildings are building large luxury apartments or we're seeing now resale of large apartment complexes and the resulting rate rent increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2210.103s">So</a>  really the focus is on is on those properties and what we can do as a city to try to limit the deep impact you know 15% rent increase in a year is really unsustainable and I think we're going to keep seeing that with just the high demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2226.157s">and</a>  the regional issues around housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2228.139s">And</a>  it's really important that as a city, we do our best to advocate for as much power as we can possibly have to make sure that residents have housing stability and aren't facing the trauma and deep emotional, financial and personal impacts that displacement and other forms of types of <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2248.847s">you</a>  know, eviction have on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2250.828s">So</a>  that's the intent of this resolution here, is that we have the housing committee discuss what we can ask the state to return power to our community to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2260.071s">And</a>  I would move approval on that, obviously, pending discussion of the council.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2267.834s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2269.135s">Councilor</a>  Collins, then Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2272.276s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears, for going through the resolution so thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2277.754s">And</a>  I appreciate you bringing up the context of the mass displacement that we're already starting to see in Medford over the past week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2285.502s">We</a>  had residents from the building on Bradley Road, some of whom are in attendance tonight, who were telling us about what they're currently going through with that exact type of situation, with where we are currently in the housing market, the housing crisis coming out of the pandemic as we seem to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2301.237s">You</a>  know, mass mass displacement of tenants from our community from the community that they want to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2307.559s">And</a>  what really shapes me about this whole situation is the fact that, you know, our hands are so tied as Council as a city for what we're able to do to protect the people who live in our community who want to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2319.343s">protect</a>  our constituents, the people that we represent, and that's because of these many, you know, potentially more impactful tenant protection, really just constituent protection measures that we're not allowed to do because of <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2334.39s">because</a>  of decisions affected on the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2336.993s">That's</a>  the reason that these tenant protections are being considered as home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2342.559s">For</a>  anybody who's unfamiliar, measures such as rent stabilization are illegal in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2348.505s">And</a>  I think this has been said by others before me, but I think it's a very frustrating position to be in, to be hearing from constituents saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2357.387s">We</a>  want to stay in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2358.668s">We</a>  want to continue being a part of this community and to be so very constrained in what we can do to effectuate helping people stay in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2367.315s">With</a>  just the situation that we're currently seeing on Bradley Road, I think it's been incredible coming together of housing advocates, people who've been through this type of situation before, residents coming together to see how they can help one another, mutual aid volunteers, just trying to alleviate a really painful, traumatizing, expensive <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2385.004s">situation</a>  for a lot of people, but there's a limit to how much you can volunteer and advocate your way out of a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2393.368s">And</a>  that's why we need to be advocating for changes to what we as a city are allowed to do to help people stay in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2401.732s">And</a>  that's why I'm excited to take up these potential home rule petitions in the housing subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2407.075s">And</a>  just to briefly touch on, I know it's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2411.387s">It's</a>  not a four letter word, but it's a four letter and numeral word. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2416.868s">I</a>  understand that, you know, some of my fellow Councilors would, you know, totally understand my fellow Councilor's perspective on advocating for things at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2427.131s">But,</a>  you know, I feel strongly about this one in particular because it directly relates to our authority as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2434.252s">It's</a>  saying, please give us authority back to make decisions about what's right for our community here at the community level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2441.837s">Um,</a>  well, and I'll leave it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2444.259s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
