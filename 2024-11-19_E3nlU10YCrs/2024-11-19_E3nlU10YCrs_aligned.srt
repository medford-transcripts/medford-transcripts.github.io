As a reference in chapter 94 Medford zoning ordinance section 2.2, the petition proposes to change the zoning district designation of the area of land bounded by Boston Avenue to the Southwest, North Street to the Southeast, the MBTA railroad tracks to the Northeast and the Somerville border to the Northeast from industrial I to office 202.

26
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:29,583
All is depicted on the plan entitled plan showing proposed zoning change in Medford Mass, Middlesex County.

The city of Medford is an EEOA 504 employer.

30
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:06,206
by order of the City Council, signed Adam L. Hervey, City Clerk, advertised in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal, June 30th and July 7th.

31
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:12,873
Do we have, before we open up the public hearing, do we have a brief presentation from the petitioner?

32
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:19,240
I know we did have... Name and address for the record, please.

33
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:28,049
this evening.

34
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:50,267
As you may recall, we were in front of this council last month regarding our petition to move the properties at 196 and 200 Boston Ave from the industrial zoning district to the newly created 02 zoning district.

35
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,511
At that meeting, and I'll

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,461
branch off a little bit.

37
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:00,263
Councilor Knight asked me a question and I would like to clarify it.

38
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:11,289
You had asked me about the project that we were preparing to consider at 200 Boston Ave about some taxes and some permit fees.

39
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,371
I think I went off the cuff a little bit, but I think I was pretty close.

40
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:22,916
The additional property taxes would be nearly $100,000 annually on top of what is already there.

41
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:27,579
And the permit fees and the linkage fees would be more than $200,000.

42
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:31,121
Just wanted to kind of close the loop on that.

43
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:34,283
Was that close?

44
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:36,064
Great.

45
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:39,547
Thank you.

46
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:50,110
So when we were here last, the council voted to move our requests to the Community Development Board for a recommendation.

47
00:04:51,251 --> 00:05:03,454
Subsequently, we went to the Community Development Board and they provided a recommendation to the City Council that they approved it, our request.

48
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:08,316
So all that said, we're here to respectfully request that the council

49
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:20,878
grant our request to move the properties at 196 and 200 Boston Ave and reclassify them as O2 in the O2 zoning district.

50
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,179
Thank you.

51
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,982
Before we open the public hearing, is there any discussion from the City Council?

52
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:43,563
Last night, Madam President, we looked at the recertification of our zoning ordinances, this was the type of project that we were looking to bring it project like this is going to be something that's going to be able to create new growth in our community rejuvenate regenerate our tax base and I think it's going to be something that's going to be good for method.

53
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:47,886
I appreciate john for coming up there and doing his homework and answering the questions that we asked last time.

54
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:55,386
But ultimately, by making the small changes, we're gonna be able to create jobs in this community, generate more new growth, more tax base, more linkage fees.

55
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:57,866
So I think it's gonna be something that's gonna be good for the community.

56
00:05:58,807 --> 00:05:59,487
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

57
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:01,688
Any further discussion from the Council?

58
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:10,771
You wanna note that, as the gentleman said, we did receive communication from the City Board on July 14th, recommending the proposed changes.

59
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,954
So as this is a public hearing, we're going to open up for public comments.

60
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,036

Before we open up the public hearing, are there any questions from the councillors?

110
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,467
So where exactly is this possible located?

111
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:47,008
It appears to be grappa on the map.

112
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:49,290
It's a side street.

113
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:53,494
Thank you.

114
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,396
Thank you, Madam President.

115
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:28,037
I've received multiple complaints, not against your business, but against other businesses over there in regards to parking overnight, leaving people just leaving cars on the street all over the place there.

116
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:33,061
Do you have parking in your facility for all off-street parking?

117
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:36,164
Yes, we have a lot of parking inside the building.

118
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,105
I'm sorry?

119
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,367
We have a lot of parking inside the building.

120
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:42,110
And what are you gonna do in the daytime when you're gonna pull the cars out onto the street?

121
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,072
We have a lot.

122
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:45,874
Where is there a lot there?

123
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,117
It's up front in the building and 26.

124
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,546
They say that's a very congested area.

125
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:58,971
I've got, you know, I'm hearing from all the other businesses in there between the

126
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,100
People from Volsau parking their cars all over the street.

127
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:09,803
The company next to Grava parking their cars all over the street.

128
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:12,265
And then there's another yard on Swan Street.

129
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:20,449
So many cars on the street there and nobody's putting their cars inside during the day.

130
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,351
And during the day it's just, that's just too congested of an area.

131
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:28,293
So I can't support this at this time.

132
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:41,057
until I see some kind of plan where the cars are gonna be, because I have called the chief for a meeting to discuss parking concerns in that area with the other businesses, not yours, that are causing problems there, too.

133
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:44,317
Thank you.

134
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:45,858
Councilor Collins and Councilor Spadafore.

135
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:47,838
Thank you, President Raul.

136
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:48,738
Thank you for being here today.

137
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:53,699
Just could you clarify how long has your business been in business at this location?

138
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,480
How many years have you been at this address, or is this the first time you're applying?

139
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:00,454
I have eight months.

140
00:12:00,814 --> 00:12:01,955
Eight months you've been in business here?

141
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:02,616
Yes.

142
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:05,659
Okay, thank you.

143
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:10,663
Councilor Scarpelli.

144
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:14,666
Company was open for three years.

145
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,509
It was another building before.

146
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:21,057
Okay, so you just, this is your new location, correct?

147
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:21,317
Yes.

148
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,619
So what was there before that, before?

149
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,180
It was a Grava building.

150
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,340
It was a Grava?

151
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:29,222
It was a Grava building behind 26th.

152
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:34,846
Okay, because is that what Grava used to do, their auto body, but they don't do it anymore, correct?

153
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:35,947
Yes, they don't do it anymore.

154
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,469
All right, so you're just taking that location.

155
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:53,441
Again, I understand Councilor Caviello's concerns, but I'm not going to penalize a new, a new business owner that wants to come into the city for the bills of, of other

156
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,439
business owners in that area.

157
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:04,226
I think that if you look at the permit and everything that's been requested of them, traffic issues and concerns.

158
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:06,608
Chief Buckley signed off on that.

159
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:13,394
I know in the past, I can ask my, my counselor genius Council night.

160
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:16,977
If we could we put a review on that Council night.

161
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:35,275
Just, if we accept it what I was thinking Council Scott probably was because we have the six day waiting period anyway after the close the public hearing that we request from the code enforcement officer listed suggestions as to what they would deem suitable for that area, and then we can put them on as restrictions to the special permit, when it comes for us.

162
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:47,871
I had spoken to the code enforcement officer and he said that is an issue that Chief Buckley needs to deal with also.

163
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:56,441
I have been, I did talk with him in the last 10 days about the concerns that other neighbors have in that area.

164
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:11,075
I think if I could recommend that with Councilor Knight, if we could recommend that and just move forward with the six day review and ask for the code enforcement and Chief Buckley to visit that before we vote on any movement moving forward.

165
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:19,222
I think I want to continue with the process, but again, I don't want to penalize a future business owner for something he hasn't done wrong yet.

166
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:21,139
or intends to.

167
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:23,943
So right now, all the paperwork seems to be in order.

168
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,389
I understand the frustration of the merchants in that area.

169
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:35,461
But at the same time, I think that has something to do with oversight and not with, um,

170
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:37,886
the petitioner that's in front of us.

171
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:47,510
So I would move approval and ask for some feedback from the court enforcement officer and the chief regarding our concerns.

172
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,750
Thank you.

173
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,532
Any further discussion from the council before we open the public hearing?

174
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:56,593
Are you all set Councilor Knight?

175
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,054
I am.

176
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:01,816
I mean, I just think that, you know, ultimately there's a situation that's going on down there.

177
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:03,877
Councilor Scapelli and Councilor Caviello are absolutely right.

178
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:04,917
If you're driving down in that area,

179
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:10,409
You know, it's the auto mile, we have a lot of dealerships down there, a lot of car repair places down there.

180
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,110
And what we're seeing is their vehicles getting parked on the public way, creating a lot of congestion.

181
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:19,072
Just recently, I believe we passed a permit for Fresh Pond Automotive, I think it was.

182
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:27,535
And although they have a lot of vehicles, a lot of parking for vehicles off street, if you drive past the location and take a look at it, I mean,

183
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,425
you barely have an inch to get a car in or out of there.

184
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:39,275
I knew our new zoning act also spoke a little bit to what types of what types of the number of vehicles that you keep on a parcel and the like.

185
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,297
So I think it's going to come down to a code enforcement issue as well.

186
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,239
But right now there is a problem that's down there.

187
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,942
The one thing I will say is that I don't think that the

188
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:50,154
It's not gonna be any more detrimental of a use than what was there before, right?

189
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:52,116
It's not like we're creating a situation and making it worse.

190
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,038
We have an opportunity to remedy it, make it better.

191
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:58,061
But like Councilor Caput said, I'd like to see the guy be in business.

192
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:59,543
I'd like to see him be able to operate.

193
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:09,652
So I think that the suggestion of asking the chief of police and the code enforcement officer to give us some suggestions as to what we can do to make it a little bit easier down there for their needs would make sense.

194
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,660
Thank you.

195
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,662
As this is a public hearing, we'll open it up to public comment.

196
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:17,483
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

197
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:19,544
And you would be in favor of this petition.

198
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:23,246
Anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

199
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:29,608
Seeing none, portion of the public hearing is closed.

200
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,010
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition of this petition?

201
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,023
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

202
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,265
Mr. Clerk, could you please read back Councilor Scarpelli's motion?

203
00:16:47,468 --> 00:17:00,518
Councilor Scarpelli, move for approval pending the six day comment period and also to ask for feedback from Chief Buckley and the Code Enforcement Officer through a site visit.

204
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,160
Thank you.

205
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,801
And that is seconded by Councilor Collins.

206
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:04,682
Any further discussion?

207
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:05,903
Councilor Scarpelli, if you could amend that.

208
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,362
put a 30 and 60 day review on that?

209
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:14,149
I wouldn't mind because it gives us a little more time once it's in there.

210
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,071
So I would support that as well.

211
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:23,208
Yes.

212
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:28,532
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Collins, amended by Councilor Carviello.

213
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,213
Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll.

214
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:36,758
So I just want to clarify that the intention of the motion is to approve after the six day comment period, correct?

215
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:37,158
Correct.

216
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,480
Here comes the roll call.

217
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:42,542
Vice President Behrs?

218
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:42,842
Yes.

219
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:44,924
Councilor Carviello?

220
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:46,901
Councilor Collins?

221
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:47,262
Yes.

222
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:48,302
Councilor Knight?

223
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:48,623
Yes.

224
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:49,844
Councilor Scarpelli?

225
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:50,124
Yes.

226
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:51,245
Councilor Seng?

227
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:52,065
Yes.

228
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:54,727
President Morrell?

229
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:57,389
Yes, I'm in favor of zeroing the negative, the motion passes.

230
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:03,494
So there'll be a six day public comment period, and then assuming no issues, then it will be approved.

231
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,035
So thank you.

232
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:05,535
Thank you.

233
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:07,617
Thank you.

234
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:08,037
Thank you.

235
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:12,920
All right, so moving on to 22-436.

236
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:19,198
436 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

237
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:26,193
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council invite representatives from the Medford Police Department to discuss the national night out in Medford.

238
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:27,115
Councilor Scarpelli.

239
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:28,769
Thank you, Madam President.

240
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:55,451
Um, if those people aren't familiar with the national night, I would is, um, we have been supporter in my capacity, my professional capacity in the city of Somerville, and it's a great opportunity to bring our neighbors together and as a unified front and and the best people, the best profession to lead that are our men and women in the police department.

241
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,932
So if I know that

242
00:18:57,738 --> 00:19:00,082
Um, we have Lieutenant Harden it here.

243
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:08,036
If he's, um, you know, just fill us in with all the particulars and I think we should all spread the word and I'll be part of such a great event.

244
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:08,817
So thank you.

245
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:13,986
Madam President, Charlie Hyden at 100 Main Street, Medford Police Department.

246
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:20,732
I'm here with with Captain Clemente Sergeant Rory Lockwood and Lieutenant Joseph Casey.

247
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:26,496
So if you'll indulge me for a couple moments I just want to explain a little bit why we're here tonight.

248
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,599
And I apologize if I'm looking at my notes a lot so.

249
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,803
So I'd like to thank you all for taking the time to hear us tonight.

250
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:37,067
I'm obviously a lieutenant with the Method Police Department.

251
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:40,611
Speaking here tonight on behalf of the department's Community Engagement Unit.

252
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:50,744
While I am here to talk about our upcoming event, I would like to take a moment to explain what the Community Engagement Unit is, its mission, and why we stand as a unit.

253
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,648
Like I said, behind me are members of our CEU.

254
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:58,629
Captain Clemente is the Administrative Division Commander.

255
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:02,331
Joseph Casey is here as part of the Professional Standards Division.

256
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:05,553
And Sergeant Rory Larkowitz is here as part of the Patrol Division.

257
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:12,656
Although the leadership of this unit may be entitled, leadership may come in all ranks.

258
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:17,859
No more important to this unit are the patrol officers who comprise us and have taken on important roles.

259
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,620
They are the backbone of what makes it work.

260
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:27,590
Our street level officers are the ones that you see on the street working around the clock, responding to the needs of Memphis citizens 24-7.

261
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,631
They have a major role in the current and future role of the department.

262
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:39,533
I'd be remiss if you have seen our social media patrol officer, Jessica Walsh, who's assigned to our patrol division.

263
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:47,574
In addition to our patrol duties, she's taken on a huge responsibility by reinventing our social media presence in the community.

264
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:49,155
She's an invaluable member of our team.

265
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:57,443
If you've seen it in the past and what it looks like now, it's leaps and bounds to what it was.

266
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,208
And so we have to thank Jess for that.

267
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:08,233
And she single handedly transformed our outreach and social media presence to be in line with 21st century policing, and with our communities wants and needs.

268
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,553
Thank you, Jessica, for that.

269
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:15,975
In addition, the CEO is represented by patrol officers, I wish they were here tonight that we had a lot of scheduling conflicts.

270
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:23,618
Julia Parthia Barbara to Christopher Kyle Terry, Kevin Braxton, and school resource officer, Richard Diobro.

271
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:27,519
These officers bring a wealth of experience and passion to this unit.

272
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:35,402
Combined, the core members have years of experience, knowledge, and passion they bring from both themselves and their respective work assignments.

273
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:38,243
I am sure that I am missing many, many more.

274
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:43,185
However, the Community Engagement Unit doesn't stop at these members alone.

275
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:48,667
We consider and believe that every member of the Memphis Police Department is part of the CEU.

276
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,248
When I say CEU, I'm just adding the acronym, sorry.

277
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:55,921
and it's from the chief down to include our civilian and dispatch personnel.

278
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:58,983
However, let me be very clear.

279
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,607
The CEU is not a directive from Chief Buckley.

280
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,470
This is not a program that is forced upon our officers.

281
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:10,692
Everyone in this unit volunteers their time.

282
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,415
This is a unit that is completely driven from within the rank and file.

283
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:22,001
Our officers want to be involved in this unit because they want to better our department and want to encourage the positive partnerships with our community.

284
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:29,727
So again, I've explained a little bit, but, and I apologize if I have a time limit.

285
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:32,349
Okay, sorry.

286
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:44,400
So the mission of the Medford Police Department is to create a proactive partnership with the citizens of Medford by providing quality policing and partnerships within the community, thereby improving the quality of life.

287
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:57,978
The CEU hopes that fostering relationships through transparency via social media channels and engagement through community events creates a partnership between the citizens and the police department to create a safer, more welcoming community for all.

288
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:09,343
Effective community policing has a positive impact on reducing crime and helping reduce fear of crime, thus enhancing the quality of life within the Metro community.

289
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:13,246
We're an evolving department, we're a young department.

290
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:22,592
It's a pivotal time of policing and we believe that a department engaging with the public helps not just our community, but our officers as well.

291
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:28,676
I've spoken to officers at roll call explaining the importance of community policing and engagement.

292
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:30,777
However, these are not just words.

293
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:39,022
We can say to them all day long, community policing, engagement, but they mean nothing if we don't live to their meaning.

294
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:48,031
This is why we believe that the first interaction with a police officer should hopefully not be when we have to respond to someone's home for a 911 response.

295
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:51,934
The first interaction should not hopefully be on a motor vehicle stop.

296
00:23:54,675 --> 00:24:08,904
Although the way police officers engage in these interactions can be positive and shape future interactions and views of our department, our hope is to reach out to our community through informal events so we can reach out to our community on a more personal level.

297
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:16,115
We want our community to know their police officers and who they are as people.

298
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:21,237
As Sir Robert Peel stated, the police are the public and the public are the police.

299
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:25,158
We wanna be seen as partners in the community, not just a uniform.

300
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:32,101
Our department does not run efficiently without the cooperation of our community and without them trusting us as equal partners.

301
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:38,523
That is why the department has invested time to reaching out to our community outside of the borders of law enforcement.

302
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:48,901
We wanna be advocates for programs, helping grow our community, as well as informing the public on the police role, what we do, why we do it, and how we can help.

303
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:55,244
We want our community to know that we are here to help 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

304
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:02,448
A quick history, CEU blossomed out of a nationwide program called Faith in Blue.

305
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:20,986
The event is a part of a nationwide initiative that aims to facilitate safer, stronger, and more just and unified communities by directly enabling local partnerships among law enforcement professionals, residents, business, and community groups to the connections of local faith-based organizations.

306
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:29,594
For our first event, we partnered with Pastor Bell and Shiloh Baptist Church of West Medford, which has a long history in Medford and strong ties to the community.

307
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:36,391
The event included a bicycle rodeo, car seat installations, activities, food, and music.

308
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:42,896
We had several local businesses sponsor the event, such as Wegmans, JRA Cycles, and Boston Cold Brew Company.

309
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:46,879
And next event is going to be October 22.

310
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,663
From this event, we spread the idea of the CEU.

311
00:25:52,483 --> 00:26:11,888
The unit hopes to encompass many of the programs which had already been conducted previous to Faith in Blue, such as donating to the No Shave November fundraiser for veterans, senior holiday lunch, Tetra truck events, autism awareness patch program to support the Doug Flutie Foundation, Medford Family Network toy drive, and many more.

312
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:17,850
In addition, we hope to be part of events such as Circle the Square or other Medford events.

313
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,351
We want our community to see us so we can see them.

314
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:26,590
open dialogue, and create partnerships within our community.

315
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:34,517
We are hopeful that all of you here, as well as people watching in our community, want to be part of this new and exciting partnership as well.

316
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:48,469
That all being said, and I promise I'm wrapping up, the department would like to extend an invitation to every citizen of Medford, young and old, to our national night out being held at Hormel Stadium on August 2nd from 5 to 8 p.m.

317
00:26:51,212 --> 00:27:01,978
National Night Out is an annual community building campaign that promotes police community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie to make our neighborhoods safer, more caring places to live.

318
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:08,781
National Night Out enhances the relationship between neighbors and law enforcement while bringing back a true sense of community.

319
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:15,064
Furthermore, it provides a great opportunity to bring police and neighbors together in a positive circumstances.

320
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:18,566
Millions of neighbors take part in National Night Out across the U.S.

321
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:34,829
On the first Tuesday in August, they host block parties, festivals, parades, cookouts, and various other community events with safety demonstrations, seminars, youth events, visits from emergency personnel, exhibits, and much more.

322
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:43,316
So to let you know what we're gonna have at National Night Out, which we're very proud of, we're gonna have an obstacle course for the children.

323
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:46,438
It's gonna be run by Officer Greg Giannino and Ricky Raymond.

324
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:52,938
And Officer Gino made a really nice wall, built it himself.

325
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,060
So he's very proud of it.

326
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,901
We're all proud of him.

327
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:59,983
We're gonna have possibly a dunk tank.

328
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:02,165
We might have to dunk the chief, I think.

329
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,307
Just keep Mari Carolina.

330
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:11,512
We're gonna have face painting from the cosmopolitan department.

331
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,312
Yeah, the College of Politics Department at the Medford High School.

332
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:17,612
Touch a trunk.

333
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:22,393
Officer Kevin Braxton will be singing the National Anthem.

334
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,534
Medford Family Network will be having games.

335
00:28:25,614 --> 00:28:26,874
Medford Rec will be having games.

336
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:31,955
KISS 108 will be DJing with Mikey V. We'll be having canine demonstrations.

337
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:41,877
And special surprise, we'll be having Boston Med Flight having a in-flight landing in the middle of Hormel Stadium doing a mock landing.

338
00:28:43,343 --> 00:29:04,776
In addition to these events, many vendors will be on hand, MHS football team, MHS cheerleaders, Porter to Hope, I believe Animal Control, Pat Hogan, tons of Medford police officers, Tufts University Police Department, Brotherhood for the Fallen, Richie Silvestro from Silvestro's Barber will be offering free haircuts.

339
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,858
The Ronald Tarantino Jr.

340
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,660
Fund, Moms Demand Action,

341
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:17,994
And we'll also be having Dave McGilvrey Sports Enterprises coming to promote their upcoming race in September.

342
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:23,017
In addition, the Board of Health, late addition with the Doug Flutie Jr.

343
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:24,138
Foundation for Autism.

344
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,499
The Chamber of Commerce will be there.

345
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:32,022
And I just found out from Sandy, we'll be having a voter registration table there as well.

346
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:39,146
So we hope that this event will foster a great relationship with the community and show what we can do for the citizens of Medford.

347
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:45,226
We extend this invite to all of you counselors and all the residents here in Medford.

348
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,008
We hope you can make it and thank you for your time.

349
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:52,691
Oh yeah, we're gonna have a ton of food, by the way.

350
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,353
Wegmans is gonna be catered, Bianchi sausage is coming down.

351
00:29:58,155 --> 00:29:59,556
Ice cream truck slush.

352
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:04,400
So if you're listening out there, Medford, come on down.

353
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,221
Captain?

354
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:07,642
Is there gonna be a where's Barry setting?

355
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:09,444
I don't know about that.

356
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:13,055
No, we really would like each and every one of you to come down.

357
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:16,239
And as Councilor Scott Pellway said, let's bring everyone together.

358
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:17,941
This is going to be a great event.

359
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:23,428
And we may have a surprise or two that Lieutenant Hatnett didn't mention.

360
00:30:23,748 --> 00:30:23,909
So

361
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:27,391
put a little mystery in that to make it a little bit more interesting.

362
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:29,992
But it sounds fantastic.

363
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:31,513
It's going to be an outstanding event.

364
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,094
We want to see each and every one of you there.

365
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:36,016
We want to see as much of the community down there as possible.

366
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:40,439
And we look forward to seeing you, and come and meet some of our officers down there.

367
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:41,339
Thank you.

368
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,200
Thank you.

369
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,802
Madam President, if I can.

370
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:46,923
So it just, again, this is the start.

371
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:53,207
We're going to keep going so that they know their place in this city.

372
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,277
Thank you for your time.

373
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,665
If I can, Madam President, this is important, but we need to get the word out.

374
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:03,711
Maybe one of those mystery surprises should be a robocall from someone.

375
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:04,793
Maybe.

376
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:14,587
But I will tell you, what's amazing is this is what our officers do on a day out anyway.

377
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:22,992
It's amazing that, again, you brought this out and everybody's volunteering to get involved.

378
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:31,958
And because I know the four people standing in front of me and the officers you mentioned all have a love and a tie to Medford and all want to continue with its greatness that it is.

379
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:56,330
I appreciate men and women in blue, I really, I think this is, you know, you guys do everybody does such a good job and making so many people feel welcome but when you bring all those groups together for an event like that, it just reaffirms how great your department is, and how great our community is, and I can't thank you enough for doing that so I'll be there, I will not be in the dunk tank.

380
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:22,486
there's now there's a liability issue mark out but we can't no one else can so thank you i think this is great thank you for your support just want to say you may see rank up here lieutenants and sergeants but this whole unit this whole event this whole unit is really driven by the patrol officers the ones you see on the street the ones that are doing the good work 24 hours a day the ones that are there at night while everyone's sleeping

381
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:29,672
they're the ones that are doing this work and it wouldn't have been without their support and all their hard work that we wouldn't have been able to do this.

382
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:31,935
So again, thank you for your time.

383
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:32,495
Thank you.

384
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:32,856
Thank you.

385
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:33,337
See you there.

386
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:35,019
Any further discussion from the council?

387
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,204
I do see on zoom, Bill Giglio name and address for the record, please.

388
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,820
I'm meeting you.

389
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,422
I sorry no I was waiting for the thing to go up.

390
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:52,086
So Bill Giglio went to freedom effort I just want to thank the police officers for putting this on.

391
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:58,891
And I hope I'm not jinxing my any of this but is there a rain day just in case or is it is what it is.

392
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:02,713
We're working on that so far the weather looks good.

393
00:33:03,294 --> 00:33:07,917
I think 85 and cloudy, even though it's cloudy still works.

394
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:13,652
It would never rain on this event.

395
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,232
Well, thank you guys.

396
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:16,653
Thank you.

397
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:20,934
Thanks to the police department for putting this on this is a, this is a sounds like a great event.

398
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:21,294
Thank you.

399
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:22,494
Thank you.

400
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:22,814
Thank you.

401
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:23,674
Thank you.

402
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:24,695
Thank you all.

403
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:27,896
Do I have a motion on Mr. Castagnetti.

404
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:32,877
Name and address for the record, please.

405
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:36,258
Mr. Andrew Paul Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Mass.

406
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:39,737
I never thought I would say this.

407
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:43,118
It's like 53 years since I've been to Woodstock 1969.

408
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:49,059
And I was not a big fan of method cops in those days.

409
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,861
However, things certainly changed in the last two or three decades.

410
00:33:56,982 --> 00:33:59,762
And I truly respect them a lot more than back then.

411
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:04,984
So I just want, especially in these trying times out there in this country, in the world,

412
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:13,231
I believe we should back boys and girls in blue because they've come a long way since the safe deposit box heist.

413
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:15,232
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

414
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:17,812
Mr. Scarpelli.

415
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:27,354
If I can amend the motion, just make sure that we send out a roll call so everyone in the community knows about this amazing event.

416
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:28,315
So I appreciate that.

417
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:28,795
Second.

418
00:34:29,155 --> 00:34:34,736
So on a motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

419
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:37,493
vice president bears.

420
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:39,294
Yes, that's trivial.

421
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:40,955
That's Collins.

422
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:42,236
Yes, that's a night.

423
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:44,116
That's just compelling.

424
00:34:44,176 --> 00:34:45,397
Yes, that's the same.

425
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,839
President Morrell.

426
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,740
Yes, seven in the affirmative zero in the negative.

427
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,982
The motion passes to two dash 437 offered by Councilor Carvial.

428
00:34:56,042 --> 00:35:02,405
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the Medford police address the overnight tractor trailer parking within the city Councilor Carvial.

429
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,801
Thank you, Madam President.

430
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:20,811
This is a problem that's been long going, especially on commercial street on Route 16 and in the parking lots in our city, these overnight tractor trailer parking there.

431
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:29,857
People are coming from other cities, park the car here in the morning and take their truck and then they come back at night and park it again there.

432
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:34,076
Yeah, part of this is this is part of our current build the city.

433
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:40,181
All of a sudden, see if method is now a truck stop for parking for free parking.

434
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:44,385
They're not method businesses, you can go by and look and see where they're from.

435
00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:47,688
They're, they're a bunch a bunch from Everett and other different cities.

436
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:54,033
Let them go out and get some parking somewhere else, not not parking lots and not on our street.

437
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:55,515
So I think

438
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,537
Officer Hartnett just went out to buzz the chief.

439
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:02,478
He's gonna come right back in if you just give him a little quick second.

440
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:05,579
I don't know if any other councilors have any other comments on that.

441
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,481
Any other discussion from any other councilors?

442
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:13,623
Just that most times those trucks, when they are parked, they do have someone that's inside them asleep.

443
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:21,146
Normally they're long haul truckers that are, you know, limited by the amount of hours that they can travel on the road through federal DOT standards.

444
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:25,508
So some where they could be going.

445
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,551
somewhere else, but yeah.

446
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:29,412
Thank you.

447
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:32,293
Any further discussion on the Council before we hear from Lieutenant Harnett?

448
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,215
Charlie Haddon, 100 Main Street.

449
00:36:36,356 --> 00:36:37,016
Sorry, Council.

450
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:59,869
actually on commercial street lining the streets every, every night, and you know they come they leave the car there in the morning, take the car and come back and leave it again at night, while the company and a bunch of companies are from Everett, you know the cities are there, and they're also parking in the back of the parking lots of shopping centers, and again it's just so it's not part of our curb appeal.

451
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:01,649
that we're trying to improve in the city.

452
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,531
And again, this is not a city of Memphis on a truck stop for truck parking overnight.

453
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:12,913
So I think it's about time that they either get tagged or asked to move to where they live.

454
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,833
This is on commercial street council.

455
00:37:14,873 --> 00:37:15,713
Mostly on commercial.

456
00:37:16,374 --> 00:37:18,754
You'll see that there's probably eight or 10 different trucks there.

457
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:22,475
They're all local people, not from Medford, a bunch from Everett.

458
00:37:23,356 --> 00:37:27,937
And also we've got the ones that park and back by the city at.

459
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:32,174
They leave that they leave the trucks there overnight, and come back in the next day.

460
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:38,978
I know the city behind city that state jurisdiction that we were out of purview of that.

461
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:54,987
But as far as commercial street goes I can definitely say, and you'll see the parking the parking in the parking lots overnight, and just just leaving this they just leave the trucks and coming back and getting them in the morning, like a certain day really guys there, and I see them switching off trucks and guys.

462
00:37:55,516 --> 00:38:06,586
I can certainly relay these concerns, Councillor, to the department's traffic unit and some of the overnight... And I say, I'm getting calls from the businesses on that street saying that they're just getting to be a little too much for them.

463
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:10,449
It's not one, it's eight, nine, 10 some nights.

464
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:14,733
They just leave their trucks there and go back to Everett where they're from.

465
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,210
Yeah, absolutely.

466
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:22,654
I'm not in the trafficking area, but I mean, certainly I can relate that to trafficking and our office and to the other shift commanders.

467
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:25,195
If he can report back to us on what he wants to do with those, I appreciate it.

468
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:25,875
Absolutely.

469

A copy of the appointment letter is attached.

Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

Sincerely, Brenna Longo, current mayor.

496
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:34,764
We do not have anyone who's able to attend from the administration tonight.

497
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,484
I know Ms.

498
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:38,765
DiBenedetto is very familiar to all of us.

499
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:41,646
I don't know if you want to speak or we have questions from the councilors.

500
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,366
If I can.

501
00:39:42,386 --> 00:39:45,167
This is a no brainer in my eyes.

502
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:52,710
I think you're talking about the recommendation to appoint Erin DiBenedetto to the election commission.

503
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,352
See, this is a person that who I know personally and I can vouch for her that

504
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:23,331
her commitment to this community and through volunteerism while her children were in the method public schools, and then her energy and efforts to then pick up the mantle around the school committee and hold that office gives her an opportunity to really give that office a different viewpoint and a sense of history.

505
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:25,032
So I think it's, I think,

506
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:32,608
It's someone I respect someone that I think is very honorable and would be a perfect fit for this position.

507
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:43,337
So, um, all I can say is I appreciate you even putting your name down there and, and continuing your, your, um, uh, pursuit and giving back to our community.

508
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:45,840
So, uh, and, and another facet informed.

509
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,342
So, um, and again, you have to thank you.

510
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:52,134
the husband, Joe, who's always been there and he just keeps smiling.

511
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:52,894
I don't know what it is.

512
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,295
Just keeps dragging.

513
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:56,255
You keep dragging him out and he keeps smiling.

514
00:40:56,295 --> 00:41:01,017
So I, um, I would, I would support this nomination.

515
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:01,597
So thank you.

516
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:02,077

523

She comes from a good family, and she's always been there for the community whenever needed.

524
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:33,928
She was a diligent member of our school committee, and she continues to serve our community as a volunteer in many different ways, and I'm glad she stepped forward to take this position.

525
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:35,569
I wholeheartedly support her.

526
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:37,449

532
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:57,059
You know, I think the other counselors have put very well, you know, her service to the city.

533
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:03,602
I'm excited to see that she's continuing to serve, choosing to continue to serve our community.

534
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:17,468

00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:27,056
to 7.30 p.m.

625
00:47:27,456 --> 00:47:29,837
Friday, September 2nd, 2022, from 8.30 a.m.

626
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:30,598
to 5.00 p.m.

627
00:47:30,758 --> 00:47:33,860
Notices will be duly posted at the date and time required.

628
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,023
Respectfully submitted, Sandra Burbank-Gayle, Elections Coordinator.

629
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:42,640
Vice President Behrs.

630
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,461
Thank you, Madam President.

631
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,842
Thank you, Sandy, for being here.

632
00:47:48,524 --> 00:47:52,527
Just wanted to confirm, so these are the seven days of early voting for the primary election.

633
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:53,607
For the primary election.

634
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:56,990
We have 14 days for the general.

635
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,331
14 days for the general in November, okay.

636
00:48:00,092 --> 00:48:04,795
And just in terms of mail ballots, is that starting as well?

637
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:06,957
Is there a deadline for that?

638
00:48:08,057 --> 00:48:09,018
There is a deadline.

639
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:17,542
The deadline for mail-out ballots to request them, I believe, is the 23rd of August.

640
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:18,303
Okay.

641
00:48:18,483 --> 00:48:20,044
I believe it's the request date.

642
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:22,685
The 23rd of August is that date.

643
00:48:23,405 --> 00:48:34,491
And then, just so you're aware, to compensate for the Monday holiday, that's why we're staying late till 5 p.m.

644
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:37,650
on September the 2nd.

645
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,331
Got it.

646
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:45,982
Because otherwise we would have normally over-the-counter voting from May 30 to 12, the day before an election.

647
00:48:46,763 --> 00:48:50,969
But since we can't, we're compensating that with 5 o'clock.

648
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:57,171
The vote by mail cards went out to Middlesex County last Thursday.

649
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:02,792
I did receive information earlier today that people had started receiving those cards.

650
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:06,013
So we're looking for those to start coming back at any time.

651
00:49:06,673 --> 00:49:07,933
Great, thank you so much.

652
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:08,813
You're very welcome.

653
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:11,314
Any further discussion from the council?

654
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:13,894
Second, Councilor Scarpelli's motion to approve.

655
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:17,775
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

656
00:49:17,795 --> 00:49:18,975
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

657
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:24,817
vice president bears.

658
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:26,098
Yes.

659
00:49:27,078 --> 00:49:27,258
Yes.

660
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:27,519
Yes.

661
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:27,779
Yes.

662
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:28,179
Yes.

663
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:28,759
Yes.

664
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:28,879
Yes.

665
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:29,239
Yes.

666
00:49:29,379 --> 00:49:29,600
Yes.

667
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,160
Thank you.

668
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,400
Thank you.

669
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:33,982
Moving on to two dash four three nine.

670
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:56,957
22-439 offered by Vice President Behrs and Councilor Collins.

671
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:17,328
Ordered by the City Council of the City of Medford that in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 59, Section 21CG of the Massachusetts General Laws, pending the approval of the Mayor of the City of Medford and with the approval of the Secretary of State's Office, the following question shall be placed on the ballot and submitted to the voters of Medford at the biennial state election

672
00:50:17,988 --> 00:50:32,338
to be held on Tuesday, November 8 2022 quote shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional $12 million in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of the general operation of the Medford public schools for additional

673
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:42,670
additional classroom teachers and staff classroom and infrastructure needs and classroom teacher and other district staff compensation $6 million.

674
00:50:43,231 --> 00:50:48,579
The general operation of the Medford public library for additional staff staff compensation books and materials needed $400,000.

675
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:58,690
The general operation of the Department of Public Works for additional staff, road and sidewalk infrastructure needs and tree planting and maintenance $2,600,000.

676
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:06,598
And for the operation of general government $3 million for which the monies from this assessment will be used for the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2023.

677
00:51:06,638 --> 00:51:10,503
Councilor Collins or Vice Mayor Behrs.

678
00:51:11,712 --> 00:51:12,232
Excellent affairs.

679
00:51:12,432 --> 00:51:13,333
Thank you, Madam President.

680
00:51:14,073 --> 00:51:24,338
If I may like to make a short presentation detailing the proposal in front of this body.

681
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:26,899
Please go ahead.

682
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:27,659
Thank you.

683
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:29,760
I can figure it out.

684
00:51:37,038 --> 00:51:38,159
So thank you, Madam President.

685
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:51,172
As was just read, was the language as required by Chapter 59, Section 21C, Subsection G of Massachusetts General Laws pertains to property tax levy referendum vote.

686
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:56,517
This presentation is regarding the specific proposal before us, which is to

687
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:15,997
request that the mayor submit to the Secretary of the Commonwealth a ballot question asking the voters to make the decision of whether or not the city should be allowed to assess additional property taxes to fund essential public schools and city services.

688
00:52:19,577 --> 00:52:34,488
As we discussed deeply extensively throughout June, and during the fiscal 23 budget process, Medford is not bringing in enough revenue to meet the spending needs for city services, public schools and the maintenance of our buildings and infrastructure.

689
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,050
We've talked about this extensively.

690
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:45,657
We have bare bones budgets and low staffing levels for most of our city departments, which means that the city provides fewer services than residents expect and deserve.

691
00:52:46,277 --> 00:52:56,286
There's limited funds at our schools for new materials educator and staff contracts and maintenance, and we have a massive infrastructure backlog for our roads and sidewalks totaling $100 million.

692
00:52:56,926 --> 00:53:02,871
Many of our city and school buildings and crumbling or at least disrepaired state and limited maintenance funds.

693
00:53:04,112 --> 00:53:15,801
Making that long term problem worse since fiscal year 2021 the city budget has had a structural deficit, which means that unreliable one time revenue sources have been used to balance the budget and fiscal 2021 fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.

694
00:53:15,882 --> 00:53:20,405
This figure has ranged between 6 million and 12 million since fiscal 21, and about $8 million and $12 million over the last two fiscal years.

695
00:53:27,448 --> 00:53:47,663
What that means is that the only short-term options available to close the structural deficit as one-time revenue sources dry up are either, one, further budget and service cuts that will deeply hurt and impact our public schools and city departments, or raising revenue through the operating budget through a Proposition 2 1⁄2 override to close the structural deficit.

696
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:56,110
In June, the council made several recommendations to the mayor, including a request that by July 14th, the mayor provide an alternative revenue plan

697
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,491
that avoids further budget and service cuts in future fiscal years.

698
00:54:00,392 --> 00:54:10,476
The mayor's response to those recommendations in late June did not provide a detailed plan and suggested that fiscal 24 city budget may have even more service cuts than the budget that we just discussed.

699
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,420
This is a chart of what that looks like.

700
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:20,384
On the left, you see fiscal year 20, which was the last year that the city did not have a structural deficit.

701
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:25,468
In fiscal year 21, we used almost $6 million in free cash to balance the budget.

702
00:54:26,288 --> 00:54:31,512
In fiscal year 2022, we used over 12 million in ARPA revenue replacement funds to balance the budget.

703
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:49,998
The initial proposal for the fiscal 23 budget would have looked somewhere around $11.25 million in one time revenue to balance the budget that ended up coming down to about $7.8 million in one time revenues, once the final fiscal 23 budget was approved.

704
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:55,780
So there's again a significant structural deficit now baked into the city budget.

705
00:54:56,976 --> 00:55:06,332
where we are relying on one-time revenue funds that may not be there in the future to provide the essential public school and city services that residents want.

706
00:55:10,302 --> 00:55:13,264
This is the process that has come up so far.

707
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:21,550
As I mentioned before, at our June 14th and June 21st meetings, the council requested that the mayor provide an alternative plan to end the structural deficit and avoid cuts.

708
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,172
We asked that to come to us by July 14th of this year.

709
00:55:26,293 --> 00:55:29,335
We received a response in June that did not have a detailed plan.

710
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:36,921
And then today we received a press release from the mayor suggesting a $3 million override referendum that came out around 1.30 today.

711
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:47,117
The steps that would go before us on this, if we were to go on this timeline, again, this is the timeline where an override would be earliest on the ballot.

712
00:55:48,614 --> 00:55:57,881
and would coincide with the current election cycle, would be the council voting at the meeting tonight, pending mayoral approval to place a referendum on the November 2022 ballot.

713
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:08,508
According to state law, the mayor would then have to send the referendum to the secretary of state by August 2nd, the first Wednesday in August, to then place an override referendum on the ballot.

714
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:15,313
And then on November 8th of 2022, Medford voters would cast ballots to determine the outcome of the referendum.

715
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:34,697
The this proposed referendum the text is here it's already been read once asked that question is formed here on the right, along with a yes or no option as proposed it would end the structural deficit facing the Medford city budget for fiscal year 24 and future fiscal years.

716
00:56:35,637 --> 00:56:39,459
It would provide needed resources for students and educators in our public schools.

717
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:52,668
It would increase support for the Department of Public Works for staff and materials needed for road and sidewalk repairs, provide funding for the Medford Public Library, and would provide some flexible funding to address urgent issues and key priorities as needed.

718
00:56:53,268 --> 00:57:04,555
In addition to these items, in the long term, it would give the city breathing room to make long overdue investments in our city services as other revenues recover from the drop-offs that were caused by the pandemic.

719
00:57:07,535 --> 00:57:11,580
The cost impacts of this referendum as proposed for Medford residents are as follows.

720
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:19,310
First, if a majority were to vote yes in November if this were to be on the ballot, the property tax levy would increase by $12 million.

721
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,734
This is commonly referred to as a prop two and a half override.

722
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:30,497
The annual cost for the average single family home, which was valued at $654,400, would be 549.70 per year.

723
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:36,079
So it would cost 550 per year for the average single family property.

724
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:39,580
That's $46 a month or $1.50 per day.

725
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,621
The way this would work is it would change the tax rate and then apply to each property based on assessed value.

726
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:51,283
The Massachusetts Department of Revenue provides a tool to calculate impact on taxpayers.

727
00:57:52,447 --> 00:58:06,028
If this were to appear on the ballot and yes vote were to happen, it would only allow an increase over 2.5% for one year fiscal year 2024, all future years would be limited to the same two and a half increase that the city has been limited to since 1980.

728
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:12,303
The city can also implement exemptions to help residents most affected.

729
00:58:13,124 --> 00:58:27,109
I believe in August, we have on our agenda to be discussing the residential and owner occupied exemption, as well as potentially I have an item on the agenda tonight, we're increasing the eligibility and exemption amount for the over 65 senior exemption.

730
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,332
Absolutely.

731
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:49,533
And again, if you want to actually look at the calculator from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, you can go to this link, bit.ly slash DLS tax calc, and you can plug in any amount you want and see what that impact would be on the average resident.

732
00:58:51,694 --> 00:59:00,842
This is actually that exact calculation pulled out today, maybe a little hard to see, but I will be posting these slides after the meeting online.

733
00:59:02,223 --> 00:59:04,225
Again, for the average single family property,

734
00:59:05,623 --> 00:59:10,087
value at $650,000, it would be a $550 per year increase.

735
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,377
So thank you for allowing me to make that presentation.

736
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:24,880
I'd just like to follow up with a couple of comments.

737
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:31,546
This is a proposal specifically to address the existing structural deficit within the city budget and avoid further cuts in fiscal year 2024 and beyond.

738
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:41,922
It does not address our capital needs backlog, like a new fire headquarters, Medford High School, or the $100 million road and sidewalk deferred maintenance amount.

739
00:59:42,968 --> 00:59:54,694
This proposed amount and timeline is because it would fully eliminate the structural deficit in one fiscal year, provide certainty and stability for our city's financial future, and do so within an already scheduled election.

740
00:59:55,394 --> 00:59:57,195
Now, this is just me personally.

741
00:59:57,795 --> 01:00:07,700
It is my personal firm belief that we have to act now, and that we need to trust the voters to make this decision to end the structural deficit and stop future cuts to our budget.

742
01:00:08,452 --> 01:00:31,432
However, regardless of what happens tonight, or between now and August 2, the August 2 deadline to move forward on this timeline, I remain fully open to suggested changes by my council colleagues, collaborative engagement with the mayor's office, which appeared to begin today, and I would support any process needed to move forward, whether it's the one that I've outlined tonight, or a different process that we work towards collaboratively.

743
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:48,344
At the end of the day, the budget is in the situation that it's in, we have a structural deficit, and we know from the month of discussion around the fiscal 23 budget that our public schools and our city departments can't afford any more cuts, there's nothing left to cut in the city.

744
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:57,190
And if we don't find revenue to address the structural deficit, we're going to be in a very difficult position in fiscal year 24, and years beyond that.

745
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:06,911
I'd like to conclude my comments by thanking my fellow counselors for allowing me to make this presentation, and I look forward to hearing what you have to say about this issue.

746
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:07,431
Thank you.

747
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:08,271
Thank you.

748
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:09,172
Thank you, President Burris.

749
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,473
Councilor Collins, would you like to speak?

750
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:11,593
Sure.

751
01:01:11,673 --> 01:01:12,413
Thank you, President Morrell.

752
01:01:14,594 --> 01:01:20,477
Not to belabor the points that Vice President Burris has already made, but just to underline a few of them to further

753
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:26,048
expand on my perspective and why I was interested in co sponsoring this motion.

754
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:40,371
What I hear about the most from my constituents are roads, the library, the schools, trees, city services, as was discussed as we said ad nauseum during the fiscal year 23 budget process over the past month.

755
01:01:41,112 --> 01:01:42,252
We have a structural deficit.

756
01:01:43,272 --> 01:01:44,313
we can't do more with less.

757
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:48,875
We can't continue to keep asking our city staff or city services to do more with less.

758
01:01:49,676 --> 01:02:03,944
I don't find it acceptable to continue cutting city services to the bone and asking our residents to make do with fewer and fewer resources and services, asking our city staff to do more and more with less and less support.

759
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:11,809
We heard during the fiscal year 23 budget process that next year's budget will likely be even leaner.

760
01:02:12,878 --> 01:02:28,202
I don't think personally, I'm not willing to accept cuts that are even deeper for next year than what we were asked to contemplate for fiscal year 23 because we saw, and we heard from the residents and the staff of the city, how that would affect our city's operation.

761
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:35,444
I also want to emphasize as was already explained if the mayor approves this resolution if this resolution proceeds.

762
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:40,180
as it's currently designed, it would become a referendum on the fall ballot.

763
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,225
It would be left up to the voters to decide yes or no.

764
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:46,651
This is not a matter to be taken lightly.

765
01:02:47,718 --> 01:02:48,579
This is a big question.

766
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,520
I want to see it put to the voters.

767
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:54,162
This isn't something for the seven member bodies to decide.

768
01:02:55,183 --> 01:03:01,227
I want to see this put to the voters to decide how we invest in the future of this community.

769
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,849
And I also just wanted to shore up Vice President Behrs' last point.

770
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:11,633
I think that developing a reliable, sustainable, appropriate revenue plan to fund our communities

771
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:15,857
urgent deserved needs is an urgent matter.

772
01:03:17,238 --> 01:03:28,166
I'm also willing to collaborate and be flexible on what exactly that looks like, and including some other proposals that are on our council agenda tonight.

773
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:41,677
I'm also open to exploring all of the options to mitigate the potentially painful effects of an override, for example, the proposal to increase the senior exemption to the maximum allowable

774
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:42,731
for now.

775
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:44,126
Thank you.

776
01:03:44,817 --> 01:03:45,617
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

777
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:47,117
Councilor Scarpalli.

778
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,218
Thank you, Council President.

779
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:55,659
Thank you, my colleagues, for bringing this forward because it is something that we can discuss and discuss we should.

780
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:59,500
But I'm looking at this in three different processes.

781
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,381
One, the presentation and the process.

782
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:12,863
I think that the budget season was difficult, but I've heard from so many constituents that something serious as this, probably something

783
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:16,835
This is probably a topic that's probably.

784
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:27,329
one of the most intense, serious questions that we should visit in our community in years, that we haven't visited in years.

785
01:04:27,389 --> 01:04:38,732
So I think understanding the process and looking how it was presented that we're presenting this in the middle of the summer and a lot of people that aren't around to really share the concerns.

786
01:04:39,432 --> 01:04:47,194
I personally received over a hundred emails, phone calls, people expressing concerns, questions that we have.

787
01:04:49,254 --> 01:05:02,306
So, to reiterate the process, not having the city assessor here tonight to answer some questions I think it's very important to not have the questions that we have to get answered for us is very important.

788
01:05:03,262 --> 01:05:06,864
For one, the senior exemption, I think it sounds great.

789
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:09,446
I think we should give every senior exemption.

790
01:05:09,766 --> 01:05:15,810
Unfortunately, it falls back on the taxpayers.

791
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:18,372
It'll be an additional money.

792
01:05:18,472 --> 01:05:27,158
So when we're talking about $12 million, if we have a tax break and understand the ramifications of who's gonna pick up that break.

793
01:05:30,751 --> 01:05:34,694
it's gonna be taxpayers, the general taxpayer.

794
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:43,399
And that number that Councilor Villes mentioned of 500 some odd dollars a year, that's a question.

795
01:05:43,459 --> 01:05:46,842
The other question people asking is, okay, so this is for one year.

796
01:05:48,562 --> 01:05:49,803
And then what do we do after that?

797
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,164
Do we apply for others?

798
01:05:51,184 --> 01:05:54,327
So these are just simple questions that can't be answered.

799
01:05:54,727 --> 01:05:58,510
The other piece of this is truly the infrastructure within City Hall right now.

800
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:10,240
I don't think we have the manpower or the person power to really function or present an override in its totality

801
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:20,138
that could be put forth in a thoughtful and professional way.

802
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:23,480
I just don't think we have that capacity today.

803
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:26,523
So I think that's another concern.

804
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:34,350
And then when it comes down to the concerns of the constituents and I'll share with everybody, the biggest issue is that

805
01:06:35,602 --> 01:06:37,422
This is going to affect so many different people.

806
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:54,306
We had a, we had a budget season that was very contentious, and a lot of people called us extortionists and, but it was something that we needed to move forward to make sure that we, the city gets gets the basic necessities that we think we need to move forward.

807
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:58,587
And then I had a discussion with the mayor and talking about

808
01:06:59,652 --> 01:07:07,276
Some of the concerns we've had for years, I was a councilor that put forth a debt exclusion for a new fire station.

809
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:16,040
The mayor assured me that it's going out to architectural design this week and we're moving forward with the new fire station.

810
01:07:16,101 --> 01:07:19,442
So that's in a positive light.

811
01:07:21,924 --> 01:07:28,347
What we've gone through, what Councilor Behr so eloquently put, and the pains that we've seen the last couple of years,

812
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:38,364
think had a direct reflection on the COVID outbreak and the lack of growth here in the community.

813
01:07:39,464 --> 01:07:45,047
We talked about the 40B projects that we haven't been able to get off the ground and creating revenue that way.

814
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:58,713
The Mystic Ave corridor and increasing revenue by opening up new zoning for clean energy or biotech or whatever

815
01:07:59,593 --> 01:08:01,354
is talked about.

816
01:08:01,374 --> 01:08:12,240
I know Councilor Carvillo talked about everyone else being landlocked and Metro being a unique community right now, that we can really do some great things and create revenue that way.

817
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:18,824
So our first license went out to our marijuana distributor that will bring in some funding.

818
01:08:18,864 --> 01:08:21,686
So we're finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.

819
01:08:22,106 --> 01:08:28,890
And believe me, I'm not calling this a knee jerk reaction, because it isn't, because we've lived through some tough times.

820
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:35,978
but I think ultimately who this affects in the community, the people we're trying to support.

821
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:43,166
I mean, all of us have talked about, you know, affordable housing, people not being able to live in Medford, people not even be able to afford rents.

822
01:08:43,927 --> 01:08:48,973
Well, the homes that aren't single family or the homes that are rented,

823
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:53,754
what happens because the taxpayer is not going to fit the bill for this.

824
01:08:54,394 --> 01:08:59,117
All they're going to do is turn and increase rents for their renters.

825
01:08:59,777 --> 01:09:07,721
And that's not going to help one of the biggest groups we've all worked for to make sure that we can make sure that methods affordable for all.

826
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:10,663
So I think there's a lot of questions that if

827
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:21,615
We had a team here, and we can sit together and figure out what's the best course of action with the true blueprint of what true new growth looks like.

828
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:25,159
And understanding where we can, where we need to move.

829
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:28,744
Listen, if $3 million is what it is and we need to move forward with that.

830
01:09:30,335 --> 01:09:34,657
after it's a thorough plan and how we don't hurt our taxpayers as much as we can.

831
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:38,298
I think it's something we visit, but it's something we visit and explore.

832
01:09:38,879 --> 01:09:40,239
I think it's very dangerous tonight.

833
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:48,803
The other point that I'll bring up is that, and I, you know, I talked to my colleague about this, that, you know, George, you know, people, this is another mis-attack.

834
01:09:48,843 --> 01:09:49,703
It's another mis-attack.

835
01:09:49,723 --> 01:09:53,305
In the middle of the summer, you're coming in, you're blindsiding the public and then, bam.

836
01:09:54,265 --> 01:09:55,066
We don't want to divide.

837
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:58,167
I think,

838
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:08,866
We've done a good job working together, and I just don't want to divide the city any more than it has to be.

839
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:13,510
These are important issues.

840
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:14,991
It's something that we've all looked at.

841
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:20,733
But I think it's it's also important that we truly don't know what's down the line.

842
01:10:20,973 --> 01:10:25,654
We've we've asked the mayor and I think the mayor is going to present us with the capital improvement plan.

843
01:10:26,195 --> 01:10:29,096
And one of those plans is going to be a new high school.

844
01:10:30,076 --> 01:10:35,358
And if that's the case, you know, if you're talking about looking at the parents and

845
01:10:36,749 --> 01:10:43,646
And what they'll be asking for for something like that and what we're asking for today, it's not just $550.

846
01:10:46,324 --> 01:10:49,006
This is something that's gonna be impacted many different levels.

847
01:10:49,046 --> 01:10:53,248
So a household's not just gonna see an increase of $550, it's gonna be much greater.

848
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:53,989
And that's what I fear.

849
01:10:54,009 --> 01:11:08,037
And I think that not having, you know, people in this room that can answer our questions and us not vetting that out properly as a team, I think, you know, even with any money people, we do how many readings?

850
01:11:09,117 --> 01:11:09,818
We do three readings.

851
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:23,584
So I think it'd behoove us, I know I wanna hear everybody before I make any motions, but it would be really beneficial for all of us to really sit down and look at the plan of totality before we put this out there.

852
01:11:23,984 --> 01:11:30,687
And it's knee jerk reaction because the truth of the matter is, I've gotten the emails too that said, hey, we need that override, support the override.

853
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:35,008
Well, okay, in theory, it sounds great.

854
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:38,510
With $12 million, we get to do all these great things.

855
01:11:41,053 --> 01:11:41,713
We don't know that.

856
01:11:43,274 --> 01:11:57,898
So, and that's and that's the other underlying situation that is is bothersome to me so I just caution I know that everybody wants other people want to talk but I just, you know, I appreciate bringing this forward because the dialogue has to come out.

857
01:11:58,418 --> 01:11:59,919
We are, we are in some constraints.

858
01:12:00,459 --> 01:12:02,080
But I think this is another situation.

859
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:10,806
We worked together with the administration say, let's look at true new growth instead of looking for a proposition to an app override.

860
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:23,955
I think that looking at that and exhausting that before we do something this drastic, because this hurts the person that lives in our neighborhoods and in every single home and apartment in the city of Medford.

861
01:12:23,975 --> 01:12:28,478
So we just have to be careful because as good as it sounds out front,

862
01:12:29,754 --> 01:12:41,526
You did your homework, no one's ever going to question that it's very thorough, but there are other questions that what is this with the two and a half, is this added with the two and a half, or without the two and a half the original two and a half.

863
01:12:41,927 --> 01:12:43,648
Is it with the.

864
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:48,614
How much would it be if we had to incur the cost of the senior exemption.

865
01:12:50,155 --> 01:12:53,977
I understand where that went because we did our assessment.

866
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:57,099
We got a report back when I tried to do the debt exclusion for the fire station.

867
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:10,487
And I believe it was with every single senior citizen to be excluded, it was $17 a quarter, I believe, for our taxpayers to build a new fire station.

868
01:13:10,547 --> 01:13:12,308
So I know the process.

869
01:13:12,448 --> 01:13:13,309
I know it's not easy.

870
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:17,471
That failed, I believe, six to one back in the day.

871
01:13:19,172 --> 01:13:31,458
And, and again, even at that point I presented it, knowing that we haven't vetted it out properly so, and this is, this is a big deal here in the city so like I said, I really think we should.

872
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:40,686
take a deep breath, look at all the information that was presented, and really move on to another meeting so we can understand this with all our stakeholders in the room.

873
01:13:40,886 --> 01:13:53,296
That means the mayor's office, a city assessor, and looking at all of the different angles and all the different possibilities that we can benefit from and we can also hurt from.

874
01:13:53,336 --> 01:13:56,198
So thank you, Madam President.

875
01:13:56,338 --> 01:13:58,180
Thank you, Councilor Favella.

876
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,984
Madam President, thank you very much.

877
01:14:03,324 --> 01:14:09,365
I think it's important to point out that we have a deficit, because the council approved the spending.

878
01:14:10,966 --> 01:14:11,906
The council approved the spending.

879
01:14:12,506 --> 01:14:12,746
All right.

880
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:16,888
And we certainly do have a revenue problem.

881
01:14:17,668 --> 01:14:18,968
But we also have a spending problem.

882
01:14:20,129 --> 01:14:21,789
And we have a prioritization of spending.

883
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:28,071
Okay, so when we look at kind of override is the only two options I don't think that that's the case.

884
01:14:28,807 --> 01:14:32,871
I think, I think we had an opportunity to eliminate a lot of waste in this last budget.

885
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:38,417
When we look at what's going on with KP law and this package here, $255,000 in outside legal fees.

886
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:42,641
That's $255,000 that could have gone to the school department.

887
01:14:47,063 --> 01:14:57,886
The mayor gave us $300,000 out of the utility account, so the lights might not be on at the hockey rink come the end of the school year, but we got the $300,000 back in the budget, because she took it out of the utilities account.

888
01:14:58,326 --> 01:15:00,267
She wanted to take it out of the contract account.

889
01:15:01,027 --> 01:15:03,548
We have a spending problem.

890
01:15:05,729 --> 01:15:09,570
We have an embraced development to generate new growth.

891
01:15:10,617 --> 01:15:13,819
We're fighting 340B projects that would bring in millions and millions of dollars to this community.

892
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:27,686
We have the gentleman up here today talking about a small scale project that's gonna bring in $300,000 annually, just our permit fees and property taxes, plus the jobs it's gonna create, which is gonna bring more revenue into our community in the circular flow of a local economy.

893
01:15:30,688 --> 01:15:33,289
We have inflated salaries in a top heavy school administration.

894
01:15:38,073 --> 01:15:39,514
We're not investing money in the classroom.

895
01:15:40,114 --> 01:15:41,174
We're investing money at the top.

896
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:44,516
We're investing money at the top.

897
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:46,437
I remember doing budgets with Roy Belson.

898
01:15:46,457 --> 01:15:48,378
He'd get up here and he'd speak for five hours.

899
01:15:49,218 --> 01:15:54,000
He'd know every single dollar, where it was being spent, why it was being spent inside and out.

900
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:55,601
He didn't talk about rubrics.

901
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:57,602
He didn't call somebody up here to speak for him.

902
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,163
He got paid $160,000.

903
01:16:00,263 --> 01:16:03,645
He came to work for 20 hours a day and he knew that budget inside and out.

904
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,461
We have human resource issues across every single department in the city.

905
01:16:15,263 --> 01:16:20,965
And we have a proven lack of fiscal constraint, transparency and mismanagement.

906
01:16:22,585 --> 01:16:31,208
So is now the time to give the administration more money to spend when they've shown us that they can't do it responsibly now?

907
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:36,350
And we've been patent possible with it, improving spending above and beyond our means.

908
01:16:38,937 --> 01:16:45,859
So when we do that, yeah, I guess counselor beers is right when we spend above our means, the only thing we can do is ask for more money.

909
01:16:47,760 --> 01:17:00,583
But if we sit down, we take a look at the budget and we see that we have $100,000 human resource director in the school department, and 140,000 human resource director on the city side, and then I communicate, and then I'm working together.

910
01:17:01,123 --> 01:17:03,424
I think that's a duplication of efforts and wasteful spending.

911
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:16,696
We need to look at this in a way that the individuals in this community if this goes through and quite frankly, I think that we do need to generate more revenue, how we do it is the question, right.

912
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:21,359
Now if you look at the tax rate in the city I mentioned, it's very low compared to our neighboring communities, it's very low.

913
01:17:21,739 --> 01:17:25,861
And over time we've seen commercial properties in the number of passes that are commercial dwindle.

914
01:17:26,581 --> 01:17:29,862
So we're at about 7% now, you know what I mean, I'd like to see us at around 15 to 20.

915
01:17:31,658 --> 01:17:47,448
For us to have that strong commercial tax base that we don't need to have this conversation every year, but we can't do that with the zoning Board of Appeals that doesn't embrace growth with a historical commission that won't let anybody improve their own homes to generate increased tax revenue and improve curb appeal and neighborhoods.

916
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:50,990
So, wow.

917
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:53,092
This is a very.

918
01:17:54,013 --> 01:17:59,395
interesting issue, and it's an issue that needs to be discussed, that needs to be talked about, because we cannot continue to go on this way.

919
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,656
We absolutely cannot.

920
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:02,737
Our roads are the worst in the region.

921
01:18:03,657 --> 01:18:06,338
DPW is the most understaffed in the region.

922
01:18:06,538 --> 01:18:09,239
$2.6 million for DPW personnel will go a long way.

923
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,862
It will go a long way, if the money ever gets there, if the money goes to where it's intended to go.

924
01:18:17,143 --> 01:18:25,870
At the very least, if this question does come to fruition, if this issue does come up, every individual should get an estimate as to what it's gonna cost them individually.

925
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:34,837
And it would be great if we had an assessor in this community that could answer some questions and put that data and information together for us, but we don't even have an assessor.

926
01:18:35,898 --> 01:18:37,840
So for us to do this right now, I think is scary.

927
01:18:39,201 --> 01:18:40,522
We're looking at exemptions.

928
01:18:41,743 --> 01:18:45,286
Exemptions are great, but the money has to be shifted somewhere.

929
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:51,799
And the more exemptions we pass, the more we're gonna squeeze those in the middle and they're already being squeezed.

930
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:55,743
So we have a lot to think about here and a lot to discuss.

931
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:10,757
I just see this as a spending issue and a spending problem here in the community, as well as a number of other issues that are going on that I think are putting us in a position to be a little bit

932
01:19:12,246 --> 01:19:15,107
less financially sound than we could be if we were a little bit more proactive.

933
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:17,649
Three years ago, we passed the budget.

934
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:22,371
And that budget had zero dollars and zero cents of deficit spending.

935
01:19:23,711 --> 01:19:26,953
Three years later, we spent $29.7 million in deficit spending.

936
01:19:33,176 --> 01:19:33,916
Thank you, Madam President.

937
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:35,137
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

938
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,518
Councilor Carvillo.

939
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,278
Thank you, Madam President.

940
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:50,323
So July 19th, we sit here tonight and trying to raise $12 million.

941
01:19:50,644 --> 01:19:53,786
And all my councilors have all made great points.

942
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:56,908
Councilor Baez, you're right.

943
01:19:58,328 --> 01:19:59,229
The city needs more money.

944
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:05,253
But with the problem with government, the more money we give government, the more money government spends.

945
01:20:06,305 --> 01:20:12,551
And I think my other counselor, right, I think we have to look at where we're spending our money and what we're doing with it.

946
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:17,235
I mean, how much more do we want to keep giving this administration to spend?

947
01:20:17,555 --> 01:20:25,222
So if this group was really serious about their proposals tonight, we have no assessor here tonight to answer any questions.

948
01:20:25,302 --> 01:20:30,767
And the assessor that we have is on the interim who's working for two different cities, which I don't even know if that's even legal.

949
01:20:31,428 --> 01:20:34,309
All right, there's no CFO here tonight to answer any questions.

950
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:37,930
And there's nobody from the administration to answer any questions here tonight.

951
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:46,573
And let's say that's, to me that says that across the hall doesn't care.

952
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:49,114
There's nobody care.

953
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:55,536
And this money should have been added into our budget from three weeks ago when we voted on that.

954
01:20:56,016 --> 01:21:01,038
And let's say we squeezed as much as we could out of it, but going forward,

955
01:21:03,642 --> 01:21:05,223
Who ultimately pays for all this?

956
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:09,486
It's the renters?

957
01:21:09,566 --> 01:21:17,031
I don't think I know a generous landlord in this community who's gonna take a tax hit and not pass it on to the renters.

958
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:20,654
And we talked about affordable housing, affordable housing keeps going up.

959
01:21:21,114 --> 01:21:27,179
And we are probably in the worst of times financially for many people in this community.

960
01:21:28,337 --> 01:21:39,163
Washington is tone deaf to what's happening in this whole country because look at inflation, gas, food, your electric bill, your gas bill, your oil bill.

961
01:21:39,203 --> 01:21:41,844
These are all bills that are mounting and mounting every day.

962
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:45,886
And now I know we say the average house is 600,000.

963
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:48,688
So how many average houses in this committee?

964
01:21:51,493 --> 01:21:54,736
I think if we actually go out and look, you're gonna see a lot more.

965
01:21:55,797 --> 01:21:58,739
You know, they say, well, $800 is not that much money, or $1,000, or $500.

966
01:21:59,339 --> 01:22:01,641
For some people, it is a lot of money.

967
01:22:02,302 --> 01:22:02,862
It is a lot of money.

968
01:22:03,122 --> 01:22:04,283
People are struggling right now.

969
01:22:04,703 --> 01:22:07,626
There's still people that aren't back to work.

970
01:22:07,906 --> 01:22:14,511
We have seniors in this community that are single seniors, that may not have a husband or a wife, that yes, are they house rich?

971
01:22:14,891 --> 01:22:15,411
Yes, they are.

972
01:22:15,652 --> 01:22:19,455
And that house rich is gonna cost them more money if we pass this.

973
01:22:20,095 --> 01:22:22,437
So, again, I agree.

974
01:22:23,598 --> 01:22:32,985
We do need to control our spending, but to keep asking for money every year is just not a fiscal way to run a city.

975
01:22:33,285 --> 01:22:39,250
I think we have to control our spending and get a fiscal plan in order before we vote on anything.

976
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:50,894
And like I said, we have nobody from any part of the city government here to give us any guidance or their opinion on anything today, other than something that we got at two o'clock this afternoon from the mayor's office.

977
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:53,474
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

978
01:22:53,514 --> 01:22:54,135
Vice President Behrs.

979
01:22:54,515 --> 01:22:55,655
Thank you, Madam President.

980
01:22:55,835 --> 01:22:58,716
Thank you to my fellow colleagues for their comments.

981
01:23:01,717 --> 01:23:05,098
This isn't the administration I wanna be managing this money.

982
01:23:07,585 --> 01:23:09,206
This is the situation I want us to be in.

983
01:23:09,606 --> 01:23:21,210
We've been asking whether it's, what are we at two and a half years now, we've been asking for certain financial reporting and information, seven months we've been asking for it under this council.

984
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:39,057
I can't even begin to think the number of hours we spent in June, going through the budget and saying, what the heck is going on, and us having to do the deep research with our packet of, you know, sheets of paper where we didn't know what's happening.

985
01:23:40,178 --> 01:23:41,339
I don't disagree with that at all.

986
01:23:44,355 --> 01:23:47,737
As you said, there isn't anyone here tonight from the administration.

987
01:23:48,438 --> 01:23:54,761
We asked unanimously a month ago, you know this, we can say it's coming up now and I understand this specific proposals coming up now.

988
01:23:55,642 --> 01:24:08,750
But we asked, we asked over a month ago, after months and months and years and years of requests for a fiscal plan and a revenue plan, and how are we moving forward and how are we going to fund the city for something, you know, and we got an answer.

989
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:15,943
Five hours before the meeting that was maybe we could do something like this and you know we're just starting to think about it today.

990
01:24:16,824 --> 01:24:17,344
So you're right.

991
01:24:18,645 --> 01:24:19,466
Where's the leadership.

992
01:24:20,927 --> 01:24:30,895
At this point, I understand the concerns that you have, but we all know that there's not eight to $12 million in the city budget that we can go find that doesn't mean firing people.

993
01:24:31,829 --> 01:24:32,669
who work for this city.

994
01:24:33,129 --> 01:24:33,970
It's just not there.

995
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:57,839
We could find a few hundred thousand, maybe we're lucky, we find a couple million, but if we hit the wall in fiscal 24, and we can't address the structural deficit, and we're talking four, eight, 12 million in a structural deficit where we don't have the revenue to come in, it means people are getting laid off, that the city's providing even less than it already is providing, and things are getting worse.

996
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:03,149
The people who are hurt the most when government isn't there are the people who need government the most.

997
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:09,054
So I understand that the higher costs on taxpayers is gonna have different impacts on everyone who pays.

998
01:25:09,094 --> 01:25:12,357
We're all individual people, we all have our own stories, we all have our own experiences.

999
01:25:12,937 --> 01:25:13,998
And I don't wanna mitigate that.

1000
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,701
But the act of government that we do is balancing.

1001
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:24,948
You can't name a single business in the world where when their costs go up 9% in a year, they can only raise their price 2.5%.

1002
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:27,281
It doesn't exist.

1003
01:25:28,062 --> 01:25:33,644
There's, there's no business in the world where you would have to cut, you know, I mean, essentially that's what we're saying.

1004
01:25:33,684 --> 01:25:44,928
If we're, if we're going to go into this situation without additional revenue, and I understand all of the reasons my fellow counselors have put out reticence with this administration and how they'll manage it and all of that.

1005
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:58,647
But if we run into that wall in 11 months, which the mayor basically said to us in her budget letter, we're gonna run into that wall, because the offer money is going away and we don't have the one time revenue, we have a structural deficit, and we're going to be responsible and lean.

1006
01:25:59,148 --> 01:26:01,129
Whose jobs are we going to be responsible and lean with?

1007
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:10,940
I don't I don't want to fire people we already know the city can't do what it needs to do so so you know I understand that we need more leadership.

1008
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:15,601
I completely agree that we should have a proactive revenue plan for this city.

1009
01:26:16,441 --> 01:26:17,821
At this point it's falling on us.

1010
01:26:18,901 --> 01:26:23,603
We don't have a staff we don't have an assessor we don't have a finance department we're just a city council the city of Medford.

1011
01:26:24,383 --> 01:26:25,423
Somebody needs to step up.

1012
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:30,231
Now, I understand the reticence, I completely understand it.

1013
01:26:30,611 --> 01:26:34,715
I wish we weren't at this moment asking this mayor to manage this money.

1014
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:35,916
I agree with that.

1015
01:26:36,637 --> 01:26:37,538
But we are where we are.

1016
01:26:38,078 --> 01:26:47,187
And as I said in fiscal 21 and fiscal 23 and I'm now looks like I'm gonna have to say in fiscal 24, I'm not gonna vote for a budget where there's less teachers.

1017
01:26:47,868 --> 01:26:50,289
I'm not going to vote for a budget where there's less public safety.

1018
01:26:50,749 --> 01:26:52,910
I'm not going to vote for a budget where there's less public works.

1019
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:57,911
I'm not going to vote for a budget where we defer the maintenance on our roads and sidewalks and buildings even more.

1020
01:26:58,352 --> 01:26:59,472
It's unsustainable.

1021
01:27:00,212 --> 01:27:01,733
It's completely unsustainable.

1022
01:27:02,413 --> 01:27:04,954
So, that's why I think we need action now.

1023
01:27:04,974 --> 01:27:07,375
I hear that there are hundreds of people who are concerned.

1024
01:27:08,155 --> 01:27:12,479
that we wish we had a better process that we had more time to discuss it.

1025
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,021
We've been asking for that.

1026
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:17,204
I don't disagree with anyone that we've been asking for that we haven't gotten it.

1027
01:27:17,784 --> 01:27:19,426
And now we're getting pushed to the wall.

1028
01:27:19,826 --> 01:27:27,013
So, that's the reason this is this is this, I put this before you with Councilor Collins tonight is because our backs against the wall.

1029
01:27:27,874 --> 01:27:31,457
And I don't want it to be next June where we're finding out, oh, my God, we don't have this money.

1030
01:27:31,837 --> 01:27:33,498
We're gonna have to cut this at the last minute.

1031
01:27:33,538 --> 01:27:34,859
There's another 10 jobs gone.

1032
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:36,380
There's another bunch of vacancies gone.

1033
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,182
There's another bunch of pink slips at the school.

1034
01:27:38,622 --> 01:27:43,425
We're sitting here till 2am having a negotiation that we should have had over the months and months before that.

1035
01:27:44,066 --> 01:27:45,047
I don't want to be there again.

1036
01:27:47,403 --> 01:27:51,627
If we get there again, I'm gonna feel confident that I put something on the table to try to avoid it.

1037
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:54,950
If it doesn't pass this council, it doesn't pass this council.

1038
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,352
If the mayor doesn't put it on the ballot, the mayor doesn't put it on the ballot.

1039
01:27:57,673 --> 01:27:59,654
If the voters vote it down, the voters vote it down.

1040
01:28:00,595 --> 01:28:08,142
I just want to advance some solution to this problem, because it's not coming from the executive leadership right now.

1041
01:28:09,143 --> 01:28:09,724
It's just not.

1042
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,315
I mean, we put it out there a month ago.

1043
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:14,516
Send us something, please.

1044
01:28:14,616 --> 01:28:15,657
A plan that's not this.

1045
01:28:15,817 --> 01:28:16,918
Anything that's not this.

1046
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:18,840
That was the resolution.

1047
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:20,321
Nothing.

1048
01:28:20,982 --> 01:28:21,923
And then what do we get today?

1049
01:28:21,943 --> 01:28:24,145
We get this but smaller.

1050
01:28:25,046 --> 01:28:26,568
So there is no plan that's not this.

1051
01:28:29,132 --> 01:28:30,873
Again, I respect all of you deeply.

1052
01:28:30,953 --> 01:28:32,014
We've done a lot of good work.

1053
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:33,434
We're gonna come to consensus.

1054
01:28:33,554 --> 01:28:37,957
I wanna try to move through a process where we have the least harmful impacts that we possibly can.

1055
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:43,379
And we do our best to keep the city functioning and avoid laying people off and firing people.

1056
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,181
I think this is an approach to get there.

1057
01:28:46,601 --> 01:28:49,823
I'm open to alternatives or amendments or different approaches to get there.

1058
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:52,544
And I'll leave it at that.

1059
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:55,346
I just, I know it feels,

1060
01:28:56,621 --> 01:28:57,661
like a short timeline.

1061
01:28:58,222 --> 01:29:00,963
I know it feels like we need more here.

1062
01:29:00,983 --> 01:29:03,424
And maybe we can come back.

1063
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:04,564
Maybe there's a special election.

1064
01:29:04,584 --> 01:29:05,645
Maybe there's something else, right?

1065
01:29:05,725 --> 01:29:06,045
I don't know.

1066
01:29:06,065 --> 01:29:07,646
I'm not, I'm not trying to put this in a box.

1067
01:29:07,686 --> 01:29:09,286
I'm just saying there's an election in November.

1068
01:29:09,706 --> 01:29:12,748
This is how we address this problem with the election in November.

1069
01:29:13,528 --> 01:29:16,189
And I think it's something we need to seriously consider.

1070
01:29:16,469 --> 01:29:16,789
Thank you.

1071
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:18,670
Thank you.

1072
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:22,052
Thank you, Madam President.

1073
01:29:22,752 --> 01:29:24,252
I know this is a serious debate.

1074
01:29:24,513 --> 01:29:25,533
This is, you know, this is

1075
01:29:26,217 --> 01:29:35,780
This is a topic about which I've received dozens and dozens and dozens of emails and calls over the last few weeks, including during budget season.

1076
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:45,943
And I think more importantly than all the messages that I've received, I live both sides of this debate.

1077
01:29:46,543 --> 01:29:49,344
My parents are homeowners in the city, they've invested in the city.

1078
01:29:52,817 --> 01:29:55,359
I recently graduated from the Medford Public Schools.

1079
01:29:55,639 --> 01:29:57,140
I know what the budget cuts look like.

1080
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:01,142
And I know what the tightness of the money looks like.

1081
01:30:01,703 --> 01:30:17,633
And I've been on the doorsteps, and I've been asked to campaign, and they've been asked to improve our roads, improve our schools, do X, Y, Z. But the fact of the matter is something I've learned while in this office is we don't even have a bare bones budget.

1082
01:30:19,094 --> 01:30:20,435
Our budget cuts through the bone.

1083
01:30:22,067 --> 01:30:29,389
We can talk about a lean government, we can talk about a fiscally responsible government, we can talk about a government that only serves the basics, but we aren't even there yet.

1084
01:30:30,269 --> 01:30:38,592
And when we asked the mayor for a plan, what we heard was, we don't really have a plan, next year will be worse.

1085
01:30:39,052 --> 01:30:48,935
The only way we can, and the implication is the only way we can get out of this mess is to advance difficult, politically difficult ideas.

1086
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,851
It's not on my wish list to raise taxes in the city.

1087
01:30:54,551 --> 01:30:55,591
No one likes it.

1088
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:56,932
No one likes it.

1089
01:30:57,892 --> 01:31:00,453
And it's a political risk to do it anyways.

1090
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:08,515
But I think we need to step up and lead and trust the people with this decision.

1091
01:31:09,535 --> 01:31:16,617
I think, you know, we've heard a lot about cutting spending and new growth.

1092
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:23,812
The fact is, when we look at all the proposals of things that we could cut in the city budget, it doesn't get anywhere close to $12 million.

1093
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:31,794
The only way we can get to that $12 million, as Vice President Behr said, is to lay off very essential staff in our city.

1094
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:39,896
And even with the budget that we have now, even if we didn't have to cut, we are already losing important members of our staff.

1095
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:45,457
We're already unable to fill very important positions in city government that every other city government in our region has.

1096
01:31:47,258 --> 01:31:54,804
When we talk about new growth, I think all seven of our counselors here and everyone in city government is behind new growth in our city.

1097
01:31:54,844 --> 01:31:59,248
We want to see us grow our commercial tax base, and we want this to be the first path that we use.

1098
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:16,382
But the fact of the matter is, because of practicality, even if we have all that new growth immediately, even if we were to sign all these deals tomorrow, we wouldn't be able to get out of the budget crunch that we're going to see for the next year, two years, three years.

1099
01:32:17,383 --> 01:32:19,804
because it takes years for a building to be built.

1100
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:22,606
It takes years for those investments to be made.

1101
01:32:23,606 --> 01:32:26,648
I understand that this is coming at a very tough time for everyone.

1102
01:32:27,288 --> 01:32:32,010
And I understand that inflation is, you know, an issue that really does hit everyone.

1103
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:37,173
I mean, you look at the gas prices, you look at food, you know, it's evidence, right?

1104
01:32:37,193 --> 01:32:47,118
But these investments are long-term investments that will reap benefits, financial benefits to homeowners and to renters alike, to everyone in our city.

1105
01:32:47,784 --> 01:32:53,348
And, you know, if we fix our roads, that means we don't have to spend as much on maintenance.

1106
01:32:53,448 --> 01:33:03,515
We don't have to, you know, we might not have to spend the, you know, spend the money that I did recently on fixing a flat, right?

1107
01:33:03,816 --> 01:33:05,757
These savings matter.

1108
01:33:06,177 --> 01:33:07,118
These savings matter.

1109
01:33:07,218 --> 01:33:11,601
And this investment, you know, in my personal opinion, comes at a difficult time.

1110
01:33:11,641 --> 01:33:16,905
I wish it didn't come at this time, but is, you know, an investment that I personally think

1111
01:33:17,393 --> 01:33:17,973
is worth it.

1112
01:33:18,374 --> 01:33:26,118
But I think that whole point doesn't get at the heart of the issue that actually is in front of us tonight.

1113
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:34,463
The issue that's actually in front of us tonight is whether we send this to the voters, whether we trust the voters with this ask.

1114
01:33:35,524 --> 01:33:44,149
I believe that if you're a yes on this, if you're a no on this, as a councilor, it's our social responsibility to trust the voters with the final decision.

1115
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,301
I don't want to impose my views on the voters.

1116
01:33:47,721 --> 01:33:50,862
And if the voters decide differently than I do, then so be it.

1117
01:33:50,962 --> 01:33:51,782
I trust the voters.

1118
01:33:52,722 --> 01:33:55,243
And I think the same works the vice, vice versa.

1119
01:33:56,344 --> 01:34:03,006
If, you know, if counselors don't like, don't like this idea, leave it to the voters, trust the voters to decide.

1120
01:34:03,026 --> 01:34:11,368
That's my personal view, because I think, you know, this is a, this is a time where we really need to trust in our residents and we need to really trust in our democracy.

1121
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:13,089
And this is,

1122
01:34:13,652 --> 01:34:19,095
the fairest, the most neutral path forward, you know, put aside my own personal views on this issue.

1123
01:34:19,815 --> 01:34:30,802
And if I were, you know, coming at it from a completely neutral standpoint, the only fair decision, in my opinion, is to send this to the voters and to trust them with the final decision.

1124
01:34:31,822 --> 01:34:38,466
I hope, you know, I know that many of our residents here tonight are not going to agree with me on what I just said.

1125
01:34:38,486 --> 01:34:39,947
I know that, you know,

1126
01:34:42,753 --> 01:34:53,161
Many will never agree or never come around to our viewpoint, but I hope that you understand where I'm coming from, as I try to understand where everyone comes from.

1127
01:34:54,042 --> 01:35:06,952
I hope that we can speak earnestly and honestly about this issue, and I hope that we can compromise a little bit and find reasonable solutions out of this budget crunch, out of this revenue crisis.

1128
01:35:07,192 --> 01:35:07,953
So thank you so much.

1129
01:35:10,109 --> 01:35:13,593
Thank you, Councilor saying, Councilor night, Madam President, thank you very much.

1130
01:35:14,814 --> 01:35:18,858
First of all, I think it's safe to say that the budget that we have right now isn't the budget that any of us want.

1131
01:35:19,799 --> 01:35:20,059
All right.

1132
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,563
The question is, will $12 million give us that.

1133
01:35:24,424 --> 01:35:25,104
And I don't think it will.

1134
01:35:26,022 --> 01:35:29,083
because the budget we have right now is the same budget that we've had for 40 years.

1135
01:35:29,403 --> 01:35:32,004
It's just been tweaked and tweaked and tweaked and tweaked year after year.

1136
01:35:32,464 --> 01:35:36,325
We've never really had a major comprehensive reform or a look at the way we spend in this community.

1137
01:35:36,365 --> 01:35:38,385
We've never prioritized the way we spend in this community.

1138
01:35:39,086 --> 01:35:41,706
I called for a zero-based budget when COVID hit.

1139
01:35:42,286 --> 01:35:45,787
Perfect opportunity for us to break it down to zero and build every department back up.

1140
01:35:46,347 --> 01:35:51,989
Start using, how about metrics and data-driven decision-making instead of reactive decision-making, right?

1141
01:35:52,389 --> 01:35:52,969
We didn't do that.

1142
01:35:53,709 --> 01:35:55,010
Now, week in and week out,

1143
01:35:55,914 --> 01:36:00,802
And it's been going on for 30 years, you hear the same thing fix this sidewalk fix this road fix this street.

1144
01:36:01,463 --> 01:36:07,031
We asked for more, we asked for priority spending in various areas across the community, and we're not getting it.

1145
01:36:07,592 --> 01:36:07,812
All right.

1146
01:36:09,687 --> 01:36:12,550
I see what counselor bears is doing he's bringing a solution to a problem.

1147
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:13,150
All right.

1148
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,012
I think there's more than one way to do it.

1149
01:36:15,633 --> 01:36:21,078
I know he thinks there's many ways to do it he's looked at them all, or the ones that he's looked at it, and he thinks that this is the best one.

1150
01:36:21,498 --> 01:36:26,003
All right, and he thinks this is the best one because you know why it plugs the hole exactly right it stops all the bleeding.

1151
01:36:26,343 --> 01:36:30,046
We're ready to rock and roll we're back to, we're back to even, and we're going to move forward right.

1152
01:36:32,027 --> 01:36:34,048
I get it, I get where you're coming from, I do.

1153
01:36:34,428 --> 01:36:35,669
I really do, I get it, right?

1154
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:44,835
But I still don't think that 12 million would give us the budget that we want or the budget that we're looking for or the spending in the priority areas that we've been asking for.

1155
01:36:46,356 --> 01:37:01,285
And until we take that budget and break it down, break it down to zero to see whether or not we can make do with what we have a little more or a little less, I think we're doing,

1156
01:37:02,095 --> 01:37:02,996
a little bit of a disservice.

1157
01:37:03,256 --> 01:37:06,918
Now I agree, there's not a lot of places you can cut, but there are places you can cut.

1158
01:37:07,518 --> 01:37:09,940
It's not so much cutting as it is moving the shells around, right?

1159
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:14,683
This account might have to go into that account, just like end of the year transfers that we see every year.

1160
01:37:14,723 --> 01:37:17,204
We pass a budget, the budget isn't the budget.

1161
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:24,409
At the end of the year, they come to us and they say, there's a million dollars in the fire department's overtime account that wasn't spent, let's transfer it over here.

1162
01:37:25,352 --> 01:37:28,833
Right, every year, there's a million dollars in this account that wasn't spent, let's transfer it over there.

1163
01:37:29,314 --> 01:37:31,494
The budget's the best case scenario, right?

1164
01:37:31,634 --> 01:37:33,375
When you look at the budget, the budget is just a picture.

1165
01:37:33,835 --> 01:37:36,116
If everything went perfect, this is how it would be spent.

1166
01:37:36,676 --> 01:37:37,937
But it's never spent that way.

1167
01:37:38,337 --> 01:37:39,517
It's never, ever spent that way.

1168
01:37:40,498 --> 01:37:44,679
And I think that there has to be a discussion, there has to be a process.

1169
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:49,541
But to say, let the voters, trust the voters, I've always trusted the voters, Justin.

1170
01:37:49,701 --> 01:37:50,742
I've always trusted the voters.

1171
01:37:51,322 --> 01:37:53,743
That's why we're here, because the voters trust us.

1172
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:59,076
I've trusted the voters I put my faith in them, and they've given me the opportunity to sit here and serve.

1173
01:38:00,756 --> 01:38:14,200
So, when it comes up to a circumstance like this, where I think the process is a little bit flawed, because it's in the 11th hour, because we've been left with no other options, other than to say, can we live with this for another 12 months.

1174
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:25,866
and then start a process all over again, and exercise and futility if you must, at some points we think, because we have a partner that doesn't wanna cooperate, it doesn't wanna have a strong partnership with us.

1175
01:38:26,406 --> 01:38:34,170
A chief of staff that comes up here and fights with us instead of works with us, gives us more defenses than answers, right?

1176
01:38:34,691 --> 01:38:36,812
We're gonna be in the same situation again, I understand that.

1177
01:38:37,452 --> 01:38:45,397
And I can appreciate Councilor Calls and Councilor Beall bringing this issue up and saying, look it, we have a large scale problem and here's a large scale solution.

1178
01:38:47,175 --> 01:38:51,077
We can keep putting band-aids on things or we can go in for surgery, right?

1179
01:38:51,277 --> 01:38:52,297
And that's really what this is.

1180
01:38:52,337 --> 01:38:56,919
This is us making a decision as to whether or not we wanna do conservative treatment or go in for surgery.

1181
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,200
And that's something that needs to be weighed.

1182
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:07,424
And when you oppose with that question in your personal life, you surround yourself with the people, your family.

1183
01:39:07,784 --> 01:39:08,845
That's our community right now.

1184
01:39:09,385 --> 01:39:10,605
That's our family, the community.

1185
01:39:11,386 --> 01:39:13,807
And you tell them what's going on and you get their input.

1186
01:39:16,082 --> 01:39:20,826
So we really need to establish a process if this is the direction that we want to go in.

1187
01:39:21,486 --> 01:39:22,827
And the process can't be this short.

1188
01:39:23,408 --> 01:39:34,356
I'd be happy to have this discussion moving forward to get this ready to go at some point in time to get languages proper for us to see what our financial needs are and move on something.

1189
01:39:34,776 --> 01:39:35,697
But now's not the time.

1190
01:39:36,097 --> 01:39:36,778
Now's not the time.

1191
01:39:38,543 --> 01:39:45,605
when we took a vote on Mystic Avenue in the middle of the summer, you would have thought Mayor Longo's head was gonna explode.

1192
01:39:45,645 --> 01:39:47,465
You used that to catapult yourself into office.

1193
01:39:47,485 --> 01:39:52,166
You thought that Stephanie Burke was gonna put apartments all up and down Mystic Avenue, no one was gonna be able to drive their car.

1194
01:39:53,426 --> 01:39:53,946
Never happened.

1195
01:39:54,426 --> 01:39:55,627
Nothing's happened on Mystic Avenue since.

1196
01:39:58,147 --> 01:39:59,347
Nothing's happened on Mystic Avenue since.

1197
01:39:59,367 --> 01:40:06,229
There's been no development, there's been no growth until this council passed the recodification of zoning.

1198
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:09,276
and was able to start generating revenue for this community.

1199
01:40:09,697 --> 01:40:11,458
So we have some tools in our toolbox too right now.

1200
01:40:12,258 --> 01:40:13,819
In September, we're gonna get an RFP out.

1201
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,022
I mean, in September, we're gonna get an assistant city solicitor, we're told.

1202
01:40:17,042 --> 01:40:21,925
We're gonna get an RFP out for our zoning consultant to continue to build upon the work that we've done.

1203
01:40:21,965 --> 01:40:23,346
We're gonna be able to generate revenue for that.

1204
01:40:24,567 --> 01:40:35,354
So I think we're gonna be able to do our part in creating recurring non-tax-based, recurring revenue, not one-time revenue sources.

1205
01:40:36,522 --> 01:40:43,106
But in terms of this question, in the direction that we're going in, I commend you on the hard work that you both put into this and the efforts that you put forward.

1206
01:40:44,007 --> 01:40:50,871
I'm not comfortable with it, based upon the timing and the process, more so than the question that's being asked.

1207
01:40:51,031 --> 01:40:53,493
I do have a couple of concerns that are legal in nature.

1208
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:56,140
surrounding this?

1209
01:40:56,841 --> 01:41:00,101
Can we put a question on that says $0 or $1?

1210
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:02,922
Is it plurality?

1211
01:41:02,962 --> 01:41:05,823
Is it 50% of the people that voted or just 50% of the people that voted the question?

1212
01:41:07,343 --> 01:41:10,504
You know, that would make this, that would enable this in an act?

1213
01:41:10,644 --> 01:41:17,085
You know, so there are a couple of questions that I have related to the process of passage as well as the financial side of things without an assessor.

1214
01:41:18,066 --> 01:41:19,786
I just think we're in a real scary spot right now.

1215
01:41:20,786 --> 01:41:23,127
We're talking about assessments and exemptions

1216
01:41:24,867 --> 01:41:32,413
moving, shifting a pot of money around among a small group of people, we really need to know what the dollars and cents are going to be.

1217
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:33,714
Without an assessor, we can't do that.

1218
01:41:35,535 --> 01:41:36,196
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1219
01:41:36,696 --> 01:41:37,597
Councilor Scarpallo.

1220
01:41:37,637 --> 01:41:38,057
Thank you.

1221
01:41:38,558 --> 01:41:50,387
I think Councilor Knight makes a lot of sense, and I think Councilor Beas brings up a lot of concerns that we all feel, but I think that there is a better solution.

1222
01:41:50,427 --> 01:41:50,887
I think that

1223
01:41:53,060 --> 01:42:09,224
I'd make the motion that we table this and we move forward with the administration that we put a team together with this council to focus on new growth and put a plan in place.

1224
01:42:09,944 --> 01:42:18,606
Because I think where we are right now, we're at 12 o'clock where we were during budget season, during budget night.

1225
01:42:19,346 --> 01:42:21,027
I think that we're at a point right now that

1226
01:42:22,023 --> 01:42:28,316
either side, if this goes one way or the other, it's gonna impact a lot of this community in a negative way.

1227
01:42:29,298 --> 01:42:41,381
where instead, I think it's a push that we need to get everybody at the table with our leadership here and move forward quickly and looking at and moving forward with new growth.

1228
01:42:41,581 --> 01:42:44,442
I think that that's, it's out there.

1229
01:42:44,482 --> 01:42:46,382
We talked about, we talked about the fees.

1230
01:42:46,422 --> 01:42:47,583
We talked about the permitting.

1231
01:42:47,943 --> 01:42:49,683
We talked about the new growth in taxes.

1232
01:42:50,003 --> 01:42:56,325
We talked about all these avenues that we have possibilities to build that number and,

1233
01:42:57,645 --> 01:43:05,772
Maybe at the end of it, we see that there is still a deficit of some odd million dollars that we need to look and focus and bring it to the voters.

1234
01:43:05,832 --> 01:43:15,280
But right now, like Councilor Knight said, and like I said previously, I think it's the process right now that this council has done great things together and we've listened to each other.

1235
01:43:15,621 --> 01:43:18,123
And I think we respected a lot of what we needed.

1236
01:43:18,343 --> 01:43:22,647
And I think this council today needs to look at this, but really not to be

1237
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:27,102
that quick and moving forward with this.

1238
01:43:27,142 --> 01:43:37,089
I think that, you know, I hear council saying, you know, put it to the voters, but I think first the voters put us here to do our job.

1239
01:43:37,589 --> 01:43:49,398
And I don't think we've done enough right now to get the most from the administration and ways we can work as a unit to create the revenue we need that we don't have to go for Proposition 2.5 override.

1240
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:51,399
So I'm hoping my,

1241
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:54,051
My fellow councils can see that.

1242
01:43:54,411 --> 01:44:10,522
I would love to see a date certain for a meeting with the administration, the city assessor, and looking at a list of new growth that we together, that we already know.

1243
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:12,664
I mean, we've already talked about the 40B project.

1244
01:44:13,064 --> 01:44:15,445
We have already talked about Mr. Gabb.

1245
01:44:15,486 --> 01:44:17,547
We've already talked about Meffitt Square.

1246
01:44:17,947 --> 01:44:19,488
I think it's time we need to do that.

1247
01:44:20,009 --> 01:44:20,669
I mean, it's,

1248
01:44:24,007 --> 01:44:25,248
And I think we're ready to do that.

1249
01:44:25,268 --> 01:44:29,691
I think the mayor and administration, hopefully they're ready to come to the table and let's get this done.

1250
01:44:29,731 --> 01:44:40,539
I think that moving forward with the proposition two and a half override in this process, I think is a little, is a slippery slope in many different ways.

1251
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:50,847
So again, like I said, I appreciate the banter, I appreciate the information, but I think it's something that we need to

1252
01:44:52,148 --> 01:44:57,433
This is our job to find a way to bring everybody together so we can find a solution other than the most drastic.

1253
01:44:57,473 --> 01:45:07,003
And I know some of us feel like we're ready for the most drastic, but I think it should be revisited in a different light.

1254
01:45:07,043 --> 01:45:08,044
So thank you, Madam President.

1255
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:10,126
Thank you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Carvalho.

1256
01:45:11,167 --> 01:45:12,028
Thank you, President Morrell.

1257
01:45:13,207 --> 01:45:13,887
I'll keep this short.

1258
01:45:13,927 --> 01:45:23,249
I just wanted to add a little bit more elaboration around my perspective on the issue and to follow up on some of the points that my colleagues have made.

1259
01:45:23,289 --> 01:45:29,790
And I wanna thank all my fellow counselors for the thoughtful dialogue around this.

1260
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,050
I really respect your points of view.

1261
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:32,130
I hear where you're coming from.

1262
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:40,072
And I know that I think where we're all coming from is aspiring towards fiscal responsibility and doing what's best for the community.

1263
01:45:41,072 --> 01:45:45,896
And I appreciate all of you for speaking from that perspective, though our opinions differ.

1264
01:45:47,517 --> 01:45:53,742
I think we all want to make sure that we're taking the best course of action for where we are right now.

1265
01:45:54,623 --> 01:45:58,466
And for me, just to explain my own perspective a little bit more.

1266
01:45:59,637 --> 01:46:28,555
When I think about timing and process, I think back on the past six weeks and I think, well, the clock just started, it's 12 months until another level funded, level service budget that is going to be harmful for the schools, for the library, for constituents who don't know when their road is gonna get paved, not to mention all of the needs, housing stability needs, environmental needs, that we have no timeframe for when those are going to start to be filled.

1267
01:46:29,435 --> 01:46:30,116
and our community.

1268
01:46:30,998 --> 01:46:37,630
And I agree that so many other measures are a crucial part of that formula, growing the commercial tax base being among them.

1269
01:46:38,872 --> 01:46:42,459
And I also know that those chickens aren't gonna come home to roost within the next 12 months.

1270
01:46:44,417 --> 01:46:56,722
And so this is why this issue to me is so glaring and so urgent that I want this override to be seriously considered because the needs going unmet in our community, to me, they're just that urgent.

1271
01:46:57,422 --> 01:46:59,583
So the people that I'm hearing from, they're just that urgent.

1272
01:47:00,784 --> 01:47:10,588
So I just wanted to circle back to that point to share more on my perspective on why to me, that's the part of timing and process that I'm most preoccupied with.

1273
01:47:11,188 --> 01:47:11,408
Thank you.

1274
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:13,359
I do apologize.

1275
01:47:13,419 --> 01:47:17,603
Councilor Scarpelli, was that a motion to table or just, was that an official motion or just?

1276
01:47:18,924 --> 01:47:23,667
Okay, Councilor Carvilla.

1277
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:26,790
Thank you, Madam President.

1278
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:36,898
We've gone around this whole table here and we've all come up with good suggestions, but the bottom line is, this came in Friday afternoon.

1279
01:47:37,659 --> 01:47:40,661
We've had three days to digest this, four days to digest this.

1280
01:47:41,807 --> 01:47:51,882
And like I said, I said, if the mayor was still sitting there as a counselor, she'd be going through the roof here with this, because I've been here with her when she's done that.

1281
01:47:52,963 --> 01:47:57,349
Again, for these type of say they got to say.

1282
01:47:59,289 --> 01:48:04,233
You've done this in the dead of the summer when no one's around to do this and to hear what's going on.

1283
01:48:04,533 --> 01:48:05,214
And I agree.

1284
01:48:05,334 --> 01:48:09,277
And we've been chastised for less things doing this.

1285
01:48:09,297 --> 01:48:18,344
But to jam this through with three days notice, and I know this has got to get on by, if you want to get it done, it's got to get on by August 3rd.

1286
01:48:19,425 --> 01:48:20,105
I get that too.

1287
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:25,910
But I think we need to sit down and figure out where the city is going,

1288
01:48:27,152 --> 01:48:31,796
the things that we've done right, and look at the things we've done wrong.

1289
01:48:33,338 --> 01:48:41,145
Nobody's perfect, and just figure out where our mistakes are, and come up with a plan for spending.

1290
01:48:42,186 --> 01:48:44,629
Even if we get this money, we do this.

1291
01:48:46,221 --> 01:48:49,383
How do we know it's gonna go to where we intended to go?

1292
01:48:50,043 --> 01:48:51,764
That's where my concern is.

1293
01:48:53,105 --> 01:49:03,571
I just don't have the confidence that even if it's 3 million or 5 million, whatever it is, I don't know if it ever gets to the spot where it's intended to be.

1294
01:49:04,691 --> 01:49:08,413
I mean, we can keep on using COVID as an excuse.

1295
01:49:09,214 --> 01:49:12,956
Other cities developed, look at the city of Malden.

1296
01:49:13,456 --> 01:49:14,877
Look what they did during COVID.

1297
01:49:15,752 --> 01:49:19,253
They developed their whole downtown area during that time.

1298
01:49:19,293 --> 01:49:20,854
They didn't miss a beat.

1299
01:49:21,734 --> 01:49:22,934
What did we do during COVID?

1300
01:49:23,614 --> 01:49:24,235
We sat around.

1301
01:49:25,955 --> 01:49:33,137
Again, government goes on, whether it's COVID or there's always going to be a situation of some kind of urgency.

1302
01:49:34,298 --> 01:49:36,818
And government needs to continue.

1303
01:49:36,858 --> 01:49:40,179
Government just doesn't stop for a certain situation.

1304
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:48,309
We haven't done anything for three years, four years, no shovels in the ground.

1305
01:49:48,709 --> 01:49:54,516
And like Councilor Collins says, we're not going to see the fruits of those projects that are just starting now.

1306
01:49:54,616 --> 01:49:56,298
I mean, we still don't have a shovel in the ground.

1307
01:49:57,199 --> 01:50:02,145
We'll say, this is going to be lucky if we ever see any fruits to this, but maybe three to four years.

1308
01:50:03,863 --> 01:50:09,968
No, I mean we we sat around with it with it with that cannabis is licensed, and now and now we're doing them.

1309
01:50:10,528 --> 01:50:12,890
But I just, I just don't.

1310
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:23,739
I just don't have confidence and giving out any more money that I'm not sure it's going to go to where I think it's going to go in the right spot so I'm not going to support this this evening.

1311
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,942
Any further discussion from the council.

1312
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,021
I think we have residents who want to speak.

1313
01:50:31,681 --> 01:50:32,302
Yeah, I do know.

1314
01:50:32,442 --> 01:50:34,983
So we have a number of residents that want to speak to the high number.

1315
01:50:35,164 --> 01:50:40,207
If we could keep comments to two minutes, I encourage you or you do have to address comments to the chair.

1316
01:50:40,727 --> 01:50:41,968
Please no personal attacks.

1317
01:50:42,288 --> 01:50:46,351
And I will be watching the time and we'll be taking folks in person and on zoom.

1318
01:50:46,411 --> 01:50:47,892
So name and address for the record, please.

1319
01:50:55,042 --> 01:50:56,843
Thank you, Council President Morrell.

1320
01:50:56,943 --> 01:50:59,404
Good evening, honorable councilors.

1321
01:51:00,124 --> 01:51:21,812
My name is Mr. Andrew P. Castanetti, and usually I speak last on issues and to throw out my Andrew-isms or sort of, but Councilor Marks allowed me to speak first, and I'm gonna let the best, all these speakers, if they come forward to be, come last.

1322
01:51:23,352 --> 01:51:24,533
I just wanted to say,

1323
01:51:25,723 --> 01:51:31,767
I'm going to add a few points, I'll make it probably less than three minutes without point of information.

1324
01:51:35,489 --> 01:51:48,618
This, no matter how you disguise this, it's not written on 22-439, but basically we all know it's a prop two and a half override, never been done in this city.

1325
01:51:49,078 --> 01:51:52,741
Winchester's done many of them and dead exclusions.

1326
01:51:55,106 --> 01:52:02,913
So if it's 12 million, why not go for 10 times that 120 million while we're at it?

1327
01:52:03,353 --> 01:52:06,335
Because it's never enough, is it?

1328
01:52:07,957 --> 01:52:11,179
For the tax man or tax woman, the city.

1329
01:52:13,421 --> 01:52:14,322
What's next?

1330
01:52:14,963 --> 01:52:22,889
Is this a prelude for a $300 million bond for a new high school, which ain't so new in 52 years?

1331
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:34,785
due to lack of maintenance amongst other buildings that were only 52 years old, library, police, fire, DPW, that's a different story.

1332
01:52:35,905 --> 01:52:42,889
You're financially killing the working class heroes, especially the fixed income retirees.

1333
01:52:44,489 --> 01:52:45,190
Don't you care?

1334
01:52:48,411 --> 01:52:49,492
Don't you care?

1335
01:52:50,807 --> 01:52:55,369
You've talked about housing affordability in Medford many, many, many times.

1336
01:52:56,510 --> 01:53:03,973
Even the newies spoke of this, especially them who's paying rent or doesn't even own home property.

1337
01:53:04,433 --> 01:53:06,894
Doesn't have to pay real estate tax per se.

1338
01:53:08,115 --> 01:53:19,900
Your $12 million prop two and a half override will cost us probably more like 10 to 12% more on the current bill starting this fiscal year, which is already started.

1339
01:53:21,678 --> 01:53:37,622
and you are still refusing us, the homeowners, my baby, Mass General Award, Chapter 59, Section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption at the full 35% shift.

1340
01:53:37,722 --> 01:53:41,583
We've lost over $2,000 a year, on average, per household.

1341
01:53:49,224 --> 01:53:55,767
Since the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted this in 1998, mind you, that's 22 years or so.

1342
01:53:56,587 --> 01:54:06,551
Imagine, even the state politicians had some compassion to help the owner-occupied homeowners, and many cities have adopted this savings.

1343
01:54:07,671 --> 01:54:16,175
Somerville, Everett, Malvern, Boston, even Senator Kerry gets it at 28 Lewisbury Square, if that's his legal address, he's not lying to the IRS, again.

1344
01:54:19,033 --> 01:54:21,536
And they're still doing it after years.

1345
01:54:21,676 --> 01:54:24,339
Does that tell us it works or does not work?

1346
01:54:25,881 --> 01:54:26,322
I don't know.

1347
01:54:26,502 --> 01:54:29,866
Maybe my common sense is going south.

1348
01:54:29,886 --> 01:54:31,868
I think it works just fine.

1349
01:54:32,109 --> 01:54:33,290
It's still in the program.

1350
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:35,312
They didn't unadopt it.

1351
01:54:35,432 --> 01:54:37,295
They adopted it and they're still using it.

1352
01:54:38,766 --> 01:55:01,578
I've been asking you all for this real estate tax relief for 19 years, and be aware, this will not cost the city hall, a dime, Mr. Orlando, because the tax savings that the owner occupied would save is simply shifted to the absentee maybe slumlords.

1353
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:05,780
So the city gets dime number one.

1354
01:55:07,053 --> 01:55:08,293
What if people don't understand that?

1355
01:55:08,754 --> 01:55:09,514
I read the law.

1356
01:55:09,934 --> 01:55:12,495
I have a sixth grade education, but I read the law.

1357
01:55:12,515 --> 01:55:14,315
Has everyone here read the law?

1358
01:55:14,455 --> 01:55:15,836
Has anyone read the law?

1359
01:55:16,176 --> 01:55:16,556
Thank you.

1360
01:55:17,436 --> 01:55:19,937
Hold that thought, sir.

1361
01:55:20,277 --> 01:55:24,398
So again, I ask you all again, why not here?

1362
01:55:25,559 --> 01:55:26,259
Come on, man.

1363
01:55:27,576 --> 01:55:27,856
Thank you.

1364
01:55:27,876 --> 01:55:30,517
We're having a meeting, as long as nothing else happens on August 10.

1365
01:55:31,477 --> 01:55:39,359
So don't understand your language past part of me what we'll have a meeting on August 10 with the interim assessor to discuss that with the new assessor interim.

1366
01:55:39,639 --> 01:55:40,499
So the old assessor.

1367
01:55:40,759 --> 01:55:44,920
Yeah, she couldn't even tell me how many absentee owners.

1368
01:55:45,701 --> 01:55:46,481
What does she know.

1369
01:55:54,927 --> 01:55:56,648
name and address for the record, please.

1370
01:55:56,668 --> 01:55:59,150
My name is Richard Orlando 13 Winford way.

1371
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:01,511
I'll try to be brief, very brief.

1372
01:56:02,232 --> 01:56:05,273
We've obviously know the implications of this to the taxpayers.

1373
01:56:06,354 --> 01:56:06,935
I hear about $500 $600.

1374
01:56:07,655 --> 01:56:17,981
There's the issue of what it might cover in the next year or two, but then I hear doesn't include the fire station, it doesn't include the roads, it doesn't include the high school.

1375
01:56:18,042 --> 01:56:18,222
So

1376
01:56:18,942 --> 01:56:21,103
This is just really the tip of the iceberg.

1377
01:56:21,664 --> 01:56:30,569
And what I see this as is more of a digging a hole and going deeper and deeper versus figuring out how to grow the community in the development.

1378
01:56:31,789 --> 01:56:36,932
I've been involved with many of the studies for development and they're still doing master planning.

1379
01:56:36,972 --> 01:56:44,016
We're spending more money with the current study going on, a very competent consultant, but there's nothing new coming up.

1380
01:56:44,236 --> 01:56:47,298
We knew the answer to the development, whether it be the square, Mr. Gaffney,

1381
01:56:47,778 --> 01:56:53,100
years ago, the time to take a step forward is well past due.

1382
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:57,041
And that's what really needs to be doing to generate the kind of revenue that's needed.

1383
01:56:57,962 --> 01:57:06,425
The concern is just, you know, you look at the mismanagement, you know, I've listed a number of things onto the respect for the citizens dollars.

1384
01:57:07,025 --> 01:57:11,927
There's been a flurry of hiring activity in the mayor's office for positions that I'm not even sure that we need.

1385
01:57:16,369 --> 01:57:24,205
We have a disturbing situation that I'm hearing there are over 40 legal actions against the city, many due to HR related.

1386
01:57:24,786 --> 01:57:27,452
Where is that money going to come from if the city loses out on that?

1387
01:57:28,522 --> 01:57:33,428
We operate we operate without a chief financial officer for six months and we just got a new gentleman.

1388
01:57:34,089 --> 01:57:35,010
Why did that happen?

1389
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:43,940
We lost a good person that had the ability and was willing to do the job and due to some mismanagement by the administration, we lost that person.

1390
01:57:44,361 --> 01:57:45,442
And I can go on and on.

1391
01:57:46,003 --> 01:57:46,803
I don't think our

1392
01:57:47,975 --> 01:57:49,516
Money is being used wisely.

1393
01:57:49,536 --> 01:57:58,141
I don't think the right people are being brought in to help and do and surround the administration with the kinds of skills they need for whatever reason.

1394
01:57:58,761 --> 01:58:05,825
And I think, again, I think the solution is growth and development in the city, and we have the ability to do that.

1395
01:58:06,285 --> 01:58:08,667
And might it be a bit of a lag catching up?

1396
01:58:08,867 --> 01:58:11,088
Yes, but that's what's gonna be needed.

1397
01:58:11,368 --> 01:58:14,030
Because surrounding communities, as Councilor Caravello says,

1398
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:16,291
They're not experiencing this.

1399
01:58:16,491 --> 01:58:16,771
Why?

1400
01:58:17,171 --> 01:58:19,572
Because they didn't sit down during COVID.

1401
01:58:19,932 --> 01:58:22,433
And I'm getting very tired of that excuse as well.

1402
01:58:22,713 --> 01:58:23,093
Thank you.

1403
01:58:29,675 --> 01:58:32,396
Former Councilor Marks, I'm happy to extend you some additional time.

1404
01:58:32,416 --> 01:58:41,940
I would just ask if one of my colleagues would be kind enough to suspend the rules to allow residents that took time out of their busy schedule

1405
01:58:42,786 --> 01:58:48,999
in the middle of the summer, waiting for two hours, that we would allot them a little more than two minutes.

1406
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:50,482
So if we could suspend the rules.

1407
01:58:54,308 --> 01:58:56,629
I've let folks speak to the end already.

1408
01:58:57,329 --> 01:59:00,210
If our rules say five minutes, I'm happy to keep it at five minutes.

1409
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:03,451
Thank you, and I appreciate that, Madam President.

1410
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:08,052
Michael Marks for the record, 37 Wellington Road.

1411
01:59:09,453 --> 01:59:18,516
It's been seven months since I've appeared before this body and in City Hall.

1412
01:59:19,436 --> 01:59:33,207
And the reason why I'm here tonight is because of the petition that is before us, which I believe strongly will hurt many, many people in this community.

1413
01:59:33,748 --> 01:59:35,229
And that's the reason why I'm here.

1414
01:59:38,311 --> 01:59:42,115
You know, we've had discussions before this body for many years.

1415
01:59:43,015 --> 01:59:45,998
And some of the council has brought up tonight about the process.

1416
01:59:47,368 --> 02:00:03,021
And I can recall being part of subcommittees that have met 15 to 20 times to discuss snow shoveling ordinances or leaf blower ordinances.

1417
02:00:04,515 --> 02:00:19,125
And here we have an issue of a prop two and a half override that's gonna cost the average taxpayer an additional 600 from the increase we just received in June on our taxes.

1418
02:00:20,246 --> 02:00:29,813
And have we had one subcommittee or committee of the whole to discuss this particular petition?

1419
02:00:30,494 --> 02:00:31,074
Have we had one?

1420
02:00:33,324 --> 02:00:34,337
So we haven't had one.

1421
02:00:35,570 --> 02:00:42,115
So when it gets brought up about process, I would agree that there has been no process.

1422
02:00:42,295 --> 02:00:47,359
And that is a major, major concern for me and many other people in this community.

1423
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,241
I appreciate the dialogue.

1424
02:00:49,441 --> 02:00:54,225
I know there's people on both sides and I appreciate the dialogue and I can see both sides.

1425
02:00:54,765 --> 02:01:03,412
But I think many of the comments that have been made tonight, which I will reiterate some of them because my colleagues have already put out great comments.

1426
02:01:04,156 --> 02:01:12,982
is the first is how much should a realistic budget be for the complete operations in the city of method?

1427
02:01:13,302 --> 02:01:16,964
Can anyone behind this real that's in favor of this 12 million?

1428
02:01:18,378 --> 02:01:22,679
state tonight, what is a realistic operational budget?

1429
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:29,041
Because if you're running a business, you know what your realistic operational budget is to run a business.

1430
02:01:29,521 --> 02:01:30,521
So what is it?

1431
02:01:31,022 --> 02:01:35,943
Can anyone behind the reel tell me what the realistic operational budget for this city?

1432
02:01:39,001 --> 02:01:41,403
It's a tough question, believe me, I know it is.

1433
02:01:41,803 --> 02:01:44,164
So we haven't answered that question.

1434
02:01:44,485 --> 02:01:45,745
What is a realistic budget?

1435
02:01:46,306 --> 02:01:49,208
Is 12 million on top of this budget realistic?

1436
02:01:49,288 --> 02:01:55,612
Is this gonna bring us to where we need to be, the promised land?

1437
02:01:56,372 --> 02:01:57,153
I don't believe so.

1438
02:01:58,834 --> 02:02:03,617
The second point is, can anyone behind this reel

1439
02:02:05,373 --> 02:02:11,418
refer to any budgetary study that outlines the complete financial needs of this community.

1440
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,202
Can anyone tell us

1441
02:02:17,432 --> 02:02:38,884
of a budgetary study I'd like, and I'm asking this as a question not, not to be facetious, I'm asking I'd like to know, because in my 20 years on the council, I can tell you firsthand, I was never part of any budgetary discussion regarding the operational needs of this community so I'd like to hear from the council because I think that's an important question.

1442
02:02:39,945 --> 02:02:43,107
We passed a resolution to that effect in June, and

1443
02:02:44,007 --> 02:02:47,037
You know, I've been saying we need one in the two years we served on the council.

1444
02:02:47,057 --> 02:02:50,087
So I agree with you that that that's a question that we need to answer.

1445
02:02:52,542 --> 02:03:00,689
Right, and I think that's an important question that needs to be answered before we put the cot before the horse, right?

1446
02:03:01,309 --> 02:03:07,034
And these are the things I think needed to be vetted out before we say, well, let's just let the voters decide.

1447
02:03:07,695 --> 02:03:12,178
I think as the leaders in this community, we all look up to you as leaders.

1448
02:03:12,659 --> 02:03:16,502
These are the questions I think that need to be answered before we take the next step.

1449
02:03:18,103 --> 02:03:24,745
When is the last time a complete and independent audit has been done of all city functions?

1450
02:03:31,327 --> 02:03:39,789
The reason why I ask is because when I was a member of the council, this council has always been on record asking for an independent audit.

1451
02:03:40,925 --> 02:03:49,891
And we used to always state that an independent audit is not done by the same firm that's been hired by the administration for the past 30 years.

1452
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:52,092
That is not an independent audit.

1453
02:03:52,753 --> 02:03:57,076
And I think members behind this reel could probably appreciate that.

1454
02:03:57,676 --> 02:04:02,459
So I think truly, if we're gonna move in a direction, and I'm not opposed to having these discussions.

1455
02:04:02,739 --> 02:04:04,901
I think this is healthy to be quite honest with you.

1456
02:04:05,141 --> 02:04:06,502
Put it on the table, discuss it.

1457
02:04:07,373 --> 02:04:09,915
But I think this information has to be on the table.

1458
02:04:10,595 --> 02:04:12,176
Have we had an independent audit?

1459
02:04:12,417 --> 02:04:13,437
The answer is no.

1460
02:04:14,298 --> 02:04:15,759
The answer is no.

1461
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:19,722
So when we look at, are there ways we can cut costs?

1462
02:04:19,782 --> 02:04:22,364
Are there ways that we can work more efficiently?

1463
02:04:23,024 --> 02:04:24,405
There absolutely is.

1464
02:04:24,425 --> 02:04:27,607
Are there things that we're doing that may be duplicate in nature?

1465
02:04:28,388 --> 02:04:29,309
Absolutely.

1466
02:04:30,244 --> 02:04:33,985
And council and I brought up one in particular about duplicate positions.

1467
02:04:34,505 --> 02:04:37,325
So there's a lot of that that hasn't been looked at.

1468
02:04:37,705 --> 02:04:41,506
You know, when we say let's look at the charter, everyone's on board.

1469
02:04:41,726 --> 02:04:45,327
And I was the first person to offer having the charter be reviewed.

1470
02:04:45,807 --> 02:04:48,567
I offered about seven or eight years ago before this council.

1471
02:04:49,007 --> 02:04:51,288
And it was sent to the state legislature and it died.

1472
02:04:51,648 --> 02:04:57,689
But everyone wants to review the charter because it's the operational framework, how this city works.

1473
02:04:58,129 --> 02:04:58,989
And it makes sense.

1474
02:04:59,841 --> 02:05:03,725
You wouldn't run a business and not change a business plan for 30 years.

1475
02:05:03,965 --> 02:05:04,866
You'd be out of business.

1476
02:05:05,887 --> 02:05:07,088
This city is no different.

1477
02:05:07,749 --> 02:05:13,614
Now we're running on a budget, like Councilor Knight said, that hasn't changed in 30 years.

1478
02:05:14,635 --> 02:05:20,801
Yes, it increases every year, but the physical budget itself hasn't changed in 30 years.

1479
02:05:22,612 --> 02:05:28,417
and throwing more money into the budget is not gonna solve any problems at all.

1480
02:05:28,798 --> 02:05:30,700
It's not gonna solve anything at all.

1481
02:05:35,884 --> 02:05:41,670
The following three questions need to be answered in order to support this proposal.

1482
02:05:43,378 --> 02:05:48,740
The first one, and I think we've got somewhat of an answer is, what will the average increase be?

1483
02:05:49,241 --> 02:05:56,384
And I think we heard tonight, we're looking at roughly 550,000 based on an assessed value of 650.

1484
02:05:56,964 --> 02:06:01,226
So that could be seven or $800 depending on your assessed value.

1485
02:06:03,447 --> 02:06:09,270
Coupled with the increase we just received

1486
02:06:09,845 --> 02:06:12,987
when the council and the mayor voted for the budget.

1487
02:06:14,008 --> 02:06:18,330
So the 550 is one portion of an increase.

1488
02:06:19,151 --> 02:06:21,612
The other portion, you just approved.

1489
02:06:22,673 --> 02:06:25,535
So when we look at the numbers, I think we have to put it in perspective.

1490
02:06:26,255 --> 02:06:26,676
It's not 550.

1491
02:06:26,776 --> 02:06:32,239
For many of us, it's well over $1,000 that the increase may be.

1492
02:06:32,259 --> 02:06:32,799
Well over $1,000.

1493
02:06:44,273 --> 02:06:46,697
Mr. Castagnetti, you had your moment to speak, can you please?

1494
02:06:46,777 --> 02:06:47,618
Right.

1495
02:06:47,718 --> 02:06:50,302
I think he said I was smart, so he can yell out any time he wants.

1496
02:06:50,322 --> 02:06:52,545
I think that's what he said.

1497
02:06:52,565 --> 02:06:56,511
Councilor Marks, I do, to your point, want to make sure we do hear from residents that are here to speak, so just.

1498
02:06:57,162 --> 02:06:59,944
No, I appreciate that.

1499
02:07:00,004 --> 02:07:02,626
But this is a very important issue for a lot of people.

1500
02:07:03,126 --> 02:07:07,809
I'm coming up here on behalf of the residents that reached out to me, to be quite honest with you.

1501
02:07:08,009 --> 02:07:10,091
That's why you haven't seen me in seven months.

1502
02:07:10,831 --> 02:07:12,993
This is a huge, huge issue.

1503
02:07:13,293 --> 02:07:16,095
And I would appreciate maybe if we could suspend the rules because

1504
02:07:16,917 --> 02:07:19,278
I don't feel like I've had five minutes and I feel rushed already.

1505
02:07:19,518 --> 02:07:19,818
It's not.

1506
02:07:19,858 --> 02:07:20,678
You've had seven minutes.

1507
02:07:20,858 --> 02:07:21,638
I've had seven minutes.

1508
02:07:21,698 --> 02:07:22,278
I'm already over.

1509
02:07:22,458 --> 02:07:25,939
Will someone suspend the rules to allow residents to speak before the podium?

1510
02:07:25,999 --> 02:07:27,580
We're allowing residents to speak.

1511
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:28,640
Right.

1512
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:30,761
But, but not fully, not fully.

1513
02:07:31,301 --> 02:07:36,602
I think we were all, you know, listening to many speeches tonight and we'd like to be able to speak.

1514
02:07:36,842 --> 02:07:37,482
It's important.

1515
02:07:37,642 --> 02:07:39,943
There's only, there's a dozen people.

1516
02:07:41,065 --> 02:07:44,827
There's a dozen people in the audience.

1517
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:46,948
I'm just encouraging if you want to hear from her.

1518
02:07:47,088 --> 02:07:53,811
If I may offer a compromise, why don't we allow everyone to speak once and use their a lot of time and then they can come back up and speak a second time.

1519
02:07:53,831 --> 02:07:55,352
We're not going to limit them to once.

1520
02:07:55,452 --> 02:07:56,773
Keep them within their five minute framework.

1521
02:07:56,793 --> 02:07:57,273
Let them speak.

1522
02:07:57,293 --> 02:08:01,475
If there are other people in line that want to come up and speak, let them and then we can keep talking until we're done.

1523
02:08:01,515 --> 02:08:04,337
No one's saying stop.

1524
02:08:04,717 --> 02:08:04,977
Okay.

1525
02:08:05,077 --> 02:08:06,278
Well, I appreciate it.

1526
02:08:06,298 --> 02:08:06,938
I'd like to finish.

1527
02:08:06,998 --> 02:08:08,399
I only have a few more minutes left.

1528
02:08:08,499 --> 02:08:10,400
I really appreciate finishing.

1529
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:18,084
So as we were mentioning, the 550 is not a realistic number for most residents in this community.

1530
02:08:18,364 --> 02:08:19,484
So that's question number one.

1531
02:08:19,805 --> 02:08:22,766
What actually will this cost the residents of this community?

1532
02:08:26,508 --> 02:08:27,749
There was a comment made tonight.

1533
02:08:28,929 --> 02:08:31,991
Each year, we're doing more with less.

1534
02:08:33,412 --> 02:08:35,993
That comment can't be furthest from the truth.

1535
02:08:37,183 --> 02:08:40,684
as a taxpayer for 30 years in this community, 30 years.

1536
02:08:41,204 --> 02:08:42,265
This is my 30th year.

1537
02:08:42,885 --> 02:08:46,426
Taxes have gone up each and every year for 30 years.

1538
02:08:46,446 --> 02:08:49,587
So I don't know how we're doing more with less.

1539
02:08:49,968 --> 02:08:54,829
The city is getting more money each and every year from the taxpayers of this community.

1540
02:08:55,129 --> 02:09:00,531
It may be not spent wisely, but they're getting more money each and every year from the taxpayers of this community.

1541
02:09:04,515 --> 02:09:06,097
I just want to put it out there.

1542
02:09:06,117 --> 02:09:09,361
I understand that in nominal terms that that's true.

1543
02:09:09,561 --> 02:09:15,668
If you adjust for inflation, two and a half percent per year has been below the rate of inflation.

1544
02:09:16,148 --> 02:09:23,116
So in real terms, the city's actually spending about the same or less than it was spending in 1980 in inflation adjusted dollars.

1545
02:09:23,157 --> 02:09:24,398
That's what I meant by that statement.

1546
02:09:25,662 --> 02:09:28,763
Well, as Councilor Wright said, I think it's a spending issue.

1547
02:09:28,803 --> 02:09:32,464
So I think that's what I'm trying to address.

1548
02:09:33,244 --> 02:09:39,606
The other question is, what impact will this have, this tax increase on our most vulnerable residents?

1549
02:09:40,006 --> 02:09:42,787
And I think that's the key and that's actually why I'm up here tonight.

1550
02:09:43,347 --> 02:09:54,810
So when we talk about seniors on fixed incomes, which my colleagues mentioned, we don't wanna address that, but truly people are making decisions whether they eat,

1551
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:56,272
or take medication.

1552
02:09:57,173 --> 02:10:00,017
And maybe members behind this reel don't see that.

1553
02:10:00,698 --> 02:10:04,103
You don't experience it, but it's happening in our community right now.

1554
02:10:04,984 --> 02:10:07,407
I'll tell you firsthand, it's happening in this community.

1555
02:10:07,948 --> 02:10:10,872
And we're asking residents to make that decision.

1556
02:10:11,809 --> 02:10:14,311
So I just want people to be aware of that.

1557
02:10:15,092 --> 02:10:29,463
What about the young families that paid top dollar for their home and brought in this community recently and have to decide whether their child will play sports, whether they'll go on vacation, whether they'll save for their college tuition.

1558
02:10:30,805 --> 02:10:33,547
These are the decisions that have to be made.

1559
02:10:34,488 --> 02:10:38,271
So it's easy to say, hey, look what 12 million will do for us.

1560
02:10:39,703 --> 02:10:42,746
But what's the collateral damage to that 12 million?

1561
02:10:43,888 --> 02:10:45,549
It's the seniors on fixed income.

1562
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:47,031
It's the families.

1563
02:10:47,391 --> 02:10:50,915
It's the renters that Councilor Caviello has mentioned in the past.

1564
02:10:52,136 --> 02:10:55,520
Many people, many landlords are going to pass this on to the renters.

1565
02:10:56,501 --> 02:10:57,562
And that's what's going to happen.

1566
02:10:58,512 --> 02:11:12,258
And as Councilor Caviello mentioned, what about the seniors in this community that brought their home 25, 30, 40 years ago in a property rich, like Councilor Caviello says, and income poor?

1567
02:11:12,278 --> 02:11:17,341
$500, I would submit to you, is a lot of money.

1568
02:11:17,981 --> 02:11:22,003
It's a lot of money for people on fixed incomes.

1569
02:11:23,396 --> 02:11:30,081
So I think, you know, when you talk about a cavalier, cavalier saying that, well, it's only 500, it's only 550.

1570
02:11:31,121 --> 02:11:36,145
And, you know, I think you gotta be mindful of who is living in this community.

1571
02:11:36,465 --> 02:11:41,208
And my last point, and I appreciate the time, believe me, and I don't wanna take up any more time.

1572
02:11:41,729 --> 02:11:43,370
We're in a time of uncertainty.

1573
02:11:43,790 --> 02:11:45,171
We're talking about inflation.

1574
02:11:45,431 --> 02:11:46,973
We're talking about recession.

1575
02:11:47,813 --> 02:11:53,298
And here we want to raise additional taxes on top of taxes we just raised.

1576
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:56,862
How blindsided is that?

1577
02:11:56,882 --> 02:12:05,110
We have to be living under a rock to say now is a good time to increase taxes again a second time.

1578
02:12:07,437 --> 02:12:11,578
So I think this is what you're hearing from the community, at least what I'm hearing from the community.

1579
02:12:11,898 --> 02:12:16,720
Maybe the council's tone deaf, certain members of the council, but this is what I'm hearing.

1580
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:18,441
Yeah, we all have a wishlist.

1581
02:12:18,721 --> 02:12:21,782
Streets should be done and so forth and more teachers.

1582
02:12:21,982 --> 02:12:26,763
We all have a wishlist, but we have to work within the confines of our budget.

1583
02:12:27,924 --> 02:12:33,106
And when we start pricing people out of this community, it's not a community I want to be part of.

1584
02:12:36,227 --> 02:12:37,167
I thank you very much.

1585
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:56,789
For your time, I thank you for your consideration, and I would only ask when you make your vote, make sure that those three subjects regarding the impact of people, regarding the cost, regarding how it's gonna affect each and every resident becomes part of your consideration.

1586
02:12:57,029 --> 02:12:57,409
Thank you.

1587
02:12:57,429 --> 02:12:58,210
Thank you.

1588
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:06,114
Name and address for the record, please.

1589
02:13:06,174 --> 02:13:08,335
Yes, Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street.

1590
02:13:10,107 --> 02:13:13,108
been a member of this community for over 40 years.

1591
02:13:15,108 --> 02:13:23,289
I am thinking about leaving Medford because it's not a place people want to live.

1592
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:24,930
We're being priced out.

1593
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:31,951
If you look around, a lot of the people here are over 65 and like myself, living on social security.

1594
02:13:31,971 --> 02:13:33,551
$20,000 a year is not a lot of money

1595
02:13:37,332 --> 02:13:44,936
the double digit inflation, 100% gas increase 20 to 40% food increase.

1596
02:13:45,496 --> 02:13:47,317
And I agree with Michael Marx.

1597
02:13:47,578 --> 02:13:52,820
Oh, first of all, I wanted to acknowledge you and the counselors and thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1598
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:53,381
I'm sorry.

1599
02:13:55,762 --> 02:13:56,042
Of course.

1600
02:13:56,622 --> 02:13:57,443
Oops, hang on.

1601
02:13:57,543 --> 02:13:58,383
Your mic just went off.

1602
02:13:58,824 --> 02:13:59,524
It'll come back on.

1603
02:13:59,544 --> 02:14:00,364
Just give it one moment.

1604
02:14:01,405 --> 02:14:02,065
Shane, just the mic.

1605
02:14:02,085 --> 02:14:04,126
There you go.

1606
02:14:04,387 --> 02:14:04,667
It's on.

1607
02:14:04,927 --> 02:14:06,027
Okay, sorry.

1608
02:14:08,288 --> 02:14:11,985
So, lost what I was going to say.

1609
02:14:13,725 --> 02:14:22,292
So it's very difficult to try and pay the bills, the heating's gone up, the electrical, everything costs more.

1610
02:14:22,632 --> 02:14:29,317
You hit us with one tax increase and now possible another and we're gonna be priced out of the community.

1611
02:14:29,898 --> 02:14:35,142
I also tried helping a person that I know very well to find an apartment here.

1612
02:14:35,462 --> 02:14:38,064
And for a studio apartment, it started at $2,800 a month.

1613
02:14:42,501 --> 02:14:43,422
Who can afford that.

1614
02:14:44,402 --> 02:14:51,066
And yet I see we keep building tenements to have people come in but people aren't going to be able to afford to live here.

1615
02:14:51,686 --> 02:15:05,094
And I do want to thank Michael Marx for mentioning the point I was going to bring up as a former business owner for over 30 years of an insurance agency that did very well in this city I might add.

1616
02:15:07,007 --> 02:15:09,569
I had a business plan, and I worked it.

1617
02:15:10,210 --> 02:15:18,458
And I also want to say something to the counselors that you were going to work less, but you didn't take the pay cut.

1618
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:24,782
If I worked less, I would have taken a pay cut.

1619
02:15:25,403 --> 02:15:29,125
But I worked 60 to 80 hours a week because I knew I had to.

1620
02:15:30,006 --> 02:15:31,186
And I did okay.

1621
02:15:31,767 --> 02:15:37,590
But all I hear is spending, spending, spending, and there hasn't been an independent audit.

1622
02:15:39,111 --> 02:15:44,815
And before you can spend, you need to know where the funds go or how they're being spent,

1623
02:15:47,077 --> 02:15:49,898
money is being spent if it's spent wisely.

1624
02:15:50,798 --> 02:15:57,180
In the early 2000s I was working with the Registry of Motor Vehicles for the Motorcycle Safety Education and Awareness.

1625
02:15:57,860 --> 02:16:04,502
We decided to do an audit of the registry for our safety funds because we felt like nothing was done.

1626
02:16:05,642 --> 02:16:09,063
We found just this one department, $189,000 that one year.

1627
02:16:13,558 --> 02:16:18,461
which got released to us so that we could spend it to help save lives here in the Commonwealth.

1628
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:20,122
This is prudent.

1629
02:16:20,562 --> 02:16:22,023
I don't see prudency here.

1630
02:16:22,063 --> 02:16:23,664
There's no transparency.

1631
02:16:24,044 --> 02:16:27,286
All we hear is we need money for this, we need money for that.

1632
02:16:27,646 --> 02:16:29,007
The city is crumbling.

1633
02:16:30,248 --> 02:16:42,035
You need to come together and find a way to take a look at the spending, have an independent audit on the committee

1634
02:16:43,407 --> 02:16:49,589
The counselor Scott Pelley mentioned, because I think that would benefit the residents.

1635
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:59,552
And you have to remember, we, you represent us, you represent what we want for the city.

1636
02:17:00,813 --> 02:17:05,034
And I appreciate all of your talking points.

1637
02:17:05,694 --> 02:17:10,156
What we want for the city is an affordable place that we can live in.

1638
02:17:11,328 --> 02:17:14,749
and love in, and that's not Medford right this moment.

1639
02:17:14,849 --> 02:17:15,290
Thank you.

1640
02:17:15,690 --> 02:17:16,030
Thank you.

1641
02:17:20,712 --> 02:17:21,892
You want to address for the record, please?

1642
02:17:22,613 --> 02:17:27,995
Good evening, Madam President, Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave in Medford.

1643
02:17:28,535 --> 02:17:33,857
I'm glad to be here tonight and miss the time that's been allotted to us.

1644
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:37,362
I just want to share a couple of notes.

1645
02:17:37,762 --> 02:17:39,203
Thank you, Michael Mox, for coming.

1646
02:17:39,864 --> 02:17:42,707
No one can really kind of follow him with some comments.

1647
02:17:43,667 --> 02:17:46,690
I just want to herald a couple of other fine speakers who are coming.

1648
02:17:47,831 --> 02:17:53,336
I'm a political peon, but I will admit something I learned a few weeks ago.

1649
02:17:53,356 --> 02:17:57,000
I had the very happy pleasure of being invited to share time

1650
02:17:57,697 --> 02:18:02,340
with a former mayor of a big, big city, not too far from here.

1651
02:18:02,921 --> 02:18:10,907
And we were talking about budgets, just talking about economics and how you know people get older and things change and whatnot and covert effects etc.

1652
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:28,763
He's heard that some people in towns have luck with almost catastrophic situations where override two and a half will be coming, and I said well I don't really know if we're kind of there yet.

1653
02:18:29,363 --> 02:18:36,185
He said the problem with cities who do get into that situation is they don't have the right people.

1654
02:18:36,865 --> 02:18:40,551
running the city, especially the budget.

1655
02:18:41,412 --> 02:18:50,325
So I do appreciate some of the facts that Adam and I came out with and others to in consideration in Adam car VLO.

1656
02:18:52,642 --> 02:19:02,952
that we have things that need to be addressed in this city, but this is the furthest thing, or the furthest answer that I thought of myself after reading the agenda, being a political peon.

1657
02:19:03,452 --> 02:19:11,920
For instance, when people need to be replaced, do you contribute in the hiring and the firing of that person?

1658
02:19:12,201 --> 02:19:13,282
We'd like to know.

1659
02:19:14,086 --> 02:19:22,915
And if somebody, can't you just have meetings with people, even with the mayor, and say, why can't some of these salaries be lowered?

1660
02:19:23,656 --> 02:19:31,183
In other words, if somebody were leaving or retiring at 85,000, why couldn't the new person come in at 79?

1661
02:19:31,704 --> 02:19:34,567
Why aren't ideas like that shared?

1662
02:19:34,587 --> 02:19:37,169
You don't think that you're really gonna get

1663
02:19:37,950 --> 02:19:48,465
poor people working, we have a host of colleges, we have people who major in finance at BU and Tufts, that the competition just trying to get in the door, they'd love a job like that.

1664
02:19:48,865 --> 02:19:53,511
I really think you need to continue to strive to work with this administration.

1665
02:19:54,072 --> 02:19:55,273
on ideas like that.

1666
02:19:55,773 --> 02:19:58,855
Also, some of the budgetary spending that might come up.

1667
02:19:59,635 --> 02:20:05,319
We heard also that five years ago, we had grants from the state to repair the roads.

1668
02:20:05,959 --> 02:20:10,922
Why haven't they been started, and we don't want to hear because they all can't be done started.

1669
02:20:11,442 --> 02:20:19,065
If the interior of my house needed to be painted, but I only had 2,000 instead of four, I certainly wouldn't stop the project for five years.

1670
02:20:19,425 --> 02:20:24,607
You need to blame yourselves partly too for not chasing after these projects.

1671
02:20:24,747 --> 02:20:31,129
I'm sorry, I respect the time that you give, but we all have contributing ideas.

1672
02:20:31,729 --> 02:20:37,931
Also, we'd like to know how many people, does anyone know what the rate is?

1673
02:20:38,972 --> 02:20:39,892
How many people own?

1674
02:20:40,625 --> 02:20:42,886
two-family and three-family homes in this city.

1675
02:20:43,727 --> 02:20:44,087
Do you know?

1676
02:20:45,188 --> 02:20:45,468
Okay.

1677
02:20:46,068 --> 02:20:50,271
We get, yeah, we get that information in the taxes, yeah.

1678
02:20:50,791 --> 02:21:01,437
So 550 to 600 a year for someone just like myself who has oddly now during the last eight to 10 years been thrown into renting the house by myself, sadly.

1679
02:21:03,478 --> 02:21:05,680
What about the people who have invested in Medford?

1680
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:09,262
They own a single and they bought a two-family and a three-family.

1681
02:21:10,123 --> 02:21:12,984
Their rate is gonna be very, very expensive.

1682
02:21:13,304 --> 02:21:14,845
So I look again to growth.

1683
02:21:15,645 --> 02:21:26,728
Method is becoming known by many people, former politicians too, and other towns, as a reactionary council, not an aggressive growth force.

1684
02:21:26,748 --> 02:21:30,189
Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to hearing some growth ideas.

1685
02:21:30,649 --> 02:21:31,550
Bye-bye, thank you.

1686
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:32,110
Thank you.

1687
02:21:37,015 --> 02:21:38,116
Name and address for the record, please.

1688
02:21:38,316 --> 02:21:43,280
Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.

1689
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:48,964
I'd like to read a line in the mayor's message today.

1690
02:21:49,285 --> 02:22:02,595
She wrote, even if we all agree that these additional expenditures on city services are helpful, we need to understand the sacrifices we're asking taxpayers to make and the other pressures they are under.

1691
02:22:04,016 --> 02:22:04,817
Sacrifices.

1692
02:22:05,858 --> 02:22:09,801
Madam Chairperson, you're the perfect example for this, what I wanna say.

1693
02:22:10,961 --> 02:22:15,124
You recently got married, and when you got married, you- No, I got married six years ago.

1694
02:22:15,144 --> 02:22:15,684
All right, okay.

1695
02:22:15,724 --> 02:22:16,145
Go on.

1696
02:22:16,285 --> 02:22:20,187
Okay, when you came to Medford, you moved to Medford a few years ago.

1697
02:22:20,287 --> 02:22:21,828
I've been in Medford almost 10 years, go on.

1698
02:22:21,848 --> 02:22:22,629
Almost 10, okay.

1699
02:22:22,649 --> 02:22:23,829
Well, I don't have an exact number.

1700
02:22:23,849 --> 02:22:24,870
All right, well- Let's put it that way.

1701
02:22:24,970 --> 02:22:26,991
If you wanna talk about my life, I'm happy to correct you.

1702
02:22:28,132 --> 02:22:32,273
of what you've got going through right now is the fact that you just have a nice brand new baby, okay?

1703
02:22:32,373 --> 02:22:33,434
And you're a brand new mother.

1704
02:22:33,934 --> 02:22:39,955
And that's very important for what I wanna say, because there's a cost factor that goes along with all of that.

1705
02:22:40,436 --> 02:22:42,976
It's a mental factor and it's a financial factor.

1706
02:22:43,236 --> 02:22:48,978
And I'm quite sure you realize what it costs now having a young child, what that entails on a daily basis.

1707
02:22:49,538 --> 02:22:55,140
When we hear the fact right now that there are additional pressures that are gonna be placed on individuals,

1708
02:22:56,297 --> 02:22:59,878
whether it's a single family, because that's the only one we heard, it was a single family.

1709
02:23:00,258 --> 02:23:04,820
We didn't hear about the two family, the three family, the condos, or the apartment dwellers.

1710
02:23:05,380 --> 02:23:07,961
We didn't hear that, that information hasn't been brought forward.

1711
02:23:08,201 --> 02:23:11,623
And it should have been brought forward if you're going to be thorough in this presentation.

1712
02:23:12,203 --> 02:23:18,845
And when you wanna talk about spending, or controlled spending, you need to talk about it.

1713
02:23:18,925 --> 02:23:20,846
So as Councilor Knight has alluded to,

1714
02:23:22,203 --> 02:23:25,024
not thinking this be the right way to go, and I agree with that.

1715
02:23:25,704 --> 02:23:44,010
You've never really had, as Councilor Marks alluded to, an outside independent order on every single department that would justify this council going into an administrative decision with the city administration to discuss, we need to now go into a Proposition 2 1⁄2 override.

1716
02:23:44,591 --> 02:23:48,352
You folks are sitting here tonight with not one city administration here.

1717
02:23:49,409 --> 02:23:50,631
I don't know if they were asked.

1718
02:23:51,192 --> 02:23:54,096
I don't know if it was intentional for them not to be asked.

1719
02:23:54,777 --> 02:24:02,528
But it would have made a big difference in trying to understand why we are at this stage at 12 and a half.

1720
02:24:02,928 --> 02:24:05,853
Two and a half weeks ago, you folks voted at a budget meeting.

1721
02:24:06,855 --> 02:24:14,783
At the beginning of the meeting, you voted seven to nothing not to approve the budget, but after the mayor came in and a quarter or two in the morning, you voted seven to nothing for the budget.

1722
02:24:15,263 --> 02:24:21,029
So what was asked for and what was gotten all took place between seven o'clock and quarter to in the morning.

1723
02:24:21,930 --> 02:24:23,932
Now, is that an exact budget science?

1724
02:24:23,972 --> 02:24:24,652
I don't think so.

1725
02:24:25,690 --> 02:24:26,771
Is that the right way to go?

1726
02:24:27,331 --> 02:24:30,414
You have a proposition here tonight being proposed to $12 million.

1727
02:24:30,874 --> 02:24:33,096
Where is the statistical information?

1728
02:24:33,576 --> 02:24:34,997
Where are the reports?

1729
02:24:35,438 --> 02:24:37,339
Where are the reports from the school department?

1730
02:24:37,539 --> 02:24:39,481
Not one school committee person is here.

1731
02:24:39,701 --> 02:24:41,843
Not one school administration person is here.

1732
02:24:42,063 --> 02:24:48,908
The superintendent should be here if she thought she was gonna be so lucky to get almost $6 million out of a $12 million proposal.

1733
02:24:49,369 --> 02:24:50,650
And then we go on the city side,

1734
02:24:51,310 --> 02:24:52,010
We're there.

1735
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:56,272
You have seven unions in this community, but there only seems to be two that have been recognized here.

1736
02:24:57,052 --> 02:25:07,375
And very conveniently, they don't mention the Veterans Affairs Office, the veterans in this community who paid who paid through their lives for us to be here and give our commentary.

1737
02:25:12,157 --> 02:25:14,098
To be exact, you need reports.

1738
02:25:14,658 --> 02:25:19,740
And the only way you can have a good report is to make sure that you require it.

1739
02:25:20,660 --> 02:25:20,840
Now,

1740
02:25:22,843 --> 02:25:26,487
I think I heard Councilor, I don't know where he disappeared to it's his resolution.

1741
02:25:27,148 --> 02:25:32,434
You know, Council bears I believe said you know we've been asking for the last seven months and this and that.

1742
02:25:33,355 --> 02:25:34,636
And the mayor hasn't come around.

1743
02:25:35,017 --> 02:25:39,842
Well you know something, who has the greatest power in this city to control the mayor.

1744
02:25:40,987 --> 02:25:42,428
It's the Medford City Council.

1745
02:25:43,069 --> 02:25:56,699
And what you also can do at any one given time, whatever that mayor, he or she wants, this council can vote against it until you guys and girls get what you want and what you ask for, because that's the way the game is played.

1746
02:25:57,180 --> 02:26:03,645
I'll help you if you help me, but if you're not gonna help me and you just go along and you vote for it, well, you're just as much

1747
02:26:04,805 --> 02:26:06,426
Just as much to blame think about it.

1748
02:26:07,046 --> 02:26:09,146
You've allowed these budgets to go forward.

1749
02:26:09,466 --> 02:26:13,327
And if you know they knew this was going on, and you did nothing about it.

1750
02:26:13,787 --> 02:26:17,928
And if you started in January asking for these financial reports and you didn't get them.

1751
02:26:18,669 --> 02:26:23,950
Then you should have stopped anything that came from the mayor's office, looking for approval until you got your reports.

1752
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:41,113
Your responsibility and for the city is to run its financial management, and when you have intermittent and you don't have administrators in this building that can come forward to explain what 12 and a half million dollars will do more than $550 on a single family home.

1753
02:26:41,693 --> 02:26:42,453
You got the doubles.

1754
02:26:42,713 --> 02:26:44,834
What about the commercial piece of people property.

1755
02:26:45,394 --> 02:26:51,175
You haven't even discussed them, and in the following years they keep going after two and a half automatically goes up each and every year.

1756
02:26:51,975 --> 02:26:55,156
It's something to really think about, because this is not chump change.

1757
02:26:55,776 --> 02:27:01,758
This isn't $1, $2, or $3 million that you probably could find if you went through that budget and you cut through it.

1758
02:27:02,258 --> 02:27:03,579
This is $12 million.

1759
02:27:04,439 --> 02:27:06,039
And who come up with the $12 million?

1760
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:07,660
Two counselors.

1761
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:11,161
Two counselors who don't even pay real estate tax.

1762
02:27:11,441 --> 02:27:12,781
They don't understand the value.

1763
02:27:23,312 --> 02:27:26,573
everyone pays taxes, regardless of their format.

1764
02:27:28,674 --> 02:27:32,956
I'm not engaging in a debate, I said no personal tax, please continue.

1765
02:27:33,836 --> 02:27:35,037
I'm gonna continue what I'm saying.

1766
02:27:35,277 --> 02:27:40,219
If you understood, if you paid real estate tax, you would understand the impact that this would.

1767
02:27:47,661 --> 02:27:49,142
Shame the mic is off.

1768
02:27:56,546 --> 02:27:57,687
I'll repeat myself.

1769
02:27:57,707 --> 02:28:00,569
Councillor Collins, if you'd like to invoke specific Councillors, I'm happy to have them speak.

1770
02:28:00,849 --> 02:28:01,530
Councillor Collins.

1771
02:28:02,010 --> 02:28:07,614
I just want to make a point of information and not to clarify only your point, Mr. Penta.

1772
02:28:08,495 --> 02:28:17,662
I'm a renter, so when people talk about Councillors foisting things off on renters, I'm not going to speak for all of them, but I just want to state again, as I have many times this term, that

1773
02:28:18,751 --> 02:28:23,493
I am one, and I pay taxes through my rent, as does every renter.

1774
02:28:23,853 --> 02:28:24,453
Please continue.

1775
02:28:24,473 --> 02:28:26,594
Now, you maybe missed my point.

1776
02:28:26,634 --> 02:28:34,656
My point was this, not owning the real estate and having to pay those additional taxes, that gets itself disseminated down to you as a renter.

1777
02:28:34,936 --> 02:28:40,298
So if you, as a renter, are gonna pay the difference in the increase, but you're putting the burden back onto the who.

1778
02:28:40,578 --> 02:28:43,639
And if she has a tax, if she's paying a rental tax,

1779
02:28:44,019 --> 02:28:53,805
that she can afford right now, maybe about a two or $300 a month increase, she won't be able to and that's what we're talking about people on fixed incomes, seniors on fixed income.

1780
02:28:54,005 --> 02:28:57,787
And when you hear the story, when you're watching on television, every dollar counts.

1781
02:28:58,127 --> 02:28:59,528
Is it going to be for my medicine?

1782
02:28:59,708 --> 02:29:01,689
Is it going to be for my where I'm living?

1783
02:29:01,949 --> 02:29:03,670
Is it going to be to put gas in my car?

1784
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:04,791
Is it going to be for food?

1785
02:29:05,091 --> 02:29:06,492
Is it going to be that I can't go out?

1786
02:29:06,532 --> 02:29:07,333
I got to stay home?

1787
02:29:08,153 --> 02:29:09,415
That's what we're dealing with right now.

1788
02:29:09,435 --> 02:29:13,100
You're dealing with an economic impact in this country that's affecting everybody.

1789
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:20,409
And that $12 million will kill this city of Medford because the city of Medford will never recover from something like that.

1790
02:29:20,650 --> 02:29:22,332
If you vote for that, you're going to...

1791
02:29:23,333 --> 02:29:27,775
If you vote for that $12 million, you're going to take away what Medford is all about.

1792
02:29:28,536 --> 02:29:30,137
Councilor Knight was absolutely right.

1793
02:29:30,777 --> 02:29:38,541
Sit down, have a discussion, go over the whole thing, and ask for an independent outside audit to address all these departments.

1794
02:29:38,942 --> 02:29:40,182
That's what you need to do.

1795
02:29:43,224 --> 02:29:44,925
You know, we're too good of a city.

1796
02:29:44,965 --> 02:29:48,507
We are way too good of a city to let something like this happen.

1797
02:29:49,552 --> 02:29:59,278
We've sat here for years with former counselors and myself, and we never, never experienced anything that was presented in the middle of the night.

1798
02:30:00,559 --> 02:30:05,062
That's what July is, it's the heat of the night, it's hot out, it's almost 90 degrees.

1799
02:30:06,413 --> 02:30:09,296
where the people that this hall should be full of people.

1800
02:30:09,617 --> 02:30:22,192
And it's not because as Councilman alluded to, there was an issue way back a couple of two or three years ago in Mystic Avenue in the month of August when they had a public hearing and all the people showed up and they got so scared as to what's going on, they canceled the meeting.

1801
02:30:22,412 --> 02:30:24,214
And after they canceled the meeting, they took the vote.

1802
02:30:24,835 --> 02:30:25,956
No way should this happen.

1803
02:30:26,757 --> 02:30:28,999
Let me just leave you with this last thing.

1804
02:30:29,499 --> 02:30:43,869
Your own Rule 19 on the Medford City Council states that the Medford City Council shall not approve of any bond or expenditure that does not have a written explanation of such expenditure at least seven days prior to said vote.

1805
02:30:44,229 --> 02:30:47,211
You got this three to four days prior to today.

1806
02:30:47,652 --> 02:30:49,033
That's not seven days.

1807
02:30:49,353 --> 02:30:53,135
You cannot even vote on this tonight because your own rules say it.

1808
02:30:53,676 --> 02:30:55,257
And your own rules also state

1809
02:30:57,012 --> 02:31:15,205
The following any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time, shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any one member, I'm quite sure there was at least one number here willing to put that on the table unless they have another motion to go by, you know,

1810
02:31:15,965 --> 02:31:18,506
I didn't mean to get to an argument with you and I wasn't trying to be right.

1811
02:31:18,546 --> 02:31:19,587
I was just trying to compliment you.

1812
02:31:19,607 --> 02:31:21,147
I got my day years mixed up.

1813
02:31:21,528 --> 02:31:30,131
The fact of the matter is I look at individuals today and I say to myself, how do they afford seven $800,000 houses?

1814
02:31:30,712 --> 02:31:33,613
How do they afford when they have two cars and they have kids running all over?

1815
02:31:33,833 --> 02:31:37,275
Maybe you must be maxed out to the answer degree in debt.

1816
02:31:38,447 --> 02:31:39,828
We never did that growing up.

1817
02:31:39,848 --> 02:31:42,631
We worked for everything we got and we went along as we went.

1818
02:31:43,452 --> 02:31:45,714
This is huge, $12 million.

1819
02:31:46,315 --> 02:31:51,961
This isn't $1 million or even two that maybe you can figure out how to massage your budget.

1820
02:31:52,521 --> 02:31:53,603
It doesn't work that way.

1821
02:31:54,860 --> 02:32:06,186
to be good counselors, dismiss this action right now, move yourself into a committee to meet with department heads, hire an outside independent auditor to come in.

1822
02:32:06,406 --> 02:32:17,932
If you could spend, as Councilor Knight said, $300,000 for an outside law firm that should be doing exactly what this law firm and the city of Memphis is paying for, there is something wrong.

1823
02:32:19,013 --> 02:32:19,373
Thank you.

1824
02:32:25,730 --> 02:32:31,394
Name and address for the record, please, and then I'm gonna just go to folks on Zoom that have had their hand up, and I'll go back and forth.

1825
02:32:31,414 --> 02:32:33,175
They're just folks on Zoom that have had their hand up for a while.

1826
02:32:33,235 --> 02:32:35,737
So give it a second for the mic to come back on.

1827
02:32:35,757 --> 02:32:38,479
I don't know why, there we go.

1828
02:32:38,759 --> 02:32:39,840
Name and address for the record, please.

1829
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:41,301
All right, okay.

1830
02:32:41,401 --> 02:32:42,802
Shane, I don't know if the mic is going on.

1831
02:32:43,242 --> 02:32:44,042
There, okay, it's on.

1832
02:32:45,243 --> 02:32:46,444
Okay, okay, don't touch anything.

1833
02:32:46,484 --> 02:32:47,185
Just don't touch anything.

1834
02:32:47,225 --> 02:32:49,306
He'll do it in there, and it'll stay on.

1835
02:32:49,626 --> 02:32:50,247
There you go.

1836
02:32:50,507 --> 02:32:51,888
It should stay on, just don't touch it.

1837
02:32:52,467 --> 02:32:55,593
Edward Lunningham, 64 Forest Street.

1838
02:32:57,496 --> 02:33:01,623
I could sum this up with two words, government waste.

1839
02:33:02,685 --> 02:33:04,749
And I say that in two examples.

1840
02:33:06,126 --> 02:33:07,907
Three weeks ago, the mayor was here.

1841
02:33:08,587 --> 02:33:12,369
You guys had her on the ropes with 46 lawsuits.

1842
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,490
Why?

1843
02:33:14,050 --> 02:33:16,532
That question was not asked the mayor.

1844
02:33:17,112 --> 02:33:19,413
Why is there 46 lawsuits?

1845
02:33:19,994 --> 02:33:24,216
Maybe $12 million is not gonna cover 46 lawsuits.

1846
02:33:25,677 --> 02:33:26,097
Okay?

1847
02:33:26,978 --> 02:33:31,220
So she got off the hook with there, but guess what?

1848
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:34,642
46 people are not gonna go away and it's gonna come out.

1849
02:33:36,028 --> 02:33:40,172
Number two, Mr. Beers, you talk about infrastructure.

1850
02:33:40,793 --> 02:33:44,817
Let's talk about Mystic Avenue that was done eight months ago.

1851
02:33:45,978 --> 02:33:50,423
Eight months, it was dug up six different times, okay?

1852
02:33:51,084 --> 02:33:56,389
Where was the clerk of courts in Councilor Mark's words?

1853
02:33:57,449 --> 02:34:00,710
Why was it dug up after eight months?

1854
02:34:01,470 --> 02:34:08,831
Infrastructure, you want to talk about infrastructure, you do the job the first time the right way, not over and over again.

1855
02:34:08,851 --> 02:34:20,514
I go on that road to coffee every single morning, not just six different spots that have been dug over because of poor drainage that wasn't done the first time.

1856
02:34:21,594 --> 02:34:26,295
Right in front of the VFW, the manholes are rattling.

1857
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:29,484
So it's gonna be dug up again.

1858
02:34:31,127 --> 02:34:35,936
So you won't talk about infrastructure to the job the first time, sir.

1859
02:34:37,632 --> 02:34:39,913
and stop wasting taxpayers' money.

1860
02:34:40,033 --> 02:34:42,853
Just a point of information on that.

1861
02:34:43,073 --> 02:34:44,394
That actually wasn't taxpayer money.

1862
02:34:44,414 --> 02:34:45,934
That was the Eversource project.

1863
02:34:46,714 --> 02:34:52,576
And this council was having resolutions and meetings asking specifically for what you were asking for around that.

1864
02:34:52,956 --> 02:34:55,296
We don't control the DPW.

1865
02:34:55,776 --> 02:35:00,978
All we can do is try to hold them accountable, which this council and these councillors did with multiple resolutions and meetings.

1866
02:35:01,158 --> 02:35:01,518
Thank you.

1867
02:35:02,178 --> 02:35:05,379
Well, excuse me, but in the words of the mayor,

1868
02:35:06,684 --> 02:35:11,007
Nothing can be done if someone's held accountable, and that's where it all begins.

1869
02:35:13,508 --> 02:35:16,790
I'm going to go to Dave McKenna on Zoom, and then we'll come right back.

1870
02:35:17,891 --> 02:35:19,712
Mr. McKenna, name and address for the record, please.

1871
02:35:20,993 --> 02:35:22,234
Yes, David McKenna.

1872
02:35:22,254 --> 02:35:24,395
I live at 2 Vine Street in Medford.

1873
02:35:26,296 --> 02:35:30,238
I wanted to offer some comments in favor of this resolution.

1874
02:35:30,258 --> 02:35:31,839
So I do support the resolution.

1875
02:35:32,039 --> 02:35:36,042
I think that we need to invest more in our city.

1876
02:35:36,757 --> 02:35:46,042
And I just wanted to give a couple examples of how I feel like this resolution would deliver value, we've heard a lot about the cost and there will be costs but it will also deliver a lot of value.

1877
02:35:46,583 --> 02:35:48,303
One example is street trees.

1878
02:35:49,004 --> 02:35:57,288
So I live on vine street in East Medford, and my whole neighborhood is full of tree stumps right on the south side of my house there's been a tree stump for two years.

1879
02:35:59,145 --> 02:36:01,586
The chambers could be quiet so we can hear the gentleman speaking.

1880
02:36:01,906 --> 02:36:02,287
Thank you.

1881
02:36:02,307 --> 02:36:03,847
Continue.

1882
02:36:03,867 --> 02:36:07,649
I've been waiting for two years for the city to replace the tree next to my house.

1883
02:36:08,210 --> 02:36:09,530
And it's the south side of the house.

1884
02:36:09,570 --> 02:36:10,591
It's sunny side.

1885
02:36:10,691 --> 02:36:18,595
And my electric bill has gone up because now to pay for my air conditioning, you know, the whole neighborhood would be cooler if we had more street trees.

1886
02:36:18,635 --> 02:36:22,177
That's value that we could invest in our city and build up our city.

1887
02:36:22,677 --> 02:36:24,398
Another example is road repairs.

1888
02:36:24,918 --> 02:36:27,980
Every time I go to do errands and I drive on Riverside Avenue,

1889
02:36:28,497 --> 02:36:32,739
My car gets damaged because it's the worst road I've ever driven on in my life.

1890
02:36:32,939 --> 02:36:35,840
I can't believe Riverside Avenue has not been fixed up.

1891
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:37,340
It's in terrible shape.

1892
02:36:37,841 --> 02:36:43,883
And so that would really deliver value to me personally and everybody who drives on Riverside to do their shopping.

1893
02:36:44,843 --> 02:36:46,504
I think that's an investment we could make.

1894
02:36:47,664 --> 02:36:53,307
I wanna talk about the money, $6 million for our schools that would allow them to expand afterschool programming.

1895
02:36:53,927 --> 02:36:56,828
Medford has a world-class afterschool program for kids.

1896
02:36:57,246 --> 02:36:58,526
but there's a long wait list.

1897
02:36:59,427 --> 02:37:06,249
Not everybody is getting into this program and so working parents don't have that service to take care of their kids.

1898
02:37:06,650 --> 02:37:13,732
That's a burden and that's a value that we could deliver if we pass this resolution, that would be a value for our citizens.

1899
02:37:14,372 --> 02:37:17,093
And the last one I wanna talk about is building maintenance.

1900
02:37:17,914 --> 02:37:21,815
Everybody tonight has been talking about how we don't maintain buildings in Medford.

1901
02:37:21,895 --> 02:37:26,697
Every time I'm on the Facebook politics page, I hear that we haven't been maintaining our buildings in Medford

1902
02:37:27,253 --> 02:37:28,194
That takes money.

1903
02:37:29,195 --> 02:37:40,003
And so that would be another value that we could deliver to extend the life of our brand new library, police station, and the schools that are about 20 years old now.

1904
02:37:40,444 --> 02:37:51,093
We could extend the life of those buildings with more revenue, continuous revenue to do the maintenance that we know we need to be doing, but we haven't made a decision to invest yet.

1905
02:37:51,273 --> 02:37:54,816
So those are just four reasons where I support the resolution.

1906
02:37:54,876 --> 02:37:56,337
I think it delivers a lot of value.

1907
02:37:56,761 --> 02:38:03,165
There is a cost, but I wish that people could also look at the value that's delivered here.

1908
02:38:03,245 --> 02:38:08,348
So I encourage all the councilors to support the resolution and I thank you for your time.

1909
02:38:09,468 --> 02:38:09,829
Thank you.

1910
02:38:10,649 --> 02:38:11,690
Name and address for the record, please.

1911
02:38:12,610 --> 02:38:14,131
My name is Paul Garrity.

1912
02:38:14,191 --> 02:38:16,653
I live at Cheetah Road in Medford.

1913
02:38:17,753 --> 02:38:19,494
Madam President, councilors, thank you.

1914
02:38:19,514 --> 02:38:20,995
It's been a long evening.

1915
02:38:22,176 --> 02:38:23,597
I've listened to many of the,

1916
02:38:24,338 --> 02:38:29,622
comments that I made and that I had reflected in my own notes, so I've thrown them out the door, and I wanted to take a different tact.

1917
02:38:30,923 --> 02:38:32,384
What I'm hearing is that we have a problem.

1918
02:38:32,404 --> 02:38:38,668
In any good approach to dealing with a situation like that, you define the problem statement.

1919
02:38:39,569 --> 02:38:46,754
I'm looking at, we either have a short-term funding, trying to solve it with a long-term solution, permanent tax assessment.

1920
02:38:47,855 --> 02:38:52,018
In reality, what I really think we have is a systemic funding issue

1921
02:38:52,938 --> 02:38:55,119
but we have no revenue plan to deal with it.

1922
02:38:55,840 --> 02:39:01,063
So step one is that we need to come together and say, what is the problem?

1923
02:39:02,123 --> 02:39:09,408
And if we do agree on the problem statement, we got a consensus point that we can begin the journey together to solve this mess.

1924
02:39:10,969 --> 02:39:12,049
I would venture to say that,

1925
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:16,361
Every time I turn into the council, I hear the complaint.

1926
02:39:16,441 --> 02:39:17,101
I don't have the data.

1927
02:39:17,141 --> 02:39:19,282
I don't know what's going on.

1928
02:39:19,723 --> 02:39:29,687
Why do we have a process in place that collects data in the city so that the council, the administration, the public at large can see what's going on?

1929
02:39:31,748 --> 02:39:34,170
To get data, you need to have a mechanism.

1930
02:39:34,590 --> 02:39:37,031
I have gone through the city hall.

1931
02:39:38,252 --> 02:39:40,893
The IT infrastructure is lacking.

1932
02:39:41,963 --> 02:39:43,624
We need to have a serious investment.

1933
02:39:43,644 --> 02:39:44,945
You wanna know what to do with the ARPA funds?

1934
02:39:45,365 --> 02:39:50,828
Build out your network, get your servers, your clients, all of the necessary hardware in place.

1935
02:39:51,629 --> 02:40:05,477
The other thing that's missing, and I've talked to the administration about this, they have a firm image working on the physical level, but spending 30 years in the industry, I believe it's not the right person for the whole package.

1936
02:40:05,557 --> 02:40:09,039
They're functioning at the physical level, they're looking at security,

1937
02:40:09,638 --> 02:40:12,358
but they're not looking at the most important thing that you people need.

1938
02:40:12,939 --> 02:40:13,899
How do we collect the data?

1939
02:40:14,439 --> 02:40:30,882
We need to invest in some kind of enterprise software resource planning tool so that you people can get the data to find out what's going on in each department, as Councilor Nye has pointed out, and start to say, what are we obligated to deliver?

1940
02:40:31,742 --> 02:40:32,902
Is it properly sourced?

1941
02:40:32,922 --> 02:40:34,182
Do we have the right people there?

1942
02:40:34,662 --> 02:40:35,702
The correct number of people?

1943
02:40:36,423 --> 02:40:37,603
Do we have the tools they need?

1944
02:40:37,623 --> 02:40:38,743
Do they have the right space?

1945
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:43,163
You're never gonna solve this problem if you have the appropriate data at hand.

1946
02:40:43,243 --> 02:40:45,164
And it should be enterprise-wide.

1947
02:40:45,204 --> 02:40:47,746
We shouldn't be having the school department does this, city does that.

1948
02:40:48,087 --> 02:40:51,369
You need to come together with a central cleaning facility.

1949
02:40:51,530 --> 02:40:52,570
It needs to be a tool.

1950
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:55,073
It needs to be proselytized because people come and go.

1951
02:40:55,433 --> 02:40:56,073
Mayors come and go.

1952
02:40:56,093 --> 02:40:57,134
Councillors come and go.

1953
02:40:57,755 --> 02:41:07,323
You need to have a permanent process that lives on so that as different administrations and different people come, you're not starting all over again from scratch.

1954
02:41:09,388 --> 02:41:13,469
Once you've got the information in hand, then you need to say, let's set our goals.

1955
02:41:14,049 --> 02:41:27,133
I will admit to you, Council Baird, you and I are at odds many times, but when you came forward and said you'd have goals, milestones, completion dates, and a revenue plan, I agree with you.

1956
02:41:27,914 --> 02:41:29,554
You fell short on the revenue plan.

1957
02:41:31,055 --> 02:41:31,655
Once you have the,

1958
02:41:32,905 --> 02:41:37,786
of some kind of process in place we're gonna go after, then you start to work at it.

1959
02:41:38,127 --> 02:41:40,507
You say, if I set my priorities, how do I set my priorities?

1960
02:41:40,527 --> 02:41:46,789
Well, I have this service delivery I have to get to, but what's the most effective and efficient way to deliver it?

1961
02:41:47,289 --> 02:41:49,830
Effective means it's the right one, efficient means I can pay for it.

1962
02:41:51,410 --> 02:41:53,031
So that says to me, where's the revenue gonna come from?

1963
02:41:53,111 --> 02:41:56,672
I've spoken to many of you people around this table about a redevelopment authority.

1964
02:41:57,152 --> 02:41:58,212
Tell them, blow them on the face.

1965
02:41:58,852 --> 02:42:00,253
There's millions of dollars

1966
02:42:01,258 --> 02:42:04,000
On Mr. Gav, there's 3 million square feet.

1967
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:08,682
If I get three bucks a square foot, I'm gonna have $9 million in my pocket.

1968
02:42:11,604 --> 02:42:18,548
Finally, once we get through all of that stuff, I'm always saying, well, this person's left me.

1969
02:42:18,868 --> 02:42:19,688
We lost all that knowledge.

1970
02:42:20,108 --> 02:42:25,071
You can build a knowledge base of data that you can go back and refer to and work from.

1971
02:42:26,232 --> 02:42:30,134
So until you start to find your problem, agree upon that problem,

1972
02:42:30,713 --> 02:42:32,758
We're gonna be fighting here till the cops come home.

1973
02:42:33,038 --> 02:42:33,399
Thank you.

1974
02:42:34,221 --> 02:42:34,502
Thank you.

1975
02:42:40,233 --> 02:42:41,313
Name and address for the record, please.

1976
02:42:41,393 --> 02:42:44,214
Good evening, Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1977
02:42:44,314 --> 02:42:52,117
I fully support fixing Riverside Ave, because I'm the guy that lives on the street that has to drive up and down that terrible road every day.

1978
02:42:52,437 --> 02:42:53,537
And I've been saying it for years.

1979
02:42:53,637 --> 02:42:59,019
So on that point to the gentleman out in Zoom land, fully agree with you on that.

1980
02:42:59,079 --> 02:43:00,439
I've been saying that one for years.

1981
02:43:00,499 --> 02:43:04,081
And in fact, they've been digging that thing up, National Grid, the water, this, that.

1982
02:43:04,181 --> 02:43:05,041
It's a disaster.

1983
02:43:05,161 --> 02:43:07,762
It's been a disaster for years without a plan.

1984
02:43:08,715 --> 02:43:10,937
We have a DPW that doesn't have a plan.

1985
02:43:11,377 --> 02:43:13,579
I think there are some efficiencies we can pick up.

1986
02:43:13,759 --> 02:43:16,220
Councilor Behrs, I appreciate the situation you're in.

1987
02:43:16,441 --> 02:43:17,101
It sucks.

1988
02:43:17,441 --> 02:43:19,243
Let's just put it that way, okay?

1989
02:43:19,623 --> 02:43:22,565
Nobody wants to talk about tax increases ever.

1990
02:43:23,065 --> 02:43:23,886
It's a crappy spot.

1991
02:43:25,647 --> 02:43:27,669
Well, yeah, sure.

1992
02:43:27,789 --> 02:43:29,130
Everyone loves slings and arrows.

1993
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:35,334
And I think the residents do appreciate, you know, like I said, nobody wants to take anything in the shorts.

1994
02:43:35,514 --> 02:43:38,376
Please know people do appreciate the work you do.

1995
02:43:39,706 --> 02:43:41,788
And we know that there's some hard decisions to be made.

1996
02:43:41,868 --> 02:43:42,948
So thanks for letting us be heard.

1997
02:43:44,389 --> 02:43:47,672
That said, I do have a list of things so I could try to be efficient.

1998
02:43:48,152 --> 02:43:49,493
I live on Riverside Ave.

1999
02:43:49,953 --> 02:43:56,498
There's been a crap ton of development on Riverside Ave and Locust Street and all around my side of the city.

2000
02:43:57,038 --> 02:43:58,699
And I'm not gonna get personal attacks.

2001
02:43:58,739 --> 02:44:06,764
I am gonna say that there are folks that live in one half of the city where you would never be putting mega apartment complexes and doing a whole bunch of development.

2002
02:44:07,645 --> 02:44:10,107
And they also have different schools their kids can get into.

2003
02:44:10,407 --> 02:44:17,193
If you live on the wrong side of the city, now I've got to try to get my kids into a lottery in order to go to the better schools.

2004
02:44:18,774 --> 02:44:20,035
Arlington doesn't do that.

2005
02:44:20,135 --> 02:44:21,557
Lexington doesn't do that.

2006
02:44:21,657 --> 02:44:25,039
If we're trying to keep up with the Joneses, then let's keep up with the Joneses.

2007
02:44:26,801 --> 02:44:27,722
Is that what's happening?

2008
02:44:27,782 --> 02:44:29,303
Is that why we need a new school?

2009
02:44:29,563 --> 02:44:30,844
Because Arlington built one?

2010
02:44:31,605 --> 02:44:35,248
I don't live in Arlington because there's no way in heck I could afford it.

2011
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:43,643
No way, my house, you can say on paper and I agree with you what the paper says, what Zillow says and this and that about my house.

2012
02:44:44,063 --> 02:44:46,724
My house is a crap hole, okay?

2013
02:44:47,084 --> 02:44:54,327
I bought it for $340,000 because that's what I could afford before my wife and I were married, before I had a rug rat.

2014
02:44:56,043 --> 02:44:56,283
Right?

2015
02:44:56,724 --> 02:44:58,748
Kids just make everything cheaper, don't they?

2016
02:44:58,808 --> 02:45:01,572
All those tax credits you get, sure, no problem, right?

2017
02:45:01,672 --> 02:45:02,714
I'm being facetious.

2018
02:45:02,874 --> 02:45:04,016
Tell me I'm wrong.

2019
02:45:04,357 --> 02:45:07,041
I had my kid three days before the end of the year, so it wasn't that bad.

2020
02:45:09,175 --> 02:45:11,015
Just wait, just wait.

2021
02:45:11,996 --> 02:45:13,496
Daycare, there's other things, right?

2022
02:45:13,576 --> 02:45:14,496
I'm a young family.

2023
02:45:14,796 --> 02:45:17,377
So you can sit there and tell me, great, my house is worth $500,000.

2024
02:45:18,197 --> 02:45:20,078
There's a reason why I paid 340 for it.

2025
02:45:20,238 --> 02:45:21,858
One, that's what the budget I could support.

2026
02:45:21,878 --> 02:45:23,559
And my parents are gone.

2027
02:45:24,019 --> 02:45:25,659
I don't have a well to go back to.

2028
02:45:26,359 --> 02:45:27,180
I gotta work more.

2029
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,280
My wife has to work more, if we can.

2030
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:31,121
We're both salaried already, maxed out.

2031
02:45:31,241 --> 02:45:32,581
Someone's gotta actually watch the kid.

2032
02:45:33,492 --> 02:45:34,893
I appreciate y'all being here.

2033
02:45:35,053 --> 02:45:36,394
I wanna go home to my kid too.

2034
02:45:36,454 --> 02:45:38,936
In fact, I missed bedtime an hour ago.

2035
02:45:39,836 --> 02:45:41,918
So I know you know how that is, right?

2036
02:45:43,278 --> 02:45:45,160
So, but we have personal budgets.

2037
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:48,642
We have to stick to them because there's no more well to go to.

2038
02:45:49,082 --> 02:45:50,343
We do that in our families, right?

2039
02:45:50,403 --> 02:45:51,344
Responsible people.

2040
02:45:51,784 --> 02:45:53,485
The city has a spending problem.

2041
02:45:53,545 --> 02:45:57,047
The city's had a spending problem since I moved here in 2014.

2042
02:45:57,488 --> 02:45:58,789
It was painfully obvious.

2043
02:45:59,529 --> 02:46:02,031
And when I hear the council say, there's nothing I can do.

2044
02:46:03,145 --> 02:46:04,786
Okay, dissolve the council.

2045
02:46:05,026 --> 02:46:08,047
There's $210,000 saved in the budget right now.

2046
02:46:08,067 --> 02:46:09,747
If there's nothing you can do, why are we here?

2047
02:46:11,488 --> 02:46:12,608
That's just quick math, sorry.

2048
02:46:12,628 --> 02:46:13,489
I know it's a little fudgy.

2049
02:46:13,509 --> 02:46:17,290
It might be more, it might be less, but 30,000 times seven is 210, right?

2050
02:46:21,471 --> 02:46:22,932
So, sometimes you still.

2051
02:46:24,775 --> 02:46:27,518
All right, so that said, other things that we've done here.

2052
02:46:27,658 --> 02:46:33,305
Let's see, we've already increased tax revenue on the residents with this thing called parking since I moved here.

2053
02:46:33,585 --> 02:46:34,687
You didn't have to pay for parking.

2054
02:46:35,648 --> 02:46:37,009
Who pays the most for parking?

2055
02:46:38,050 --> 02:46:39,711
Do you think it's people from the outside?

2056
02:46:39,951 --> 02:46:42,793
Are they really flocking to Medford Square to go pay for parking?

2057
02:46:43,213 --> 02:46:48,276
Or is it your residents that are keeping your businesses alive, and now they gotta pay effectively in addition to tax?

2058
02:46:48,316 --> 02:46:53,599
The city budget actually pays the most for parking, because it went from not paying anything to now paying over a million dollars a year.

2059
02:46:54,019 --> 02:46:56,161
Great, get rid of the parking and save a million!

2060
02:46:58,248 --> 02:47:00,469
But who's footing that bill?

2061
02:47:00,749 --> 02:47:01,669
It's your residents.

2062
02:47:02,249 --> 02:47:03,410
This isn't Cambridge.

2063
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:04,970
This isn't Somerville.

2064
02:47:05,050 --> 02:47:07,211
There is no assembly square to go to.

2065
02:47:07,891 --> 02:47:10,672
If I wanna go to a bar around here, where do I go?

2066
02:47:11,452 --> 02:47:12,572
I go to Somerville.

2067
02:47:13,792 --> 02:47:15,453
I'm spending my money somewhere else.

2068
02:47:15,493 --> 02:47:18,314
Now I'm a parent and I have a budget and I can't afford to go to a bar.

2069
02:47:18,374 --> 02:47:19,314
So I gotta stay home.

2070
02:47:19,614 --> 02:47:20,774
And that's a choice I gotta make.

2071
02:47:20,814 --> 02:47:21,575
That's a tough choice.

2072
02:47:21,895 --> 02:47:22,695
I don't go out to eat.

2073
02:47:23,919 --> 02:47:24,799
It's not that I'm poor.

2074
02:47:25,059 --> 02:47:29,621
We could reel it back to, I appreciate it, but just reel it back to the two and a half.

2075
02:47:30,021 --> 02:47:30,221
Right?

2076
02:47:30,481 --> 02:47:32,742
But I mean, this is what we have to deal with.

2077
02:47:33,502 --> 02:47:38,384
So, you know, we've got parking now that is taxed on your residents.

2078
02:47:39,384 --> 02:47:41,685
We hired an outside consultant

2079
02:47:43,727 --> 02:47:46,910
Martha Coakley, during the Clipgate incident.

2080
02:47:46,950 --> 02:47:48,011
Do we not remember that?

2081
02:47:48,031 --> 02:47:53,595
Because we couldn't have Medford PD figure out why there was a magazine found in one of our schools.

2082
02:47:55,196 --> 02:47:55,457
Really?

2083
02:47:55,817 --> 02:47:57,859
We couldn't have Medford PD figure that out.

2084
02:47:57,919 --> 02:47:59,360
We had to contract that out.

2085
02:48:01,345 --> 02:48:03,166
This city has a spending problem.

2086
02:48:03,866 --> 02:48:07,388
The DPW has a night watchman, last name of Pellegrini.

2087
02:48:08,088 --> 02:48:14,531
He likes to yell at people that, you know, pull up in front of the recycle bin and don't sit there and park in parking spots that don't exist.

2088
02:48:14,891 --> 02:48:20,754
I don't know whether the added value he's bringing when the DPW wants- Again, just no personal attacks.

2089
02:48:20,774 --> 02:48:24,716
No, no, no, this is something I was gonna bring up anyways, is as a complaint.

2090
02:48:24,756 --> 02:48:25,936
No names, no personal attacks.

2091
02:48:25,976 --> 02:48:27,077
I don't care who we're talking about.

2092
02:48:27,973 --> 02:48:32,815
Fine, you have a person who functions only as a night watchman according to his own admission.

2093
02:48:33,875 --> 02:48:35,355
I don't know how much his salary is.

2094
02:48:35,876 --> 02:48:38,416
It's nine o'clock on a Friday or Saturday night.

2095
02:48:38,837 --> 02:48:42,878
Nobody's coming in and out of that parking garage or the DPW garage.

2096
02:48:43,538 --> 02:48:50,280
You couldn't contract that out to Securitas or some other function instead of paying that person's salary plus their retirement.

2097
02:48:51,081 --> 02:48:54,902
I think there's things that we can do to look at the budgets and spend more efficiently

2098
02:48:56,802 --> 02:49:01,045
There's plenty, Tufts University, we've talked about this, Zach.

2099
02:49:01,606 --> 02:49:06,189
There may be ways we can actually bring in some metrics and bring in some data analysis.

2100
02:49:06,309 --> 02:49:07,169
I think it's time.

2101
02:49:07,489 --> 02:49:08,710
It's been long overdue.

2102
02:49:10,171 --> 02:49:15,755
What's the number of personnel in the city by department and how much has been, what is that number year over year?

2103
02:49:16,896 --> 02:49:18,357
I don't expect you to have the answer.

2104
02:49:18,677 --> 02:49:20,198
The problem is it's not published.

2105
02:49:21,417 --> 02:49:22,438
Let's put it to the voters.

2106
02:49:22,558 --> 02:49:24,399
Okay, well, the voters gotta be educated.

2107
02:49:24,699 --> 02:49:28,721
The voters need to be able to find the data and make educated decisions.

2108
02:49:29,021 --> 02:49:32,783
And no offense, you're not gonna take Zach Baer's word for it because you're only one person.

2109
02:49:33,063 --> 02:49:35,885
And even you don't have all the data, right?

2110
02:49:36,125 --> 02:49:36,505
Trust me.

2111
02:49:37,986 --> 02:49:39,267
Trust me, I'm from the government.

2112
02:49:39,387 --> 02:49:40,067
I'm here to help.

2113
02:49:41,872 --> 02:49:42,232
You know?

2114
02:49:42,592 --> 02:49:45,954
No, you wanna present the data and let people make educated decisions.

2115
02:49:45,994 --> 02:49:48,476
There's no possible way you could do that.

2116
02:49:48,616 --> 02:49:50,377
I don't think that that's a fair assessment.

2117
02:49:50,397 --> 02:49:53,838
I think everybody behind this reel gives a lot of their time and a lot of their effort, right?

2118
02:49:53,999 --> 02:49:56,060
I don't think you can give enough time to do it.

2119
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:58,001
To make this city a better place, you know what I mean?

2120
02:49:58,021 --> 02:50:00,102
So when you make that, I'm a politician, trust me.

2121
02:50:00,182 --> 02:50:03,143
I mean, I just don't think that's a fair characteristic.

2122
02:50:03,203 --> 02:50:09,487
I think it is when you have someone saying, hey, let's put it to the voters and they can't, they don't have the information to make the educated decision.

2123
02:50:10,633 --> 02:50:12,133
Is he giving you any reason not to trust him?

2124
02:50:13,233 --> 02:50:14,174
It's not about trust.

2125
02:50:14,234 --> 02:50:16,154
It's about, they don't have the information.

2126
02:50:16,534 --> 02:50:17,754
It's trust, but verify.

2127
02:50:18,754 --> 02:50:19,955
I wanna be able to verify.

2128
02:50:20,035 --> 02:50:20,915
And I think that's fair.

2129
02:50:20,975 --> 02:50:21,575
You would too.

2130
02:50:21,635 --> 02:50:28,216
Again, if we could come back, I know you have, you can come back and talk at public participation at the end of the meeting to talk about all your grievances with each one of us.

2131
02:50:28,256 --> 02:50:30,277
But if we could just focus on- Yeah, I am.

2132
02:50:30,857 --> 02:50:31,037
I am.

2133
02:50:31,257 --> 02:50:32,357
Well, we can suspend the rules.

2134
02:50:33,737 --> 02:50:35,778
The suspend the rules is something we have voted.

2135
02:50:35,818 --> 02:50:37,918
It's not something you just say and it happens.

2136
02:50:38,859 --> 02:50:42,960
Yeah, if I'm running over my time, then suspend the rules, please.

2137
02:50:44,481 --> 02:50:45,721
So I think we need the data.

2138
02:50:45,801 --> 02:50:48,022
I think we need it published.

2139
02:50:48,382 --> 02:50:52,563
Did the city hire a person specifically to figure out how to use the COVID-19 funds?

2140
02:50:54,024 --> 02:50:55,644
Yes, and then they just hired them, so.

2141
02:50:56,665 --> 02:51:00,426
Okay, but the point is you still spent the money ahead of time for a person to figure out how to spend money.

2142
02:51:02,484 --> 02:51:05,325
There's ways that happens in this city to say there's no way.

2143
02:51:05,446 --> 02:51:08,747
That came from ARPA funding, that didn't come from the budget.

2144
02:51:11,008 --> 02:51:11,609
It doesn't matter.

2145
02:51:11,629 --> 02:51:12,989
It's different sources.

2146
02:51:13,169 --> 02:51:16,011
It's a pattern of, it's not the bucket you draw from.

2147
02:51:16,771 --> 02:51:19,473
And that's part of the spending problem is there's always been proposals.

2148
02:51:19,753 --> 02:51:22,234
Oh, well, there's this match we're going to get for the state.

2149
02:51:22,454 --> 02:51:23,995
So we got to do this project now.

2150
02:51:24,255 --> 02:51:26,836
The library wasn't supposed to cost anything for the taxpayers.

2151
02:51:26,916 --> 02:51:29,858
Again, I'm asking you, please focus on the paper at hand.

2152
02:51:30,478 --> 02:51:30,778
I am.

2153
02:51:32,119 --> 02:51:32,480
I am.

2154
02:51:34,381 --> 02:51:35,862
You have a spending pattern.

2155
02:51:36,243 --> 02:51:47,591
Section 22, this point, or section 21 now again this is we're getting out of here we're getting way off track of this and postpone this to the next meeting.

2156
02:51:51,454 --> 02:52:19,762
okay rule 21 and you are looking at rule 21 as far as finance papers so any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any member that has been requested by councilor carriello you can table it to a date certain which would be one week from today uh the to the next meeting well it's one week in the rule so it's tabled for one week um as it's written in the rule that's tabling for one week so that would be to july 26th

2157
02:52:21,955 --> 02:52:26,718
So just to clarify, did I just get cut off?

2158
02:52:29,239 --> 02:52:34,723
So just to lay the paper on the table, which would effectively have to be.

2159
02:52:35,269 --> 02:52:36,930
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

2160
02:52:37,170 --> 02:52:42,911
You're welcome to speak at public participation when we revisit it, but the motion was just to lay the item on the table, which ends all debate.

2161
02:52:42,931 --> 02:52:44,412
It ends our debate, it ends every debate.

2162
02:52:44,652 --> 02:52:47,473
It's not even a motion, it's just a rule in one sentence.

2163
02:52:49,673 --> 02:52:58,036
It's a reference to chapter 43, section 22 of the general laws, which says that if any member of the council objects, the measure should be postponed for that meeting.

2164
02:52:58,736 --> 02:53:00,497
So it's postponed for this meeting.

2165
02:53:02,999 --> 02:53:04,620
one of the rules hasn't been debated.

2166
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:06,742
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

2167
02:53:06,762 --> 02:53:10,765
You're welcome to speak at public participation at the end of the meeting, but the item has been tabled.

2168
02:53:12,066 --> 02:53:15,088
There's no more debate on this item for the rule.

2169
02:53:15,428 --> 02:53:17,790
And if I do want to finish my points, I have to come back next week.

2170
02:53:18,150 --> 02:53:22,353
No, just at the end of the meeting, just at the public participation section.

2171
02:53:23,354 --> 02:53:25,816
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

2172
02:53:27,737 --> 02:53:29,118
Okay, so I'm cut off for the night.

2173
02:53:29,178 --> 02:53:30,919
That's, right Councilor Knight?

2174
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:31,660
Yes.

2175
02:53:38,915 --> 02:53:39,235
Awesome.

2176
02:53:40,216 --> 02:53:40,556
Thank you.

2177
02:53:41,277 --> 02:53:42,718
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

2178
02:53:43,999 --> 02:53:53,926
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2179
02:53:56,167 --> 02:53:56,888
Vice President Behrs.

2180
02:53:57,188 --> 02:53:57,448
Yes.

2181
02:53:59,069 --> 02:53:59,690
Councilor Kerrio.

2182
02:53:59,710 --> 02:53:59,950
Yes.

2183
02:54:00,650 --> 02:54:01,311
Councilor Collins.

2184
02:54:01,371 --> 02:54:01,611
Yes.

2185
02:54:01,991 --> 02:54:02,492
Councilor Knight.

2186
02:54:02,712 --> 02:54:02,932
Yes.

2187
02:54:03,212 --> 02:54:04,013
Councilor Scarpelli.

2188
02:54:05,114 --> 02:54:05,674
Councilor Singh.

2189
02:54:06,274 --> 02:54:06,454
Yes.

2190
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:09,621
President Morrell.

2191
02:54:09,661 --> 02:54:20,005
Yes, the motion passes reverting to the regular order of business records the records of the meeting of June 22 on the motion of Council night to approve all the records.

2192
02:54:37,955 --> 02:54:39,496
All right, for the records, vice president bears.

2193
02:54:40,436 --> 02:54:42,417
Yes, that's carry on.

2194
02:54:46,618 --> 02:54:47,159
He's absent.

2195
02:54:47,499 --> 02:54:47,739
Yes.

2196
02:54:47,859 --> 02:54:48,139
Yes.

2197
02:54:48,559 --> 02:54:48,739
Yes.

2198
02:54:55,595 --> 02:54:58,317
Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent, zero negative.

2199
02:54:58,337 --> 02:54:59,038
Motion passes.

2200
02:54:59,058 --> 02:55:00,038
Reports of committees, 22-354.

2201
02:55:00,098 --> 02:55:01,379
Move approval.

2202
02:55:02,660 --> 02:55:04,682
Motion to join the two papers and move approval.

2203
02:55:04,942 --> 02:55:11,707
On the motion of Artisan Barrett to join 22-354, they both have the same number from June 28th and June 29th.

2204
02:55:11,807 --> 02:55:17,171
On the motion to join and move approval, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2205
02:55:17,772 --> 02:55:18,933
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2206
02:55:20,087 --> 02:55:20,888
Okay, they're not the same.

2207
02:55:21,008 --> 02:55:26,492
Okay, they're honestly given the same number one was budget and one was the Air Force project.

2208
02:55:27,292 --> 02:55:28,733
Oh, still move approval.

2209
02:55:28,773 --> 02:55:29,193
That's fine.

2210
02:55:29,614 --> 02:55:29,914
All right.

2211
02:55:31,415 --> 02:55:32,716
Motion continues.

2212
02:55:33,376 --> 02:55:34,337
Second by Councilor Knight.

2213
02:55:34,617 --> 02:55:35,598
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2214
02:55:47,655 --> 02:55:47,735
Yes.

2215
02:55:47,755 --> 02:55:47,815
Yes.

2216
02:55:47,835 --> 02:55:47,975
Yes.

2217
02:55:48,015 --> 02:55:48,075
Yes.

2218
02:55:48,095 --> 02:55:48,396
Yes.

2219
02:55:48,796 --> 02:55:49,016
Yes.

2220
02:56:02,787 --> 02:56:05,890
Six in the affirmative, one absent, zero negative, the motion passes.

2221
02:56:06,990 --> 02:56:13,115
We do have a motion with the next resolution is from Councilor Carviello, so I'm going to skip that at the moment.

2222
02:56:13,975 --> 02:56:17,718
We're going to go to 22 dash 414 offered by Vice President bears.

2223
02:56:18,418 --> 02:56:23,502
Leave this companion paper that's the same amount of President 22435 and 22435 offered by Councilor Carviello.

2224
02:56:27,814 --> 02:56:33,198
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest condolences to the friends and family of Oscar Green on his passing.

2225
02:56:33,278 --> 02:56:42,904
Oscar was a long-time Medford resident, world-renowned veteran, author, and member of the Grace Church community, and an identical paper was also submitted by Councilor Carvalho, Vice President of Affairs.

2226
02:56:43,336 --> 02:56:44,256
Thank you, Madam President.

2227
02:56:44,516 --> 02:57:01,581
Mr. Green was a centenarian, longtime resident, World War II veteran, author, and most importantly, a member of the Grace Church community, at least most importantly to all the residents who reached out to me in sadness at his passing.

2228
02:57:02,781 --> 02:57:04,001
I know it's now a late hour.

2229
02:57:04,021 --> 02:57:09,563
There may have been some residents on earlier who had hoped to speak to this, but whereas it was,

2230
02:57:10,823 --> 02:57:20,745
on the June 28th agenda, and now it's on this agenda, I would ask that we move to approve and send a note of condolence, perhaps to the Grace Church community.

2231
02:57:20,765 --> 02:57:27,326
And I know Councilor Carabiello had placed this on the agenda as well, so I will defer to him.

2232
02:57:29,126 --> 02:57:35,707
Councilor Carabiello's abstention, I'd just like to mention that he was also a great member of this Metro community, not just the Grace Church community.

2233
02:57:35,807 --> 02:57:36,047
Yes.

2234
02:57:36,348 --> 02:57:38,608
And served that country well.

2235
02:57:39,938 --> 02:57:40,618
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2236
02:57:41,259 --> 02:57:42,099
Any further discussion?

2237
02:57:42,519 --> 02:57:42,980
Move approval.

2238
02:57:43,480 --> 02:57:46,441
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

2239
02:57:46,521 --> 02:57:47,702
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2240
02:57:47,722 --> 02:57:50,343
Could it be a motion to join and approve?

2241
02:57:50,463 --> 02:57:51,964
Oh, sorry, the motion to join and approve.

2242
02:57:51,984 --> 02:57:56,346
Does that motion work for you, Councilor Knight?

2243
02:57:57,247 --> 02:58:00,028
Motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

2244
02:58:00,048 --> 02:58:01,169
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2245
02:58:02,589 --> 02:58:03,290
Vice President Behrs?

2246
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:03,970
Yes.

2247
02:58:04,831 --> 02:58:05,651
Councilor Kerrio?

2248
02:58:06,151 --> 02:58:06,551
Absent.

2249
02:58:07,272 --> 02:58:07,912
Councilor Collins?

2250
02:58:08,192 --> 02:58:08,392
Yes.

2251
02:58:08,953 --> 02:58:09,413
Councilor Knight?

2252
02:58:09,908 --> 02:58:10,188
Yes.

2253
02:58:11,650 --> 02:58:11,970
Yes.

2254
02:58:12,550 --> 02:58:12,951
Yes.

2255
02:58:13,491 --> 02:58:13,731
Yes.

2256
02:58:14,732 --> 02:58:15,353
President Morrell.

2257
02:58:15,693 --> 02:58:15,873
Yes.

2258
02:58:17,214 --> 02:58:19,977
Six in the affirmative one absence here in the negative the motion passes.

2259
02:58:21,718 --> 02:58:22,459
The second.

2260
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:30,246
The next item to do for to do dash 433 is offered by myself, Councilor Carville also again has a similar paper.

2261
02:58:30,886 --> 02:58:33,388
Enjoy on the motion of Councilor night to join.

2262
02:58:35,517 --> 02:58:38,338
Seconded by Councilor Collins.

2263
02:58:38,398 --> 02:58:39,238
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2264
02:58:39,298 --> 02:58:39,798
Join 22-433 with 22-434.

2265
02:58:39,818 --> 02:58:41,338

Okay.

2332
03:03:27,058 --> 03:03:32,704
So is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the petition in front of us, either in person or on Zoom?

2333
03:03:34,666 --> 03:03:36,768
Madam President, I ask that we keep the public hearing open for 90 days.

2334
03:03:36,788 --> 03:03:37,068
You need to...

2335
03:03:42,068 --> 03:03:44,851
I'm sorry, not to close the public hearing to keep it open for 90 days.

2336
03:03:45,192 --> 03:03:45,432
Okay.

2337
03:03:45,913 --> 03:03:49,897
Would that be with approval and to keep it open for 90 days, or you want to revisit this?

2338
03:03:50,117 --> 03:03:51,059
No, not with approval.

2339
03:03:51,379 --> 03:03:51,839
Okay.

2340
03:03:51,980 --> 03:03:55,744
Starbucks right now is in the middle of a quite a public

2341
03:03:57,297 --> 03:04:04,442
dispute over the conditions that they placed their workers in allowing the five o'clock opening right now in the middle of a contract negotiation.

2342
03:04:04,462 --> 03:04:05,162
I don't think it's the way to go.

2343
03:04:05,182 --> 03:04:11,607
There's a strike going on at Starbucks right now for the Starbucks baristas relative to wages, hours and conditions of employment.

2344
03:04:12,207 --> 03:04:13,688
I think that's something that needs to be remedied.

2345
03:04:14,008 --> 03:04:20,192
I support the work of people and I think this corporate giant should go to the table, sit down with them.

2346
03:04:20,513 --> 03:04:20,993
They're not broke.

2347
03:04:21,732 --> 03:04:25,313
Thank you, and do you wanna register that as opposition to the position or?

2348
03:04:25,393 --> 03:04:33,676
No, I just wanna keep the public hearing open for 90 days to be sure that our friends at the United Commercial Workers can come down and express their concern about this when the time is right.

2349
03:04:33,936 --> 03:04:34,676

The Medford City Council will hold a public hearing on July 19th, 2022 at 7 p.m.

2386
03:05:57,996 --> 03:05:58,437
and the Howard F.

of the City of Medford and recommend as recommended by the Department of Public Works and the Community Development Board, a copy of the order is available for inspection in both the office of the city clerk room 103 and the office of the city engineer room 300 in Medford City Hall 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass 02155.

2389
03:06:34,127 --> 03:06:39,551
I don't believe, I'm not sure if we have anyone from the administration here.

2390
03:06:39,571 --> 03:06:41,632
Oh, I do see Owen, all right, all right, calm down.

2391
03:06:41,932 --> 03:06:44,654
Okay, I do see Mr. Martella is here.

2392
03:06:47,858 --> 03:06:48,118
Hi.

2393
03:06:48,458 --> 03:06:52,219
Oh, and if you could just give us an overview of what we're looking at.

2394
03:06:52,399 --> 03:06:54,399
I will keep this very, very brief.

2395
03:06:54,619 --> 03:06:56,100
I know you guys are here really late.

2396
03:06:56,220 --> 03:07:07,081
So the purpose of this order of taking is to change the ownership of two roadway parcels from the school to the city so that appropriate funds can be used for their future repair.

2397
03:07:07,722 --> 03:07:13,863
Currently, there is no timeline for these repairs, and there are no betterments to the city with this transfer.

2398
03:07:14,003 --> 03:07:15,903
This is just a formal transfer of ownership.

2399
03:07:16,532 --> 03:07:19,513
and I'm here to answer any questions about this order of taking.

2400
03:07:19,993 --> 03:07:20,293
Thank you.

2401
03:07:21,353 --> 03:07:36,016
So would taking these roadways from the school department as private property and then making them public ways allow us to utilize CHAPA 90 funds to repair them?

2402
03:07:36,356 --> 03:07:37,196
Sorry, you got muted again.

2403
03:07:38,237 --> 03:07:38,957
Yes, sorry.

2404
03:07:39,017 --> 03:07:41,577
Yes, exactly.

2405
03:07:42,157 --> 03:07:42,978
That is the intent.

2406
03:07:43,878 --> 03:07:44,298
Move approval.

2407
03:07:45,332 --> 03:07:46,572
Any further discussion from the council?

2408
03:07:47,693 --> 03:07:48,533
Not amongst each other.

2409
03:07:49,273 --> 03:07:50,013

2410
03:07:51,494 --> 03:07:53,014

03:08:34,998 --> 03:08:38,140
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

2427
03:08:38,680 --> 03:08:43,902
So Councilor Knight, would you want to approve and waive the comment period or would you like to keep the comment period?

2428
03:08:44,143 --> 03:08:50,006
Let's keep the comment period open in case there's any question about whether or not we need to have input from the traffic commission on such a matter.

2429
03:08:50,246 --> 03:08:54,688
I don't think we do, but let's keep it open just in case friends of the traffic commission have some input they'd like to make.

2430
03:08:54,708 --> 03:09:01,331
Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve at the close of the six day public comment period, seconded by Councilor Collins.

2431
03:09:01,371 --> 03:09:02,592
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2432
03:09:07,122 --> 03:09:07,783
Vice President bears.

2433
03:09:08,224 --> 03:09:11,368
Yes, that's curable is absent Council Collins.

2434
03:09:11,488 --> 03:09:11,708
Yes.

2435
03:09:12,730 --> 03:09:13,231
That's a night.

2436
03:09:13,631 --> 03:09:13,831
Yes.

2437
03:09:19,747 --> 03:09:23,128
Yes, six in front of one absent zero in the negative the motion passes.

2438
03:09:24,048 --> 03:09:36,893
Going back to some paper to do dash four and three briefly which is Councilor Carrillo's drive a motion to table that as he is no longer in attendance on the motion of Councilor Collins table to do dash 413 as seconded by.

2439
03:09:36,913 --> 03:09:40,594
Why don't we just table all the Councilor Covey was okay.

2440
03:09:44,925 --> 03:09:48,749
Councilor Collins, would you make that motion to table all of Councilor Carvalho's papers?

2441
03:09:48,789 --> 03:09:57,337
So on the motion of Councilor Collins to table all of Councilor Carvalho's papers, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk.

2442
03:09:57,557 --> 03:09:58,198
Please call the roll.

2443
03:09:58,218 --> 03:10:04,644
So that's 416, 421, 4, anything that says 4.

2444
03:10:05,184 --> 03:10:05,605
That's it, 4.

2445
03:10:05,665 --> 03:10:07,106
Yeah, it's 413, 416 and 421.

2446
03:10:15,195 --> 03:10:16,135
Okay, vice president bears.

2447
03:10:16,615 --> 03:10:19,896
Yes, it's curable is absent Council Collins.

2448
03:10:20,176 --> 03:10:20,356
Yes.

2449
03:10:21,477 --> 03:10:23,437
Yes.

2450
03:10:23,637 --> 03:10:24,598
Yes.

2451
03:10:25,078 --> 03:10:26,698
Yes.

2452
03:10:27,058 --> 03:10:27,238
Yes.

2453
03:10:27,798 --> 03:10:36,761
Six and affirmative one absence here and then I get the motion passes to do that for one five petition to reverse sign denial by Michael R Dolan and transfer that for both.

2454
03:10:38,212 --> 03:10:39,372
for VOLTA.

2455
03:10:39,392 --> 03:10:40,773
760 Felsley, Medford, Mass.

2456
03:10:40,793 --> 03:10:43,514
Reason for denial, elimination and movement is not permitted.

2457
03:10:43,654 --> 03:10:46,475
We do have folks with VOLTA in front of us.

2458
03:10:46,575 --> 03:10:49,676
If you'd like to just speak to the sign.

2459
03:10:50,076 --> 03:10:50,316
Sure.

2460
03:10:50,536 --> 03:10:50,976
Thank you.

2461
03:10:51,256 --> 03:10:52,137
Good evening, everyone.

2462
03:10:52,437 --> 03:10:57,118
My name is Michael Dolan from the law firm of Brown Rudnick here on behalf of VOLTA Charging.

2463
03:10:57,138 --> 03:11:00,339
I just want to give a little background about who VOLTA is.

2464
03:11:00,940 --> 03:11:03,480
VOLTA was founded in 2010 and has been an innovator in

2465
03:11:05,365 --> 03:11:08,406
developing cutting-edge electric vehicle charging networks.

2466
03:11:09,087 --> 03:11:19,631
Their chargers are the most frequently and heavily used in the charging industry, and there are thousands of their stations across the country, including many here in the Commonwealth.

2467
03:11:19,831 --> 03:11:28,895
The Volta charging experience is a unique concept because unlike other electric vehicle charging station companies, Volta does not charge fees.

2468
03:11:29,495 --> 03:11:36,019
or costs to customers for the electricity but rather gives it away to encourage the use of electric vehicles.

2469
03:11:36,919 --> 03:11:48,526
As the electricity that Volta gives away though must ultimately be paid for, Volta sells advertising space to brand name advertisers on charging station related media screens

2470
03:11:48,990 --> 03:11:51,832
to generate the revenue needed to pay for the electricity.

2471
03:11:52,693 --> 03:12:01,260
Examples of advertisers are Haagen-Dazs, Netflix, FedEx, Hulu, big national brands like that.

2472
03:12:01,820 --> 03:12:12,208
Volta's charging station model is destination charging, with its stations typically situated near outlets, malls, large retailers, and grocery stores.

2473
03:12:12,668 --> 03:12:14,230
Here, we are proposing

2474
03:12:15,110 --> 03:12:20,153
at 760 Felsway at the stop and shop to level two charging stations.

2475
03:12:20,654 --> 03:12:31,521
Each charging station would include a two sided digital advertising display screen, which is designed to target pedestrians going in and out of the stop and shop, not vehicles.

2476
03:12:32,641 --> 03:12:39,045
The display screens are internally lit and the ads on the screens are stationary and softly

2477
03:12:40,747 --> 03:12:42,609
transition every eight seconds.

2478
03:12:43,029 --> 03:12:50,376
There's no flashing, no intermittent lights, no video, no sound or noise emitted from the stations.

2479
03:12:51,237 --> 03:12:55,682
As I think you can see from the photos included with our application,

2480
03:12:56,802 --> 03:13:02,944
The charging stations have crisp lines, they're attractive and made of the finest quality in the charging industry.

2481
03:13:03,725 --> 03:13:16,209
They were designed in Austria and they're highly sought after not only by EV charging users for the free component but by businesses and communities alike because of their attractive appearance.

2482
03:13:16,769 --> 03:13:18,910
Stop and shop customers have asked them

2483
03:13:20,210 --> 03:13:38,642
to install free charging at their stores, including here in Medford, and after a thorough review of alternative charging station options, Stop and Shop selected Volta due to the aesthetics and the excellent user experience from their stations.

2484
03:13:40,203 --> 03:13:53,551
The proposed stations will be installed in two of the existing islands in the parking lot near the entrance to the store and adjacent to each charging station will be one marked and designated EV charging parking space.

2485
03:13:54,392 --> 03:14:03,737
This subject property, I'm sure you're familiar with it, is located in the high intensity commercial one zoning district and the proposed units will be set back over 470 feet from the public right of way.

2486
03:14:08,275 --> 03:14:15,518
In short, these stations will have no visual impact on surrounding properties or any public roads.

2487
03:14:15,998 --> 03:14:30,604
We're here tonight pursuant to an appeal under section 6.2.64 of the Medford Zoning Ordinance, that's the new ordinance, based on a denial of our assigned design review application.

2488
03:14:31,365 --> 03:14:37,147
Specifically, Inspector Moki, who I'd spoken to, referred our proposal

2489
03:14:37,507 --> 03:14:49,434
to the City Council for its consideration in connection with two sections that he thought we should just run by you guys, one related to continuous illumination and the other relating to movement.

2490
03:14:50,035 --> 03:15:00,842
As to the requirement under the ordinance that signs have continuous illumination, the thought there is they don't want signs that would be flashing or intermittent light and the like.

2491
03:15:01,062 --> 03:15:02,643
And as I alluded to earlier,

2492
03:15:03,564 --> 03:15:07,549
Our stations do in fact involve continuous illumination.

2493
03:15:08,089 --> 03:15:17,941
It should also be noted that the screens are automatically dimmed depending upon the time of day and they can shut down when the stop and stop is closed overnight.

2494
03:15:19,565 --> 03:15:35,037
With respect to the provision of the zoning ordinance regarding movement and signs, as mentioned, Volta's displays are static images and there's no video motion or movement other than the transition every eight seconds between advertisements.

2495
03:15:35,637 --> 03:15:44,385
One last point that I'd like to make is that Volta is amenable to including on the screens Medford public service announcements for free.

2496
03:15:44,525 --> 03:15:50,290
Volta has successfully partnered with other cities and towns in this regard and the benefits to municipalities

2497
03:15:50,810 --> 03:15:54,595
has been very well received, including during the recent pandemic.

2498
03:15:55,056 --> 03:16:05,268
And I heard about the wonderful event that the police department was mentioning tonight, there's an example of something that could go up on those screens, but we'd be glad to work with the city on that.

2499
03:16:05,789 --> 03:16:09,292
So in closing, and I'm trying to get through this quickly, I know it's late for all of you.

2500
03:16:10,353 --> 03:16:23,385
We believe that Volta's charging stations with these display screens are consistent with the city's zoning ordinance, and we hope that you'll approve their new cutting edge technology, which will bring free EV charging to the residents of Medford.

2501
03:16:23,725 --> 03:16:32,693
With that, I just want to quickly introduce Mike Dennehy, who is a general manager at Volta Charging, just to say a few words and introduce himself.

2502
03:16:32,942 --> 03:16:33,602
Thank you, Mike.

2503
03:16:33,702 --> 03:16:36,284
Thank you, Madam President, members of the City Council.

2504
03:16:37,164 --> 03:16:38,365
Let me just go back and thank you.

2505
03:16:38,525 --> 03:16:39,145
I know it's late.

2506
03:16:40,726 --> 03:16:41,646
Thank you for bearing with us.

2507
03:16:41,906 --> 03:16:42,847
Yes, no.

2508
03:16:43,287 --> 03:16:45,288
Four months ago, I was the town administrator in Milton.

2509
03:16:45,588 --> 03:16:46,648
I did that for five years.

2510
03:16:46,708 --> 03:16:50,270
Prior to that, I was the Public Works Commissioner for Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.

2511
03:16:50,630 --> 03:16:54,132
I get the service that is being displayed here this evening.

2512
03:16:54,999 --> 03:16:56,320
I feel your pain, right?

2513
03:16:57,740 --> 03:16:59,961
I missed town meeting this year in May, thankfully.

2514
03:16:59,981 --> 03:17:02,682
But no, I want to thank you all for this.

2515
03:17:03,522 --> 03:17:05,203
I took a liking to EV charging.

2516
03:17:05,563 --> 03:17:09,544
We were able to cite permit and construct two in Milton.

2517
03:17:09,604 --> 03:17:11,285
I really fell in love with the industry.

2518
03:17:11,305 --> 03:17:15,586
27 years of government doing what you folks are doing every night.

2519
03:17:16,226 --> 03:17:17,647
This is a great model.

2520
03:17:18,427 --> 03:17:19,948
Volta is in 26 states.

2521
03:17:20,048 --> 03:17:21,729
There's over 2,500 stations.

2522
03:17:22,369 --> 03:17:25,290
We have great site partners and great relationships.

2523
03:17:26,231 --> 03:17:30,532
We've delivered over 124 million free miles of electrons to people.

2524
03:17:31,393 --> 03:17:34,994
And I'm here to answer any questions, but thank you for hearing us again this evening.

2525
03:17:35,174 --> 03:17:35,975
Thank you for your service.

2526
03:17:36,235 --> 03:17:36,555
Thank you.

2527
03:17:36,675 --> 03:17:37,855
Councilor Scarpalli.

2528
03:17:38,436 --> 03:17:39,336
Thank you, Madam President.

2529
03:17:39,376 --> 03:17:41,777
So gentlemen, thank you for being here so late.

2530
03:17:42,217 --> 03:17:43,458
And we appreciate it.

2531
03:17:44,218 --> 03:17:53,304
I, you know, I can honestly say 10 years ago, one of my first initiatives was making sure Method brought charging stations to our community.

2532
03:17:53,845 --> 03:17:55,866
And people said, you're crazy.

2533
03:17:56,467 --> 03:17:58,208
So this is, this is nice.

2534
03:17:58,428 --> 03:17:59,409
I can now retire.

2535
03:17:59,909 --> 03:18:07,735
So if you guys are looking for another consultant, just call me, you know, but we're doing is what you're doing is great.

2536
03:18:07,755 --> 03:18:12,498
I think that, you know, the biggest concerns we had when neighbors heard, you know, we had that,

2537
03:18:13,568 --> 03:18:28,386
We've had some serious issues in that that Plaza that, you know, one was a dumpster that was taking in free clothing that turned out to be a disgrace but what what we saw what I saw, and, you know, doing my research.

2538
03:18:29,027 --> 03:18:29,888
It's so far away.

2539
03:18:31,189 --> 03:18:32,970
I think it's exactly what we're asking for.

2540
03:18:32,990 --> 03:18:34,051
I like the concept.

2541
03:18:34,171 --> 03:18:49,764
I think that probably the only thing that I'd ask, and I'm sure you have the answer, that any of the materials that are gonna be advertised are tasteful and are in good nature with our family atmosphere.

2542
03:18:49,784 --> 03:18:51,185
I think that's the biggest question I had.

2543
03:18:51,285 --> 03:18:54,888
Other than that, I love the idea that you're giving back to the community.

2544
03:18:56,669 --> 03:19:03,555
anywhere we can spread the word, something simple as an election coming up here in September and adding something like that is very important.

2545
03:19:03,615 --> 03:19:17,486
So anywhere we can add that, where it's not an eyesore, where people love to put those signs in the middle of violence, I think this is a tasteful and respectful way to kill two birds with one stone.

2546
03:19:17,506 --> 03:19:19,468
So I think it's a great idea.

2547
03:19:19,488 --> 03:19:22,330
I would support this and we'll approve it.

2548
03:19:23,727 --> 03:19:25,369
Thank you.

2549
03:19:25,510 --> 03:19:25,970
Thank you.

2550
03:19:25,990 --> 03:19:26,170
Thank you.

2551
03:19:26,210 --> 03:19:26,811
Thank you.

2552
03:19:27,152 --> 03:19:27,372
Thank you.

2553
03:19:40,067 --> 03:19:40,708
But that's great.

2554
03:19:41,668 --> 03:19:53,257
We have a letter here from our Energy and Environment Committee which noted it's static images to change every eight seconds designed to be viewed by pedestrians, not visible from windows of private residences and not on public ways.

2555
03:19:53,317 --> 03:19:54,518
So that all seems to check out.

2556
03:19:55,459 --> 03:20:01,003
My only question is just you mentioned on the PSAs, putting city PSAs up.

2557
03:20:01,143 --> 03:20:04,025
Are you in communication with the mayor's office about that already?

2558
03:20:05,598 --> 03:20:09,541
That's something that with an approval, we'd be right in touch with them right away.

2559
03:20:09,561 --> 03:20:10,661
Great, fantastic.

2560
03:20:10,681 --> 03:20:12,763
We have a team that does that, so.

2561
03:20:13,383 --> 03:20:14,444
Great.

2562
03:20:14,564 --> 03:20:26,812
I would second Councilor Scarpalli's motion to approve and just say, not a condition or amendment or anything, just encourage that to happen as quickly as possible so that once the stations are up, we can work with you on getting public information out there.

2563
03:20:27,672 --> 03:20:27,952
Thank you.

2564
03:20:28,193 --> 03:20:28,473
Thank you.

2565
03:20:34,268 --> 03:20:39,149
machines right we were moving variable message boards around Milton because we couldn't get our messages.

2566
03:20:39,229 --> 03:20:40,270
Appreciate it.

2567
03:20:40,330 --> 03:20:45,811
Thank you request for donations.

2568
03:20:46,692 --> 03:20:47,732
All of my points have been made.

2569
03:20:47,772 --> 03:20:48,152
Thank you.

2570
03:20:50,373 --> 03:20:53,674
I'm the other guy.

2571
03:20:54,074 --> 03:20:54,574
I'm that guy.

2572
03:20:55,253 --> 03:20:56,694
This is a public private partnership.

2573
03:20:56,714 --> 03:20:57,475
This is what you love.

2574
03:20:57,675 --> 03:21:02,218
I know, I know, but we don't live in Las Vegas, you know, 55 inch LCD screens.

2575
03:21:02,238 --> 03:21:03,199
What happened?

2576
03:21:03,219 --> 03:21:04,360
Shut off the microphone.

2577
03:21:15,260 --> 03:21:18,983
And my uncle was the quartermaster at the Milton VFW for a number of years.

2578
03:21:19,043 --> 03:21:21,525
So I know what you're dealing with out there as well.

2579
03:21:23,166 --> 03:21:24,687
So these are gonna be 55 inch screens?

2580
03:21:25,287 --> 03:21:25,628
Yes, sir.

2581
03:21:26,128 --> 03:21:27,629
And there's only gonna be two of them?

2582
03:21:27,889 --> 03:21:30,911
There's two stations and there's a screen on each side.

2583
03:21:31,092 --> 03:21:37,956
Okay, so we're looking at 220 inches, square inches of illuminated sign.

2584
03:21:38,337 --> 03:21:38,537
Yeah.

2585
03:21:38,917 --> 03:21:39,938
Okay, in two locations.

2586
03:21:41,248 --> 03:21:41,509
Yes.

2587
03:21:41,749 --> 03:21:42,009
Okay.

2588
03:21:42,029 --> 03:21:43,450
Two different charts.

2589
03:21:43,490 --> 03:21:47,414
Designed for pedestrians to look at when they're crossing the street, right?

2590
03:21:49,696 --> 03:21:53,720
They don't have to if they don't want to.

2591
03:21:53,760 --> 03:21:59,165
Are there crosswalks in the locations where they are about the areas where the signs are going to be located?

2592
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:12,254
Other crosswalks here, marked delineated crosswalks already.

2593
03:22:12,614 --> 03:22:16,780
I don't see it on the plans, Councillor, but I will certainly follow up.

2594
03:22:18,596 --> 03:22:19,636
They do, right?

2595
03:22:19,696 --> 03:22:22,997
We're at the- There were speed bumps and everything over there.

2596
03:22:23,017 --> 03:22:24,678
I know what you're talking about.

2597
03:22:24,698 --> 03:22:28,199
With the placement, I'd like to see the placement be placed where a crosswalk is, right?

2598
03:22:28,279 --> 03:22:30,340
So that at the very least, the stop sign crosswalk.

2599
03:22:30,400 --> 03:22:34,161
So, I mean, someone's going to look at a distracted driving, something we talk about all the time, right?

2600
03:22:34,281 --> 03:22:36,742
If you guys have driven in this parking lot, right?

2601
03:22:36,922 --> 03:22:37,122
Yes.

2602
03:22:37,242 --> 03:22:37,782
Yeah.

2603
03:22:37,842 --> 03:22:39,343
You'd want the bulldozer, not the truck, right?

2604
03:22:39,363 --> 03:22:40,283
I mean, it's crazy in there.

2605
03:22:40,303 --> 03:22:42,544
There's a lot of cars, a lot of vehicles, a lot of heavy trucking going on.

2606
03:22:42,884 --> 03:22:50,229
I'm not so worried about the internal illumination because I mean who's your neighbor half afraid you know what I mean I don't think that they're going to really mind too much if they see that.

2607
03:22:52,651 --> 03:23:01,097
In terms of moving forward we have two now is there plans for expansion or is it just going to be two?

2608
03:23:01,590 --> 03:23:06,551
There are not, and of course, anything we would ever want to do, we have to come before you again.

2609
03:23:06,871 --> 03:23:12,252
And if you said, you know what, that's too many, or I don't like where that one's going, we live with however you want us to go.

2610
03:23:12,272 --> 03:23:20,333
Yeah, but if you work at Brown Rudnick, and you guys are slick talking lawyers, we approve it once, next thing you know, you come in and, oh, you approved it last time, now you're out, you can't do that now, what are you gonna do?

2611
03:23:20,373 --> 03:23:30,075
Councilor, that's a great point, but to the business model, those impressions, you're not gonna get the same impression if you have so many screens in the same location, right?

2612
03:23:30,955 --> 03:23:34,197
Volta usually puts two at each location.

2613
03:23:34,417 --> 03:23:39,420
For a reason, you go to the Star Market in Belmont, or you go to the, sorry, is it Shaw's in Belmont?

2614
03:23:39,460 --> 03:23:44,383
Shaw's in Belmont, Star Market, no, Star Market in Belmont, Shaw's in Wakefield.

2615
03:23:44,403 --> 03:23:44,763
You'll see it.

2616
03:23:45,343 --> 03:23:45,823
They're there.

2617
03:23:45,843 --> 03:23:50,346
We're in Cambridge at the Galveston, Cambridgeside Mall.

2618
03:23:50,606 --> 03:23:51,907
We're going to Somerville soon.

2619
03:23:52,347 --> 03:23:54,748
Wait a minute, we're gonna get something electric before Somerville?

2620
03:23:55,549 --> 03:23:55,709
Yes.

2621
03:23:55,909 --> 03:23:57,590
Oh, move approval.

2622
03:23:59,377 --> 03:24:00,537
No, you've addressed my concerns.

2623
03:24:00,557 --> 03:24:07,240
As long as the crosswalk issue is addressed and this is located in close proximity to a crosswalk and stop sign, I certainly have no problem with it.

2624
03:24:07,260 --> 03:24:09,060
Yeah, I'm not sure there's a crosswalk.

2625
03:24:09,360 --> 03:24:14,582
Just noting it, it looks like it's right across from the two front doors to the stop and shop, so that's where the- It's the race sidewalk.

2626
03:24:15,062 --> 03:24:19,263
It's the race sidewalk, the fire lane, and then it's where the two things come up, so there's not a crosswalk.

2627
03:24:19,283 --> 03:24:19,984
I'm a witness guy.

2628
03:24:20,024 --> 03:24:21,204
I don't know.

2629
03:24:21,224 --> 03:24:22,404
It's a crossing area.

2630
03:24:22,845 --> 03:24:25,125
I'm just like, they're like educated Metro voters at this point.

2631
03:24:25,145 --> 03:24:26,726
Maybe we should let them out of here.

2632
03:24:30,776 --> 03:24:32,137
Any further discussion from the council?

2633
03:24:33,637 --> 03:24:35,617
I want to thank you both for bearing with us.

2634
03:24:35,657 --> 03:24:40,358
And this is just, you know, we've talked about if we want an EV future, this is the type of infrastructure we need.

2635
03:24:40,438 --> 03:24:43,139
Everyone's grappling with having this type of infrastructure, how do you add it?

2636
03:24:43,539 --> 03:24:44,779
So I think this is a great opportunity.

2637
03:24:44,799 --> 03:24:46,539
I appreciate you coming before us.

2638
03:24:46,599 --> 03:24:49,260
And I do just see one resident has their hand up.

2639
03:24:50,780 --> 03:24:52,741
Tony, name and address for the record, please.

2640
03:24:55,225 --> 03:25:00,268
I'm not against any type of revenue for the city.

2641
03:25:01,609 --> 03:25:05,232
Just curious, is there a time limit for these units?

2642
03:25:05,512 --> 03:25:08,053
And what prevents people from parking there overnight?

2643
03:25:08,073 --> 03:25:11,295
So if you live across the street, you get free charging and no one else can use the unit.

2644
03:25:11,976 --> 03:25:16,459
Or is there any like queue for the cars that are, I mean, where will all those cars line up?

2645
03:25:16,639 --> 03:25:20,802
Again, I'm not against this in any way, shape or form, but it'd be good to know the answers to these questions.

2646
03:25:21,182 --> 03:25:21,462
Thank you.

2647
03:25:23,643 --> 03:25:24,444
Thank you, Mr. Tanks.

2648
03:25:24,524 --> 03:25:24,745
Yes.

2649
03:25:25,185 --> 03:25:33,034
So, this is private property, the hours, we will work with the city to set those hours normally at these locations.

2650
03:25:33,615 --> 03:25:37,359
I think the question actually is if someone comes and parks there all day.

2651
03:25:37,780 --> 03:25:40,803
Okay, I thought the first question was the timings to it, right?

2652
03:25:42,145 --> 03:25:48,628
Yeah, so I took the time limit question to be, we usually turn them on an hour before and an hour after the store closes.

2653
03:25:49,269 --> 03:25:51,770
We do not want people staying there overnight.

2654
03:25:51,970 --> 03:25:55,792
Most of the site partners we have don't want people there during off hours.

2655
03:25:56,112 --> 03:25:59,294
We don't promote it and they turn them off.

2656
03:25:59,354 --> 03:26:01,195
So yeah, that would be addressed.

2657
03:26:01,575 --> 03:26:08,500
With respect to the enforcement of someone overstaying their welcome, there will be card readers installed in these.

2658
03:26:08,560 --> 03:26:16,285
They're going to be free, but we will have the ability going forward, not yet, but going forward to terminate that charge from someone if they overstay.

2659
03:26:17,246 --> 03:26:19,087
Usually we put two hour signs up for everyone.

2660
03:26:19,107 --> 03:26:22,209
But if someone's not charging, they don't have an electric vehicle, they just park there.

2661
03:26:22,269 --> 03:26:23,850
Who enforces that?

2662
03:26:23,930 --> 03:26:26,972
We call them ICE vehicles, combustible engines.

2663
03:26:27,493 --> 03:26:31,075
It would have to be enforced by the site partner, which would be, in this case, Stop and Shop.

2664
03:26:33,237 --> 03:26:33,537
Thank you.

2665
03:26:34,458 --> 03:26:36,760
And have they expressed willingness to do that?

2666
03:26:38,181 --> 03:26:40,463
I don't know necessarily about this spot, but yeah.

2667
03:26:40,483 --> 03:26:41,024
In other places.

2668
03:26:41,344 --> 03:26:44,947
It's a benefit for them to have it available to people.

2669
03:26:44,987 --> 03:26:48,770
So they're going to encourage people to get out of there unless they're charging a car.

2670
03:26:51,012 --> 03:26:52,594
Very good questions.

2671
03:26:54,515 --> 03:26:57,838
I know we have you muted, but does that address your question, Tony?

2672
03:27:01,556 --> 03:27:03,357
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

2673
03:27:04,377 --> 03:27:04,977
Great, thank you.

2674
03:27:05,337 --> 03:27:10,239
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as seconded by Vice President Behrs, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2675
03:27:11,239 --> 03:27:11,959
Vice President Behrs.

Yes.

2682
03:27:18,521 --> 03:27:19,241
Councilor Scarpelli.

2683
03:27:19,381 --> 03:27:19,581
Yes.

2684
03:27:19,922 --> 03:27:20,502
Councilor Singh.

2685
03:27:21,102 --> 03:27:21,322
Yes.

2686
03:27:22,742 --> 03:27:23,303
President Morrell.

2687
03:27:23,683 --> 03:27:23,883
Yes.

2688
03:27:24,343 --> 03:27:26,684
Six in the affirmative, one absent, zero in the negative.

2689
03:27:26,724 --> 03:27:27,764
The motion passes.

2690

Thank you very much.

2691
03:27:30,925 --> 03:27:31,245
Thank you.

2692
03:27:32,392 --> 03:27:36,533
and thank you for your service.

2693
03:27:36,613 --> 03:27:36,813
Yes.

2694
03:27:36,833 --> 03:27:39,774
22-416 was tabled, 22-417 offered by Vice President Behrs.

2695
03:27:39,854 --> 03:27:54,457
Be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that the City of Medford increase the property tax exemption for qualified seniors over 65 to the maximum 20% of the average assessed valuation of the residential property in the City of Medford allowed by Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 41C.

2696
03:27:57,058 --> 03:28:21,167
and a half, via further resolve of the city of Medford, increase the income limit for property tax exemption for qualified seniors over 65 to the maximum income limit for the circuit breaker state income tax credit allowed by Massachusetts general law chapter 59, section five, clause 41C and a half, via further resolve of the city solicitor and interim chief assessor, review the proposed language above and submit any suggestions for changes to the council by July 14th.

2697
03:28:21,187 --> 03:28:23,227
Vice President Behrs.

2698
03:28:23,768 --> 03:28:24,588
Thank you, Madam President.

2699
03:28:26,097 --> 03:28:26,718
when still here.

2700
03:28:43,477 --> 03:28:52,321
Madam President, I would like to amend the paper to strike out the last paragraph as it's, this was submitted in June, so that's why that last paragraph was there.

2701
03:28:52,341 --> 03:28:59,964
So amended to strike the last paragraph and then a motion to refer to the August committee of the whole meeting with the assessor.

2702
03:29:01,185 --> 03:29:07,908
Any further discussion on the motion of Vice President Behrs as amended by Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2703
03:29:09,328 --> 03:29:10,129
Mr. Clerk, please.

2704
03:29:16,252 --> 03:29:16,953
Vice President Behrs.

2705
03:29:16,993 --> 03:29:17,313
Yes.

2706
03:29:18,434 --> 03:29:19,434
Councilor Kerrio-Vela is absent.

2707
03:29:20,015 --> 03:29:20,595
Councilor Collins.

2708
03:29:20,615 --> 03:29:20,675
Yes.

2709
03:29:21,836 --> 03:29:22,336
Councilor Knight.

2710
03:29:22,597 --> 03:29:22,857
Yes.

2711
03:29:23,437 --> 03:29:24,058
Councilor Scarpelli.

2712
03:29:24,078 --> 03:29:24,178
Yes.

2713
03:29:25,298 --> 03:29:25,839
Councilor Sang.

2714
03:29:26,479 --> 03:29:26,719
Yes.

2715
03:29:27,740 --> 03:29:28,301
Councilor Morrell.

2716
03:29:28,741 --> 03:29:28,941
Yes.

2717
03:29:29,722 --> 03:29:32,323
Six in the affirmative, one absent, zero in the negative.

2718
03:29:32,343 --> 03:29:33,504
The motion passes.

2719
03:29:34,365 --> 03:29:35,846
Vice President Behrs.

2720
03:29:42,451 --> 03:29:44,212
Dangerous, putting me up here.

2721
03:29:45,997 --> 03:29:55,136
22-418 offered by councillor saying be it so resolved that the Bedford City Council asked relevant state agencies to fix the broken signage and remove signage debris in Wellington Circle.

2722
03:29:55,176 --> 03:29:55,837
Councillor saying.

2723
03:29:56,698 --> 03:29:58,299
Thank you, Vice President Barrows.

2724
03:29:58,339 --> 03:30:00,701
This is pretty self-explanatory.

2725
03:30:01,321 --> 03:30:03,783
We talk about curb appeal, we talk about beautification.

2726
03:30:06,144 --> 03:30:15,190
This is something that we can do to make Medford look better, but also to make Medford safer, especially for drivers and pedestrians who use Wellington Circle.

2727
03:30:15,491 --> 03:30:18,973
There are street lights that are knocked down, signs that have been

2728
03:30:19,469 --> 03:30:21,230
not down and not replaced.

2729
03:30:21,790 --> 03:30:36,700
And I'd like us to do our best to contact our state agencies, because that's who owns that land, to make sure that they are fixing those signs and making sure that Wellington Circle not only looks good, but is safe for everyone.

2730
03:30:44,585 --> 03:30:45,445
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2731
03:30:45,485 --> 03:30:46,666
Any further discussion on the motion?

2732
03:30:50,960 --> 03:30:57,662
On the, on the motion of counselor saying to approve seconded by Councillor Scarpelli Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2733
03:31:11,384 --> 03:31:12,844
President Morrell is absent from the chamber.

2734
03:31:13,605 --> 03:31:14,305
Vice President Behrs.

2735
03:31:14,325 --> 03:31:17,706
Yes, for the affirmative, none of the negative motion passes.

2736
03:31:17,726 --> 03:31:19,367
22-419 offered by Councilor Seng.

2737
03:31:19,807 --> 03:31:25,769
Being so resolved that the Medford City Council asked the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to remove debris from the Wellington Station grounds.

2738
03:31:25,869 --> 03:31:26,669
Councilor Seng.

2739
03:31:26,689 --> 03:31:29,350
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

2740
03:31:29,570 --> 03:31:35,472
Councilor Knight was so kind as to let me know about some updates about the situation at Wellington Station.

2741
03:31:37,112 --> 03:31:38,493
And in particular about

2742
03:31:39,842 --> 03:31:43,663
people who have no place to stay, who stay there overnight.

2743
03:31:44,824 --> 03:31:51,026
And you wanted us, Councilor Knight wanted us to be careful with how we worded this resolution.

2744
03:31:51,106 --> 03:31:54,768
So I'm proposing a slight amendment.

2745
03:31:56,348 --> 03:32:02,851
I'll email this to the clerk right after I speak, but I'll just read it out right now so you have it.

2746
03:32:04,120 --> 03:32:13,967
I'd like to amend it to be it so resolved that the Medford City Council ask the MBTA to remove signage debris and replace signage from Wellington Station grounds.

2747
03:32:14,167 --> 03:32:23,694
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to provide social service help to those in need living at the Wellington Station grounds.

2748
03:32:24,435 --> 03:32:31,320
And be it further resolved that the Medford City Council ask the MBTA to find local artists to beautify the Wellington Station grounds.

2749
03:32:32,553 --> 03:32:35,374
Again, this is a resolution that's similar to the last one.

2750
03:32:35,414 --> 03:32:47,277
We just want to make sure that we improve our curb appeal, improve beautification, make Medford look better, but also make sure that we have the right signage for all of her.

2751
03:32:48,597 --> 03:32:48,897
Thank you.

2752
03:32:49,878 --> 03:32:50,658
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

2753
03:32:50,678 --> 03:32:54,499
On the motion of Councilor Seng, as amended by Councilor Seng, seconded by Councilor Spadafore.

2754
03:32:54,519 --> 03:32:55,499
Any further discussion?

2755
03:32:56,660 --> 03:32:58,280
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2756
03:33:01,949 --> 03:33:03,031
Councilor Caravella is absent.

2757
03:33:03,071 --> 03:33:03,713
Councilor Collins.

2758
03:33:03,813 --> 03:33:03,993
Yes.

2759
03:33:04,394 --> 03:33:04,895
Councilor Knight.

2760
03:33:07,039 --> 03:33:07,781
Councilor Scarpelli.

2761
03:33:10,206 --> 03:33:10,787
Councilor Sang.

2762
03:33:11,889 --> 03:33:12,029
Yes.

2763
03:33:13,258 --> 03:33:14,939
President Morrell is absent, Vice President Behrs.

2764
03:33:15,039 --> 03:33:20,300
Yes, five in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

2765
03:33:20,320 --> 03:33:21,761
22-420 offered by Councilor Seng.

2766
03:33:21,781 --> 03:33:29,043
Be it resolved that the city administration inform local restaurants and food trucks about the Massachusetts SNAP restaurant meals program and encourage them to apply to this program.

2767
03:33:29,503 --> 03:33:36,025
This program allows older adults, homeless individuals, and people with disabilities to buy food at authorized restaurants and food trucks using their SNAP EBT card.

2768
03:33:36,645 --> 03:33:39,286
Restaurants and food trucks can apply to the pilot program through August 31st, 2022.

2769
03:33:39,326 --> 03:33:39,686
Councilor Seng.

2770
03:33:42,933 --> 03:33:45,414
The resolution basically describes what this program is.

2771
03:33:45,814 --> 03:33:53,777
This is something that our state government has put into place that I think could benefit the groups that are mentioned in this resolution.

2772
03:33:54,917 --> 03:33:57,318
You know, we talk about food security, we talk about food access.

2773
03:33:57,658 --> 03:34:02,220
This is one of the things that could help increase access to healthy food in our community.

2774
03:34:03,840 --> 03:34:04,701
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

2775
03:34:04,741 --> 03:34:07,802
On the motion of Councilor Seng, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2776
03:34:07,822 --> 03:34:08,782
Any further discussion?

2777
03:34:10,022 --> 03:34:11,783
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2778
03:34:19,372 --> 03:34:20,454
Councilor Kerrio is absent.

2779
03:34:20,494 --> 03:34:21,255
Councilor Collins?

2780
03:34:23,198 --> 03:34:23,699
Oh, yes.

2781
03:34:24,681 --> 03:34:25,222
Councilor Knight?

2782
03:34:26,103 --> 03:34:26,324
Yes.

2783
03:34:26,644 --> 03:34:27,385
Councilor Scarpelli?

2784
03:34:27,706 --> 03:34:27,866
Yes.

2785
03:34:28,307 --> 03:34:28,908
Councilor Sang?

2786
03:34:29,910 --> 03:34:30,110
Yes.

2787
03:34:31,753 --> 03:34:32,233
President Morrell?

2788
03:34:33,901 --> 03:34:37,522
President Morello's absence, Vice President Paris.

2789
03:34:37,542 --> 03:34:37,922
Yes.

2790
03:34:38,002 --> 03:34:41,483
Motion passes 22-438 offered by Councilor Collins.

2791
03:34:42,083 --> 03:34:52,166
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council requests an update from the Department of Public Works on the measure standards or contracts in place for cleaning and waste pickup in the public area along the river between the Craddock Bridge and the pedestrian bridge.

2792
03:34:52,226 --> 03:34:52,986
Councilor Collins.

2793
03:34:53,412 --> 03:34:53,832
Thank you.

2794
03:34:53,852 --> 03:35:00,618
I've been hearing from constituents complaining about the uncleanliness of the area around the pedestrian bridge and credit bridge by the Mystic River.

2795
03:35:00,638 --> 03:35:04,240
I also ride my bike along that path to get to every city council meeting.

2796
03:35:04,281 --> 03:35:09,164
So I'm particularly attuned to the broken glass that's frequently on the path there, bit of a safety risk.

2797
03:35:09,725 --> 03:35:19,893
I would love to hear an update from the administration about whose jurisdiction this public space is under and how we can support it being maintained for everybody's enjoyment.

2798
03:35:21,441 --> 03:35:22,841
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2799
03:35:23,222 --> 03:35:27,643
On the motion of Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2800
03:35:28,103 --> 03:35:28,963
Any further discussion?

2801
03:35:31,084 --> 03:35:32,304
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2802
03:35:43,168 --> 03:35:44,308
Councilor Kerrio-Vela is absent.

2803
03:35:44,408 --> 03:35:45,068
Councilor Collins?

2804
03:35:45,528 --> 03:35:45,808
Yes.

2805
03:35:46,209 --> 03:35:46,709
Councilor Knight?

2806
03:35:46,729 --> 03:35:47,749
Yes.

2807
03:35:47,789 --> 03:35:48,509
Councilor Scarpelli?

2808
03:35:48,609 --> 03:35:48,689
Yes.

2809
03:35:49,170 --> 03:35:49,750
Councilor Sang?

2810
03:35:50,350 --> 03:35:50,510
Yes.

2811
03:35:51,677 --> 03:35:52,557
I'm here.

2812
03:35:52,918 --> 03:35:54,258
Yes, I apologize.

2813
03:35:54,878 --> 03:35:55,099
Yes.

2814
03:35:57,219 --> 03:35:57,980
Vice President bears.

2815
03:35:58,080 --> 03:36:12,366
Yes, 60% of the negative motion passes 22 dash 440 offered by Councilor Collins be resolved at the Medford City Council expressed support for House Bill H 4795 and act to expand access to high quality affordable early education and care which would

2816
03:36:13,487 --> 03:36:20,433
Support investments in childcare and early education, increase affordability and availability for families and support wage raises for early educators and childcare providers.

2817
03:36:20,493 --> 03:36:29,601
Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Bedford Legislative Delegation, as well as chairs and vice-chairs of the House Ways and Means Committee by Gewitz and Ferranti.

2818
03:36:29,721 --> 03:36:30,622
Councillor Collins.

2819
03:36:30,922 --> 03:36:31,402
Thank you.

2820
03:36:31,422 --> 03:36:37,245
We'll skip over the part where we recount the funding issues we've been talking about tonight and for the past six weeks.

2821
03:36:38,146 --> 03:36:56,836
Given that our short-term municipal revenue growth is uncertain and we have so many needs already going unmet, and that the lack of accessible, affordable childcare is something that we've been hearing about from constituents all term long, I felt that the least I could do as a counselor is to try and urge our state leaders to help the communities out with providing for this critical resource.

2822
03:36:57,796 --> 03:37:02,379
The point I try to make every time I put a state bill on the agenda is that state issues are local issues.

2823
03:37:02,919 --> 03:37:12,404
I wish that we could fund all of these services in-house with municipal revenue, but until we can, I will continue to advocate for state resources to leave Medford families less in the lurch.

2824
03:37:12,684 --> 03:37:12,984
Thank you.

2825
03:37:13,524 --> 03:37:14,365
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2826
03:37:14,405 --> 03:37:15,385
Any further discussion?

2827
03:37:15,405 --> 03:37:19,487
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by?

2828
03:37:19,847 --> 03:37:20,087
Second.

2829
03:37:20,468 --> 03:37:22,028
Councilor, President Morrell.

2830
03:37:23,760 --> 03:37:26,022
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2831
03:37:26,682 --> 03:37:28,003
Councilor Kerrio is absent.

2832
03:37:28,323 --> 03:37:29,024
Councilor Collins?

2833
03:37:29,244 --> 03:37:29,444
Yes.

2834
03:37:29,804 --> 03:37:30,284
Councilor Knight?

2835
03:37:30,304 --> 03:37:30,365
Yes.

2836
03:37:33,707 --> 03:37:34,367
Councilor Scarpelli?

2837
03:37:34,507 --> 03:37:34,727
Yes.

2838
03:37:36,469 --> 03:37:36,989
Councilor Sang?

2839
03:37:37,729 --> 03:37:37,930
Yes.

2840
03:37:40,011 --> 03:37:40,531
President Morrell?

2841
03:37:40,772 --> 03:37:40,972
Yes.

2842
03:37:41,372 --> 03:37:42,012
Vice President Barrett?

2843
03:37:42,132 --> 03:37:42,433
Yes.

2844
03:37:42,713 --> 03:37:44,294
Private affirmative, one of the negative, one absent.

2845
03:37:44,314 --> 03:37:45,355
The motion passes.

2846
03:37:46,555 --> 03:37:50,999
Nothing further on the agenda but we do have public participation we do have someone in line.

2847
03:37:52,040 --> 03:37:56,724
So, I will recognize you Mr Cassidy name and address for the record please.

2848
03:37:56,864 --> 03:37:58,125
I think you already said it.

2849
03:37:58,406 --> 03:38:08,615
I just want to hang around to the end, because it's late, it's quarter 11 but point out as late as the last meeting was probably what 145 am is that the last minute.

2850
03:38:09,783 --> 03:38:10,724
I'm not gonna get you there.

2851
03:38:11,084 --> 03:38:12,005
I cut to the chase.

2852
03:38:12,746 --> 03:38:24,355
I just wanted to say, I get passionate at times, because I guess I still care about this city, you know, for better or for worse and trying to make betterments.

2853
03:38:24,675 --> 03:38:28,258
And I know you people must be in the same shoe or mentality.

2854
03:38:28,638 --> 03:38:28,778
So,

2855
03:38:30,022 --> 03:38:33,064
If I must excuse myself at times, I do.

2856
03:38:33,685 --> 03:38:36,607
I hope you do, excuse me, excuse me.

2857
03:38:37,987 --> 03:38:56,260
But I wanted to say one thing, because Mr. Gabb came up in conversation this evening, and how can I say for a lack of the proper word, not enough rules, tax going to the city of Medford, it seems.

2858
03:38:57,261 --> 03:38:58,802
So I used to live on,

2859
03:38:59,958 --> 03:39:04,721
Route 38, which is Mystic Ave, the old highway to Boston, when I was five years old.

2860
03:39:07,243 --> 03:39:18,110
And then five years later, 1960, the old highway to Boston was not replaced, but made adjacent, parallel to Interstate Route 93.

2861
03:39:18,150 --> 03:39:18,110
1960.

2862
03:39:18,170 --> 03:39:18,930
I think, I think, huh?

2863
03:39:27,408 --> 03:39:28,409
You don't know when I was 10.

2864
03:39:29,809 --> 03:39:30,970
Now you know the numbers.

2865
03:39:31,110 --> 03:39:32,491
Now you get the numbers.

2866
03:39:32,651 --> 03:39:33,931
Okay, you really want to know.

2867
03:39:36,273 --> 03:39:38,134
So the point is this.

2868
03:39:38,154 --> 03:39:42,556
Don't you think that this, that's like, it's a cash cow.

2869
03:39:42,816 --> 03:39:49,520
It's still blighted with mechanic places and this and that, and bumpy, five times curved over, whatever.

2870
03:39:49,880 --> 03:39:53,922
The point is, that's the old highway to Boston, Route 38.

2871
03:39:53,962 --> 03:39:54,202
Why not?

2872
03:39:57,171 --> 03:39:59,534
Of course you're thinking about it, but it's not happening.

2873
03:39:59,554 --> 03:40:02,857
60 years later, is it?

2874
03:40:03,218 --> 03:40:06,722
There's the Rolling Stones 60th anniversary tour right now.

2875
03:40:07,282 --> 03:40:08,984
Come on, man.

2876
03:40:09,725 --> 03:40:12,348
You should have, who am I to dictate?

2877
03:40:12,929 --> 03:40:14,751
Five, six, seven, eight stories.

2878
03:40:15,131 --> 03:40:15,431
I won't.

2879
03:40:16,857 --> 03:40:21,638
I was gonna say, I won't piss off some people and say 12 and 25 like New York City, 100.

2880
03:40:22,099 --> 03:40:30,281
But listen, the first couple of floors should be mixed use like Station Landon or Assembly Road, right?

2881
03:40:30,801 --> 03:40:32,141
Mr. Beers, are you still with me?

2882
03:40:32,181 --> 03:40:32,682
I'm listening.

2883
03:40:32,882 --> 03:40:33,802
Are you with Mr. Knight?

2884
03:40:35,569 --> 03:40:38,190
The first couple of four should be as big shoes.

2885
03:40:38,631 --> 03:40:38,971
Okay.

2886
03:40:39,691 --> 03:40:51,738
And, and then above, it could have residential, you wouldn't have affordability problems, you could do it different ways and Innsbruck Austria, I believe they, the city had land and gave it to a developer.

2887
03:40:52,098 --> 03:40:54,320
So it's quasi federal.

2888
03:40:55,672 --> 03:40:59,253
Austrian federal and private, and they have affordable housing.

2889
03:40:59,693 --> 03:41:02,134
And it's like, it's like, it's like the, not the timeshare.

2890
03:41:02,154 --> 03:41:04,354
It's like, it's like they have in New York City.

2891
03:41:04,754 --> 03:41:07,075
It's not called real, it's not called condos.

2892
03:41:07,555 --> 03:41:08,215
It's some other term.

2893
03:41:08,255 --> 03:41:08,556
Co-ops.

2894
03:41:08,616 --> 03:41:09,036
Co-ops.

2895
03:41:09,576 --> 03:41:09,936
Co-ops.

2896
03:41:10,976 --> 03:41:12,377
I believe it is co-op.

2897
03:41:12,557 --> 03:41:14,237
Yeah, it is co-op in New York City.

2898
03:41:14,617 --> 03:41:16,318
I don't think I've ever seen that here.

2899
03:41:16,558 --> 03:41:16,878
Have you?

2900
03:41:18,978 --> 03:41:19,959
Well, okay.

2901
03:41:21,159 --> 03:41:24,000
Mr. Castaneda, if I may, just given the lateness of the hour,

2902
03:41:26,467 --> 03:41:32,652
Two things, one that we passed the first comprehensive zoning recodification of the city and nearly as long as 60 years.

2903
03:41:33,173 --> 03:41:42,962
This, this past March, and we are looking at hopefully a plan development district will come into maybe domestic app or maybe we'll look at it in our second round of zoning the funding that we secured.

2904
03:41:43,582 --> 03:41:45,163
to finally execute that.

2905
03:41:45,203 --> 03:41:56,851
And I would be remiss if I didn't also say, if we're gonna bring up Austria, that Vienna, Austria, many people are housed in social housing, it's incredibly high quality public housing, and the Socialist Party has not lost an election in 100 years.

2906
03:41:57,392 --> 03:42:00,854
I'm glad you reiterated what I was implying.

2907
03:42:01,334 --> 03:42:03,556
God bless you, I'm glad you know that.

2908
03:42:04,065 --> 03:42:05,165
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

2909
03:42:05,205 --> 03:42:10,386
It's possible, you know, and we could have, I come up with an idea.

2910
03:42:10,426 --> 03:42:12,127
I think I stole from Connecticut, Mr. Knight.

2911
03:42:12,527 --> 03:42:18,528
Could have a third tax rate instead of 10 for the residential, 20 for the commercial, let's go for 15.

2912
03:42:18,688 --> 03:42:23,309
It's quasi this and that, and maybe eminent domain, if need be.

2913
03:42:23,549 --> 03:42:26,850
You could have Davis Square on Mystic Ave all the way, put a trolley.

2914
03:42:26,970 --> 03:42:27,250
I gotta go.

2915
03:42:27,710 --> 03:42:29,750
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

2916
03:42:29,850 --> 03:42:31,911
Seeing no other hands for public participation.

2917
03:42:33,412 --> 03:42:34,294
Is there a motion on the floor?

2918
03:42:34,715 --> 03:42:35,396
Motion to adjourn.

2919
03:42:35,516 --> 03:42:39,704

2920
03:42:39,784 --> 03:42:41,287

2921
03:42:41,548 --> 03:42:44,593

2922
03:42:46,958 --> 03:42:48,861
Councilor Knight is absent, Councilor Scarpelli.

2923

2924
03:42:51,947 --> 03:42:52,148
Yes.

2925
03:42:53,009 --> 03:42:53,751
President Morrell?

2926
03:42:53,871 --> 03:42:54,111
Yes.

2927
03:42:54,392 --> 03:42:55,273
Vice President Behrs?

2928
03:42:56,235 --> 03:42:56,536
Yes.

2929
03:42:56,656 --> 03:42:57,858
Five in the affirmative, two absent.

2930
03:42:57,898 --> 03:42:58,860
The meeting is adjourned.
